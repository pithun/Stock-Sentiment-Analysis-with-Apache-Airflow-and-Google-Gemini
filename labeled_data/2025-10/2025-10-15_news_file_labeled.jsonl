{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"Britain is targeting Russia's largest oil companies and the country's \"shadow fleet\" of oil tankers in a bid to cut off Vladimir Putin's ability to fund the war in Ukraine. The UK government is also pursuing a major Indian oil refinery and four Chinese oil terminals in a package of 90 new sanctions. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the move was expected to have a significant impact on Russia's economy and its ability to sustain military operations in Ukraine. \"We are sending a clear signal: Russian oil is off the market,\" she said ahead of a meeting in Washington DC with global counterparts to discuss Russian sanctions. Reeves said the government was \"significantly stepping up the pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin's war effort.\" Russia's two largest oil companies - Lukoil and Rosneft - will be hit with sanctions, Reeves said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) annual meeting.  The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They work together to maintain global economic stability. \"At the same time, we are ramping up pressure on companies in third countries, including India and China, that continue to facilitate getting Russian oil onto global markets,\" Ms Reeves said. \"There is no place for Russian oil on global markets and we will take whatever actions are necessary to destroy the capability of the Russian government to continue this illegal war in Ukraine.\" The government was also sanctioning 44 tankers that operate in Russia's \"shadow fleet\" transporting oil around the world, Reeves said in a joint statement with the Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. The two Russian oil firms export 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. Rosneft is responsible for nearly half of all Russian oil production, which makes up 6% of the global output, according to the government. Also on the sanction list is India's Nayara Energy Limited, which the government said imported 100 million barrels of Russian crude oil worth more than $5bn (\u00a33.75bn) in 2024 alone. Rosneft partly owns Nayara Energy Limited, which it acquired in 2017 in a deal with other partners. Cooper said: \"Today's action is another step towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and towards a more secure United Kingdom.\" The announcement comes as the G7, a grouping of some of the world's most advanced economies, prepares to consider a plan to effectively seize hundreds of billions from the proceeds of Russian investments, frozen since the invasion of Ukraine. A vast bulk of Russia's assets are held as cash at the European Central Bank, after its underlying bond investments matured. The European Union (EU), where the bulk of funds are held, had been reluctant to pursue the wider plan, but appears to be developing a way round legal concerns. It will be considered at an EU summit next week. Ukraine has significant funding needs as the war continues, both in arms and reconstruction. Earlier this year, the UK joined the US in directly sanctioning energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. At the time the then Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, had said it would \"drain Russia's war chest \u2013 and every ruble we take from Putin's hands helps save Ukrainian lives\". The US separately has discussed putting additional tariffs on goods from China, up to 500%, tied to Beijing's purchases of Russian oil. But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday that the US would not take that step unless Europe agreed to do something similar. \"We will respond if our European partners will join us,\" he said. In the last two months, Russia has hugely upped its attacks on Ukraine's trains and rail network. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says Reeves needs to find \u00a322bn to make up a finance shortfall. Trump says the move is \"a big stop\", but there has been no confirmation so far from New Delhi. PPE Medpro was ordered to repay damages by 16:00 BST on Wednesday after breaching  a Covid-19 contract. This will be the fourth consecutive winter of outages since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"                 reading time 5 minutes        AI is overrated, according to author Cory Doctorow. \u201cI don\u2019t think AI can do your job,\u201d Doctorow said, but despite that, bosses across industries are \u201cinsatiably horny\u201d about the idea that AI will replace jobs. Top of the list is tech bosses. Tech is one of the industries where AI is scaling significantly faster in the workforce than average (the bigger picture corporate AI adoption is much slower, and some studies claim the returns on investments are low). Many tech CEOs have made statements expressing their wishes to automate tasks that would have regularly gone to human workers. A new report by Source, a consulting firm that works with the tech industry, claimed that over half of tech companies are considering restructuring because of AI. \u201cTech bosses love the story of AI replacing programmers,\u201d Doctorow said at an event hosted by the Brooklyn Public Library last week, where he was answering former FTC chair Lina Khan\u2019s questions. During her tenure in the Biden administration, Khan was known for her firm regulatory stance against big tech monopolies. Computer programming was once the most lucrative industry to go into, with a surplus of demand for workers; there were numerous job opportunities with great pay and benefits, and cushy amenities. Now, the script has completely switched. Many have blamed the rise of generative AI for it. But Doctorow argues \u201cthat\u2019s just not a thing AI is doing\u201d or even can do. \u201cAI can write sub-routines, it can\u2019t do software architecture. Can\u2019t do engineering, because engineering is about having a long, broad context window to understand all the pieces that came before, all the pieces that are coming in the future, and the pieces that sit adjacent to code, and if you know anything about AI, the one thing that is most expensive to do with AI is expanding the context window,\u201d Doctorow said. Doctorow is famous for having coined the term \u201censhittification\u201d to describe the common, modern-day phenomenon of almost every tech platform becoming soulless, dysfunctional and widely-hated corpses that internet users are still trapped under.\u00c2\u00a0 It\u2019s a cathartically profane critique of capitalism in the tech age that Macquaire Dictionary picked as its word of the year in 2024. He argues that what tech bosses actually like is to have tech workers \u201cterrified that they\u2019re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.\u201d To understand why, you need to look into how the dynamic has changed in the tech workplace in the past two decades. \u201cThe way that tech bosses motivated tech workers was appealing to their sense of mission,\u201d Doctorow said. It was a double-edged sword: it both motivated the tech workers to work grueling hours, but it also made them passionate about the product and its purpose. So, if the boss decided to make changes at the expense of that vision of greater good and in the pursuit of greater margins, the workers tended to fight for the user. One example of that was the Google employee protests over the controversial military AI initiative Project Maven, which successfully saw the tech giant walk back its involvement. Back then, Doctorow argues, tech workers were a good way to keep the industry in check because they had a sense of purpose and they had power. Demand for workers far exceeded the supply, so if things were going awry in the company\u2019s progress towards its mission, they could threaten to leave. There were many other opportunities that they could switch to. But things have since changed, and supply has caught up with demand. Roughly 400,000 tech employees have been laid off in the past two years alone. Silicon Valley companies are asking their employees to work 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a schedule known as \u201c996\u201d that was popularized in China. Meanwhile, big tech companies are spending big and making record profits. Nvidia just became the first and only company to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. The power dynamic has now switched, and the power is with the bosses. And this time around, according to Doctorow, they want to make sure that the power dynamic stays that way. \u201cTech bosses have shown us how they treat workers they\u2019re not afraid of,\u201d Doctorow said, pointing the finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Federal injury data from 2022 found that Amazon warehouse workers were seriously injured at more than twice the rate at other warehouses. A subsequent Senate probe from 2024 concluded that Amazon had been manipulating its self-reported injury data to make its warehouses appear safer. \u201cThe minute Jeff Bezos can put a piss jar next to your workstation, he will,\u201d Doctorow said. \u201cAt this point, when Google is firing 12,000 workers, and then doing a $70 billion stock buyback that would have paid their wages for the next 27 years, you need a union,\u201d he advised. If Doctorow\u2019s estimates are true, then AI won\u2019t take over any jobs. But then what about the billions and billions of dollars that have been poured into the AI industry, so much so that those investments are almost entirely driving American economic growth? \u201cThe great kind of tragedy and terror of all of this is that AI, if it can\u2019t do your job, then whatever benefits we get from it are not commensurate with the capital expenditures that we\u2019ve made for it, nor will they be sufficiently profitable to incur the operational expenses associated with maintaining these large foundation models,\u201d Doctorow said. TLDR on that: He thinks there is an AI bubble. And he is not alone in thinking like this; many other experts have been sounding the alarms of a rapidly growing AI bubble. In a notable addition this week, the United Kingdom\u2019s central bank said that \u201cequity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,\u201d and that this could lead to a sudden, sharp correction. The Bank said that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five are the AI-heavy big tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. Lina Khan painted a picture of some other reasons why experts believe there is an AI bubble at the event on Thursday. \u201cThere have been increasing discussion about how we may actually be just seeing a big AI bubble,\u201d the former FTC chair said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing all of these circular investments where it\u2019s like the same five to seven companies just handing each other big bags of cash, saying, IOU, we\u2019re seeing, you know, increasing reporting in the business press that even though we\u2019re seeing such significant investment in AI, increasingly, firms are being candid that they don\u2019t know what the profitable use case is going to be, but are just kind of afraid of missing out.\u201d In her time in office, Khan\u2019s FTC opened inquiries into the various deals and partnerships between big tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft and the then-rising, now-reigning AI labs OpenAI and Anthropic. A bubble is worrying. A pop is even more worrisome. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a collapse, and it\u2019s going to be very bad,\u201d Doctorow said. \u201cI think 2008 is going to look like a golden age when AI pops.\u201d Explore more on these topics      Share this story             Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.                    Innovation meets stagnation.                     Warning bells have been ringing for months, and now experts are providing the data to back that up.                     Yet another tale of AI's less-than-stellar employee track record has emerged.                     If you work with dead bodies, AI probably won't steal your career.

Jamie Dimon isn't worried about AI being a bubble, but reckons some of the industry's myriad projects won't work out. \"I wouldn't say I'm concerned,\" the JPMorgan Chase CEO said at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit on Tuesday. \"You can't look at AI as a bubble. Though some of these things may be in a bubble, in total, it'll probably pay off.\" Fortune's editor in chief, Alyson Shontell, asked Dimon about statistics like AI investments accounting for 40% of GDP growth and such companies making up 80% of US stock gains this year. Shontell, who was previously Business Insider's editor in chief, also flagged circular AI deals, such as OpenAI taking a stake in AMD and acquiring lots of its chips. Dimon said he doesn't see this as evidence of the sector's boom being a bubble. \"Remember that capex is roads and cement and steel and servers and connectors \u2014 it's a million different things going on,\" he said. Tech companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars building data centers to power AI. However, Dimon predicted that not all of these will pan out as planned. \"Some of those projects won't get done the way they were announced. Some of them won't get the power they need,\" he said. \"You've got to go one by one to say: is it pushing a bubble, or is it real? Are they really going to develop stuff that'll have productive capability that pays off on the investment?\" \"Like I said, in total I think they probably will \u2014 but one by one, I don't know.\"                   Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

October brings the spooky season and kids who love building and Halloween want something that combines both. Decorations sit on shelves gathering dust after a few days and cheap plastic toys break before the month ends. A LEGO set solves both problems by giving kids a hands-on building project and a decoration they can display long after Halloween passes. The LEGO Halloween Barn just dropped to a record low of $11 on Amazon, down from $14: That\u2019s the cheapest this 205-piece seasonal set has ever been, and it\u2019s perfect for kids who want to build something creepy, tell spooky stories and add a haunted touch to their room. See at Amazon The Halloween Barn is 5.5 inches high, 6.5 inches wide, and 2.5 inches deep so it is small enough to sit easily on a shelf or desk without consuming a lot of real estate. The construction gives that old haunted barn appearance through weathered wooden planks in various shades of brown and gray, crosses by the windows and door and a crooked old tree that appears to have stood for decades. The hidden surprises are what make this set fun: Open the barn door and you\u2019ll see a mouth with fangs on the back side. The teeth are visible from the front when the door swings open and gives the barn a menacing face. The window shutters hide another surprise: an eyeball that peers out when you open them. These hidden features add an element of discovery to the building process so kids aren\u2019t just stacking bricks. Inside and around the structure, you\u2019ll find small accessories that add to the spooky atmosphere: There\u2019s a bat, a lamp, a green bottle, a black jar, and the twisted tree that sits next to the barn. The accessory set also comes with a skeleton mini-figure that\u2019s a typical LEGO skeleton you\u2019re bound to have found in other kits. It\u2019s nothing unique or a proprietary piece but is good for its purpose of being a character for kids\u2019 pretend stories for Halloween. The skeleton\u2019s mouth is open and has moveable arms and legs so that kids will be able to position it in various spots around the barn. A vampire or a scarecrow would have been a better addition but the skeleton will do for a decent pretend play. Kids will be able to pretend that the skeleton is the caretaker of the farm or a drifting spirit or whatever scary character that comes to mind. In 205 pieces, this is a relatively quick building. Eight-year-olds and up will want to complete it in an hour or so, depending upon experience with LEGOs. Instructions are simple to see and are straightforward, and each step tells exactly where a piece goes. Younger builders will want help for a bit of the detail when it comes to the smallest pieces, but the building itself isn\u2019t very complicated. At $11 this is the all-time lowest that the LEGO Halloween Barn has been. This is a very reasonably priced way to get kids a fall building set that will be fun to use during the month of October and display seasonally. For a family that wants a gift for Halloween or a fun activity to do together, this set provides good value for the money without costing a lot.

We aren\u2019t quite sure who to thank for this latest HP laptop deal at Amazon, but it\u2019s kind of crazy how generous this one is. So, big shout-out to whomever is responsible for taking this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop, loading it with 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD, and then installing the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, and deciding it should be over $3,000 less than the list price. Granted, that original $4,400 list price was more than a little bit silly, but even so, the final price of $1,140 for a state-of-the-art touchscreen Windows laptop that arrives as loaded as this one does is more than a little bit crazy too. There\u2019s also a free accessories bundle which includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a 7-in-1 USB hub, 128GB thumb drive, and more. See at Amazon The Intel Ultra 7 255U processor would be a stone cold beast under any circumstance thanks to its max speed of 5.2GHz, but then when you add in the 12 TOPS of AI acceleration to drive the Microsoft Copilot AI assistant that\u2019s preinstalled, that\u2019s when the magic happens. Copilot\u2019s bona fides as a top-notch AI assistant are well established, but the AI enhancements don\u2019t end there \u2014 useful features like background blur and intelligent noise reduction for video calls and conferencing are also powered by AI. The rest of the package under the hood of this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop is all about going big, especially the 64GB of DDR5 RAM that is basically a license to open as many tabs and apps as you want without fear of slowdown. That kind of workout also requires a fat storage capacity to hold all of your projects and other files, and this HP has a 2TB SSD ready and waiting. You can truly appreciate the 2TB of storage and the 64GB of RAM, but the other giant feature on this HP Business Laptop us the one you can actually see and touch \u2014 the beautiful 17.3-inch touchscreen display. Not only is there more than enough room for truly immersive streaming or as many windows as you want to open for multitasking, they\u2019re all touch-controlled so this HP laptop can work like the world\u2019s most powerful tablet. Everything about this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is big, except its 0.81-inch thickness that makes it an easy backpack carry. The biggest feature of all is the price, or more accurately, the discount. Amazon\u2019s limited-time 74% off deal on this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop and its accessory bundle brings that price down to $1,140 \u2014 exceptionally good for a laptop this stacked.

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that US automakers overestimated consumer demand when they started ramping up production of electric vehicles. \"Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs,\" Fields, 64, told CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" \"They really didn't have a good discussion on the consumer, in terms of what it was going to take to get the consumer to buy these EV products,\" Fields said. Representatives for Fields did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Fields started his career at Ford in 1989 after graduating with an MBA from Harvard Business School. He held a variety of senior leadership positions at Ford, and was the company's chief operating officer from 2012 to 2014 and its CEO from 2014 to 2017. Some of the big bets automakers made on EVs have come undone \"over the last 18 months or so,\" Fields told CNBC. General Motors said in an exchange filing on Tuesday that it was taking a $1.6 billion charge \"based on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand.\" The company said it expected the \"adoption rate of EVs to slow\" after the Trump administration eliminated federal EV incentives. Under the Biden administration, EV buyers were entitled to a $7,500 consumer tax credit if they bought a new EV and a $4,000 consumer tax credit for a used EV. Both schemes expired on September 30. \"This is clearly an issue where the market didn't develop the way automakers thought. A lot of them, particularly in GM's case, boasted that they had the full lineup of EVs,\" Fields said on Tuesday. \"And what was an advantage, at least they thought at the time, has now probably turned into a bit of an albatross as the market take-up of EVs is going to be lower, at least in the near to medium term, than they plan for,\" he continued. Auto chiefs have expressed mixed views on whether the rollback of federal EV incentives would hurt the US EV market. Ford's current CEO, Jim Farley, said last month that the expiry of federal EV incentives could halve US EV sales. \"I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,\" Farley said on September 30. Former Tesla president Jon McNeill, however, thought otherwise. McNeill said in an interview with CNBC on October 2 that the market can continue to \"grow without subsidies.\" \"In Europe, France and Germany in particular rolled subsidies off a couple of years ago, and what happened after that, surprisingly, was the market continued to grow,\" McNeill said. \"That's largely because the models continue to roll out from other OEMs, much like they have here,\" McNeill added, using the acronym for original equipment manufacturers.

MacKenzie Scott has sold nearly half her Amazon stake, according to a filing disclosed this week. A regulatory filing with the SEC, filed Tuesday and dated September 30, shows that Scott's ex-husband, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, reported holding 81.1 million shares on Scott's behalf. That's down from about 139 million shares a year earlier and one of the steepest drops since the couple split in 2019. At Tuesday's closing share price, the reduction is equivalent to roughly $12.6 billion. The filing doesn't specify whether the decline reflects stock sales, charitable transfers, or both, but it marks a major shift for one of the world's most generous philanthropists. Bezos remains the reporting party because he continues to exercise voting power over Scott's shares under the terms of their divorce. An email from Business Insider to Yield Giving, Scott's philanthropic platform, seeking comment received an automatic response. Scott, 55, has spent the past five years giving away her fortune at an extraordinary pace. Through Yield Giving, she donated about $2 billion in gifts to 199 organizations in 2024, bringing her total lifetime giving to about $19.25 billion, according to her website. Her approach is notable for its speed and simplicity: she offers unrestricted grants to small and midsize nonprofits, allowing them to use the money however they see fit. \"Generosity is generative,\" she wrote in a 2021 essay on her website. \"Sharing makes more.\" \"Each unique expression of generosity will have value far beyond what we can imagine or live to see,\" she wrote in a 2021 Medium post explaining her philosophy. Scott received a 4% stake in Amazon after her divorce, then worth about $36 billion, instantly making her one of the richest women in the world. Despite her continued giving \u2014 and the latest 42% stake reduction \u2014 she remains wealthier than when she left her marriage. That's because Amazon shares have more than doubled since early 2019, boosting her residual holdings and ensuring her fortune, estimated at around $41.2 billion as of Wednesday, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos, who founded Amazon in 1994, remains the company's largest individual shareholder and continues to file annual disclosures on Scott's behalf due to his voting rights arrangement. Unlike Bezos \u2014 who now focuses on space exploration, media, and philanthropy through the Bezos Earth Fund \u2014 Scott has kept an unusually low public profile. She rarely grants interviews or comments on her donations, often revealing gifts months later through Yield Giving's website. Her consistent selling or gifting of Amazon stock has become a barometer of her philanthropic activity, even if the specifics remain opaque. Whether her latest 42% cut signals a new wave of giving or a strategic portfolio move, it underscores Scott's singular commitment: to give away most of her wealth in her lifetime \u2014 and do it quietly.

Marc Benioff doesn't think enough companies have figured out how to adopt AI. \"Customers are getting their head around how to deploy AI,\" Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, told CNBC host Jim Cramer on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Benoiff kicked off the Dreamforce conference at San Francisco's Moscone Center with a keynote, where he touted how clients such as Williams-Sonoma and Dutch jewelry maker Pandora have adopted Salesforce's AI products. \"The speed of innovation is far exceeding the speed of customer adoption,\" said Benioff to Cramer. \"These customers have to go back and modify massive architectures they have and systems they're running.\" The comments on AI adoption come as Salesforce shares are down more than 28% compared to the same time last year and around 34% compared to their peak in December 2024. The company said in August that it cut its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees, thanks to the adoption of AI agents. When asked about the stock decline, Benioff said that the Agentforce platform has rapidly grown since the company first introduced it a little over a year ago, but there is little understanding of how the company is using autonomous bots to drive efficiency. \"People don't understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce,\" said Benioff. \"It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform.\" The Dreamforce conference is set to bring tens of thousands of guests to San Francisco this week as Benoiff attempts to sell software like Tableau and Slack, powered by AI. Tickets typically run from $999 to $2,299. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Dario Amodei, CEO of AI lab Anthropic, are both scheduled to have chat sessions with Benoiff throughout the week, topped off with music performances from Metallica and Benson Boone.

Tesla's \"affordable\" EVs are finally here \u2014 and not everyone is impressed. Andy Palmer, the former Nissan COO who launched the Leaf, the world's first mass-market electric car, told Business Insider that Tesla's new Standard models won't help it fight off fierce competition from China's EV giants. \"If you take out the features \u2014 and Tesla has taken out an awful lot of features \u2014 then that creates a new price point, but that new price point doesn't make it competitive with the Chinese competition, which are stacked with features,\" Palmer told Business Insider. Tesla launched the Model 3 and Y Standard, which cost $37,000 and $40,000 respectively and come without features such as Autosteer, rear screens, and radios, last week. The lack of features and high price tags left some investors and fans underwhelmed, and Tesla's share price fell after the new models were revealed. Palmer, who is known as the \"godfather of EVs\" for his work developing the Nissan Leaf, said the new Model Y and 3 failed to fill the need for truly affordable EVs in the US. \"The US needs electric cars that are well-specified for less than $30,000,\" said Palmer. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Investors have been calling for Tesla to launch more affordable EVs for years. Last week, the Cybertruck maker unveiled the new models, which cost around $5,000 less than their premium counterparts. It comes as Tesla faces growing pressure from upstart Chinese manufacturers. Although companies like BYD and Geely don't sell their cars in the US due to high tariffs, they are now rapidly winning market share in Europe and other global markets like Brazil and Mexico. BYD's lineup of affordable electric and hybrid cars has proven especially popular in Europe, with the Shenzhen-based company seeing sales surge even as Tesla's have plummeted. \"It isn't such a big problem in the US, but elsewhere you have Chinese models that are coming in with lots of features at a very good price point,\" said Palmer. \"Stripping back a car doesn't help you,\" he added. Chinese automakers have increasingly prioritized high-tech features such as autonomous driving and AI assistants as they battle to win customers. BYD announced in February that it would incorporate advanced self-driving tech into all of its cars, including its cheapest model, the $8,000 Seagull. Meanwhile, Xiaomi's $30,000 SU7 sedan allows drivers to voice control home appliances from their car. Palmer, who spoke to Business Insider from China, said Western brands needed a \"wake-up call\" on the rise of Chinese automakers and had to develop strategies to match them, rather than simply relying on tariffs to keep BYD and its rivals out. \"You have to address the issue rather than standing behind regulatory or tariff rules. They'll insulate you for a while, but don't make the problem go away,\" he said.                  Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

Gazing out over New York Harbor from a poolside lounge chair on a 25th-floor terrace in downtown Manhattan, you might not believe the space used to be occupied mainly by JPMorgan Chase computers. Until 2022, 25 Water Street was home to the bank's back offices and, until 2020, housed the New York Daily News newsroom. Now, about half of its 1,320 rental apartments have been leased. The 32-story tower, which sits on the border of the financial district and the South Street Seaport, is the largest completed office-to-residential conversion project in the country. A combination of the pandemic-induced shift to remote work and a worsening housing shortage has pushed some developers to lean into a decades-old effort to repurpose languishing commercial space into new homes. New York City is leading the country in the financially and architecturally complex endeavor, boosted by government tax incentives. This year, 8,310 units are set to come online in converted buildings. There are music and podcast recording studios, coworking spaces, two bowling alleys, indoor and outdoor pools, a gym with pickleball and basketball courts, and a spa with an infrared sauna. The elaborate amenities cost tenants on average $150 a month to use (with WiFi included), said Sarah Patton, of Compass Development Marketing Group, who leads marketing and leasing for the building. That's on top of the relatively steep market-rate rents, which range from the high $3,000s for a studio to three-bedrooms that start at $10,000 a month. Eligible incomes for the building's 330 affordable apartments range from $37,612 to $180,810, depending on the size of the family. Without the tax incentive, all of the building's apartments would have been market-rate, said Brian Steinwurtzel, co-CEO of GFP Real Estate, which bought and developed the building with Metro Loft Management and Rockwood Capital. Steinwurtzel said the program, called 467-m, which GFP advocated for and the New York State legislature passed in 2024, \"is actually well designed in its structure,\" but the city's affordable housing lottery is frustratingly slow. The city receives about 450 applications through the lottery for each available unit, citywide. \"We can generate a lease very quickly, and the resident could really sign a lease very quickly, but the process to go through the lottery and all the checks that have to be done and all the sign-offs from the city are really complicated and take a very long time,\" Steinwurtzel said. He'd like to see the city simplify and shorten the application process so that tenants can move in much more quickly, saving residents and the building owners time, money, and unnecessary stress. When GFP and its co-developers bought 25 Water in 2022, \"most people thought that we were crazy,\" Steinwurtzel said. The developers bought the building for about $250 million as New York's commercial real estate market was hitting rock bottom, and have since benefited from the city's resurgence post-pandemic. Still, Steinwurtzel expects the pipeline of conversions to slow unless the city or state extends the tax incentives or the commercial real estate market plunges back into crisis. At 25 Water, this meant cutting two light wells into the center of the building and adding 10 floors to the top. The facade was originally designed to resemble an IBM punch card, with small, sparse windows, so lots of new windows had to be added. \"We created the hole in the doughnut to bring the light and air into the middle of the space,\" John Cetra, the Manhattan architect and cofounder of CetraRuddy, which led the design of 25 Water, previously told Business Insider. \"The ceiling heights that you get in the units are much higher than a new build residential product,\" Steinwurtzel said. The transformation of Pfizer's former headquarters into 1,602 apartments is expected to overtake 25 Water as the city's largest-ever conversion when it's finished next year.

AI is the story driving markets in 2025, but as companies rack up huge tabs in their sprawling infrastructure buildout, some investors have begun to worry: will all of the spending be worth it? Morgan Stanley this week has a reassuring answer. OpenAI alone has announced a huge web of deals with the largest players in tech, announcing big partnerships with Oracle, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. The AI startup is doubling down on investments in chips and data centers to support its fast-growing infrastructure. In an October 13 note to investors, Morgan Stanley global director of research Katy Huberty shared a chart on AI tech spending diffusion. It showed a group of highly connected tech companies with a lot of capital flowing either through or from OpenAI. The analyst notes that Morgan Stanley's tech team thinks the AI spending cycle is still in its early stages, but the huge price tag shouldn't necessarily spook investors.  \"Our team believes the sustainability of the current investment cycle ultimately depends on whether AI generates durable cash flows to support returns on the significant capital being committed,\" Huberty stated. \"And their bottom-up analysis suggests they will, as they forecast US$1.1 trillion in AI software revenue in 2028 at typical software margins.\" Morgan Stanley's forecast implies the current wave of AI spending is part of a longer-term profit cycle and not a speculative bubble that some have begun to fear. If those revenue targets prove correct, Huberty's team sees the AI boom continuing to drive growth for companies that are heavily investing in the space today.  Analysts from firms such as Morningstar have speculated that colossal AI capex among tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet could negatively impact their stock prices over time.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"BySiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff. French billionaire Bernard Arnault\u2019s net worth rose by more than $19 billion on Wednesday as the shares of his company LVMH surged more than 14% after the luxury goods conglomerate posted a growth in sales in its earnings report for the first time this year, driven by increased Chinese demand.

As South Korea's beauty giant Olive Young gears up to land on US shores, American retailers are jostling for a share of the K-beauty pie. US beauty retailers like Sephora and Ulta Beauty are snapping up South Korean beauty brands and inking exclusive sales partnerships to capitalize on the K-beauty trend. Skincare brand Hanyul announced in May that it was exclusively launching in the US via Sephora. Aestura, a sensitive skincare brand, said the same in February. And Ulta Beauty is the only major US retailer selling products from Medicube, a beauty tech company whose skincare devices have been touted by celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber. This turf war over K-beauty in the US is unfolding before Olive Young, South Korea's answer to Ulta Beauty, makes its much-awaited US debut in 2026. The retailer, which has over 1,300 stores in South Korea, is known for stocking top-ranking K-beauty brands and focusing on trendy and affordable products. K-beauty, known for its innovative formulations, gentle ingredients, and multi-step routines, means big money. According to data from marketing research firm NielsenIQ, it was a $2 billion industry in the US in the year leading up to July 2025 \u2014 up 37% from the same period the year before. Sephora stocks many big-name Korean brands, such as Beauty of Joseon, Dr. Jart+, Laneige, Aestura, Hanyul, and others. Ulta Beauty execs said on an earnings call in August that the company is expanding its K-beauty assortment, with new additions like Anua and Peach & Lily joining its existing portfolio of Korean brands like Medicube, Belif, COSRX, and others. Ashley Kang, the global beauty director of Chicago-based market research company Worldpanel, said K-beauty is still a niche product category. Its core audience consists of Asian consumers and younger demographics, ranging from Gen Alpha to millennials. \"Until the rise of K-culture, Asian beauty outside of Japan had little global recognition,\" Kang said. \"The growing influence of Korean pop culture and dramas allowed people to see the flawless skin of Korean celebrities, building trust and belief in K-beauty products.\" K-beauty differs from clean skincare brands from the US, like Hailey Bieber's Rhode, in several ways. Larissa Jensen, the global beauty industry advisor of Chicago-based market research firm Circana, said brands like Rhode home in on ethical ingredient sourcing. In contrast, K-beauty brands have carved out a niche in preventive care and long-term skin health. Anna Keller, a principal analyst from London-based market research firm Mintel, told Business Insider that K-beauty has a price advantage over US brands. \"They're super affordable, so you're getting high-quality, effective products without breaking the bank,\" Keller said. Sephora and Ulta Beauty are choosing K-beauty brands that have already proven themselves to US consumers, she said. These brands, like Beauty of Joseon and Medicube, have been popular on online platforms like Amazon. \"A lot of this success comes from social media buzz \u2014 think TikTok trends like 'glass skin' and the hype around ingredients like snail mucin,\" Keller said. \"Sephora and Ulta are essentially riding the wave of this existing demand, bringing in brands that are already popular and have a strong following in the US.\" With US retailers snapping up K-beauty brands before Olive Young's debut next year, the Korean company is set to enter a competitive landscape. \"Unlike Sephora and Ulta, which focus on a handful of big-name brands, Olive Young is more about discovery,\" Keller said. \"They're known for curating a mix of well-known and up-and-coming Korean brands, which makes them a go-to for people who want to explore beyond the mainstream.\" Kang from Worldpanel said Olive Young needs to \"position itself as a K-beauty specialist, ensuring that its competition does not directly overlap with Sephora or Ulta.\" She said that the retailer can take advantage of the tariff turmoil.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"A TV advert by Red Tractor, the UK's biggest certifier of farm products on supermarket shelves, has been banned for exaggerating the scheme's environmental benefits and misleading the public. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the organisation had provided \"insufficient evidence\" that its farms complied with basic environmental laws to substantiate the claims in its ad. Environmental group River Action, which brought the complaint in 2023, said the ruling showed the scheme was \"greenwashing\" and urged supermarkets to stop using it. But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision \"fundamentally flawed\" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards. In 2021, Red Tractor aired an advert in which it said: \"From field to store all our standards are met. When the Red Tractor's there, your food's farmed with care.\" You can watch it below. The environmental charity River Action took issue with the ad, which ran for a further two years, and complained to the watchdog that it suggested to consumers that Red Tractor farms will \"ensure a high degree of environmental protection\". The charity pointed to a report by the Environment Agency, released in 2020, which looked at how many breaches of environmental law there were on Red Tractor farms in the previous five years. The report concluded that these farms were \"not currently an indicator of good environmental performance\". After more than two years of investigation - one of the longest running - the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint. It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide \"sufficient evidence\" that its farms met \"basic\" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad. It also ruled that as a result the advert was \"misleading\" and \"exaggerated\" the benefits of the scheme. River Action welcomed the decision by the ASA and called on supermarkets to act. \"What this shows is that for their environmental credentials Red Tractor has been misleading the public and their suppliers,\" said Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River Action. \"So, we're looking for suppliers like supermarkets to really examine and take stock of what is on their shelves.\" She added that challenging such adverts was important because of the risk to the environment from agricultural pollution. In 2022, the Environment Audit Committee concluded that agriculture was one of the most common factors preventing rivers from being in good health - affecting 40% of them. The risks to the environment include from slurry and pesticide runoff. But Red Tractor, which assures 45,000 farms in the UK, have pushed back strongly, calling the finding by the ASA \"fundamentally flawed\". Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: \"They believe that we have implied an environmental claim. Nowhere in the voiceover or the imagery is any environmental claim actually made.\" He argued that the ASA only found a minority of people would think the advert meant Red Tractor farms had good environmental standards, and in fact the scheme is focused on other issues. \"Red Tractor's core purpose is food safety, animal welfare, and traceability. Whilst we have some environmental standards, they are a small part. And as a consequence, we leave that entirely to the Environment Agency to enforce environmental legislation,\" said Mr Moseley. When asked if that meant Red Tractor does not know if its farms are complying with environmental law, he said: \"Correct\". But many supermarkets do refer to the environmental benefits of Red Tractor farms. Natalie Smith, Tesco's head of agriculture said last month, on the 25-year anniversary of Red Tractor: \"Certification schemes play a key role in providing reassurance for customers, and over the past 25 years, Red Tractor has established itself as a mark of quality, standing for\u2026 environmental protection.\" On Morrisons' website it states: \"100% of the fresh pork, beef, lamb, poultry, milk and cheddar cheese we sell in our stores comes from farms certified by Red Tractor, or an approved equivalent scheme, giving customers assurance\u2026 environmental protection.\" Both supermarkets were asked if they stood by the Red Tractor logo. Morrisons did not respond to a request for comment. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"We recognise there is still more to do, and it's essential that the Government and industry work together to drive change.\" It also referred the BBC to their industry body the British Retail Consortium. The consortium said that \"retailers remain committed to working with Red Tractor\", but that the organisation themselves are owners of the scheme.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) stock dropped by 6% on October 14, and is now trading at $139. This decline was triggered by investor concern over new reports. Specifically, reports that Meta and Oracle plan to adopt NVIDIA's Spectrum-X Ethernet networking devices for their AI data centers were perceived as a significant competitive threat to Arista, a major provider of cloud networking solutions. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it might be the right time to purchase additional ANET shares.

Mozilla is betting big on privacy with a new move: It is currently testing a free VPN service built directly into Firefox which is a feature that arrives as the browser struggles to maintain relevance with just 2.5% market share in the United States and around 2-3% globally. The timing couldn\u2019t be better for this cool feature. Around the world, content restrictions and privacy concerns are pushing millions of users toward VPN services. Countries are increasingly implementing blocking mechanisms for various types of content, from adult websites to social media platforms and news outlets. In France, for instance,\u00c2\u00a0mandatory age verification on adult websites introduced in July triggered a dramatic market reshaping. Major platforms like PornHub and YouPorn chose to exit France entirely rather than comply while others like Xvideos implemented verification systems. The unintended consequence? A proliferation of illegal sites flooding Google search results\u00c2\u00a0and a massive surge in VPN adoption. But France is just one example among many. Certain US states have implemented similar age verification laws for adult content (like Texas or Florida where PornHub is banned) while countries like Turkey and China maintain extensive content blocking systems. Even within democratic nations, geographic licensing restrictions prevent users from accessing streaming content available in other regions. Unlike Mozilla\u2019s existing paid VPN service which protects all internet traffic on a device, this new Firefox offering focuses exclusively on web traffic flowing through the browser itself. The advantage is simplicity: no separate application to install, no complex configuration menus to navigate. Users simply toggle the feature on within Firefox, and their IP address is masked and their ISP can no longer monitor their online activities. Mozilla promises unlimited data with no connection speed throttling. The company also commits to collecting only minimal technical data necessary for service operation which would be deleted after three months. Most importantly, Mozilla pledges never to log browsing history or track downloaded content. On paper, it sounds like an ideal privacy solution. But in practice, there are significant complications. Here\u2019s where things get tricky: Mozilla is an American company operating servers on US soil. This places it squarely under American jurisdiction and within the reach of the Five Eyes alliance which is an intelligence-sharing pact among English-speaking nations. Even with the best intentions, Mozilla could be legally compelled to respond to government data requests or modify its practices under pressure. American tech companies have a documented history of receiving National Security Letters and FISA court orders, often accompanied by gag orders preventing them from disclosing these requests. While Mozilla\u2019s stated no-log policy means there would theoretically be nothing to hand over, the jurisdiction issue remains a psychological and legal barrier for privacy-conscious users who prefer VPN providers based in countries like Switzerland, Panama, or the British Virgin Islands. Mozilla isn\u2019t pioneering this space of built-in VPNs: Opera has offered a free integrated VPN for years, and Brave has developed its own solution. Microsoft Edge recently introduced comparable privacy features as well, even if it\u2019s probably not the most private either. The trend is real: Privacy protection has become a crucial competitive differentiator for browsers fighting for relevance. However, these integrated VPNs fall short compared to dedicated VPN services: Server counts are limited, configuration options are minimal, and performance can be disappointing. Firefox VPN will initially offer only American servers at launch which restricts its usefulness for accessing geo-restricted content or achieving genuine location diversity.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. American Battery Technology (NASDAQ:ABAT) stock has experienced a dramatic surge, driven by a recent regulatory breakthrough. The company announced the completion of key regulatory baseline studies for its Tonopah Flats Lithium Project in Nevada on October 13, 2025. This progress effectively removed a regulatory hurdle, driving a significant price increase and strong positive market sentiment. In the seven trading days since the announcement, the stock has logged consecutive gains, accumulating a total return of 132%. This surge added over $1 billion to its valuation in the last week, bringing its current market capitalization to approximately $1.3 billion. For context, the stock is now trading 360% higher than its price at the end of 2024, far outpacing the S&P 500's year-to-date return of 13%. ABAT engages in the exploration, mining, extraction, and recycling of battery metals, holding extensive mining claims and private properties with water rights in the Western Nevada Basin. This is one perspective on analyzing stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses many more factors and is designed to minimize stock-specific risk while providing potential for appreciation. The table below outlines the return of ABAT stock compared to the S&P 500 index across various time frames, including the current winning streak: What is the significance? Momentum often precedes confidence. A streak of gains over multiple days may indicate increasing investor confidence or encourage additional buying. Observing such trends can aid in capitalizing on strength or preparing for timely investment if momentum decreases. Currently, there are 21 S&P constituents that have experienced 3 or more consecutive days of gains, and 19 constituents that have seen 3 or more consecutive days of losses. While ABAT stock appears appealing because of its winning streak, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be precarious. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, composed of 30 stocks, has a proven history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices \u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor.   From a quantitative perspective, the 40.1% fluctuation in Microsoft (MSFT) stock between 4\/17\/2025 and 10\/14\/2025 can be largely attributed to a 27.5% variation in the company's P\/E Multiple. Although there is more to this narrative than mere figures, let\u2019s first analyze the stock price trends and their influencing factors. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is considerable advantage to a more diversified strategy, such as the one we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock that appeals to you, or should you create a portfolio that is structured to succeed throughout market cycles? Our analyses indicate that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed the uncertainty of stock selection into reliable market-outperforming results. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation framework of Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a Boston-based wealth management firm and Trefis collaborator \u2013 whose asset allocation strategy achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 crisis when the S&P 500 plummeted by over 40%. Returning to the \"change\": The shifts in fundamental aspects such as valuation, revenue, and profit margins reflect underlying business dynamics and investor sentiment. Below, we outline the key factors that affected the stock price movements for MSFT. For context, MSFT provides software, services, devices, and solutions, including Office, Microsoft Teams, Windows OEM licensing, and productivity tools to meet both business and personal computing demands. Opinion: At present, we view MSFT stock as relatively overpriced. Why is that the case? Investigate the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell MSFT Stock to understand the factors influencing our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, Microsoft is not immune to significant declines. It experienced a drop of approximately 65% during the Dot-Com bubble and nearly 58% in the Global Financial Crisis. Recent shocks have also led to considerable declines \u2014 around 37% in the inflation spike and nearly 28% amid the Covid sell-off. The lesser correction in 2018 still resulted in a fall of over 18%. Strong fundamentals are essential, but when the market undergoes severe sell-offs, even leading stocks like MSFT can be caught in the downturn. Consistently identifying winners is a challenging endeavor \u2014 particularly given the volatility that comes with an individual stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising of 30 stocks, has a proven history of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 throughout the last four years. Why does that happen? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; it\u2019s been less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

Twitty wants to set the record straight on Southern food: it's not just heavy fried meats and sweet tea by the pitcher-full. In his new, hefty cookbook that surveys the region, Recipes from the American South, the James Beard Award-winning author is teaching home cooks how to make food that better reflects the region's complex, messy and still-evolving history. I recently spent the day cooking and talking with Twitty at his home in Virginia. We started out on a cool September morning in Twitty's garden, where I admired the huge variety of produce that he grows. There are peppers. Beans. Corn. Cabbage. All kinds of herbs. Plus, boxes of cotton plants and peanuts, which Twitty grows to acknowledge his enslaved ancestors.

I grow different varieties that are heirlooms. They're not meant for, like, commercial production. They're just meant to preserve the seed. And show people what's what.\" From one of the herb beds, he grabbed some fresh parsley and offered up a bouquet. It smelled amazing \u2013 vibrant and verdant.

We're almost at the end of tomato season, so these sweet little jewels figure prominently in our meal. That's one of the many things that Twitty wants the wider world to understand: Southern food, at its core, is deeply seasonal.  Today, the garden is absolutely bursting with okra \u2014 the essential African vegetable that became prized in the American South \u2014 so we're making okra soup, red rice and slow-simmered green beans in a rich, meaty broth. Twitty is Jewish and observant \u2013 which he wrote about at length in one of his other books, Koshersoul \u2014 and we're swapping in beef bacon for the more traditional pork version. Twitty's home was cozy and bright, full of hundreds and hundreds of books and objects collected from his travels. \"This is a maximalist household,\" he observed.

He said it's like an altar. \"So this is my great grandmother, grandmother and mother's hot comb. And so I put it like a mezuzah at the door.\" He pointed to another object, saying, \"My grandmother's church fan, a fan from Ghana.\" \"I make sure this space is kept sacred to me,\" he said. \"I understand it has to be entered with respect. So this is for the mothers.\" Everything with Twitty is like that \u2014 considered, curated, special. The recipes, too. Twitty traces the history and cultural context for each one he shares in Recipes from the American South. He said he wants to honor the tapestry of Indigenous, African, European and Asian peoples who created all these dishes by using the techniques they already knew with local ingredients they found here, in the American South.

And all the recipes in this hefty tome are accessible to the home cook. Twitty said he doesn't want to preach at the public, but he also wanted to acknowledge and teach the region's complicated history \u2014 and he said that for far too long, Black chefs and food writers have not been part of that larger conversation. \"An African American writer of southern heritage can most definitely tell the story of the Cajuns, the Chinese from Mississippi, the Kurds, the Latinos, everybody,\" he said emphatically while slicing okra. \"You know, put everybody in a story that tells the story of the South as a family. We're a dysfunctional family, but we're still a family.\"                  Twitty grabs serving bowls from his kitchen cabinet.

Twitty said he finds it both writing on the page and cooking in the kitchen. \"For me,\" he said, \"it's mental health work. I don't think a lot of people understand what it means to be immigrants, what it means to be an exile people, what it means to be a diaspora people, what it means to be oppressed, what it means to have to work within the bounds of poverty. And when you do learn how to cook that way and feel that way and understand yourself, it is very healing. It's very corrective.\" We finally sat down in the dining room to enjoy the meal we prepared. The flavors were delicious, and all those homegrown foods were deeply satisfying. And at Michael Twitty's table, everyone is welcome.  Left: Twitty slices okra onto a cutting board.

Okra, which came from West Africa via the Afro-Caribbean world, unites the South with the rest of the African Atlantic. It is without a roux, and although it can be made with proteins (see the variation), it works perfectly as a meatless dish. Prep time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 55-60 minutes Serves: 6 INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS In a large Dutch oven (casserole dish) or heavy-bottomed soup pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and saut\u00e9, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the corn, fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes, stock, and salt and black pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30\u201335 minutes, until the flavors are well combined. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the okra, cayenne, and salt and black pepper to taste. Saut\u00e9, stirring often, until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Once the broth has finished cooking, add the okra, taste, and add additional seasoning as preferred. Cover and cook over medium heat until the okra is soft and imbued with the broth, 10\u201315 minutes. Enjoy with a spoonful of rice in each bowl. STORAGE: Store airtight in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. VARIATION: About 1 cup (235 g) diced raw beef or chicken makes a great addition. Add to the broth before adding the okra.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) shares have surged 33% over the last week and are currently priced at $114.06. The recent rally comes amid a recent $5 billion strategic partnership agreement with Brookfield Asset Management to deploy Bloom\u2019s advanced fuel cell technology in AI  data centers. However, our machine-driven, multi-factor analysis indicates it might be advisable to sell BE shares on the recent surge. Overall, we have a pessimistic outlook on the stock, and a target price of $80 could be within reach. We think there are only a few concerns regarding BE stock considering its general Moderate operational performance and financial health. However, taking into account its Very High valuation, we view the stock as Unattractive. Below is our analysis: BE stock has recently experienced significant gains, yet we currently find it unattractive. This may seem like a warning, and there are considerable risks in depending on a single stock. Nonetheless, we believe there is substantial merit in a more broadly diversified approach, as we utilize with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Consider this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework improves your chances.

Here are some details. While revenue growth is beneficial, this isn't strictly a growth outlook. Pricing power coupled with high margins fosters consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, which diminishes risk and permits capital to be reinvested. The market typically appreciates this. As a brief overview, Danaher offers professional, medical, industrial, and commercial products within Life Sciences, Diagnostics, and Environmental solutions, including lab automation, diagnostic systems, genomics, and microscopy technologies. But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell DHR Stock to determine whether Danaher still possesses an advantage that withstands scrutiny. Investing in a single stock can be precarious, but there is immense value in the diversified approach we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio.

The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework increases your chances of success. Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is the Data This is how we make our selections: We focus on stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and then filter out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also exclusively consider stocks that have substantially decreased in valuation over the past year. Below are statistics for stocks that have followed this selection strategy since 12\/31\/2016. But Weigh the Risks However, DHR is not immune to significant downturns. It declined around 46% during both the Dot-Com Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis. The inflation shock impacted it at about 37%, and even the Covid sell-off reduced its value nearly 28%. The correction in 2018 was less severe but still brought it down over 13%. Robust fundamentals are important, but during market downturns, DHR can experience considerable pullbacks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which encompasses all three \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices \u2014 and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this so?

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) is a solid company with robust margins and a strong balance sheet, yet its stock still appears expensive. Although it has experienced a 32% decline this year, the narrative of \u201ccheap Chipotle\u201d seems exaggerated. Growth has decelerated, valuations continue to be high, and consumer weakness could result in turbulent quarters ahead. The S&P 500 has climbed 13% in 2025, whereas Chipotle is lagging behind, even as struggling Starbucks stock (NASDAQ: SBUX) is down by a smaller 12%. Certainly, the brand is expanding internationally, venturing into Asia, and introducing new menu offerings\u2014but this does not render the stock affordable. CMG continues to trade at roughly 37 times earnings and 4.7 times sales, a premium for a company witnessing moderating growth and traffic trends. For those investors seeking lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 105% since its inception. Separately, you can check Micron Stock A Better Bet Than Analog Devices? Chipotle continues to grow, but the pace has decreased. Over the last three years, revenue increased by approximately 12.5% each year, but in the past twelve months, that growth has decelerated to 8.6%, with the latest quarter reporting just a 3% year-over-year increase. That performance is respectable\u2014but it does not justify a high valuation. As inflation pressures consumers and menu prices rise, Chipotle's same-store sales strength may continue to diminish. To be fair, the company\u2019s fundamentals are robust. Chipotle\u2019s operating margin is around 17% and its net margin nears 13%, indicating a well-managed business with strict cost controls. The company generates roughly $2 billion in operating cash flow each year and has minimal debt\u2014only $4.8 billion compared to a $55 billion market cap. With over $1.5 billion in cash, Chipotle enjoys excellent financial stability. Such strength provides management the flexibility to invest during downturns or finance expansion overseas. In summary, Chipotle is financially sound\u2014it\u2019s just not fully operationally efficient. Here\u2019s the main concern: the disparity between what you pay and what you receive. Chipotle\u2019s valuation implies perfection, yet its current operational performance is merely moderate. Growth is decelerating, inflation remains persistent, and expansion requires time to yield results. Even with a strong balance sheet, this combination seldom justifies a high multiple. If earnings on October 29 demonstrate further margin compression or declining foot traffic, investors could easily witness another downturn. Chipotle\u2019s history indicates it can bounce back swiftly. During the pandemic collapse, CMG saw a drop of over 50%\u2014then fully recovered in just a matter of months. This level of brand loyalty and recovery speed is uncommon. However, it also underlines the stock\u2019s volatility; when sentiment shifts, it shifts abruptly. Thus, while Chipotle tends to rebound stronger after significant shocks, the timing might be painful for those investors who purchase too early. The risk doesn\u2019t solely arise from major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions\u2014consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read CMG Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Chipotle is still one of the leading operators in fast-casual dining, and its financial standing is solid. However, strong fundamentals do not always equate to a great buying opportunity. At current values, the valuation appears stretched for what is now a moderate-growth trajectory. Therefore, this isn\u2019t a stock to fear\u2014it\u2019s merely one to hold off on for now. Single stocks can be risky, but there is great value in a more diversified strategy. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has beaten its all-cap benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver impressive returns for investors. The quarterly rebalanced mixture of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible way to benefit from bullish markets while reducing drawdowns, as demonstrated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":" Design concepts live in that fascinating space between \u201cwhat if\u201d and \u201cwhy not,\u201d where the constraints of manufacturing budgets and market research haven\u2019t yet trimmed away the boldest ideas. While finished products get the spotlight and the sales figures, concepts represent design thinking at its most uninhibited, tackling problems we didn\u2019t even know we had and proposing solutions that make us wonder why nobody thought of this sooner. The concept phase is where designers can be genuinely fearless, pushing boundaries without worrying about supply chains or price points, and the results often reveal just how limited our current approaches really are. The Red Dot Award: Design Concept 2025 winners showcase exactly this kind of unbridled innovation, representing the design industry\u2019s best guesses about what we\u2019ll actually need in the coming years. Unlike the product design category that celebrates what\u2019s already hitting shelves, these concept awards highlight the ideas that could fundamentally shift how we approach everything from daily routines to major life challenges. At Yanko Design, we pay close attention to these concept winners because they consistently predict the design trends that eventually become mainstream, and this year\u2019s selection suggests some genuinely exciting directions for the future of human-centered design. Here are some of our Best of Best handpicked winners from this year\u2019s awards program, along with the Luminary Winner and Peter Zec Prize winner for the year! Click here to view more Award-winning designs from the Red Dot Award: Design Concept       Traditional pickup trucks force buyers into rigid categories: work truck, family hauler, or recreational vehicle, with each choice requiring compromises that leave most users wishing they could have multiple vehicles for different situations. Dongfeng\u2019s E-Truck concept demolishes these artificial boundaries by treating the vehicle as a transformative platform rather than a fixed-purpose machine, using what they call \u201call-in-one design\u201d to seamlessly transition between configurations with a single button press. The result looks more like a piece of industrial architecture than a conventional truck, with its stainless steel finish and minimalist form suggesting durability and adaptability rather than adherence to traditional automotive styling cues. The visual transformation captured in the images reveals the concept\u2019s true innovation: the truck bed\u2019s French doors and flip-up cover create an instant tent structure that converts the vehicle from transport to basecamp in minutes, while the integrated solar collection panel provides the energy independence that makes extended off-grid adventures actually practical. The full-wheel steering and crab motion capabilities aren\u2019t just technical showing off, they\u2019re essential features for a vehicle designed to navigate tight camping spots and urban environments with equal ease. The modular components like removable stereos and refrigerators acknowledge that modern utility vehicles need to serve as mobile command centers, entertainment systems, and emergency response platforms depending on the situation. By incorporating Steer-by-Wire technology and multi-dimensional environment-sensing HMI, the E-Truck positions itself as software-defined transportation that can adapt its behavior to match its current configuration. This Red Dot: Best of the Best winner represents more than just automotive innovation, it\u2019s a complete reimagining of what utility vehicles can be when freed from the constraints of traditional categories, suggesting a future where single vehicles can replace entire fleets of specialized machines.  Toddler footwear operates in a bizarre economic reality where parents routinely purchase shoes knowing they\u2019ll be outgrown within months, creating a cycle of constant replacement that\u2019s both financially wasteful and environmentally destructive, yet unavoidable because growing feet demand properly fitting footwear. The 10 to 18-month period represents peak foot development chaos, with toddlers experiencing rapid changes in length, width, and arch development that make traditional static shoe construction fundamentally incompatible with healthy foot development. JuicyFlex attacks this problem by treating toddler shoes not as miniature adult footwear, but as dynamic growth systems that can adapt in real-time to foot changes, using what Anta calls \u201cadaptive expansion technology\u201d to create a single pair of shoes that can accompany a child through multiple developmental stages. The visual appeal immediately signals this isn\u2019t typical children\u2019s footwear: the honeycomb-patterned sole and sock-like upper construction look more like advanced athletic equipment than toddler shoes, yet maintain the playful colors that appeal to both children and parents. The three-dimensional adaptation system integrates lateral width adjustment, longitudinal length extension, and vertical flexible cushioning, essentially creating a shoe that grows with the foot rather than constraining it. The dual-layer construction pairs an inner sock made from natural lotus fiber, flax fiber, and soybean fiber with an outer shoe constructed from fruit leather and mycelium leather, demonstrating that sustainable materials can deliver both performance and safety in children\u2019s products. This combination of 100% non-toxic materials with antibacterial and moisture-wicking properties addresses the hygiene challenges of active toddlers while the bio-based outer construction reduces environmental impact without sacrificing durability. The Red Dot: Best of the Best recognition acknowledges JuicyFlex as more than just innovative children\u2019s footwear, it\u2019s a complete reimagining of how products can be designed for human growth and development, suggesting a future where adaptive design principles could transform numerous product categories beyond footwear.       Smartphone addiction has become so normalized that we\u2019ve stopped recognizing it as a design problem and started treating it as a personal failing, blaming users for lacking willpower rather than questioning why our most essential communication tools are deliberately engineered to be as addictive as slot machines. The Audion concept attacks this problem at its source by completely reimagining what a personal communication device can be when it\u2019s designed for human wellbeing rather than engagement metrics, replacing the infinite scroll of modern smartphones with what the designers call \u201cmeaningful interaction.\u201d The result looks more like a sophisticated piece of audio equipment than a phone, with its clean geometric form and terracotta finish immediately signaling that this device serves a fundamentally different purpose than the glossy, attention-grabbing rectangles we\u2019re accustomed to carrying. The radical design philosophy becomes clear in the visual comparison: where traditional smartphones present endless colorful app icons designed to trigger dopamine responses, the Audion\u2019s minimal display shows only essential text-based information that informs rather than entertains. The dual circular sensors on top suggest sophisticated environmental awareness that enables the device to provide contextually relevant assistance through conversational AI rather than demanding constant visual attention. By eliminating the screen-based ecosystem that enables endless scrolling and social media consumption, the Audion forces a complete rethinking of how we interact with personal technology, shifting from passive consumption to active communication. The modular design visible in the stacked configuration suggests the device can adapt to different use cases while maintaining its commitment to intentional interaction rather than mindless engagement. This Red Dot: Best of the Best winner represents more than just minimalist device design, it\u2019s a manifesto for what technology could become if we prioritized human flourishing over user engagement, proposing a future where our personal devices become tools for clarity and focus rather than sources of distraction and anxiety. The concept acknowledges that true digital wellness isn\u2019t about using willpower to resist addictive design, but about creating technology that doesn\u2019t require resistance in the first place.  Industrial food robots have traditionally looked exactly like what they are: intimidating pieces of factory equipment that belong behind closed kitchen doors, operated by technicians in hairnets rather than experienced by customers as part of their dining experience. The CA-1 shatters this paradigm by treating autonomous cooking not as an industrial process, but as a form of culinary theater that customers can actually watch and interact with, transforming what could be a sterile automated system into something that feels almost magical. The clean, minimalist exterior and large viewing window invite curiosity rather than anxiety, positioning the robot as a skilled chef worthy of observation rather than a machine to be hidden away. What sets the CA-1 apart from every previous attempt at cooking automation is its claim to true autonomy through CircusOS, an AI-native operating system that handles real-time adaptive decision-making without human intervention. This isn\u2019t just programmed recipe execution, it\u2019s embodied intelligence that can adjust cooking parameters, timing, and techniques based on ingredient variations, environmental conditions, and quality assessments that human cooks make instinctively. The electromagnetic gripper system and precision heating modules work in concert to manage multiple dishes simultaneously, as shown in the image of robotic arms juggling five different pans with the kind of coordination that would challenge even experienced line cooks. The modular ingredient silos visible in the system design enable 500-meal production runs while minimizing food waste through precise portioning and inventory management. The conversational voice AI interface transforms interaction from technical operation to something approaching collaboration, making the complex machine feel approachable rather than intimidating. Set for market rollout in Fall 2025, the CA-1 represents more than just automation, it\u2019s a fundamental reimagining of how commercial cooking can scale while maintaining quality and creating positive customer experiences, earning its Red Dot: Best of the Best recognition by solving industrial efficiency challenges without sacrificing human connection to food preparation.  Most racing simulators suffer from an identity crisis, trying to look like stripped-down racecars while functioning as gaming equipment, resulting in products that feel like cheap approximations of the real thing rather than sophisticated simulation platforms in their own right. The Kelako Formula takes a completely different approach, creating what looks more like a piece of futuristic transportation than a gaming accessory, with clean lines, bold color blocking, and a design language that references Formula 1 aesthetics without trying to literally replicate them. The result is a simulator that commands respect as a serious piece of equipment while maintaining the visual excitement that makes you want to climb in and start racing. What sets this apart from typical racing simulators is the sophisticated modular architecture that allows the system to grow with user needs and technological advances. The base single-seater rig can be incrementally upgraded with motion actuators, bass shakers, off-center vibrators for rumble strip simulation, and VR compatibility, transforming from a static simulator into a full motion platform without requiring a complete system replacement. The authentic Formula car ergonomics aren\u2019t just about visual appeal, they\u2019re about creating muscle memory that translates to real-world racing, which makes sense given the designer\u2019s background as an instructor pilot who understands the importance of realistic training environments. The lightweight carbon fiber and fiberglass construction paired with precision-folded sheet metal framing creates a structure that\u2019s both visually striking and mechanically robust enough to handle the forces generated by motion systems. By treating the simulator as an evolving platform rather than a fixed product, KELAKO has created something that can serve everyone from casual gamers to professional drivers, scaling from home entertainment to professional training facility without compromising the core design integrity that earned it Red Dot: Best of the Best recognition.  Most prosthetic limbs still operate under the outdated philosophy that replacement body parts should be invisible and apologetic, designed to hide rather than celebrate the reality of the human experience with amputation, while providing only the most basic mobility functions that keep users functional but rarely confident. FFATE completely rejects this approach by embracing what the designers call \u201cstrong and dynamic appearance,\u201d creating a prosthetic that looks more like advanced athletic equipment than medical device, with an external exoskeleton that follows natural leg contours while making no attempt to disguise its artificial nature. Instead of hiding the technology, FFATE celebrates it, transforming the prosthetic from something users endure into something they can showcase as part of their identity and capabilities. The visual impact is immediately striking: the copper-colored internal structure visible through the black exoskeleton openings resembles organic muscle fiber more than traditional mechanical components, created through advanced 3D printing that replicates the user\u2019s actual muscle structure in synthetic form. This fiber-like inner layer doesn\u2019t just look organic, it functions organically, stretching with movement and absorbing impact in ways that help users adapt to their prosthetic more quickly and naturally. The modular foot system acknowledges that athletic amputees don\u2019t need one-size-fits-all solutions, they need specialized attachments for different sports and activities, while the material and color customization options ensure that each FFATE prosthetic becomes a unique expression of its user\u2019s personal style. This Red Dot: Best of the Best winner represents more than just innovative prosthetic design, it\u2019s a fundamental shift toward technology that enhances human capability and self-expression rather than simply replacing lost function, suggesting a future where assistive devices become extensions of personal identity rather than medical necessities to be hidden.  Medical furniture has traditionally embraced an aesthetic of clinical sterility that somehow equates \u201cmedical-grade\u201d with \u201cdeliberately uncomfortable and intimidating,\u201d as if healing requires suffering through institutional design that makes patients feel more like specimens than people. Geni-us\u2019s Smart Medical Chair completely rejects this philosophy, creating what looks more like premium lounge furniture than medical equipment, yet transforms seamlessly from welcoming armchair to full treatment bed without losing any of its sophisticated visual appeal. The clean, rectangular-circular form and neutral upholstery make it indistinguishable from high-end residential furniture when in chair mode, immediately reducing the anxiety that typically accompanies medical and aesthetic procedures. The \u201cone-stop clinic\u201d concept represents a fundamental rethinking of how medical spaces can function, eliminating the inefficient shuffle between consultation chairs, treatment beds, and recovery areas that characterizes most clinics. The independently adjustable headrest, backrest, and leg rest allow for precise positioning during procedures while maintaining patient comfort, while the built-in heated seat addresses the temperature regulation issues that can make lengthy dermatological treatments uncomfortable. The integrated IV pole slot and rear power outlet aren\u2019t just convenience features, they\u2019re space-saving innovations that allow compact treatment rooms to function with the efficiency of much larger facilities. What makes this design particularly brilliant is how it addresses the psychological dimension of medical treatment: by creating furniture that patients actually want to sit in rather than endure, the chair reduces treatment anxiety while maintaining all the functionality that medical professionals require. The Red Dot: Best of the Best recognition acknowledges this as more than just medical furniture, it\u2019s a complete reimagining of how clinical environments can support both patient comfort and procedural efficiency, transforming medical treatment from something patients tolerate into something approaching hospitality.  Music creation technology has traditionally forced users to choose between accessible-but-limited consumer tools or professional-but-intimidating studio equipment, leaving most people as passive consumers of music rather than active creators, despite having sophisticated musical tastes and creative instincts that never find expression. Daize attacks this artificial barrier by combining the tactile familiarity of analog music equipment with AI-powered generation capabilities, creating what amounts to a bridge between casual listening and professional music creation that doesn\u2019t require years of technical training to master. The visual language immediately communicates this hybrid approach: the white configuration resembles classic DJ equipment with its central turntable and surrounding control panels, while the bold orange variants suggest a more contemporary, modular approach to music interaction. The genius of Daize lies in its recognition that generative AI can democratize music creation only if the interface feels natural and intuitive rather than computational and abstract. The square screens that reference vinyl album covers aren\u2019t just nostalgic design choices, they\u2019re visual anchors that help users understand how AI-generated elements relate to familiar musical concepts, while the rotary controller provides the kind of tactile feedback that makes complex audio manipulation feel immediate and responsive. The modular panel system visible in the different configurations allows users to customize their creative environment based on their specific interests, whether that\u2019s sound mixing, environmental effects, or live performance applications. The foldable design transforms the device from professional music equipment to portable creative tool to decorative interior object, acknowledging that modern creative tools need to fit into diverse lifestyle contexts rather than demanding dedicated studio spaces. This Red Dot: Best of the Best winner represents more than just innovative music technology, it\u2019s a complete reimagining of how AI can enhance human creativity when properly integrated with intuitive, tactile interfaces that respect both technological capability and human instinct, suggesting a future where advanced creative tools become extensions of personal expression rather than obstacles to overcome.  Most mobility devices treat their users like passengers in their own lives, requiring constant vigilance to navigate around coffee tables and curbs that shouldn\u2019t be obstacles in the first place. The Strutt ev1 flips this dynamic entirely, introducing what they call Co-Pilot, an AI system that handles the environmental awareness so users can focus on where they want to go rather than what they need to avoid. Instead of the typical binary relationship between human and machine, this creates something closer to a partnership, where the device actively contributes to navigation decisions while the user maintains full directional control through an intuitive joystick interface. The technical foundation rests on Strutt\u2019s Smart-Wheel System, which deploys four purpose-built motors working in coordination to deliver what the company describes as \u201cprecise and predictable\u201d movement in any direction. This isn\u2019t just about power, it\u2019s about intelligent power distribution that adapts to terrain changes, inclines, and surface conditions in real-time. The breakthrough lies in how the system processes environmental data to make micro-adjustments that prevent the jarring stops and sudden direction changes that typically plague mobility devices when encountering obstacles. By combining automotive-grade technology with compact design principles, the ev1 represents a significant departure from the medical device aesthetic that has long dominated this category, positioning itself instead as a piece of smart mobility technology that happens to serve users with mobility challenges.  Braille education suffers from a geographic problem that digital learning was supposed to solve, but never quite did. While sighted children can access virtually any educational content through screens and speakers, blind children still depend on specialized teachers and tactile materials that simply aren\u2019t available in many regions, creating educational deserts that persist despite our connected world. The Enlightening Star system tackles this accessibility gap head-on by creating what amounts to a remote braille classroom, where the physical sensation of reading and writing braille can be transmitted across distances and controlled by teachers who might be hundreds of miles away. The system\u2019s genius lies in its two-pronged approach: an online platform that handles course management and progress tracking, paired with a hardware device that makes remote tactile learning actually possible. Teachers can upload standard braille materials and control the tactile display points in real-time during live sessions, maintaining the immediate feedback loop that makes braille instruction effective. Meanwhile, the hardware device features a specialized writing area that captures and analyzes children\u2019s braille writing attempts, providing feedback that would normally require a teacher\u2019s physical presence. The rounded, safety-focused design acknowledges that this isn\u2019t just educational technology, it\u2019s educational technology designed for children who navigate the world primarily through touch. By combining sophisticated remote control capabilities with child-safe tactile interfaces, the Enlightening Star represents a rare example of assistive technology that doesn\u2019t compromise on either functionality or safety, potentially transforming braille education from a location-dependent service into something as accessible as a video call.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":" EAPlants Vs ZombiesPvZReplantedTrailer  When I hit play on EA\u2019s new \u201cdeep dive\u201d trailer for the upcoming Plants vs Zombies Replanted, I didn\u2019t expect to be presented with a fake stream featuring two actors pretending to be hip and cool content creators playing the new remastered version of PopCap\u2019s beloved tower defense game. Yet that\u2019s what this new trailer is. It\u2019s so strange and cringey. Announced earlier this year, Plants vs. Zombies Replanted is a 4K remastered version of the original 2009 PvZ with some new content as well as bonus features like the co-op mode first seen in the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Think of it as the ultimate version of the popular game, which will finally be available on consoles and PC later this month. I\u2019m very excited to replay PvZ after not touching the game for many, many years. But a new trailer from EA showing off PvZ Replanted nearly made me question my excitement for this remastered classic. Released on October 14, EA\u2019s \u201cDeep Dive Trailer\u201d does indeed show off a lot of the upcoming PvZ Replanted, including a new perma-death mode and the return of all the minigames found in past ports. That\u2019s great. What\u2019s not great is that all of this information is, for some reason, delivered to us via two fake streamers playing the game on a fake stream, complete with fake chat and forced reactions. Here\u2019s the trailer: Yeah, it\u2019s pretty bad. After watching it the first time, I felt like it must have been nearly 10 minutes long, but it\u2019s not even 4 minutes. It just felt so much longer. I guess hearing a fake streamer yell out \u201cSpud Yeah!\u201d can make you lose track of time. The comments below the trailer are, predictably, not positive, with many excited about the game but unsure why EA decided to market it this way. The top-voted comment simply states: \u201c\u2018How do you do fellow kids\u2019 trailer.\u201d Yeah, teens and kids aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019ll see right through this obvious corporate-approved attempt to recreate a Twitch stream in the most sanitized way possible, say \u201cCringe,\u201d and move on. PvZ is good. Just show people how much better this version looks and some of the new features. That\u2019s all you gotta do to get people on board. The $20 price tag is also a great selling point that this trailer fails to mention. Anyway, bad, cringey trailer aside, I\u2019m still excited to play Plants vs Zombies Replanted when it arrives on consoles and PC on October 23.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"US President Donald Trump has threatened to disarm Hamas \"violently\" amid moves by the group to reassert control over the Gaza Strip, targeting what it called \"collaborators\".  Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said if Hamas failed to disarm within \"a reasonable period of time\" then \"we will disarm them\". He did not say when he expects the group to surrender its weapons. His comments came as footage circulated online showing a public execution and other displays of force by Hamas fighters in Gaza since the US-brokered ceasefire began last week. The execution - which BBC Verify geolocated to a junction in central Gaza City - follows Hamas's pledge to crush \"lawlessness\" in the Strip. Other verified clips have shown armed men wearing insignia identifying them as members of Hamas's internal security force on patrol and masked fighters firing on unarmed men. Analysts told BBC Verify that the show of force is at least partially intended to counter armed clans which have increasingly challenged the group's hold on the Strip over the past two years. Tensions between Hamas and some of the groups it is now fighting stretch back before the war. Some - like the Dughmush clan - have historically been involved in smuggling over the Strip's border with Israel, an expert told BBC Verify. Recent clashes between Dughmush and Hamas left more than 50 people dead, including 12 Hamas members. Israel has previously said it has supplied weapons to other armed groups in the Strip. One Hamas internal security unit recently pledged to \"eradicate gangs and militias\" it accused of co-operating \"with the enemy\". A clip which emerged on Monday afternoon showed Hamas fighters executing a group of eight men. BBC Verify geolocated the footage to a junction in the central Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City, which had been the focus of a major Israeli ground offensive in recent weeks but is now back under Hamas control after the Israeli military withdrawal. Fighters - some of whom were wearing body armour and Hamas headbands - could be seen in the footage lining the men up in front of a large crowd, which appeared to include at least one young child. After forcing the men to their knees, crowds could be heard shouting \"collaborator\" or \"agent\". The assembled fighters then opened fire on the bound men, who fell to the ground. Afterwards, the men fired into the air and shouted \"long live the al-Qassam Brigades\" - Hamas's military wing. Another verified video showed masked and armed fighters forcing a man to his knees in the middle of the same Zeitoun junction before shooting him in the leg. Several other gunshots also rang out, followed by screams, but the footage doesn't show whether others were attacked. In the aftermath of the footage, several armed men stand guard around the injured man, waving away onlookers who witnessed the incident. It is not clear what prompted the incident, which first emerged online on 10 October. Google image searches returned no earlier results. Palestinians who spoke to the BBC expressed fear at the public executions. \"Why are people cheering for chaos? A masked man kills another masked man without any proof, without investigation, without a court, without even a waiting period for appeal what do we call this? Resistance? No, this is lawlessness,\" a lawyer living in Gaza said. \"You can't correct one mistake with another,\" one activist living in central Gaza Strip added. \"Executions without fair trial are a crime. May God guide our people .\" Meanwhile, members of Hamas's internal security force have also been deployed across Gaza City in a show of force by the group. Two such fighters, sporting the insignia of internal security units and armed with rifles, could be seen in several images geolocated by BBC Verify stationed at a crossroads in Gaza City. Other shows of force included armed men wielding assault rifles marching through a market in the Zeitoun area followed by a small group waving a Palestinian flag. \"I think what Hamas has been trying to do is mobilise its forces, using its interior ministry forces, to assert and consolidate its control,\" Professor Fawaz Gerges, Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics, told the BBC's Today Programme. \"In the areas where it's Hamas control, Hamas will be able to destroy the various clans and gangs and looters and militias because its forces are more seasoned, more skilled, more determined,\" he added. While Hamas has long had simmering rivalries with various armed groups in the Strip, Israel's bombardment of Gaza and the loosening of Hamas's grip on power has allowed some of the clans to grow in strength, analysts say. \"The collapse of other social institutions has increased the appeal of the clan, which can serve as a social network for its members,\" Yaniv Voller, a senior lecturer in Middle East Politics at the University of Kent, told BBC Verify. \"At least some of the clans have been reported to have received weapons and other support from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), to serve as proxies against Hamas,\" he added. Some of the militias are also operating in IDF-controlled areas. By analysing videos circulating on social media, BBC Verify identified bases used by two rival groups deep inside IDF controlled territory, including one near the southern city of Rafah, and one \u200b\u200bnear the northern town of Beit Hanoun. In response to Hamas's re-emergence and the role of its security forces in policing, Trump previously said this did not fall outside the peace agreement. \"[Hamas] do want to stop the problems and they've been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters on Monday. \"You have close to 2 million people going back to buildings that have been demolished, and a lot of bad things can happen. So we want it to be \u2013 we want it to be safe.\" Prof Gerges said that the US and its allies had little choice but to allow Hamas to exhibit some show of force in Gaza if the ceasefire was to have any meaningful impact. \"Without security you cannot deliver aid. Without security you cannot really have life,\" he said. \"The Americans realise that the only force is Hamas and that's the irony.\" Additional reporting by Emma Pengelly and Ahmed Nour.   What claims do you want BBC Verify to investigate? The group's armed wing says it has returned the bodies it can reach in Gaza's ruins, but needs specialised equipment and more time to retrieve others. But the president would not be drawn on whether the CIA had been told to topple Nicolas Maduro.  Trump says the move is \"a big stop\", but there has been no confirmation so far from New Delhi. US President Donald Trump claims to have ended eight wars - is that true? The US government shutdown began after Republicans and Democrats failed to resolve a budget dispute. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"     The developer said the new Haiku outperforms its Sonnet 4 model at a third of the cost.    Anthropic released a new small model for Claude named Haiku 4.5.\u00a0 The newest Claude generative AI model, called Haiku 4.5, has the same coding ability of the company's Sonnet 4 model in a smaller, faster package, Anthropic said in a press release on Wednesday. The new model is being made available to everyone, and will be the default for free users on Claude.ai. Anthropic says Haiku 4.5 is significantly faster than Sonnet 4, but at a third of the cost. When using Claude for Chrome, an extension that gives Chrome users AI capabilities in their browser, Anthropic said Haiku 4.5 is faster and better at agentic tasks. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.\u00a0Add CNET\u00a0as a preferred Google source. Because Haiku 4.5 is a small model, it can be deployed as a sub-agent for Sonnet 4.5. So, while Sonnet 4.5 plans and organizes complex projects, small Haiku sub-agents can finish other tasks in the background. For coding tasks, Sonnet can handle the high-level thinking while Haiku deals with other tasks like refactors and migrations. For financial analysis, Sonnet can do predictive modeling while Haiku monitors data streams and tracks regulatory changes, market signals and portfolio risks. On the research side of things, Sonnet can deal with comprehensive analysis while Haiku reviews literature, gathers data and synthesizes documents from multiple sources.\u00a0 Haiku's speed also assists on the chatbot side of things, handling requests faster. \"Haiku 4.5 is the latest iteration of our smallest model, and it's built for everyone who wants the superior intelligence, the trustworthiness, and the creative partnership of Claude in a lightweight package,\" Anthropic CEO Mike Krieger said in a statement provided to CNET. Given the high expense to train and deploy AI models, companies have been looking for ways to roll out smaller, more efficient models that are still performant. An AI query consumes significantly more energy than a Google search, but it depends on the size of the AI model. A large model with over 405 billion parameters can eat up 6,706 joules of energy, enough to run a microwave for eight seconds, according to an MIT Technology Review report. A small model, however, one with eight billion parameters, may only eat up 114 joules of energy, which is like running a microwave for one-tenth of a second. A Google search can use 1,080 joules of energy. Letting smaller, more efficient models take on the load of simpler queries or background tasks can significantly save on server costs. ChatGPT-5, for example, can move between models, giving instant responses for lighter questions of leveraging more power for complex queries. Energy-saving measures are necessary as AI companies need to be able to recoup the potential trillions that'll be spent in data center investments.\u00a0","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"     PFAS, often referred to as \"forever chemicals,\" will still be allowed in cookware sold and purchased in California.    Teflon-coated pans will still be allowed in California.\u00a0 California Gov. Gavin Newsom has rejected a bill that would have banned\u00a0PFAS\u00a0in cookware in California.\u00a0 PFAS, which stands for\u00a0poly and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are manmade chemicals that have been in use in the US since the 1940s. Commonly referred to as forever chemicals, they fail to break down in the environment or body over time and have been linked to possible health effects. PFAS are found in clothing, packaging and nonstick cookware, among various other items. According to a study from the National Library of Medicine, which looked at PFAS in items that come into contact with food, the highest content of PFAS was found in microwave popcorn bags and nonstick cookware, \"probably because they reach very high temperatures and are used for long periods,\" the study states. \"Moreover, the aging kitchen utensils, intended for repeated use, should be considered when evaluating the migration of PFAS.\" In a statement explaining why he rejected the proposed bill, Newsom stated that if passed, the bill \"would result in a sizable and rapid shift in cooking products available to Californians,\" adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" it would impact \"the availability of affordable options in cooking products.\"\u00a0 Nonstick pans are usually significantly cheaper than nontoxic options. Despite this rejection, California has banned PFAS from other items in the state, including\u00a0menstruation products,\u00a0as studies into the chemicals continue.\u00a0 Nonstick cookware containing forever chemicals have been connected with an increase in certain diseases, including cancer. According to the CDC's\u00a0Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, \"epidemiological evidence suggests\" that exposure to specific types of PFAS may increase certain health effects, such as cholesterol levels, liver enzymes, kidney and testicular cancer, and more, depending on exposure and individual factors.\u00a0 \"At this time, scientists are still learning about the health effects of exposures to mixtures of different PFAS,\" the agency stated. \"Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects.\" State Sen. Benjamin Allen, the author of the proposed California bill, told The Los Angeles Times that he was disappointed in the decision.\u00a0 \"We know there are safer alternatives, [but] I understand there were strong voices on both sides on this topic,\" he told the outlet, later adding, \"I'm hopeful we can continue working on a transition away from these dangerous products which already have safer alternatives at reasonable prices available on the market.\" Scratched nonstick cookware and pans heated to above 500 degrees F are associated with higher health risks.\u00a0 Generally, nonstick cookware becomes unsafe when heated above a certain temperature or when they surface is scratched repeatedly, leading to consumption of the chemical coating.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. Asian stocks surged overnight on easing United States\u2013China geopolitical tensions, a weaker United States dollar, and renewed optimism for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indices broke their seven-session losing streak, each rebounding strongly after both had previously set a 52-week high on October 2. Market breadth was robust, with all industry sectors positive, completely reversing yesterday\u2019s declines, and trading volume rose to 134% of the one-year average. Growth stocks outperformed in both the Hong Kong and Mainland China markets. Mainland investors were rare net sellers of Hong Kong stocks via Southbound Stock Connect, selling their positions in the Hong Kong Tracker Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that had been bought on the recent dip; however, they were net buyers of several individual names. JD.com (9618 HK) climbed 2% following the announcement of a partnership with GAC Group and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd (CATL). CATL to build an electric vehicle (EV) priced between RMB 100,000 and RMB 120,000. The optics of the move were mixed, as the company\u2019s recent expansion into restaurant delivery had negatively impacted earnings per share and net income. Cloud Walk Robotics\u2019 initial public offering (IPO) shares jumped 75% in pre-market trading. Baidu (9888 HK) gained 2.73% despite analyst expectations for its third-quarter core search revenue remaining fairly pessimistic, projecting a decline of between 7% and 11%. Mainland China\u2019s equity markets had a strong session, although breadth lagged behind Hong Kong, as the energy, shipping, and air freight sectors finished lower. The country\u2019s deflationary pressures moderated in September, as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell 0.3% year-over-year (YoY), compared to August\u2019s 0.4% decline and market expectations of a 0.2% decrease. The Producer Price Index (PPI) dropped 2.3% YoY, an improvement from August\u2019s 2.9% contraction and matching expectations. CPI weakness was driven primarily by falling food prices (-4.4% YoY), though food prices rose 0.1% month-over-month (MoM). Core consumer price index (CPI), excluding food and energy, rose 1% YoY in September versus a 0.9% increase in August. It remains to be seen whether the slower rate of producer price declines reflects the impact of China\u2019s recent anti-involution campaign. Loan data released at the Mainland\u2019s close indicated September\u2019s year-to-date new loans reached RMB 14.75 trillion, up from RMB 13.46 trillion in August but slightly missed expectations, while aggregate financing rose to RMB 30.09 trillion, ahead of consensus, from August\u2019s RMB 26.56 trillion. We recently emphasized the importance of following statements from commodity executives regarding China\u2019s economic health, rather than relying on the negative bias in much of the Western media coverage of the subject. LVMH\u2019s latest results showed a recovery among China\u2019s high-end consumers: sales in Asia ex-Japan, including China, rose 2% in the third quarter, after prior declines of 11% in the first and 6% in the second quarter. Earlier in the week, my colleague Brian argued that there is a \u201cTrump put\u201d on United States\u2013China relations, anchored in the President\u2019s focus on supporting financial markets. On Tuesday, United States Trade Representative Greer confirmed that United States and Chinese officials had met, highlighted by the newswire headline: \u201cGreer: We Always Watch the Stock, Bond Markets.\u201d The note also drew attention to the largely unseen influence of the Washington, D.C., policy bureaucracy. For instance, the United States Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation informed the Dutch government in June that Nexperia\u2014the Chinese parent of Dutch semiconductor firm Wingtech\u2014had been added to the United States' sanctions list, meaning the Dutch company would be included, by extension, as of September 30. The Dutch government subsequently seized Nexperia, arguing that the move protected local jobs and prevented the company's destruction, although some may view it as an uncompensated expropriation. There are likely additional factors, as the United States Department of Commerce also played a role. This phenomenon is not isolated to the United States: Treasury Secretary Bessent recently suggested that China\u2019s issuance of rare earth export licenses was the result of bureaucratic action, not a top-down order from President Xi Jinping. The broader point is that both President Trump and President Xi have the power to halt these slow-moving, bureaucratically-driven escalations.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Eli Lilly stock (NYSE: LLY) has returned $47 billion to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks. This shareholder-centric approach has delivered solid results in 2025, with the stock posting 9% year-to-date returns, despite experiencing some volatility from its peak of $937 earlier in the year, while demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increased competition in the diabetes and obesity treatment markets.  Eli Lilly's commitment to rewarding shareholders reached new heights with the board's approval of a massive $15 billion share repurchase program in December 2024, replacing the completed $5 billion buyback and representing one of the largest capital return initiatives in pharmaceutical industry history.  The diabetes and obesity treatment leader further reinforced its shareholder-first philosophy by announcing a 15% dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, raising the quarterly dividend from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $6.00 and yielding approximately 0.74% at current levels.  Eli Lilly\u2019s exceptional financial performance has been driven by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound, with 2024 revenues reaching $45.04 billion (up 32% year-over-year) and earnings of $10.59 billion (up 102%), providing the robust cash generation that enables both aggressive share buybacks and consistent dividend growth while maintaining substantial R&D investments for pipeline advancement. These two drugs alone accounted for $11.5 billion in total sales last year, and in the first half of 2025, this figure has surged 115% y-o-y to $14.5 billion.  Let\u2019s look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines.  Interestingly, LLY stock ranks 58th in history in total shareholder returns. Why does this matter? Because dividends and buybacks represent direct returns to shareholders and reflect management\u2019s confidence in future cash generation. Many companies follow this strategy. Below is a list of the top 10 companies by total capital returned through dividends and repurchases. While that\u2019s one perspective, Trefis High Quality Portfolio considers many more factors to help reduce company-specific risk while maintaining growth exposure. For the complete list, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking. Key takeaway: Total shareholder returns as a percentage of market cap often appear inversely related to growth potential. Companies like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding faster and more predictably but have returned smaller proportions of their value to shareholders. That\u2019s the trade-off: attractive capital returns can sometimes come at the cost of growth. Keeping that in mind, let\u2019s examine Eli Lilly\u2019s fundamentals. (See Buy or Sell Eli Lilly Stock for more.) That\u2019s a solid snapshot, but a complete investment evaluation requires a broader view. That\u2019s exactly what the Trefis High Quality Portfolio delivers\u2014balancing lower risk with upside exposure. Still, Lilly isn\u2019t immune to volatility. It dropped 51% during the Global Financial Crisis and 43% in the Dot-Com bubble. Even during more recent events\u2014the 2018 correction, inflation shock, and Covid pandemic\u2014it declined between 18% and 22%. So, while fundamentals remain strong, the stock can still see notable drawdowns during market downturns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio of 30 stocks has consistently outperformed major benchmarks such as the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000. Why? Collectively, HQ stocks have offered higher returns with lower volatility\u2014a smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock might be a good candidate to ride the upside trend. Why? Because you get strong margins, a low-debt capital structure, reasonable valuation, and strong momentum. Here is some data. Although revenue growth is beneficial, this selection focuses on leveraging momentum with quality \u2014 evaluated by margins (indicative of pricing power\/strong business model) and capital structure (not excessively debt-laden). For some context, eBay operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide through an online marketplace and mobile applications.     Do these figures, however, provide a complete picture? Read Buy or Sell EBAY Stock to determine if eBay still retains an advantage that stands up under scrutiny. This is one perspective on evaluating stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio examines a broader range of factors and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential for upside.   Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is Data We determine our selections by evaluating stocks with a market cap exceeding $2 billion, high operating and cash flow margins from operations (CFO), no instances of revenue decline exceeding 15% over the past 5 years, reasonable valuations, a low-debt capital structure, and strong momentum according to our proprietary metric. Below are figures for stocks that applied this selection strategy between 12\/31\/2016 and 6\/30\/2025. But Consider The Risk eBay is not immune to significant downturns. It plummeted over 77% during the Dot-Com Bubble and nearly 75% during the Global Financial Crisis. The corrections in 2018 and inflation shock caused declines of 43% and 54%, respectively. Even the Covid crash resulted in a drop of about 32%. Indeed, eBay has robust fundamentals, but these figures illustrate its susceptibility to substantial declines when the market worsens. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns while incurring less risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment experience as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Scale AI shuttered a team of contractors in its Dallas office on Monday, as it shifts towards more technical, expert-level training, the startup confirmed to Business Insider. The cuts mark the latest shake-up since Meta took a stake in Scale AI in a $14.3 billion deal.  The team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks, such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence chatbots. That kind of work is in less demand in the fast-moving AI training industry as chatbots improve and require input from humans with skills in more niche fields, like medicine, robotics, and finance.  Based in San Francisco, Scale AI helps tech companies improve their latest chatbots by doing things like rewriting their responses. It's part of a fast-moving AI training industry. Scale AI offered the workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI. The recently laid-off workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.  \"As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,\" the email read. Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo confirmed the cuts to Business Insider. \"Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,\" Montalvo said. \"This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery.\" The Scale AI spokesperson added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programs and that the recent shifts have not impacted Scale AI's broader group of contractors that continue to work in Dallas.  xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialized AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.  The Meta deal, which was announced in June, caused some of Scale AI's longtime customers, like Google and OpenAI, to abruptly halt their work. A few weeks later, Scale AI laid off 14% of its workforce \u2014 200 employees and 500 contractors \u2014 citing overhiring and unspecified market forces in an internal email about the division. Last month, Scale AI terminated twelve members of its Red Team, a key unit tasked with probing artificial intelligence models for harm. Scale AI attributed the cuts to performance issues, but two former Red Teamers disputed this, saying their team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal. Have a tip?

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"For the 13th year running, Apple has topped Interbrand\u2019s Best Global Brands ranking, which measures companies by value, influence, and brand strength. Here are a few highlights from this year\u2019s list. Despite being a subjective ranking, Interbrand\u2019s yearly Best Global Brands report has offered interesting insights into how brand perception and market value evolve over time. It has also tracked the rise and fall of major market trends, and, unsurprisingly, this year\u2019s list leans has an AI flavor to it, as Interbrand\u2019s Global CEO Gonzalo Bruj\u00f3 also pointed out: \u201cDigitally enabled services and the rise of AI are creating winners faster than ever. Disruption is a defining force shaping global brands. Brands that are innovating across industries, building cultural relevance, and investing in long-term brand strategy are winning. Those relying on legacy strength alone are seeing challenges to their growth.\u201d In this year\u2019s ranking, Nvidia recorded the biggest jump in brand value, up 116% to $43.2 billion, climbing to 15th place. Qualcomm (39th, $20.1B), Dell (51st, $16.3B), and Shopify (99th, $6.9B) were among the 12 newcomers, while Electronic Arts, HP, LG, and WhatsApp were among the 25 brands featured in the \u201cBrands to Watch\u201d section. As it has done since 2013, Apple topped the list but saw a 4% decrease in brand valuation, down to $460.9 billion. Microsoft came in second with a 10% gain ($388.5B), followed by Amazon (+7%, $219.9B), Google (+9%, $317.1B), and Samsung (-10%, $90.5B). Interestingly, ChatGPT is mentioned three times in the report, but it hasn\u2019t made the list. Overall, Interbrand said that the added brand value of the Top 100 brands reached $3.6 trillion, representing a $150 billion increase compared to 2024.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"                 reading time 4 minutes        The U.S. electric vehicle industry is in a crisis. The Trump administration has walked back government support for the industry and found itself caught up in a trade war that is putting a strain on both EV consumers and manufacturers. In response, demand is facing a rapid slowdown, and manufacturers are increasingly pulling back. General Motors said in a filing this month that it would take a $1.6 billion hit on its quarterly earnings due to the drop in value of its EV operations. Ford CEO Jim Farley indicated that the company will pivot to focus on partial electrification instead of fully electric models. But the story differs when you look at the industry globally. Global electric vehicle sales hit a record 2.1 million in September, according to market research firm Rho Motion. That record was only partially driven by U.S. buyers rushing to get electric vehicles before the end of the electric vehicle tax credit. Also driving the record was strong sales in China, which accounted for about two-thirds of all sales worldwide. September is traditionally referred to as the golden month of auto sales in China, as carmakers tend to launch new models around this time. China has been the frontrunner of the global EV race for some time now, thanks to consistent support from Beijing in the form of subsidies and other infrastructure incentives. At this point, the country is overproducing electric vehicles and has gone full speed into exports. Exports of \u201cnew energy vehicles,\u201d which include both EVs and plug-in hybrids, surged by 100% in September, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 latest data. Earlier this month, the United Kingdom became the largest foreign market of BYD, which is not only one of China\u2019s but also the world\u2019s leading EV manufacturers. Europe, on the other hand, was also a big driver behind the global record. EV demand on the continent hit a new high in September. Europe also offers various tax benefits and incentives for its electric vehicle industry, and the European industry\u2019s sales numbers trump those in the United States. The U.S. is only bound to fall further behind the rest of the world when it comes to the EV race. Much of that is thanks to these two political developments: the end of government subsidies for the electric vehicle industry and the escalating trade war with China. The Trump administration\u2019s attack on the electric vehicle industry started on the campaign trail and was finalized with the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated the electric vehicle tax credit. The electric vehicle tax credit expired two weeks ago, delivering a much-feared sledgehammer to the EV industry as it tries to scale in the U.S. The result has been a slew of manufacturers completely disincentivized from production as the industry braces for a huge drop in demand in the coming months. Electric vehicles in the U.S. are really expensive. The tax credit was used to help address that and drive demand as it lowered the burden on buyers. China, on the other hand, is really good at making cheap EVs that still continue to outperform other models. BYD offers EV models that can charge in five minutes and start at around $29,000. The automaker also offers EV models that cost as low as less than $8,000. Tesla\u2019s most affordable models, which were released earlier this month, start at $36,990 and can supercharge in 15 minutes. The models, which are just stripped-down versions of its existing Model Y and Model 3 cars, are also still more expensive than the more premium models were without the EV tax credit. Also weighing heavily on the American EV industry is the China-U.S. trade war. China\u2019s biggest bargaining chip, and the Trump administration\u2019s top request, in the trade dispute is Beijing\u2019s hold over the global supply of rare earth minerals. Rare earth minerals are 17 elements that are crucial to many parts of the tech industry, from smart phones to PCs. They are also crucial to electric vehicle production. China mines 70% of the world\u2019s rare earth minerals, and refines about 90%. Each escalation of the trade war has put this supply at risk. China tightened export controls on 12 out of the 17 rare earth minerals last week. Foreign entities are now required to obtain a license from the Chinese government before they can export any product that contains more than 0.1% China-sourced rare earths. Beijing will also start imposing restrictions on lithium batteries, which are used in EVs. In response, Trump has threatened Beijing with 100% tariffs. For now, the trade war continues to escalate further with no end in sight. If the growing fears of an even more widespread crackdown on rare earth minerals materialize, it would be the cherry on top for an already struggling American electric vehicle market. The U.S. and Detroit led the global auto industry as it scaled massively last century, and this position only boosted global American power. This century\u2019s automotive test is electric vehicles, and the U.S. is nowhere near its previous heights in the global auto industry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the U.S. doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t transition to new energy vehicles quickly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d auto industry expert Michael Dunne of Dunne Insights told Newsweek last month. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDetroit will cede the global market and be reduced to a niche supplier of gas-powered pickup trucks and SUVs.\u201d Explore more on these topics      Share this story             Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Our power ranking of the NFL's starting passers takes into account their most recent individual performance along with their full season and team success.\u00a0 Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Let\u2019s dive into the latest pecking order:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019ll say it: Baker Mayfield has been the NFL\u2019s best quarterback so far this season. An MVP frontrunner through six weeks, Mayfield put together more heroics to lead the Bucs to a 30-19 victory over the Niners this past weekend. His spectacular 15-yard scramble on a third-and-14 early in the fourth quarter set up his 45-yard touchdown pass to Tez Johnson that helped push the game out of reach. Mayfield completed 17 of 23 passes for two scores and no interceptions with a terrific 139.0 passer rating in a game he finished without his top three wide receivers. Star rookie Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) was lost for the game in the second half, while Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula) were inactive. Not to mention, standout running back Bucky Irving (foot, shoulder) didn\u2019t play either. It didn\u2019t matter for Mayfield, who elevated those around him.\u00a0\u00a0 And before Sunday\u2019s win, the 2018 No. 1 pick had led the Bucs on four game-winning drives in the last minute this season. He\u2019s tied for third in touchdown passes (12), fourth in passing yards (1,539) and sixth in both passer rating and EPA per dropback, according to Next Gen Stats. He\u2019s playing at an absurd level this season, which is why he sits atop the QB Stock Market for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0 Mayfield played for three franchises from 2021-22 (Browns, Panthers, Rams), and now he\u2019s becoming a truly elite quarterback. It\u2019s an incredible story.\u00a0 Jared Goff has 14 touchdown passes and just two interceptions this season, but the Lions scored only 17 points on Sunday in their loss to the Chiefs.

But I can no longer justify keeping him atop these rankings, as he had been since Week 1, just because he\u2019s Josh Allen.\u00a0 He had his worst game of the season in the Bills\u2019 stunning Monday night loss to the Falcons, against whom he completed just 15 of 26 passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions. His first pick, in the final seconds of the first half, was just bad. And his second one, the result of a tipped pass, came with 51 seconds left, ending Buffalo\u2019s hopes for a comeback.\u00a0 It was Allen\u2019s first two-interception game since Week 10 of last season. His 72.6 passer rating was also his lowest in a game since Week 16 of 2024. The three-time Pro Bowler has five turnovers in the past three games, including four interceptions. And his Bills, who\u2019ve lost two straight, are on fraud alert \u2014 their 4-0 start came against teams that are now a combined 3-21 (Ravens, Jets, Dolphins, Saints). They're 0-2 against teams with a winning record (Falcons, Patriots).\u00a0 Allen isn\u2019t getting the help he needs around him. He\u2019s also playing poorly right now. Both things can be true. Josh Allen reacts after losing to the Falcons 24-14 on Monday night. (Photo by Rich von Biberstein\/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)  For a moment, the Giants version of Daniel Jones crept back in.\u00a0 In the second quarter of the Colts' victory over Arizona on Sunday, he essentially threw the ball right to Cardinals linebacker Mack Wilson Sr., who was sitting in front of the QB's intended target, tight end Mo Alie-Cox. It marked just Jones' third turnover of the season.\u00a0 Otherwise, though, he was terrific once again, leading a Colts offense that still can\u2019t be stopped. The former No. 6 pick completed 73.3% of his passes for 212 yards and three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing). He led Indianapolis to three straight scoring drives to start the second half, including back-to-back touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The Colts (5-1) didn\u2019t punt in the final two quarters. Six games into the season,\u00a0this Daniel Jones remains very real. At age 41, Aaron Rodgers may not be what he once was, but the four-time NFL MVP is showing that he still has skills with a football in his hands. (Photo by Mark Alberti\/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)  Herbert reminded the NFL on Sunday that he\u2019s one of the most gifted quarterbacks on the planet.\u00a0 In the final minute, he broke what appeared to be a sure sack from the Dolphins\u2019 Jaelan Phillips\u00a0easily, and then fired a pass to Ladd McConkey, who had the 42-yard catch and run to set up the Chargers\u2019 game-winning field goal. Herbert\u2019s pocket magic highlighted his best performance in weeks \u2014 a 76.3% completion rate for 264 yards and two touchdowns with no turnovers and a 112.2 passer rating to guide L.A. to its fourth victory of the season. And Herbert didn\u2019t have a starting receiver (Quentin Johnston) and both his offensive tackles (Joe Alt, Trey Pipikins III) in the game.\u00a0 No, the consistency hasn\u2019t been there for Herbert this season. But shortcomings and injuries around him haven\u2019t helped. He\u2019s fully capable of playing at the level he did against the Dolphins on a more regular basis. After a tough rookie year, Caleb Williams is showing progress under first-year Bears head coach Ben Johnson. (Photo by Michael Owens\/Getty Images)  Michael Penix Jr. delivered a big-time performance in his Monday Night Football debut.\u00a0 While his superstar teammate, running back Bijan Robinson, stole the show with 238 total yards from scrimmage, the second-year quarterback showed great composure and played clean football against one of the AFC\u2019s elite. The former No. 8 pick threw for 250 yards and a touchdown with no turnovers against the Bills. He engineered a 14-play, five-minute field goal drive down the stretch of the fourth quarter that left Buffalo facing a 10-point deficit with less than two minutes remaining and no timeouts. To add to Penix\u2019s feat, he didn\u2019t have left tackle Jake Matthews for most of the game.\u00a0 This is what Penix, who\u2019s already had plenty of ups and downs in his eight career starts, can be on a more consistent basis. He has surrounding weapons that would make other quarterbacks jealous. If he can keep Atlanta on schedule offensively, the production should be there. In Week 6, rookie Jaxson Dart delivered a second upset win for the Giants, this time against the defending-champion Eagles. (Photo by Cooper Neill\/Getty Images)  Tua Tagovailoa isn\u2019t the kind of quarterback who can elevate or transcend an offense that has shortcomings. He needs the right support and talent around him. And that\u2019s OK.\u00a0 It's just that his flaws get magnified on a team mired in dysfunction (like his Dolphins)\u00a0while\u00a0he\u2019s not playing well.\u00a0 Tagovailoa's three interceptions on Sunday marked his second three-turnover game of the season. One of them wasn\u2019t his fault \u2014 on the Dolphins\u2019 second play from scrimmage, Jaylen Waddle bobbled a pass that was secured by the Chargers. But his sloppy play overall overshadowed the fact that he helped Miami overcome a 10-point, fourth-quarter deficit to have a chance down the stretch.\u00a0 Tagovailoa has had some good moments this season, but it\u2019s hard to see the trajectory of his 2025 campaign becoming positive with Mike McDaniel on the hot seat and persistent accountability issues in-house.\u00a0 Joe Flacco played well against the Packers despite joining the Bengals just days earlier from Cleveland. (Photo by Michael Reaves\/Getty Images)  Fields entered the season with a chance to be the Jets\u2019 long-term starting quarterback, but that opportunity is quickly dwindling.\u00a0 He\u2019s firmly on the \"potential to be benched\" watch after his disastrous performance in London against the Broncos, who sacked him nine times for a loss of 55 yards. He often held the ball too long, slow to make decisions. He completed just 9 of 17 passes for 45 yards, leading a New York offense that produced a net of minus-10 passing yards, the fewest in franchise history.\u00a0 Fields is effective with his legs and has had some efficient passing performances this season, but he\u2019s not giving the Jets enough through the air \u2014 he has just four touchdown passes in five games \u2014 and he\u2019s not processing in the pocket quickly enough.\u00a0 Ben Arthur is an NFL reporter for FOX Sports.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) is a digital infrastructure company that designs, constructs, and operates AI-first data centers and high-performance computing (HPC) facilities. The stock has increased by nearly 20% over the past five trading days, maintaining an approximate gain of 330% year-to-date. This recent surge follows the company reporting robust first-quarter results, propelled by the demand for artificial intelligence data centers, with sales climbing roughly 84% year-over-year to $64.2 million. While Applied Digital\u2019s operations are central to the ongoing AI infrastructure boom, boasting a valuation close to $10 billion and the stock trading at an elevated 33x forward revenue, investors are now questioning whether the rally can continue. APLD stock has risen significantly recently, and there is considerable risk in depending on a single stock. However, a broader, diversified strategy offers substantial value. If you desire upside potential with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) \u2013 HQ has outperformed its benchmark \u2013 a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, achieving returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Risk management is critical \u2013 consider, what could long-term portfolio performance look like if you blended 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. In contrast to legacy data centers being modified for AI workloads, Applied constructs its campuses from the ground up to meet the extreme power density, cooling, and scalability requirements of accelerated computing \u2014 from AI training and inference to machine learning and blockchain. The company's facilities include liquid cooling, advanced power systems, and renewable energy integration, ensuring efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. Data centers are strategically positioned for access to low-cost, clean energy as well as natural cooling. The company's significant advantage is its purpose-built design. While most traditional colocation and cloud providers adapt existing data centers, Applied\u2019s infrastructure is specifically engineered for accelerated compute \u2013 delivering superior power efficiency, cooling capabilities, and scalability. Their partnership with ABB on medium-voltage power systems further enhances energy efficiency and operational reliability. The key highlight is the upcoming Polaris Forge 2 campus in North Dakota, which is a $3 billion project expected to accommodate 280 megawatts of capacity. Work on the project commenced in September 2025, and full operations are anticipated to start in early 2027. The largest tech corporations, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, are expected to invest over $380 billion in AI-related capital expenditures in 2025, as they rush to expand computing capacity for artificial intelligence workloads. This investment boom necessitates physical infrastructure \u2013 and Applied Digital is likely well-positioned to gain market share. Unlike traditional colocation providers, Applied Digital builds, owns, and operates purpose-built AI and high-performance computing (HPC) data center campuses, specifically designed for accelerated workloads. Instead of modifying pre-existing facilities, the company constructs its campuses from scratch and then leases capacity (measured in megawatts of critical IT load) on long-term agreements to AI hyperscalers and large enterprises. A prominent example of this approach is its partnership with CoreWeave, a leading AI cloud provider. In June, Applied secured a $7 billion lease agreement with CoreWeave, which it expanded last quarter by an additional 150 megawatts at the Polaris Forge 1 campus in North Dakota. This expansion raised the expected contracted lease revenue to approximately $11 billion, locking in predictable, multi-year income connected to the AI expansion. Beyond leasing, Applied is enhancing its service layer through the Applied Digital Cloud, providing GPU-as-a-Service to enterprises that require access to advanced computing power without managing their own infrastructure. In collaboration with Nvidia and Supermicro, the company deploys state-of-the-art GPU servers optimized for AI and HPC workloads. related: Nvidia Stock To $350? Although Applied's valuation is high, the company is expected to experience rapid growth as its new data centers become operational. See: APLD Valuation Ratios The consensus indicates approximately 40% revenue growth for 2026 and around 80% growth for 2027. As AI workloads increase exponentially, the demand for data centers tailored for GPU compute is surging, which could enhance profitability in the long term. The company\u2019s multi-gigawatt capacity pipeline and committed anchor customers may position it as a primary beneficiary of this long-term trend. Nonetheless, risks are present. Applied is highly capital-intensive, with billions invested in new campus constructions, making the company vulnerable to execution delays or cost overruns. Its valuation is already elevated, leaving limited room for errors. Furthermore, the market for AI data center services is becoming more competitive, with traditional hyperscalers and cloud providers expanding their own capacities, which may pressure margins or slow customer acquisition. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all 3 \u2013 S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a steadier performance, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. General Motors (NYSE:GM) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. Consensus predictions estimate earnings of $2.31 per share with revenues reaching $45.2 billion. GM has already disclosed its U.S. delivery figures for the quarter, which show that vehicle sales increased by 8% year-over-year, fueled by ongoing strength in both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles. Although the company\u2019s crossovers and SUVs hit a new high in Q3, led by models like the GMC Terrain, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Traverse, and Buick Envista, EV sales were boosted as buyers attempted to capitalize on the $7,500 federal tax credit that lapsed at the end of September. The company boasts a current market capitalization of $54 billion. Revenue for the past twelve months was $188 billion, and it was operationally profitable, reporting $11 billion in operating profits and a net income of $4.8 billion. While much will hinge on how outcomes compare to consensus and expectations, recognizing historical trends could enhance your chances as an event-driven trader. There are two methods to achieve this: comprehend the historical probabilities and position yourself before the earnings announcement, or examine the relationship between immediate and medium-term returns following earnings and adjust your position after the earnings are revealed. That being said, if you are looking for potential gains with less volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative \u2013 it has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 105% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for recorded 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are compiled along with the statistics in the table below. A comparatively lower-risk approach (though ineffective if the correlation is weak) is to evaluate the correlation between short-term and medium-term post-earnings returns, identify a pair exhibiting the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader may take a \u201clong\u201d position for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data derived from a 5-year and a more recent 3-year history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the connection between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns. Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the stock\u2019s reaction following earnings. In fact, the market anticipation may begin even before the earnings announcement is made. Here is some historical information regarding the post-earnings performance of General Motors stock in comparison to the performance of peers that reported earnings just before General Motors. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one-day (1D) returns.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"  By Luke Bouma on in  In a seismic shift for the television industry, TiVo Corporation has quietly pulled the plug on its storied digital video recorder line, effectively ending an era that redefined how consumers interacted with broadcast content. As of early October 2025, the company\u2019s official website has scrubbed all references to its hardware DVR products, including the once-revered TiVo Edge models designed for cable subscribers and over-the-air antenna users. Visitors searching for these devices now encounter a streamlined catalog that omits any mention of physical recording hardware, signaling a complete withdrawal from the retail DVR market. This move culminates decades of gradual decline for TiVo\u2019s hardware ambitions, which peaked in the early 2000s when the brand became synonymous with effortless time-shifting of television programming. Launched in 1999, TiVo\u2019s DVRs introduced features like one-touch recording, commercial skipping, and intuitive search capabilities that made traditional TV schedules feel obsolete. At its zenith, the company boasted millions of subscribers, forcing cable providers and networks to adapt to empowered viewers who could pause live broadcasts or binge-watch at will. The TiVo Edge, introduced in 2021 as a hybrid device supporting both cable cards and streaming, represented the final evolution of this hardware legacy, blending OTA tuners with 4K support and expanded storage options. Yet, even as it garnered praise for superior interface design and reliability, sales dwindled amid the cord-cutting revolution. The catalyst for this pivot appears rooted in broader market dynamics. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube TV have eroded demand for standalone DVRs by offering cloud-based unlimited storage and on-demand libraries, often at lower costs without the need for bulky set-top boxes. Cable companies, facing their own subscriber losses, have increasingly pushed proprietary cloud DVRs that lock users into ecosystem-specific rentals, sidelining third-party options like TiVo. Regulatory changes, including the phased-out support for CableCARD technology\u2014essential for TiVo\u2019s cable compatibility\u2014further squeezed the viability of consumer hardware. Analysts have long predicted this trajectory, noting that TiVo\u2019s retail DVR shipments had plummeted by over 80 percent since 2019, as consumers opted for smart TVs with built-in apps or affordable streaming sticks from Roku and Amazon. With DVRs consigned to history, TiVo is redirecting its energies toward software-driven ecosystems that align with modern viewing habits. The company is doubling down on its TiVo Operating System (OS), a customizable platform now powering smart TVs from select manufacturers. This OS integrates live linear TV, streaming apps, and personalized recommendations into a unified interface, aiming to recapture the \u201cTiVo magic\u201d without the hardware hassle. Partnerships with TV brands are expanding, with recent integrations in mid-range models from Hisense and TCL, where the OS enhances voice search, universal remote control, and ad-skipping for on-demand content. Early adopters report smoother navigation across fragmented services, positioning TiVo as a behind-the-scenes orchestrator in the smart home entertainment space. Equally ambitious is TiVo\u2019s foray into automotive entertainment through AutoStage, a video streaming service tailored for in-vehicle infotainment systems. Launched in beta earlier this year, AutoStage leverages TiVo\u2019s content discovery algorithms to deliver family-friendly playlists, podcasts, and short-form videos optimized for backseat passengers. Integrated with systems from Ford and Volkswagen, it supports offline downloads for road trips and parental controls to curate age-appropriate feeds. This automotive pivot taps into the growing connected-car market, projected to exceed 300 million vehicles by 2030, where downtime during commutes presents untapped viewing opportunities. By focusing on lightweight, cloud-synced software, TiVo avoids the manufacturing pitfalls that plagued its DVR days, instead licensing AutoStage to automakers for recurring royalties. The implications for loyalists are bittersweet. Longtime subscribers, many of whom invested in lifetime service plans for their TiVo boxes, face uncertainty about ongoing support. Enthusiast communities online buzz with alternatives, from DIY OTA setups using Raspberry Pi devices to hybrid solutions pairing HDHomeRun tuners with Plex servers. For cord-cutters, the shift underscores a broader industry consolidation, where pure hardware plays give way to agile software layers. Cord Cutters News has reached out to TiVo\u2019s public relations team for clarification on the DVR delisting and future roadmap details but has not received a response as of press time. Industry watchers speculate that this silence masks internal restructuring, possibly ahead of further acquisitions in the streaming aggregation space. As TiVo evolves from a box-maker to a platform provider, it leaves behind a hardware icon that not only changed television but also inspired a generation of innovators. Whether AutoStage and the TiVo OS can reignite the spark remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the pause button on DVRs has been pressed for good.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"The Financial Times\u2019 lead story is Top US financiers sound alarm on lending standards. As we\u2019ll explain, this piece, which takes the tone \u201cMistakes were made but we don\u2019t see catastrophic outcomes in store,\u201d follows a series of warnings about US equity market risks.  Yours truly does not give financial advice and does not like doing something that might be mistaken for market prognosticating. However, the evidence is strong that many markets are priced so that the risk\/return tradeoff of a long position looks awfully dubious.  But the current situation is vastly more difficult to evaluate than the runup to the 2008 crisis. There, the exposures were in risky US mortgage loans and related derivatives. The information on the underlying loans was high; for instance, yours truly picked apart a granular assessment by CoreLogic of subprime mortgage resets which claimed nothing terrible would occur.1 Our reworking suggested the reverse, which proved to be correct.  Not only do those who want to make sense of what is going now not only lack that level of transparency, but in addition many more financial asset types are implicated, and there are also far more international factors to consider. For instance, we pointed out that in 1987, experts were fixated on the Japanese real estate and stock market bubbles and did not have a US crash on their bingo cards. The fundamentals in Europe are terrible and getting worse, yet the euro and European stock markets are peppy, apparently due to undue optimism that military Keynisianism will deliver happy economic outcomes\u2026.even as trying to implement those priorities has led to the lack of a government in France and stunningly low approval ratings for national leaders in Germany, the UK, and Italy.  An additional impediment to diagnosis now compared to the pre-Lehman period is the lack of an econoblogosphere. There, an active community, including Tanta at Calculated Risk, Ed Harrison,Felix Salmon, Barry Ritholtz,  Nouriel Roubini, Paul Krugman, \u201cIndependent Accountant,\u201d Steve Waldman and many others posted about what we were seeing and debated what it meant. There\u2019s no information sharing\/sanity checking community now.  Just like some key points of the seemingly very well covered 1987 crisis actually not being well understood, that it true of some not-distant debt implosions too. The savings and loan crisis masked a second meltdown in leveraged buyouts. One colleague, in charge of workouts at GE, one of the bigger US lenders (the monster suckers had been foreign banks) got two conference rooms for his labors. One he called Triage, the other, Don Quixote. That secondary downdraft increased damage to banks, leading Greenspan to engineer a very steep yield curve so as to aid them in rebuilding their balance sheets.  But the bigger point of these seeming digressions is that historical analogies may miss key points, again even before getting to how many plates there are in the air now: the AI\/tech bubble (which also implicates junk lending to AI players), the not-well-understood risks in the private debt market, the extra layer of leverage in private equity thanks to lending against the funds themselves via \u201csubscription lines of credit,\u201d  political fractures in most Western states, economic wobbles that may spill into markets from Europe, China (which is undergoing serious deflationary pressures), and Trump kinetic and trade war mongering. Not a pretty picture! Despite how unusual it is for financial firm leaders to issue what sure look like statements against interest, which could be read as a signal that bad outcomes are nigh, the prototypical pattern for a bull market is for the mania to persist until as the wags put it, the last bear has thrown in the towel. We pointed out to readers that despite the dot-com bubble looking frothy from at least Greenspan\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d remark of late 1996, the even more richly priced market in 2000 has a final three months blowout (see the move from 4,000 to 5,000 and even the speed of the increase from 3,000). From Stocks to Trade:  So remembering that it is not over until the fat lady sings, let\u2019s first turn to the fresh financial top brass warnings in the Financial Times about debt: Top US financiers have warned of an erosion in lending standards after credit markets were shaken by the collapse of First Brands Group and Tricolor Holdings. Apollo Global Management chief executive Marc Rowan said the unravelling of the two businesses followed years in which lenders had sought out riskier borrowers\u2026. Last month\u2019s failure of First Brands and subprime auto lender Tricolor has reverberated across credit markets and left investors such as Blackstone and PGIM, as well as major banks including Jefferies, nursing heavy losses. It has also prompted further scrutiny of the private capital industry and the lack of transparency around borrowers, which tend to be highly levered with debt. \u201cIn some of these more levered credits, there\u2019s been a willingness to cut corners,\u201d Rowan told the Financial Times Private Capital Summit in London. Both Rowan and Blackstone president Jonathan Gray pointed the finger at banks for having amassed exposure to First Brands and Tricolor, but said the collapses were not signs of a systemic issue. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is both of those were bank-led processes,\u201d Gray told the same FT conference, rejecting \u201c100 per cent\u201d the \u201cidea that this was a canary in the coal mine\u201d or a systemic problem\u2026. Banks and private capital firms have been at odds in recent years as businesses have increasingly turned to private credit for their borrowing needs. Traditional lenders have labelled the shift regulatory arbitrage and complained that non-bank financial institutions are too lightly regulated.\u00a0 But First Brands and Tricolor have exposed how both sides are intertwined through complex financial structures that can obfuscate who holds the underwriting risk, especially as bank lenders aim to maintain their market share.\u00a0 JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon echoed some of the concerns on Tuesday as the bank reported strong earnings that were marred by a $170mn hit from Tricolor\u2019s collapse.\u00a0 \u201cMy antenna goes up when things like that happen. I probably shouldn\u2019t say this but when you see one cockroach there are probably more,\u201d he said. \u201cThere clearly was, in my opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t improve our procedures,\u201d he added, acknowledging that the Tricolor exposure \u201cwas not our finest moment\u201d. Again, yours truly is old-fashioned. First Brands was engaged in what is called factoring, as in getting loans against receivables. That is a staple of the garment industry. I would regard that in an established being a sign of either a desire to achieve a high level of leverage or distress, meaning heightened scrutiny was warranted, But First Brands had the good fortune to go on its borrowing and as Dimon alludes, fraud spree when lending standards were light and \u201ccov lite\u201d as in deals with lower-than-normal lender protections, were the norm.  It appears that First Brands double-pledged collateral, here its receivables. That\u2019s a crime. For instance, many years ago, Ralph Esmirian, a highly respected figure in New York\u2019s diamond industry, sold collateral he had used to get loans and also double pledged collateral after buying the storied jewelry retailer Fred Leighton. Esmirian was sentenced to six years in Federal prison. See this section of a Wall Street Journal account, Behind the Collapse of an Auto-Parts Giant: a $2 Billion Hole and a Mysterious CEO:  [Patrick] James\u2019s company, First Brands Group, has filed for bankruptcy, acknowledging that more than $2 billion is unaccounted for. Newly appointed directors are probing irregularities in the company\u2019s financing arrangements, and the Justice Department has opened an inquiry, according to people familiar with the matter. First Brands, of which James is chief executive officer and sole equity owner, borrowed more than $10 billion from some big names despite a history of lawsuits from business partners who had alleged that James made misrepresentations in his convoluted financing arrangements. Major banks including UBS Group and Jefferies Financial Group are exposed. Unbeknown to most, the company raised billions through off-balance-sheet financing, especially through a form of borrowing against money it is owed by customers such as AutoZone\u2026.

Unbeknown to most, the company raised billions through off-balance-sheet financing, especially through a form of borrowing against money it is owed by customers such as AutoZone. In theory, Jeffries, which is the most exposed, to the tune of $715 million Point Bonita fund, could take the entire loss. But there likely will be, as occurred during the financial crisis,2 demands from investors who participated in the fund, for Jeffries to make them whole. That would entail an entirely different level of damage.  Now to the stock market alerts, again courtesy the pink paper: The leaders of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citi warned investors that investor exuberance risked driving a recent-run up in financial markets into bubble territory. Goldman chief executive David Solomon said: \u201cThere is no question that there\u2019s a fair amount of investor exuberance at the moment, with US equity markets consistently hitting record highs over the last several months.\u201d \u201cMuch of this has been fuelled by a tremendous amount of investment in [artificial intelligence] infrastructure, which has driven significant capital formation. But as students of history, we know that following periods of broad-based excitement around new technologies, there will ultimately be a divergence where some ventures thrive and others falter.\u201d JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon said: \u201cWe have a lot of assets out there which look like they\u2019re entering bubble territory. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have 20 per cent to go. It\u2019s just one more cause of concern.\u201d Citi CEO Jane Fraser said the global economy has \u201cproved more resilient than many anticipated\u201d, thanks in part to investments in AI. \u201cThat said, there are pockets of valuation frothiness in the market so I hope discipline remains,\u201d she said. And the related debt exposure is not trivial. From Bloomberg on October 7: The amount of debt tied to artificial intelligence has ballooned to $1.2 trillion, making it the largest segment in the investment-grade market, according to JPMorgan\u2026 AI companies now make up 14% of the high-grade market from 11.5% in 2020, surpassing US banks, the largest sector on the JPMorgan US Liquid Index (JULI) index at 11.7%, JPMorgan analysts including Nathaniel Rosenbaum and Erica Spear wrote\u2026 The analysts identified 75 companies across tech, utilities and capital goods sectors that are closely tied to AI, including Oracle Corp., Apple Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Many of these firms are prolific debt issuers and in the case of tech, they are cash rich with very low net debt. The cohort trades at 74 bps, 10 bps tighter than the broader JULI index, they said Keep in mind that investment grade equals, or is supposed to equal, pretty secure. Yours truly has also read mentions of AI-related junk debt but has yet to see any aggregate estimate.  But even if you consider stock market froth alone, this bubble is as bad and even by some measures worse than the dot-com affair. And we aren\u2019t alone in thinking things could get even more frenzied. Hoisted from comments: FWIW Mark Spitznagel of Universa Investments [engages in Nassim Nicholas Taleb style hedging and has Taleb as an advisor] is calling for a blow off top and then a like 80% crash in the stock market and thinks we are currently in the middle of that rally. IIRC he said we, \u201ccould see\u201d SPX around 8000 before the massive crash, so maybe 20% higher from here- obviously predicting exact numbers is a fool\u2019s errand but still\u2026 so if that is what comes to pass then getting in now could be lucrative short term but potentially devastating if you don\u2019t get out in time, so pretty high risk\u2026. I think Spitznagel compared what is happening right now to the beginning of 1929, euphoric high ahead, then massive crash. Good luck man, probably don\u2019t let FOMO lizard brain overtake rational brain and make you put all your chips on the table at a time of irrational euphoria though, always be in a position where your gonna have $ to buy stuff when its cheap. I believe Spitznagel thinks there are lagging effects from the Fed raising rates so quickly and for so long that are going to be the catalyst that pops the bubble.  Even if the bubble pops at more or less where we are, the knock-on real economy effect would be considerable: \u26a0\ufe0fThis is truly INSANE: US households now own a RECORD 52% of their financial assets in equities. This share has more than DOUBLED since the Great Financial Crisis and surpassed the 2000 Dot-Com Bubble by ~5 points.

So that group battening down on spending would have an even bigger effect than normal times.  We have been mentioning deflation for some time, since it is clear China is experiencing it and is to some degree already exporting it. Its domestic real estate prices are still falling. The government has admitted it has way too much capacity in large, critical sectors, above all electric vehicles, leading to what was once called ruinous price competition. It\u2019s in the process of trying to rationalize them, but a similar campaign in the mid-teens took years to resolve the problem. And it is over my pay grade, but experts say that the current overcapacity will be harder to remedy. China at least currently ramping up exports to Southeast Asia is a sign of weakness, not strength. Some of it is intended re-export to the US; some of it is channel stuffing. We are already in borderline deflation here (signs of pay rates for casual labor falling; no inflation; official forecasts only for 0.5% to 1.0%). Aside from the deflationary effect of a big stock market crash, another vector is tariffs. I don\u2019t know Lacy Hunt but his reasoning is persuasive. He contends that the initial effect of tariffs will be to increase inflation, even as businesses also try to absorb some of the costs (given that profit share of GDP has been at record highs in recent years, there is some room for bigger businesses to eat the tariff expenses). But the second set of effects, as happened due to Smoot-Hawley, is that consumers and businesses cut spending, and that the effect of the reduction in the deficit is to reduce capital inflows, which has an additional deflationary effect. Hunt argues central banks wrong-footed what to do then and are likely to do so again: \"The only other time this ever happened was between 1929 & 1930\" Lacy Hunt sees a deflationary debt spiral unfolding now caused by tariffs & lack of liquidity in international markets.

From the March 2007 post, quoting the Wall Street Journal: [Author] Christopher Cagan, director of research at the real-estate-information concern [CoreLogic] based in Santa Ana, Calif., said those foreclosures are likely to occur over six to seven years and won\u2019t be enough to damage the national economy. 2  This occurred with the sales of credit card receivables, which were by their explicit terms non-recourse to the seller.

Maybe the Mag 7 will do for the federal reserve and treasury this time. My dad started in penny stocks in Denver in the mid 50\u2019s, and went west to be involved in the Pacific Stock Exchange action and ended up having an apartment in Manhattan in the 60\u2019s and flew back and forth to the Big Apple for bigger fish @ the NYSE. His world revolved around the market, and as luck would have it, he and my mom were in Hong Kong when the 1987 market crash transpired, and it was a vastly different world a couple of generations ago, this isn\u2019t my father\u2019s market crash, you see. He called me up in a panic, and frankly I never cared much for the stock biz, not my bag. He could\u2019ve punched my ticket to be like him, but apathy reigned-I had smaller round things to chase. I\u2019m 25 and of course i\u2019m doing all I can to find out what\u2019s going on-as he\u2019s rather completely in the dark, and what do I have aside from a few talking heads on radio or tv, or if I can wait a day later, the LA Times, or if a week is ok, Time magazine. I know nothing-like everybody else. He can\u2019t press a button on a QWERTY to sell, I can\u2019t find out what happened a minute ago on Drudge, it\u2019s a speeded up world now and shit is gonna happen in heartbeat when the deal goes down. The problem is pervasive and systemic.  The looting and pillaging has been going on for so long that the financial system -needs- the kind of loosey-goosey supervision that allows for sketchy activity to fester in the growing shadows in our public marketplace. Frankly, any kind of corrective efforts risks tumbling the house of cards.  Which would suck for everyone, but would serve to allow some sunlight in to start disinfecting things.  Which should have happened back in 2008, when the triggered cross-defaults would have nuked a vast swath of the financial-industrial complex, but would also have allowed for a re-direction of that malinvestment back into value-building (as opposed to value-extracting) activities. In a sense, a stock bubble and crash can be seen as a determined wealth extraction effort. What is AI for?  These holdings are concentrated in wealthier households, natch, which as we have chronicled for the past 2 years plus have been the main driver of what passes for growth in the US. I think AI is a means of pulling the accumulated wealth out of these households and the entire financial sector. It is then spent on the data centre supply chain, energy inputs, data science offshoots etc etc. One final heave to strip mine the only \u201cwealth\u201d left in the US, then throw up your hands and say it was all so complicated after.

As the smoke clears around First Brands, it appears that Jeffries $715M was mostly hedged to an insurance company (whose name I don\u2019t recall).  There may well be more insurance companies who come up the ultimate bag-holders like AIG in 2007.  Recall that PE and hedgies have become heavily invested in insurance companies.  They may finally be out of luck with their bogus co-co\u2019s and payment-in-kind.  It could get ugly very quickly.  And if serious fraud is involved, nobody will want to pay anybody\u2026except, of course, the Fed will pay all the golfers. Thanks for mentioning debt-deflation.  While all the froth is on the surface, debt deflation remains the powerful unseen current.  It will sweep us all along if the 10% of the US population that is currently doing 50% of the spending reverses the flow.

I\u2019m sure Macron will have traded the patents already( a la alstom), with a robocop style 4th directive. thank you Yves. Fpr Yves, or any other enlightened financial services professional, I have a question.  I am a lawyer, but not in financial services; however, I did at one time aim to do commercial work, and undertook the required secured transactions class. IIRC, a good lender would have completed a security filing for the factoring, which would have provided notice and prevented fraud. Was I lead astray back in law school? Or do these big banks just not bother with such formalities these days? Not really my area but: 1. Factored receivables OUGHT to have a UCC filing 2. However, as indicated, cov-lite deals became common\u2026.suggesting that that important step might not have been observed 3. The fact that some collateral does seem to have been double pledged suggests no UCC filing OR fraud. One of my lawyers told me of a case where the collateral claim was voided due to the discrepancy of a mere period in a name of an entity referenced in a UCC filing v. the entity\u2019s legal name.  So perhaps someone did a clever like that? thank you! To me, this is just a great example of how the masters of the universe can\u2019t even meet their own standards. \u201cX\u201d for me, but not for thee. Or maybe that don\u2019t even understand what they\u2019re doing at all.  I\u2019m a low level accountant and my company recently had a vendor of ours give us new remittance advice, and it was for what sounded to me like a factoring company.  When I called to confirm the new bank info, they explicitly told me that yes, they were using factoring now.  I then told our legal department and some upper management to make sure we had some secondary sourcing just in case, but first I had to explain to them what factoring was and why it was a sign that a company may be in dire straights.   I should have gotten one of those MBAs that upper management has and cashed in, since clearly the standards can\u2019t be all that rigorous. MBA is Morals By Auction, I doubt you would have made it. This was my bailiwick in the leveraged 90s; things haven\u2019t changed much. If you really want to perfect your security interest in receivables, you use a lockbox arrangement where customers send their checks to a specific p.o. box or bank account that is not under control of the borrower. Once cash gets to the borrower\u2019s bank account, it\u2019s virtually impossible to separate out from the other assets of the borrower, so a UCC-1 does little good. I\u2019d be almost certain that nothing of the kind was done. thats pretty wild,lol. i once had a ticket in another state that i ignored\u2026got the summons, etc a year later, but they had totally mangled the spelling of my one of a kind name, so i have been ignoring it ever since(\u201cwell, i dont know who that is\u2026\u201d). almost 40 years ago. Small correction: I believe that Tanta commented mostly at Calculated Risk, not at Angry Bear. CR still shows today a picture of her in memoriam years after she passed away. I visited NC for the first time about 20 years ago because Tanta had very good commentaries about NC. That\u2019s how I found out about NC as well! Correct!   You beat me to it. Gah, huge bad! Fixed. \u201cBut the current situation is vastly more difficult to evaluate\u2026\u201d \u201cAn additional impediment\u2026is the lack of an econoblogsphere\u2026no information sharing\/sanity checking community now.\u201d \u201cHistorical analogies may miss key points\u2026\u201d Totally agree. I don\u2019t know if anyone mentioned but there is a big difference between the Dot-Com era and this bubble and that is the Government budget deficit. Back then we were technically in a surplus (the famous \u201cClinton Surplus\u201d) which, according to some commentators especially on the MMT side, triggered the bursting of that bubble where currently we run at 6% or more AFAIK\u2026.that is a lot of money sloshing around looking for a place to go\u2026 aye thats what was in me head while reading about all this(and not just here, altho Yves is the best at this): is there the wherewithal to do a giant bailout these days? the legitimacy? or would even the attempt to make the golfers whole just further destroy everything? Those large deficits in ordinary times, go straight into corporate profits, check out the Kalecki Profit Equation. Just look at the charts, the rise in hyper-profits started at the same time as these not really needed deficits. Just more plundering of the public purse. The corps won\u2019t want to give up this gravy train and generate profits the hard way again now. Get used to them. At the start of Covid M2 was $15.5 trillion, now it is $22.1 trillion.  Peak after Covid recession is now. Lots of liquidity. Fed balance sheet, $4.2 trillion Feb 2020.  Peak $8.95 trillion Apr 2022.  Today $6.6 trillion. Not much tightening in 42 months.  Less than 60 billion a month.  Half the covid QE. Do the bankers ever wonder if the ROI they use to underwrite is equal to the note rate? My brother died in May 2023.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 91.7% change in Palantir Technologies (PLTR) stock from 4\/17\/2025 to 10\/14\/2025 was mainly influenced by a 37.5% change in the company's Net Income Margin (%). This narrative goes beyond mere numbers, but first, let's analyze the stock price movement and its contributing factors. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is substantial value in a broader diversified strategy like the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend beyond just equities. Is a portfolio composed of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto, in addition to equities and bonds, likely to yield better returns over the next 1-3 years while providing superior protection if the markets drop by 20%? We have analyzed the data. Returning to the \"change\": The variation in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins tell a story related to business performance and investor sentiment. Below, we have highlighted key developments that affected the stock price movement for PLTR stock. To provide a quick background: PLTR offers software platforms that assist the intelligence community in discovering hidden data patterns and supporting counterterrorism investigations and operations through seamless collaboration between analysts and operators. Opinion: We currently find PLTR stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Dive into the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell PLTR Stock to understand what informs our present assessment. Risk: However, it's important to note that Palantir isn\u2019t shielded from significant declines. It dropped approximately 23% during the Covid slump and suffered a much steeper decline of around 85% during the inflation shock phase. Despite all the positive aspects surrounding the stock, these drastic dips illustrate its vulnerability when markets take a downturn. Strong fundamentals are essential, but during turbulent periods, abrupt sell-offs can still take place. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly considering the volatility tied to individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why does this occur? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

He's looking for product marketing and digital experience roles. Business Insider has verified Ha's past employment with documentation. It has been edited for length and clarity. On July 9, I learned I'd been laid off by Intel. While I enjoyed my five years at the company, I didn't have the reaction some people describe \u2014 getting the news, breaking down, and cycling through emotions. Part of the reason is that I saw the layoff coming. In recent years, Intel has conducted thousands of layoffs, which made many of us worried about our job security. When our CEO left the company last December, we were worried that more cuts could be coming. My role fell under the company's sales and marketing group. In the months leading up to July, Intel had taken steps to outsource some of my team's work to another company. That made it seem even more likely that our group would be hit. The other reason the layoff news didn't affect me too much was that I'd already been laid off twice by other companies since 2015 \u2014 once during a restructuring and again during the pandemic. By the time it happened a third time, my mindset had already shifted. I'd seen it coming, I knew what it was like to lose a job, and I was already looking for my next role. Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.\u00a0If you have a story to share about struggling to find work, contact this reporter via email at\u00a0jzinkula@businessinsider.com, via Signal at jzinkula.29, or fill out\u00a0this quick form.\u00a0Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device;\u00a0here\u2019s our guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Before I was laid off, I'd started focusing on building my skills in hopes of reducing the chances I'd be let go. But at the same time, I began monitoring the job market to assess the types of roles available. As the company's outlook worsened, I began browsing roles more actively, and it became clear that finding a new job could be challenging. By June, I believed there was a decent chance I'd be let go in the coming months, so I took two steps to prepare. The first was reaching out to my financial advisor. I told them a layoff seemed likely and that the job market looked tough. They advised me not to overreact to something that hadn't happened yet, but said that if I was let go, I should file for unemployment \u2014 and that my wife and I should cut back spending on things like eating out and vacations. The second step I took to prepare for the layoff was to start applying for jobs. I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan. Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes. It was a contingency plan \u2014 that's how I thought about it. As I began searching for jobs, with a focus on product marketing and digital experience positions, I found myself reflecting on the two previous times I'd been laid off. In 2015, I moved from Portland, Oregon, to San Diego for a new role. Six months later, I was let go due to company restructuring. After that layoff, it took me about two and a half months to secure my next role, a three-month contract position. Knowing there wouldn't be a chance for an extension, I kept searching \u2014 and was able to find a full-time job that started shortly after the contract ended. In 2020, I was working at a home improvement company that focused on in-home services. When the pandemic hit, those services came to a halt. To cut costs, the company laid off workers \u2014 and I was among them. I was fortunate to land a content manager contract role at Intel in less than a month. That role eventually led to a promotion into a full-time digital marketing strategist position, which I held until I was laid off this year. In both 2015 and 2020, I cold-applied to jobs \u2014 but what actually worked was posting my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on sites like Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster. Staffing agencies would reach out, which led to interviews. Compared to my prior layoffs, this job search has been particularly challenging. I'm not having as much luck with those job boards, and when I do hear back, it's usually for entry-level roles. There also seems to be an increase in scams \u2014 for example, I recently got an email where the subject line said Audi was hiring, but the body of the message referenced the Marriott Hotel. My other strategies have included updating my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 with help from ChatGPT \u2014 to ensure it reflects the skill sets needed for the roles I'm targeting. I also strengthened my personal website, hoping to showcase my capabilities to potential employers. I've also reached out to my network to let them know I'm looking for work. I was fortunate to be part of a supportive team at Intel, and even now, many of us continue to share job leads and support each other. That's helped quite a bit. While these strategies have helped me get some interviews, I'm still struggling to land a job. The search has been an emotional roller coaster because there are roles that seem like a perfect fit, and then they go nowhere. I've been fortunate enough to secure some interviews, but it's really difficult to prepare for them and convey the right information within a short timeframe. As I go through my job search, I'm very grateful to my wife, who listens to me talk about companies day in and day out. Knowing how stressful it is for me, she's made us go on nightly walks to decompress. It's also been extremely helpful to have her income coming in \u2014 she works in the healthcare industry. I have a few pieces of advice for others who have been laid off: The first is related to your mindset. My first layoff in 2015 hit me hard \u2014 I'd just moved to California for the role, and six months later, I lost it. Over time, I realized it wasn't personal. Companies evolve, and so must you. That perspective helped me stay grounded during later layoffs, including this one. Second, find ways to grow. I noticed that one role I was interested in preferred a certified Scrum Product Owner certification, which I was already planning to pursue, so I took the course. I'm now planning to explore AI courses as well to stay current and competitive. And finally: Take a breath. As hard as this is, it might be the only time in your career when you can pause. I remind myself it's a marathon. Having a routine, staying sharp, and preparing for the next opportunity \u2014 that's what keeps me going.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"Maybe hold off on that Apple TV or HomePod mini purchase...  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Are you in the market for a new Apple TV or HomePod mini? If so, you might find it tricky to get one, as several Apple Stores have been running low on stock of both devices. But far from a one-off blip, these shortages might suggest that new models are about to land. There have been rumors for some time that Apple is planning to launch new versions of these devices, but this is the first time we\u2019ve seen claims that Apple\u2019s existing stock is running low. According to an example given by MacRumors, the Apple Store at Regent Street in London is completely sold out of all five colors of the HomePod mini. The website adds that some HomePod mini and Apple TV models are out of stock at other locations, but online availability seems to be better. When Apple\u2019s stock runs low \u2013 either online or in physical stores \u2013 it\u2019s often a sign that the company is gearing up to discontinue the product in question. That, in turn, is an indication that a new version is on the cusp of being released. That\u2019s what could be happening with the Apple TV and the HomePod mini. That idea is strengthened by the fact that several sources have claimed that new versions are on the way, with the updated versions expected to arrive before the end of the year.      According to the grapevine, the next Apple TV will pack in an A17 chip for faster performance and support for Apple Intelligence-infused Siri, plus a new Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip that will offer either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7. There have been rumors that a future Apple TV will feature a built-in FaceTime camera, but it\u2019s not clear if that will make it into the next model. As for the HomePod mini, this is expected to come with an S9 chip (or potentially something newer) that, like the A17, will support Apple Intelligence-powered Siri, plus an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"You probably can't (or shouldn't) repair it yourself, but the Pixel Watch 4 proves that other smartwatch brands can do better.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.       My weekly column focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments to the latest apps and features. iFixit says the Google Pixel Watch 4 is the most repairable smartwatch available today. That doesn't mean you or I should try to repair it, as the actual repair process is time-consuming and challenging. That doesn't change the fact that repairability matters if we're going to take smartwatches more seriously. Look at the official 118-page Pixel Watch 4 repair manual. It's extremely detailed on every step, safety precaution, part, and tool that you'll need, including flowcharts for every part you'll need to interact with to repair a specific part. For mechanical nerds, or even laymen like myself, it's extremely cool to see how the Pixel Watch 4 was jigsawed together with removable parts without compromising the IP68 protection; compared to the unrepairable Watch 3, things won't break if you take it apart. You just need the technical know-how to reassemble it.      For battery replacement, Google told me it aimed to make it as simple as repairing a quartz watch; you can remove the back with exposed screws in the band slot, using tools that'll only cost about $10 on iFixit. The battery itself isn't for sale yet, but let's assume it'll be no more than a Pixel phone battery ($30\u201350). You should use your one-year limited warranty first and let the pros handle it, Google said, but you can do it if you're technically confident or past the first year. The iFixit guide certainly makes it look straightforward. For every other component, though, they likened it to fixing a mechanical watch, something that's not for the faint of heart. iFixit gave the Watch 4 a 9\/10 rating for repairability, saying they were \"inside within minutes\" and had little trouble detaching the display from the replaceable gasket, then removing the Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 2. But they do that kind of thing for a living. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android If you get something wrong during disassembly or reassembly, you're left with an out-of-warranty bundle of parts; you'll have to give it to a repair person and hope they can put Humpty Dumpty back together again. As someone who gets overwhelmed assembling Ikea furniture, I'll pass. Still, the Pixel Watch 4's repairability has proven that we can (and should) expect better from other brands.      If you're lucky, you'll never have to take advantage of the Watch 4's repairability during its three-year software support window. A battery swap wouldn't be too expensive, but iFixit suggested a new display will cost about $100, high enough that \"lots of people won\u2019t choose repair\" when they can upgrade instead. Still, you have the option, and local repair shops are more likely to offer their services if you can point them to extensive step-by-step documentation. Meanwhile, iFixit gave the Apple Watch S10 a 3\/10, because it relies on tight seams and adhesive with no official guides; without Applecare, you're out of luck. And iFixit cut ties with Samsung in 2024 because it relies too much on adhesives that made replacement parts too expensive \u2014 though the Galaxy Watch Ultra got a solid 7\/10.      If I'm buying an $800 Apple Watch Ultra 3 designed to last for 5+ years of software support, I want someone to be able to take it apart and fix a faulty component, even if it's not me or Apple doing it. The same principle applies to Garmin watches; they're more expensive than ever and use AMOLED displays that could show burn-in after a few years. People love making Garmin watches last for years, but if something goes wrong, most non-Fenix Garmin watches allegedly use glue for waterproofing, so you have to hope Garmin will send you a new model.      Repairability gives us more third-party backup options if warranty repairs are either unavailable or too expensive. It also reduces waste and makes it more likely that we could get a thriving refurbished market for older watches, with proper retrofits instead of skin-deep fixes. Smartwatches are still treated like accessories that get a pass in areas like repairability, and I can accept that for a $100 fitness band. But for expensive, rugged fitness watches or \"Ultra\" flagships that cost as much as a phone, I think it's fair to ask that these brands stop taking design shortcuts, switch out glue for screws, and make repair guides and parts available at launch. If the Pixel Watch 4 did it, why not bigger, more expensive watches?       Fast and fixable The Google Pixel Watch 4 is one of the best Android smartwatches. Aside from its repairability, you get satellite SOS for emergencies, dual-band GPS for accurate training data, and summonable Gemini using Raise to Talk. It has other key upgrades over the Watch 3 like a 3,000-nit display and improved battery life. Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

Halloween has always been more of a lifestyle than a holiday for me, much to the chagrin of my husband and family. Although I worked at Spirit Halloween \u2014 the seasonal chain known for taking over empty storefronts \u2014 for three years, I've been a longtime customer and have even joked that the store was created just for me. Here are nine mistakes I saw customers make while shopping for their costumes and seasonal decor at the popular Halloween chain. If you only plan to wear a costume once, it's fine to go for the cheap stuff. But investing a little more can extend the costume's wear. Spirit Halloween offers a line of Signature Collection costumes, which cost more but are made with higher-quality fabrics. I've found these pieces can last through several years of Halloween events or cosplay fun. And, in my opinion, investing in great accessories to complete the look is just as important. For example, if you're dressing up as a vampire, fangs can add an extra layer to the costume. However, a cheap pair probably won't last the night. My personal favorite is the Scarecrow brand of fangs because they come in different sizes for a more custom fit. Makeup can really elevate a costume's look, but let's face it, most Halloween-store makeup isn't top quality. I recommend protecting both your skin and your look by investing in quality products like primer, setting powder, and heavy-duty setting spray. If you're using prosthetics, be sure to purchase Spirit Gum adhesive and remover. Without it, removing prosthetics can be difficult. And you definitely don't want to join that next-day Zoom meeting still dressed as Hellboy. Always test makeup and adhesives for allergic reactions by using a small amount of the product on the inside of your wrist. Wait at least 20 minutes to see how your skin reacts. Before purchasing any products, read the package carefully and search for any irritants or allergens. When shopping for accessories to complete your look, keep your eyes open and peruse the entire store because hidden gems are everywhere. The checkout line, in particular, is always full of the best selection of chokers, earrings, and other fun novelty items. Never make just one trip per season to Spirit Halloween, as stores get truckloads of new merchandise delivered weekly. Chances are you'll find something new every time you visit. I also recommend asking an associate on the sales floor when the next delivery will be. I was always happy to help customers find the latest products. When purchasing animatronics, always make sure you read the box before making a purchase. A lot of the animatronics are made for outdoor, covered use only. That means that they can break down from exposure to weather (especially humidity that can mess with the electronics) if left outdoors unprotected. Most people are tired of receiving email and text offers, but I think Spirit Halloween's are worth it. By signing up, you'll get a 20% off coupon to use during your next visit. You'll also receive exclusive emails throughout the year about new props and displays, and notifications when stores near you are opening or hiring. Most people don't realize that Spirit Halloween has its own tech support hotline. Before returning any electronics to the store, call the Zombie Tech Squad (their number is displayed on all prop directions). Most times, they can troubleshoot your issue and save you a trip back to the store, which can be super helpful during the busy Halloween season. Don't skip out on the clearance sales on November 1 and 2. Three years ago, my store was still putting out new stock until closing on October 31. All of that merchandise is typically discounted by 25% to 50% the next day. This story was originally published on October 12, 2023, and most recently updated on October 15, 2025.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. POET Technologies stock (NASDAQ: POET) experienced an increase of nearly 10% on Monday and is still up approximately 60% for the past month. The firm, which creates silicon photonics solutions that utilize light instead of electricity to transfer data between chips, has garnered heightened investor interest due to excitement surrounding artificial intelligence infrastructure investments, a recent capital raise of $75 million, and a series of new partnerships, which are bringing the company closer to commercialization. So, is the stock a worthwhile purchase at this time? POET stock has increased notably in recent times, but there is considerable risk in depending on a single equity. Nonetheless, a broader, diversified strategy has substantial advantages, as seen with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, ponder what your portfolio\u2019s long-term performance could look like if it included 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto combined with equities. Interconnects serve as the physical connections that facilitate data transfer between chips, servers, and systems within data centers. Conventional electrical interconnects, which rely on copper wiring, are increasingly falling short of the vast data transfer demands of AI tasks due to limitations in speed, energy efficiency, and heat dissipation. These limitations result in bandwidth bottlenecks, elevated energy consumption, and expensive cooling needs, constraining the scalability of AI infrastructure. Conversely, optical interconnects, like those engineered by POET Technologies, substitute electrical signals with light for transmission, permitting multi-terabit data transfer rates, lower power consumption, and minimized heat production. This makes them essential for the upcoming wave of AI and high-performance computing systems. While other competitors exist in this niche, including Ayar Labs, Celestial AI, and Ranovus, POET\u2019s Optical Interposer merges photonics and electronics on a single wafer, tackling cost, scalability, and manufacturability challenges more efficiently than its competitors by omitting traditional expensive photonics assembly steps. The company\u2019s core breakthrough, the Optical Interposer, combines electronic and photonic elements on one chip, enabling data transmission speeds of 800G and 1.6T aimed at next-generation AI and high-performance computing systems. Several factors have contributed to the stock\u2019s upward trajectory. The firm secured $75 million in new investments just last week, which could provide it with the means to enhance product development and expand production. Additionally, POET has established strategic partnerships with Foxconn, Semtech, and notably Sivers Semiconductors in recent times. The collaboration with Foxconn centers on the development of 800G and 1.6T plug-in optical transceiver modules utilizing POET's silicon photonics optical engine technology, with Foxconn responsible for designing and manufacturing the high-speed transceivers for clients globally, leveraging their manufacturing proficiency. POET and Semtech have unveiled 1.6T high-performance optical receivers that integrate Semtech\u2019s FiberEdge 200G-per-lane receiver technology with POET's Optical Interposer platform. Furthermore, POET recently initiated a strategic collaboration with Sivers Semiconductors to combine Sivers\u2019 high-power distributed feedback laser technology with POET's optical interposer platform, aiming to develop scalable, cost-effective solutions for AI clusters and hyperscale data centers. POET is still in the nascent stages of commercialization. The company reported revenues of less than $300,000 for Q2 2025. Over the preceding 12 months, operating losses totaled $-28 million. The future of POET heavily hinges on successful product adoption and the ability to increase production, making it a rather speculative investment. Its valuation appears stretched, with the stock trading at over 60 times projected revenue for 2026, offering minimal margin for execution risk. With a market capitalization below $900 million, POET is also classified as a small-cap stock, which may entail greater volatility and reduced liquidity. Overall, POET seems to be a high-risk, high-reward investment on the ascent of AI infrastructure, although substantial gains will rely on how effectively it implements its product roadmap and transforms partnerships into tangible revenue in the upcoming quarters. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of outperforming its benchmarks, which include the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index, presenting a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AppFolio (APPF) shares have dropped by 20.2% in under a month, decreasing from $285.18 on 9\/22\/2025 to a current price of $227.50. What lies ahead? It appears that the stock may decline further. The ongoing correction, when viewed in light of the stock's Very High valuation, indicates the potential for additional downside. A price of $160 is plausible, especially sinc e the stock has reached this level within the last 5 years. So, should you hold off before purchasing this dip? Possibly. There is no flawless method for timing dips. However, here is another viewpoint on APPF stock to assist you in your decision-making. Historically, the stock has delivered a (median) 53% return over one year, with a peak return of 97% following sharp dips (greater than 30% in 30 days). For some context, APPF provides cloud-based property management solutions that feature automated workflows, user-friendly interfaces, and value-added services aimed at optimizing real estate business processes. For further information on stock fundamentals and assessments: Read Buy or Sell AppFolio Stock to get the complete picture. APPF stock has recently dropped significantly and we now consider it relatively expensive. While this may appear to be an opportunity, relying on a single stock entails considerable risk. On the flip side, adopting a broader diversified approach has substantial benefits, as shown with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management \u2014 a Boston-based wealth manager \u2014 whose asset allocation strategies achieved positive returns during the 2008-09 period, when the S&P index lost more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation framework to provide clients with better returns while mitigating risks compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a less turbulent investment experience, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. APPF has experienced 2 occasions since 1\/1\/2010 where the dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was triggered. It is essential to evaluate revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength to mitigate the risk of a dip being indicative of a declining business performance. While dip buying can be appealing, it is crucial to assess it thoroughly from various perspectives. This multi-faceted analysis is precisely how we formulate Trefis portfolio strategies. If you seek upside with a more stable investment experience compared to individual stocks, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, achieving returns of over 91% since its inception.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-15","content":" This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Strategy (MSTR) bears have pierced a key bull market support, leaving bitcoin BTC$110,794.00 bears trailing behind. The technical breakdown centres around the Strategy share price's recent breach of its 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This SMA had consistently acted as a springboard since March 2023, marking the end of corrective pullbacks and triggering buying interest that propelled shares to new highs for over two years. But, in recent weeks, bears have managed to establish a foothold below this crucial average, signaling a significant weakening in buying pressure and exposing the stock to further downside. Bitcoin bears, by contrast, have yet to achieve this. BTC's own 50-week SMA has served as a reliable springboard over the past two years, with prices still holding above that level despite pulling back from record highs above $124,000. In essence, BTC's broader bullish trajectory remains intact. Nevertheless, the recent technical deterioration in Strategy warrants attention, as it's the largest publicly-listed BTC holder in the world, with a coin stash of 640,250 BTC ($71.73 billion), according to Bitcointreasuries.net.  Its sustained BTC accumulation has been a key driver of the rally from $30,000 to $124,000 over the past two and a half years, making its current price weakness a potential cautionary signal for BTC bulls. Both Strategy and bitcoin simultaneously broke above their respective 50-week SMAs in the first quarter of 2023, embarking on impressive rallies, with the moving average serving as a reliable floor (marked by boxes) during corrections. The floor has now given way to Strategy bears, with popular momentum indicators like the weekly MACD histogram flashing red. Bitcoin\u2019s MACD is also in the red; whether its price will follow suit and break below the 50-week SMA remains to be seen. As of writing, BTC changed hands near $111,700, with the SMA support at $101,872., per data source TradingView.

Turin is known as one of Italy's most chic places. Earlier this year, Vogue named it the most elegant city in the country, even beating out the fashion capital of Milan. I've also read many travel blogs and articles about the great things Turin has to offer. Situated in the northwest of the country, it's known for its grand baroque architecture and royal history. It's also famous for being home to the Shroud of Turin, a centuries-old religious relic. So when my husband and I were trying to figure out where to go for a short trip in northwest Italy, we decided to give it a try. Though we enjoyed a lot about our July visit, we didn't fall in love with the city and wouldn't rush back. From afar, central Turin looked amazing. The baroque architecture and wide porticos made the city look more like Paris or Vienna than any other Italian city I've visited before. It was undeniably impressive. Up close, however, I noticed that many of the buildings and streets seemed a little gritty and worn, with graffiti and stickers covering some facades. To me, this gave parts of the city a slightly rough-around-the-edges feel, but I know some travelers might just see that as part of its character. I also expected to find a more upscale shopping scene in Turin. Given the city's reputation \u2014 and how an Italian friend had described it as quite wealthy and refined \u2014 I'd pictured rows of luxury shops and stylish boutiques. However, I found myself disappointed. Though I found some designer stores, such as Chanel and Prada, there seemed to be more shops selling vapes and touristy trinkets. I felt this gave the city a more down-market feel, rather than an elegant and chic one. Still, there were several things I really enjoyed about Turin. The historic Palazzo Reale was fascinating to wander around, and the ancient Roman ruins of the Palatine Gate were cool to see \u2014 even if some of the surrounding newer, not-so-attractive buildings didn't exactly complement such a historic relic. The city center is also really walkable, which I loved. Our hotel, The NH Collection Torino Piazza Carlina, was perfectly situated in the city so that we could easily head out to explore, then pop back to recharge before going out again. When we got tired of walking around, we could rent some of the many e-bikes and e-scooters available in the area. At one point, we even rode Turin's historic tram, which was bursting with charm and a really fun way to get around. I also liked how the city had a buzz to it, especially in the evenings when aperitivo time (roughly 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.) was in full swing. Turin does aperitivo well, too. The Aperol Spritzes were about half the price of what we've found in the UK and France. Some were as affordable as 5 euros, and our drinks always came with nibbles, like salty popcorn, nuts, olives, or crisps. We also enjoyed some really good food while in Turin, including a standout pizza at Sorbillo and gelato flavored with gianduja (a special regional paste made with chocolate and hazelnut). My husband and I live in the south of France, which is part of the reason we wanted to visit northwest Italy \u2014 it's not too far away and an easy drive. However, perhaps living in Provence means our standards are high when it comes to European charm: We live on the C\u00f4te d'Azur, not far from famously beautiful spots like Saint-Tropez and Aix-en-Provence, where beautiful old buildings and historic plazas abound. Turin might be a great weekend trip for people whose priorities are art and culture, or those who don't live near historic cities. Still, I'm glad I went \u2014 traveling is always a privilege, and the city was interesting. It just wasn't in the top few places I've been lucky enough to visit.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Caterpillar stock (NYSE: CAT) is up 21% in a month, a surge fueled by positive analyst sentiment and strategic expansion. Wall Street is increasingly optimistic, primarily citing Caterpillar's role in the AI data center boom through its power business, which supplies essential generators to meet rising electricity demand. Further adding to the momentum, the company announced on October 13, 2025, that it will acquire RPMGlobal Holdings. This deal, which was well-received by investors, is a strategic move to enhance Caterpillar's technological offerings and software capabilities in the mining sector. With Caterpillar stock surging lately, it makes sense to re-evaluate vs its peers. Consistently assessing alternatives is core to a sound investment approach. Here is how Caterpillar stock stacks up against its peers in size, valuation, growth, and margin. As a quick background, Caterpillar provides construction and mining equipment, engines, industrial turbines, and financial services, including leases and loans for various industries. CAT stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it unattractive. This may feel like a caution, and there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. However, there is a huge value to a broader, diversified approach. Strategic asset allocation and diversification help you stay invested. Did you know investors who panicked out of the S&P in 2020 lost significant upside that followed? Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management's asset allocation approach are designed to reduce volatility so you can stay the course. Why does this matter? CAT just went up 21% in a month - peer comparison puts stock performance, valuation, and financials in context - highlighting whether it is truly outperforming, lagging behind, and above all - can this continue? Read Buy or Sell CAT Stock to see if Caterpillar holds up as a quality investment. Furthermore, there is always a risk of a fall after a strong rally - see how the stock has dipped and recovered in the past through the CAT Dip Buyer Analysis lens. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

Revenge of the Sith's official novelization is now available in a gorgeous new hardcover edition designed for collectors. By      Steven Petite    and      Darryn Bonthuys    on October 15, 2025 at 3:16PM PDT  Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: Deluxe Edition (Hardcover)   $55.80 (was $60)   Star Wars: Master of Evil (Hardcover)   $27.90 (was $30) | Releases November 11    Star Wars fans can add a gorgeous collectible edition Revenge of the Sith's superb novelization to their bookshelves this week. Released in celebration of Episode III's 20th anniversary, Revenge of the Sith's hardcover Deluxe Edition is available as of October 14 for $55.80 (was $60). Along with a collector-worthy appearance, the Deluxe Edition includes a plethora of new insights from author Matthew Stover. Revenge of the Sith's Deluxe Edition released just in time for a reread before the next Star Wars novel. Star Wars: Master of Evil, a direct sequel to Revenge of the Sith, releases November 11. You can preorder Master of Evil in hardcover for $27.90 (was $30). The Deluxe Edition hardcover has wrap-around cover art depicting the film's iconic lightsaber battle. The artwork is protected by a transparent, acetate jacket featuring a foil-stamped silhouette of Darth Vader. The red stained page edges are foil-stamped with an iconic quote from the film: \"This is how it feels to be Anakin Skywalker, forever...\" It also comes with a satin ribbon bookmark and fully illustrated endpapers.  The ISBN barcode and pricing details are printed on a removable belly band instead of the book jacket, so the illustration on the back cover isn't obscured by any text. Author Matthew Stover wrote a new introduction for the Deluxe Edition. You'll also find over 170 annotated notes from the author with behind-the-scenes insights on how the novelization was written.  Widely considered to be one of the best Star Wars novelizations, the literary adaptation of Revenge of the Sith improves on the feature film's story by diving into each character's internal thoughts, providing more insight into their motivations and actions. The added context makes for a holistic version of the plot and adds a Shakespearian quality to the story, mixing tragedy with a painful lesson about always having the upper hand. Master of Evil is a direct sequel to Revenge of the Sith that chronicles Anakin Skywalker's early days as Darth Vader. When Vader performs a dark ritual to forge his lightsaber, he becomes obsessed with the power he can wield on the Dark Side. Under the direction of Emperor Palpatine, Vader travels the galaxy completing missions while reckoning with his move to the other side of the Force. In Revenge of the Sith, we see how Anakin Skywalker adopts the identity of Darth Vader. In Master of Evil, fans will see how Anakin becomes the Darth Vader we know in the Original Trilogy: the \"Master of Evil.\" Master of Evil's hardcover edition is 384 pages. The sequel novel will also launch in ebook and audiobook formats. It was written by Adam Christopher, the author of Star Wars: Shadow of the Sith, a Stranger Things novel, and the Dishonored novelizations.   If you're curious about the other Star Wars novelizations, all eleven Star Wars feature films--Episodes 1-9, Rogue One, and Solo--have received official book adaptations. The Prequel Trilogy novels are widely viewed as the best of the bunch, but all of them are worth reading. The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith are getting new paperback editions next June. That's a long way off, so thankfully each novel remains in print. For the best bang for your buck, check out Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy, a single-volume omnibus collecting all three novelizations in one massive paperback (1,008 pages). You can snag a copy of The Prequel Trilogy for only $18 (was $24) at Amazon. There's also an omnibus edition of the Original Trilogy's novelizations for only $10 (was $15).

Salvatore, the author of the long-running Legend of Drizzt series, wrote the novelization for Attack of the Clones. Novelizations of the Original Trilogy were reissued in trade paperback in July. It's likely that the new editions of the Prequel Trilogy will have matching cover designs.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByCarmine Gallo, Senior Contributor. A famous Warren Buffett quote is having a resurgence as investors debate whether the stock market is overvalued and approaching a \u2018bubble\u2019 phase. It\u2019s been 40 years since Buffett wrote the now famous line in this letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, but it captures the psychology of the market so perfectly\u2014and so memorably\u2014that it\u2019s easy to repeat.  Buffett, explaining his long-term investing approach, wrote:  \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d Buffett\u2019s maxim isn\u2019t just smart investing advice. It\u2019s a masterstroke of messaging. At just 12 words and under 70 characters, Buffett\u2019s advice can easily fit in a social media post and still leave room for the writer\u2019s own commentary. Buffett didn\u2019t clutter the line with extra qualifiers or multi-syllable abstractions such as \u201cmarket sentiment\u201d or \u201ccontrarian philosophy.\u201d Each word is short, punchy, and easy to say. The line is so simple, in fact, it\u2019s written at a grade level appropriate for 11 to 12-year-old readers, according to a Flesch-Kincaid text analysis. Of course, most 10-year-olds wouldn\u2019t understand the context of psychology and the stock market, but \u201cfear\u201d and \u201cgreed\u201d are one-syllable, commonly understood words.  The best, most repeatable explanations are not long. They\u2019re short, easy to process, use simple language, and pack a lot of information into a few words. Buffett\u2019s line packs a punch because he chose emotional language to make his point that fear and greed are \u201csuper contagious\u201d among the investment community. And \u201cthey\u2019ll forever occur,\u201d he added.  Everyone gets the gist of these emotions, even an 11-year-old. They might not use the words fear or greed to explain their feelings, but they\u2019ll understand what feels like to be scared or to want more than another kid in the class.  Industry jargon doesn\u2019t translate into repeatable and powerful messages. Feelings do.  Buffett\u2019s advice is easy to remember because it\u2019s written for the ear. It\u2019s a line that sounds better than it looks in text.  The structure of the sentence is balanced, divided into two parts of five words that are exact mirrors of each other.  Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.  The technical term for Buffett\u2019s rhetorical structure is \u2018antithesis,\u2019 juxtaposing two opposing ideas to highlight the contrast between them. In this case, the opposing ideas are fear and greed.  Bottom line: it sounds good.  If you have big, bold ideas that you want people to remember and repeat, take a page from the Buffett playbook: Make your message short, simple, emotional, and rhythmic.  As to whether today\u2019s investors are on the greedy end of the spectrum, Buffett has an answer for that, too. In his 1992 shareholder letter, he wrote, \u201cThe only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good.\u201d","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"Rivian is at a critical moment in its history, with its R2 SUV hitting the market next year. Starting at $45,000, the R2 is supposed to carry Rivian into its next stage, but meanwhile the company is still selling the R1T pickup truck and thus far in 2025, sales haven't been very impressive. In fact, according to InsideEVs (citing Cox Automotive data), the \"R1T is currently the worst-selling electric pickup in America.\" Rivian sold 2,378 pickups in the third quarter, and on paper that number looks good, as it's up about 13% from the same period in 2024. Year-to-date, however, the R1T has seen a sales collapse, down more than 32% from last year, with 2025 sales of 5,857 units versus 2024's January-September total of 8,673. (The R1S SUV strongly outsells its pickup sibling.) From InsideEVs' perspective, Rivian is a victim of a U.S. market that has soured on pickups powered by electrons: [M]ost of the battery-powered trucks on sale today in the U.S. have increased their sales numbers from July through September. At the same time...figures show Americans clearly aren't as interested in electric pickups as they are in gas-powered ones. In fact, only the R1T and the Tesla Cybertruck\u00a0have shown big YTD sales declines in 2025. Ford saw its market-leading F-150 Lightning replicate 2024's pace (up 1%), while GM witnessed the GMC Hummer EV, as well as the Chevy Silverado EV, post hefty increases. The F-150 Lighting is leading the 2025 sales race by a wide margin, moving 23,024 vehicles to second-place Tesla's 16,097 Cybertrucks. The GMC Hummer pickup\/SUV combo came in at 13,233, and the Silverado EV notched 9,379. 6,147 of the GMC Sierra EV have been sold, beating out the last-place R1T by a few hundred units. The R1T was updated for 2025, and since its introduction the pickup has received generally positive reviews and has built a devoted ownership base. The sales slide has occurred in the context of some turmoil for Rivian: the company has downgraded its deliveries guidance for the year amid ongoing supply chain issues. The company is also gearing up to produce the forthcoming R2 at its only plant, located in Illinois. It broke ground for a new factory in Georgia last month, but that facility won't come online until 2028. In terms of the entire pickup market in the U.S., the Ford F-Series posted 620,580 in total sales through September. The F-150 Lightning's performance has been notable, but the vast majority of trucks that Ford is selling continue to run on gas. This is also true for the other companies that are major players in pickups. The disparity between gas-powered pickups and their electric counterparts is indicative of an EV market that hasn't entirely stalled but that, for trucks, is beginning to look niche rather than transformative. The challenge of course is figuring out how to make money off these vehicles: Rivian has been losing over $30,000 per unit. The end of the $7,500 federal EV credit is just going to make matters worse, as automakers will have to discount their electric pickups to sustain sales momentum. In this environment, it's unclear what Rivian should do. The R1T is expensive and could be structurally unprofitable; phasing down production in favor of the R2 to bridge the gap between now and the Georgia plant becoming operational might be the best business plan, but that would mean sidelining the company's flagship. Rivian might not have a choice. Ford and GM have predictably surged ahead with their electric pickups \u2013 and Cybertruck has proved itself to be a folly \u2013 so the market may already have picked its winners. And the R1T might not be among them.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"ByAlan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff. Waymo plans to begin giving paid robotaxi rides in London next year, with no human backup driver, as the Alphabet unit seeks to establish itself as the global leader in autonomous driving. The Mountain View, California-based company will begin operating a fleet of electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs in the British capital, sometime in 2026, that commuters can hail via the Waymo app. Moove.io, an African mobility fintech company, will handle fleet maintenance and service in London, just as it does in Phoenix and, soon, Miami, Waymo said today. The news comes as the robotaxi leader prepares to take its service beyond Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and Atlanta to Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas, Denver, Nashville and New York. Waymo, which provides hundreds of thousands of paid rides weekly, has been testing in Tokyo as well, but hasn\u2019t yet announced a launch date. In a blog post, co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana emphasized Waymo\u2019s safety record, based on years of U.S. road tests and service. The company says its robotaxis are involved in \u201cfive times fewer injury-causing\u201d accidents and far fewer collisions with pedestrians resulting in injuries compared to human drivers. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated how to responsibly scale fully autonomous ride-hailing,\u201d she said. For the latest in cleantech and sustainability news, sign up here for our Current Climate newsletter. Waymo is at an inflection point, looking to dramatically scale up its service after 16 years of technical development. Its London expansion could also be a big development for Moove. Based in Lagos, Nigeria, it operates 36,000 vehicles in ridehail services in 19 cities around the world. The company, partly owned by Uber, began by providing vehicles to drivers who finance them with revenue from rides. Now it wants to build one of the world\u2019s largest rideshare fleets\u2013including robotaxis. Bloomberg reported in July that Moove was raising $1.2 billion in part to buy a Waymo fleet to expand operations in the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019re excited by a future where Waymo\u2019s safe and reliable autonomous technology is available in London, transforming how the capital moves,\u201d Ladi Delano, Moove\u2019s cofounder and co-CEO, said by email. \u201cThis partnership represents a major step forward for urban mobility, bringing world-class innovation to one of the world\u2019s greatest cities.\u201d Waymo\u2019s London launch isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Last month, media reports said the company had begun hiring local staff there. In June, the U.K. government gave approval to testing autonomous vehicles without safety drivers. Wayve, a London-based Waymo competitor, is testing its driverless vehicles there in a partnership with Uber.","label":0}

Zach Cregger's critically acclaimed horror movie Weapons is $28 on 4K Blu-ray, but if you want the Steelbook Edition, it's extremely expensive right now. By      Steven Petite    on October 14, 2025 at 8:40PM PDT  Weapons on 4K Blu-ray   $28   Weapons Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)   $59 | Restocked on October 14  One of the best horror films of 2025 is now available on 4K Blu-ray. Weapons, the second feature from Barbarian director Zach Cregger, is in stock for $28 at Amazon and available to ship this week. That last part is key here, as the other three editions of Weapons have quite the estimated wait on launch day (October 14). After being sold out for two months, Weapons Limited Edition Steelbook is back in stock with an eye-watering $59 price. Amazon is still referring to the Steelbook Edition as a preorder and doesn't expect orders to ship until December 8. If you manage to secure a preorder, you won't be charged until your order ships, so hopefully the price will drop back down to the $38-$45 range it was at originally. Note: Amazon sold out and restocked the Steelbook Edition three times in the last 15-20 minutes, so keep checking the store page if it's unavailable when you click. Meanwhile, the standard Blu-ray edition ($23) and DVD ($18) have delivery estimates ranging from one to two months at Amazon. Walmart has the Blu-ray edition in stock for $23 and the DVD for $18, and unlike Amazon, both editions are available to ship immediately. and can deliver your order as soon as tomorrow. Weapons Editions at Amazon: The 4K Blu-ray edition of Weapons has support for Dolby Vision and HDR10 as well as three surround sound tracks: Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD 7.1, and Dolby Digital 5.1. Along with the 4K Blu-ray disc, you'll find a voucher for the digital edition via Movies Anywhere. Both 4K Blu-ray editions and the 1080p Blu-ray release include behind-the-scenes videos and a trio of featurettes:     As mentioned, Weapons Limited Edition Steelbook had been sold out since preorders opened in early August. It initially sold out at a $38 price point at Amazon and Gruv, but it wound up selling out at Walmart with a $59 price point. It appears that there are some inventory issues with the Limited Edition Steelbook, since Amazon estimates orders placed today (October 14) won't arrive until December 8. If you manage to secure a preorder, you won't be charged until your order ships, so hopefully the price will drop back down before then. The Steelbook Edition features Alex Lilly (Cary Christopher) staring out his window on the front, and the glow of 2:17 on an alarm clock on the back cover. The interior artwork shows the creepy version of Alex sitting alone in his classroom. The Steelbook Edition comes with 4K Blu-ray, 1080p Blu-ray, and digital versions of Weapons. Weapons is a captivating and exceedingly unsettling horror film that takes place in a small suburban town in Pennsylvania. When all but one child from the a third grade class inexplicably run from their homes at 2:17 AM one night, the community is left reeling with unimaginable loss. Initially, the focus of the investigation and the ire of Archer (Josh Brolin) and other grief-stricken parents falls on the third grade teacher Justine. But just like Barbarian, Cregger's 2022 directorial debut, Weapons is far weirder, creepier, and disturbing than it may initially seem. Like Barbarian, Cregger wrote and directed Weapons. The story is brilliantly told through multiple viewpoints and jumps back and forth between before and after the kids go missing. Weapons is the one of the highest-rated horror movies of the year. Unfortunately, Cregger's first film, Barbarians, has yet to receive a physical release, so hopefully that's in the cards at some point. Cregger's next project is a Resident Evil adaptation set in the world of Resident Evil 2. It's currently in pre-production and is slated to release in theaters next year. The Steelbook Edition of Weapons may be incredibly expensive at the moment, but there is another critically acclaimed horror film with an upcoming Steelbook Edition that's experiencing the exact opposite situation. The Amazon-exclusive 4K Steelbook Edition of The Long Walk is available to preorder for $26.65 (was $35). The Long Walk is one of the best-reviewed adaptations of a Stephen King novel in a long time. It's one of numerous Amazon-exclusive Steelbook Editions horror fans can preorder now. Other standouts include a trio of Saw movies with extremely cool steelbook and slipcover artwork.

{"date":"2025-10-15","content":"It's easy to convince EDC people to buy EDC things. But how do you convince non-EDC folks to buy your product? Simple: Fear. The global \"car escape tool market,\" according to market research firm Data Insights Market, is valued at $500 this year, projected to grow 7% a year and hit $900 million in 2033. The trend is being driven by \"heightened safety concerns among consumers.\" A big seller in this category is the automotive window breaker and seat belt cutter. The fantasy being peddled by the toolmakers is: You will crash, remain conscious, find that your car has burst into flame or is slowly sinking in water, find that you cannot undo your seatbelt, yet are still able to reach for this specialty tool, slice through your seatbelt, then smash the window open and climb free to safety. This image sure looks real to us!   Accidents that involve fire or water are less than half of one percent of all accidents, according to the NHTSA. And the amount of accidents where the above scenario actually occurred, and that tool saved lives, is not recorded as a statistic. Similarly, seat belt jamming is so rare that neither the NHTSA nor the AAA track it as a statistic. As for the glassbreakers, here's the big thing that most people don't realize: They're designed to break tempered glass, which is what most cars used to have for the side windows. However, modern safety regulations\u2014specifically, the \"Ejection Mitigation Rule\" in the 2013 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 226 (FMVSS 226), mean that most manufacturers have transitioned to laminated glass for the side windows.  Laminated glass (which is what the windshields were already made of) is tougher to break, and is now used to prevent occupants from being ejected through the side glass. An AAA research report tested six commonly-available glassbreakers. Not a single one of them was capable of breaking through laminated glass\u2014and two of the tools couldn't even break through tempered glass, but instead broke themselves. On the glass.   It's true that not all automakers have switched over to laminated glass for the side windows; the FMVSS 226 law stipulates that you can get around it if you install elaborate side airbags that also prevent ejection. The automakers that are using laminated side glass are only: Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, Genesis, GMC, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jaguar, Jeep, Kia, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, Ram, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Some of them, like Chevy and BMW, have been using laminated glass since the '70s and '80s. Glassbreakers might only be useful if you're driving around in a classic car and believe you'll become submerged. That said, seatbelt cutters are of supreme use to firefighters, EMTs and other first responders who may not be able to reach an unconscious accident victim's seatbelt release. So there might be a case for them if you see yourself in a situation where you need to free an unconscious person, and have the training to safely extricate them.
