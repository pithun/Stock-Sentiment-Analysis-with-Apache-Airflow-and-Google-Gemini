Noise-canceling headphones have become essential gear for commuters and travelers who need to block out the world and focus on what matters. Sony just quietly liquidated XM4 inventory on Amazon, dropping the price to $198 from the usual $348, and the timing is interesting because both the XM5 and XM6 are on the market at nearly three times this price. Here\u2019s the thing though: the technological improvements between these new generations are minimal and most users can\u2019t tell the difference in real-world use. The XM4 delivers the same exceptional active noise cancellation, 30-hour battery life, multipoint connection, and premium sound quality that made Sony the leader in this category. Amazon has already moved over 10,000 units at this all-time low price, and it\u2019s easy to see why. See at Amazon The core feature that made the XM4 legendary is Sony\u2019s Dual Noise Sensor technology which uses microphones on both the outside and inside of each earcup to capture ambient sound. The HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1 analyzes this audio data over 700 times per second and generates inverse sound waves that cancel out unwanted noise. This isn\u2019t passive isolation from thick padding, though the earcups do provide physical noise blocking too: This is active electronic cancellation that targets low-frequency rumble like airplane engines, train noise and air conditioning systems. The noise cancellation levels on the Sony can now be adjusted by an additional 20 levels through an app, and gives you complete control over how much of the environment you can shut out. The ambient sound mode reverses this by letting ambient sound come in through the headphones, which can be useful if you need announcements in an airport or traffic direction if you\u2019re on foot. Again, there are 20 levels of adjustment there. The Quick Attention mode can be activated by resting your hand on top of the right cup which will instantly give you ambient sound while reducing the volume of your music. The battery life reaches an impressive 30 hours of non-stop use with active noise cancellation, which will take you through not one but multiple cross-country flights or an entire week of commuting. The quick charging function is a lifesaver if you remember too late that you need to plug them in before bed. Charging via USB-C will give you an additional 5 hours of use after just 10 minutes of charging. Charging from empty will take a mere 3 hours. The touch controls on the right side of the headband allow all of your playback and calling controls right at your fingertips. Simply swipe up or down to change the volume, swipe forward or backward to skip tracks, tap once to play or pause playback, or tap twice to answer or hang up a phone call. The touch controls take a little getting used to if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re accustomed to physical buttons, but after a day of using them, they become second nature. The voice assistant compatibility comes with both Alexa and Google Assistant which can be accessed by either giving it the wake-up phrase or by pressing and holding the touch panel. Wear detection uses a proximity sensor on the left ear cup that automatically pauses audio playback when you take off the headphones and resumes playback when you put them on. This conserves battery life as well as ensures that you do not miss anything in your podcast or audiobook. The XM4 headphones come with multipoint technology that allows you to pair two different devices simultaneously. For instance, you can be connected to your laptop as well as your smartphone. The audio automatically switches from one device to another according to which is in use. At $198, you\u2019re paying less than many mid-tier noise-canceling headphones while getting performance that rivals anything on the market today, regardless of price.

If you're looking for art advice, consider asking your bank. Rebekah Bowling, an art advisor at Citi, helps ultra-high-net-worth clients in Citi Wealth manage and build their art collections and knows how hard it can be to make sense of the market. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and UBS are among the other banks offering art advice to wealthy clients. Bowling spent a decade at the global auction house Phillips, where she ran the midseason and day sales, before moving to LA and focusing in part on client development. She joined Citi in July. Her day-to-day can include keeping clients in the know about auctions, suggesting artists who might fit well in their homes or collections, or planning events. In her mind, it's not wise for anyone to buy art they don't actually enjoy \u2014 \"you will only be disappointed,\" \u2014 but she knows that many are concerned with finding artists who represent good value. For anyone who is just getting into collecting, Bowling said focusing on galleries that represent emerging artists is a good place to start. These days, Bowling said, historically underrepresented or overlooked artists are gaining attention. High-net-worth individuals were increasingly open to buying art from artists they hadn't known before, according to Art Basel and UBS's 2025 Survey of Global Collecting. Sixty-six percent bought work from artists they discovered in 2024 or 2025, a rise of 8% from the year prior. Although the art market is experiencing a downturn \u2014 global sales value decreased by 12% year-over-year, according to Art Basel and UBS' 2025 Global Art Market report \u2014 some galleries have been bucking the trend. The smallest dealers posted a 17% increase in annual sales, according to the report. Bowling told Business Insider that institutional support for artists who toe the line between fine art and craft is \"very strong, which has led to soaring prices for these artists at auction.\" Sculptor Ruth Asawa and textile artist Olga de Amaral are among those gaining traction, she said. In September, one of de Amaral's pieces sold at an auction for around $1.14 million, almost three times the low-end estimate according to Christie's. Asawa isn't underground \u2014 her retrospective recently opened at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan \u2014\u00a0but Bowling said that Kay Sekimachi is an artist who fits into the same market trend and remains somewhat under the radar. She's a fiber artist who was friends with Asawa, and her work is currently being shown at a gallery in Manhattan. The prices aren't listed on the gallery's site, but a group of three woven bowls recently sold for $3,800 at an auction in California, exceeding the high-end estimate, per Invaluable, a fine art marketplace. No matter the potential monetary gains, though, Bowling says it's crucial to be guided by taste. \"From an investing perspective, you really shouldn't buy anything that you don't love,\" she said.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"        Kirk Siegler                        A crowd gathers for some rare good news in Pacific Northwest wheat country, which has been reeling from low wheat prices and uncertainty over a trade war.                                                           Photo courtesy of Andrew Snyder, Cairnspring Mills                                       hide caption  PENDLETON, Ore. \u2014 It's hard times in America's heartland right now, where many farmers are on the brink of bankruptcy due, in part, to President Trump's trade war shutting off global sales of many of their crops.  Trump's tariffs have also made imported fertilizer and other equipment farmers rely on even more expensive amid already high inflation. But in one corner of Pacific Northwest wheat country, there are glimmers of economic hope due to the burgeoning business of \"craft flour.\" On the Umatilla Indian Reservation near Pendleton, Ore., Washington-state based Cairnspring Mills is building a new craft flour mill that will expand the company's production twelvefold and give some wheat farmers a local market for their grains. Upwards of 90% of all the wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest is exported. \"We're trying to do our little part in changing that because the commodity market is unpredictable,\" says Kevin Morse, co-founder of Cairnspring. \"It's usually a race to the bottom and not profitable.\"  Once at full production, the new mill will need about 2 million bushels of wheat a year, which is still a blip in the overall Northwest wheat market. Even though it's growing, analysts say craft flour coveted by artisan breadmakers is still a niche business.                  Steven Hart, a trustee with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, says growing up, one of the only economic drivers on the reservation was the tribal casino.

An estimated 20 jobs will be created, and the mill is promising to give Native people priority in training and hiring.  Tribal officials say it's a signal that Indian Country is open for business. \"For small communities in rural areas, there's hope,\" says Steven Hart, a trustee at large.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":" This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.       We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.      Professional blowouts at a high-end salon easily run $60 to $100 per session and if you\u2019re getting your hair done weekly, that\u2019s thousands of dollars annually for results that last just a few days. Dyson just dropped the Supersonic Origin hair dryer to $299 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $419 price, and at this all-time low, you\u2019re paying the equivalent of three to five salon visits for a tool that delivers the same professional-grade results at home for years to come. See at Amazon This isn\u2019t your average drugstore hair dryer: The Supersonic packs Dyson\u2019s digital motor V9 that spins at 110,000 RPM, intelligent heat control that measures air temperature 40 times per second, and Air Multiplier technology that amplifies airflow by three times. The key motor element of the Supersonic is Dyson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital motor V9: This motor is a brushless DC motor which is much smaller and more lightweight than traditional hair dryer motors. Typical conventional dryers place the motor in the foundation of the unit but Dyson relocated this motor to the handle of its unit. The motor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speed of 110,000 RPM has more than just show value: This speed powers an impeller which draws air into its chambers. The motor pulls this air into its chambers at a rate of 13 liters of air every second. The Air Multiplier technology is taken from Dyson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bladeless fans. The function of this technology is the induction of air from the motor and then amplifying it through a carefully created hole. This amplifies the air into a three times more powerful jet of air than the motor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capability, but this air comes from a smooth airflow. For this reason, it becomes capable of drying your hair sections quickly without releasing it all over the place. The area where the Dyson Supersonic differs from more affordable models is heat control: The unit comes equipped with a glass bead thermistor sensor located in the airflow that tracks the temperature of the air up to 40 times every second. This information is then used by the microprocessor to make adjustments on the fly to ensure it does not reach unsafe levels. High temperatures damage hair by breaking down the protein bonds which makes it brittle, dry, and easy to break. The problem with most conventional dryers is that it can often reach temperatures above 300\u00c2\u00b0F which is damaging enough on its own: The Supersonic keeps its top speed below 230\u00c2\u00b0F. Another field that Dyson ventured into is acoustic engineering: The hair dryer is a device that has always been known to generate considerable noise levels. This happens as the motor, along with airflow, produces sound waves of undesirable frequencies that tend to cause irritation in human ears. Dyson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design of the motor ensures the generation of sound waves of frequencies higher than 16kHz\u00c2\u00a0which cannot be detected by human ears. Additionally, Dyson provided an acoustic silencer in the airflow path which serves to suppress sound waves. The outcome is a hair dryer that produces less noise than its predecessors. The Dyson Origin series has only one magnetic attachment which is the styling concentrator. The styling concentrator is used for focusing airflow which enables the user to dry or style his or her hair. The magnetic attachment system is an excellent design aspect of this series: The user can easily switch from one attachment to another without waiting for it to cool down or handling it with hot hands. For only $299, you will be paying the price of five salon blowouts but you will be gaining so much more than that. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

It's cuffing season for chipmakers. As their valuations skyrocket on the back of the AI boom, so do pay packages for employees whose compensation is tied to stock price. Some are anticipating paydays worth millions of dollars. There's one catch: Stock payouts unlock over time, rewarding employees who stay with the company longer \u2014 and penalizing those who skip out sooner. One Nvidia employee who plans to leave when their equity vests told Business Insider that doing so before would have a \"big cost,\" adding, \"If I wanted to leave now, I do not think I can command the salary I have now with another company.\" It's a tactic that tech giants, such as Amazon and Google, have used for years to retain employees. Now that chipmakers are striking big deals to meet the growing demand for powering AI, the golden handcuffs at the US's three largest \u2014 Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom \u2014 are tightening. Business Insider spoke about the impact of these packages with six current and former employees at Nvidia and Broadcom who are not authorized to speak to the press. Since both companies have over 36,000 employees receiving a variety of compensation structures, we also worked with Levels.fyi, which tracks employee compensation more broadly in Silicon Valley. It could take up to four years for some to get the full payout. However, the skyrocketing value of stock awards means some employees are already earning buckets of compensation, which in Nvidia's case has tipped some to coast into a \"semi-retirement\" mode. \"A lot of them have families,\" one Nvidia employee said, \"and they probably think logically like, 'Who am I to walk away from this job that guarantees that my kids will never have student debt?'\" The stock growth of chipmakers Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD since January 2023 has outpaced that of other tech giants, such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. \"Aside from Meta, even the 'poorest' performing AI chip company (AMD) has outpaced the rest of Big Tech in these past two years,\" said Hakeem Shibly, a data analyst at Levels.fyi. One Broadcom employee, who estimated that their restricted stock units, or RSUs, are valued at over six times their salary, said, \"Given the recent rise of the share price, people who have been able to hold on to their shares will now be looking forward to a very comfortable retirement.\" In one case, an equity package of $488,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is now worth more than $2.2 million, according to Levels data. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $265,000. Business Insider spoke to a former Broadcom employee who said they lost unvested RSUs when they were let go from the company last year. They estimate their vested RSUs are now worth half a million dollars, but if they were still at Broadcom, their total RSU package would now be worth about $3 million. In some of the user-submitted data provided by Levels.fyi, the value of several Nvidia employees' equity grants has risen over 350% since their hire date in 2023, but because they're not fully vested, they would risk walking away from more than $500,000. Likewise, at Broadcom, the grants of several employees have increased by over 300% since 2023, with many holding RSU packages worth millions, according to Levels data. Two Broadcom employees said theirs were worth over $6 million each. One Nvidia employee said RSUs have created a \"lottery winner syndrome,\" meaning that it feels unlikely to find a similarly lucrative opportunity elsewhere. \"The golden handcuffs are RSUs,\" the former Broadcom employee said. \"No one's going to put in their notice now to go to other opportunities.\" Leaders inside the chip giants are well aware of how powerful these packages are for retaining talent. Nvidia said that \"RSUs promote retention\" in its annual sustainability report and said its turnover rate has more than halved, from 5.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2025. CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy, and the company said that 20% of employees have been there for 10 years, while 40% have been there for more than five years. Likewise, Broadcom reported that its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is \"below the technology industry benchmark.\" It cited equity awards as a \"powerful long-term retention incentive,\" saying it has \"historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees.\" The Nvidia employees said that since the RSUs of longer-time employees are worth more than those of newer employees, the disparities are sometimes openly discussed. One employee said some managers who have been with the company for a long time \u2014 and whose shares are worth exponentially more \u2014 \"are just resting and vesting.\" The other employee said that those whose RSUs are worth more could be more incentivized to go above and beyond, including working more intensely or being less likely to push back in meetings. According to Levels data, Nvidia has started using a method used by Google, Uber, DoorDash, and Pinterest in recent years, which is to \"front-load\" its vesting schedules. This means employees receive the biggest chunk of their equity in their first year at the company. Similar to a signing bonus, front-loading can be a valuable tool for attracting top talent. It also ties financial rewards more closely to employee performance, as tech employees often receive additional stock awards after their first year of work. After that, if an employee's performance is poor, they're more likely to see diminished payouts. Smaller pay packages handed out at these AI hardware companies have also become incredibly lucrative. Employees may get more equity in lieu of a higher salary or bonuses \u2014 and for some of those working at the chip giants right now, that's OK. \"In private conversations I've had with others,\" another former Broadcom employee said, \"they're quite pleased with RSUs.\"                       Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. It's gotta be the shoes! Why else would people be willing to drop at least $1,100 on a pair of sneakers? I'd never shell out that much but I am tempted to go try on Wall Street's favorite pair of kicks. On the agenda today: But first: Are you leaving the money on the table? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Imagine you work for a company and your stock price has just skyrocketed. Think Nvidia, up more than 1,100% over the past few years to become a $4.5 trillion company. Or Broadcom and AMD, two other chipmakers whose shares are surging in the AI boom. Employees of these companies must be feeling pretty good right about now. What could possibly go wrong? As is often the case, though, there is a catch. In this instance, it's known as \"golden handcuffs\" \u2014 the notion of feeling stuck because it's too risky or expensive to move or change. These compensation packages often include restricted stock units, or RSUs. Those who decide to leave their companies could forfeit any unvested stock, meaning they could miss out on a substantial form of compensation \u2014 potentially worth millions of dollars. My colleagues Geoff Weiss, Hugh Langley, and Rosalie Chan wrote this weekend about the latest golden handcuff trend sweeping through Silicon Valley, particularly at the AI chip companies. In one case, they reported that an equity package of $420,000 given to an Nvidia employee in 2023 is worth almost $2 million today, citing data from Levels.fyi. Even a more modest $66,000 RSU package reported by a Broadcom employee in 2023 has jumped in value to around $267,000. Stock payouts unlock over time. Quitting before shares vest can potentially mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. Although, it's worth noting that if you quit or lose your job, those unvested RSUs disappear. Companies use restricted stock as a retention tactic. It's one that has been utilized from Wall Street to Big Tech, with a similar dynamic now occurring in the AI boom. Consider the employee churn rates at these chipmakers. Nvidia said in its annual sustainability report that its turnover rate has been cut in half over the past few years, adding that \"RSUs promote retention.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has boasted about making employees wealthy. Similarly, Broadcom said its global voluntary attrition rate last year was 6.2%, which is \"below the technology industry benchmark.\" It cited equity awards as a \"powerful long-term retention incentive.\" This is the conundrum for chipmaker employees right now. Walk away and forfeit millions for a new opportunity? Or stay? For the last 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg has been the world's Minister of Thought. Starting with Facebook, the Meta CEO has transformed how we view ourselves and each other. Now, Zuckerberg appears to be ceding that title to OpenAI's Sam Altman. ChatGPT is only three years old and has more than 800 million weekly users \u2014 about 40 times more than Facebook's audience during its first three years. If the past two decades were about curating who we are, the future may be about creating who we want to be. From pokes to prompts. Dimitri Semenikhin is the 29-year-old day trader whose thesis helped spark a massive rally in Beyond Meat. The day trader is a Moscow native who lived in Monaco and was schooled in London. He previously launched a luxury travel startup called Yacht Harbour, and is currently the CEO of his family's real-estate development firm. And while he's leaned into it at times, he said he's not Roaring Kitty 2.0. What makes Semenikhin and Beyond different. At the video-game giant Electronic Arts, management is gung-ho on AI. Workers, on the other hand, say AI is actually making their jobs harder \u2014 and they fear it could be game over if they're training their replacement. AI has been a part of video games for some time: when you play \"Madden\" you're competing against a computer-controlled team, for instance. But the modern AI affecting game design is different, and it's widening the gap between bosses and employees. Player v. player.

After Aki Ito's story on the death of workplace loyalty, Dan DeFrancesco asked newsletter readers that very question. Of the 170 people who responded, nearly twice as many chose loyalty over money. The poll's result confirmed something Aki has heard in her conversations with white-collar professionals before: the desire for a workplace built on mutual care runs so deep that people would trade real money for it.

The best things, as the saying goes, come in threes. This year, with a trio of lawsuits from national brands against retailers, the same could be said for the typically obscure area of intellectual property law known as trade dress. Earlier this summer, snack maker Mondelez sued discount grocer Aldi over several of its lookalike cookie packages. Then, Lululemon sued Costco for selling several popular apparel items. And this month, JM Smucker sued Trader Joe's for skating too close to its Smucker's Uncrustables line of frozen PB&J sandwiches. While there are nuances to each case, the phenomenon of household names battling it out in court has grabbed no shortage of attention. What's more, legal and IP experts tell Business Insider these types of cases are likely to become more common going forward, thanks to a host of marketing and consumer trends. \"Why it's getting a lot more attention now is that it's really an economic kind of issue,\" said Paul Reilly, a partner at Baker Botts who specializes in branding, advertising, and copyright issues. With rising costs, more consumers are looking for savings by shopping store brands instead of national ones. Think Costco's Kirkland Signature, Walmart's Great Value, or Target's Cat & Jack. Often called private label, these brands are owned and sold by retailers themselves, as compared with the national brands that are carried by many retailers. And shoppers are loving them. For example, Amazon and Whole Foods shoppers bought 15% more of those companies' private-label products last year compared to 2023, the company said at the launch of its new Amazon Grocery line. Data from market research firm Numerator earlier this year found that roughly a quarter of products sold are from private label brands. Effectively, all US households have purchased a private label grocery item in the past 12 months, and the popularity is still growing. \"They're looking for those comparables, and they're often finding them in store brands,\" Reilly said. Where it gets legally tricky is when a newer product's appearance starts causing genuine confusion with a more established one among shoppers. \"What it boils down to always is: Are consumers confused?\" said Mark Simpson, partner at Saul Ewing, who advises companies on intellectual property enforcement strategies. \"There's a lot of human nature involved.\" For example, lawyers for Smuckers highlighted social media posts from customers who said (incorrectly) that Uncrustables was making the Trader Joe's snacks. One factor that could be at play in the three national brands' decisions to file big lawsuits against alleged copycats is that they don't typically do business with the retailers they're suing. So, Mondelez isn't risking a customer by going after Aldi. Trader Joe's is also almost an exclusively private-label store, and Costco tends to march to a different tune than most retailers. By comparison, Walmart and Target have extensive private label portfolios, but their executives go to great lengths on earnings calls to assure national brands that their products can coexist peacefully on the same shelves. In other words, any differences between a retailer and one of its actual suppliers would likely be hashed out quietly, the legal and IP experts told Business Insider. Either way, Sharon Urias, partner and intellectual property group leader at Greenspoon Marder, says the market continues to get more competitive, which means there could be more conflicts over whether a product's appearance or packaging is confusing customers. \"Companies are really pushing the limits of what is acceptable and not acceptable in order to sell their products,\" she said. \"There is a trend of increased aggressive marketing tactics through packaging. I am seeing that in my practice as well.\" Filing a lawsuit also sends a clear message to the market: we won't tolerate dupes. \"If you don't enforce your rights, you're going to lose them,\" he added.

M$ needed brought to heel, especially back then. Microsoft got shafted by Nvidia. The high failure rate of the Xbox 360 was mostly Nvidia's fault. The PS2 was the best selling console for a long time. The Xbox didn't gain much traction in Japan, so as well as missing out on that market, if you like Japanese games it's not a great platform. You might be thinking of the Xbox360.   Nvidia wasn't playing with M$ by then. The Nvidia complaint was simple enough, M$ had forced Nvidia to lose money on their GPU supply. Ever see the inside of a 360?  It's an insanely stupid design.  The DVD drive is laying directly on top of GPU heatsink with virtually no room for airflow.  My guess is, somehow, they stress-tested the prototype without a disc spinning in the DVD drive, so they didn't account for the extra heat output by the drive.  Later models of the 360 had extra heat pipes for the GPU, but used the same full-sized DVD drive, case design, and fan tunnel.  Absurd. You could even dual boot with Linux.I had one for my kids and this was a selling point.  I don't buy sony anymore. You could even dual boot with Linux. I had one for my kids and this was a selling point.  I don't buy sony anymore. I don't really remember, but I'm sure I got it after the initial frenzy. I was never a gamer. Then I was visiting my brother and he showed me GTA3 running on a PS2 and I thought it was the funniest shit I had ever seen. I never saw a video game like that before! When I got home, I got a PS2 and Vice City.  It was the only game I had for a very long time, but it was enough. San Andreas killed it for me though. I just couldn't get into it. I'm probably just a racist. Eventually I got one of the Bauldur's Gate gam  I have a nine year old now. I'd like to play the Baulder's Gate game with him, on our 98\" TV, with minimal investment. Don't really want to buy a windows box just for that purpose. Even if I got one for free, overall, I think it would be more trouble than it's worth. I really wish you could get Gauntlet II for something like AppleTV.  Just upgrade the graphics to HDMI resolution, find a way to get two players at once on there and don't touch anything else. That would be awesome. San Andreas killed it for me though. I just couldn't get into it. I'm probably just a racist.You should play GTA V to find out. It does have a black guy in it, but it also has two white guys including a meth head. San Andreas killed it for me though. I just couldn't get into it. I'm probably just a racist.

When GTA 3 came out, I was living in a nice area of London and I had a friend visit from North America. He had plans to see all the sights and do all the things but in the end we sat in my basement and played GTA for a week straight. No regrets on either of our parts. You might say it was PS3, because Cell, but most early titles mostly ran on the PPE and used the SPEs only for graphics, which is a lot like today's systems. The PS2's architecture was super interesting, being made out of multiple weird MIPS cores glued together with an ordinary one, and in weird ways. That generation is also obviously notable for being where the writing went up on the wall for highly custom consoles, with the PC-based Xbox. Even though Microsoft themselves built a fairly interesting consol  Dreamcast was the best system of that generation and deserved a lot more success, I will die on this hill.

After years of sitting vacant, rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, sold one of his two Wyoming properties back to its original owners. West purchased a 6,713-acre ranch known as Bighorn Mountain Ranch in Greybull, Wyoming, from David and Paula Flitner for $14.495 million in 2019, according to TMZ. Wyoming local outlet Cowboy State Daily reported in October that Flitner's son Greg and his wife, Pam Flitner, bought it back. The sale was notarized in September in Zurich by Bianca Censori, West's wife, according to Cowboy State Daily. According to the listing, the property sold for $16.995 million. \"It was not listed publicly at first,\" Pam Flitner told Cowboy State Daily. \"It was just honestly a fluke that we found out it was listed, and then it was taken down again.\" While West had grand plans for his Wyoming property and was unable to fully realize them, the Flitners said he didn't cause much damage to the existing structures. The same can't be said for his other Wyoming property. \"He did not knock down \u2014 unlike Monster Ranch \u2014 he did not knock down any of the buildings,\" Pam said. \"They may need a little TLC, but they're all solid. He didn't go in with a bulldozer and take them down.\" West's other Wyoming property, which he bought for $14 million in 2019, according to People, is still on the market for $12 million. Here's a peek inside West's old Wyoming ranch. The first purchase was a 3,885-acre property called the Monster Lake Ranch in Cody, Wyoming, in September 2019. In November of the same year, he purchased Bighorn Mountain Ranch, which he sold in 2025. The recently sold ranch sits on 6,713 acres and is located less than 100 miles from the other ranch. Bighorn Mountain Ranch's listing states the property is \"completely surrounded\" by Bureau of Land Management and National Forest lands. The privacy of the ranch was probably a selling point for West. There are also three cabins that sleep up to six guests, with full bathrooms. The three-story main lodge has a wet bar in the basement and an adjoining walk-in sauna that can be used year-round. The Snowshoe Lodge also includes a garage for car and ATV storage. The Flitner family homesteaded this property in 1906 and originally called it Cow Camp, according to the listing. The listing estimates that between 1,500 and 2,000 elk use the ranch and nearby property frequently. There are also a few creeks that run through the property, offering fishing opportunities. Situated close to White Creek, the ranch is also near scenic hiking trails, canyons, meadows, and grassy hills. West's plans for Wyoming were never fully actualized, and it looks like he's leaving the state, for now. However, the Flitners understand why someone would want to build an oasis away from the spotlight. \"A lot of people have said he was a really, really good guy,\" Greg told Cowboy State Daily. \"And that he was really on task a lot of the time. So, none of us can fault him at all for buying it and trying to get something accomplished for himself.\"                    Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

For many recent graduates with limited work experience and small professional networks, finding that first full-time job can feel daunting. In a field like software engineering, standing out from hundreds of other applicants can feel especially challenging as AI coding tools take on work that used to belong to entry-level hires. This concern is top of mind for LinkedIn's VP of engineering for talent solutions, Prashanthi Padmanabhan. The VP told Business Insider that in the current job market, \"technical skills don't cut it.\" While technical expertise remains \"core\" to the job and areas like LLM development and cloud applications are rising in importance, software engineers need to demonstrate they can bring more to the table. The VP said highlighting soft skills and side projects will help candidates stand out in a crowded market. Padmanabhan said that soft skills are key to being an effective software engineer. \"You need to learn how to collaborate with different people, like a product manager, a UX designer, a marketer, to take your idea from concept to completion,\" Padmanabhan said. The executive pointed to LinkedIn's \"Skills on the Rise in Engineering\" report, a data-backed ranking based on what companies are increasingly hiring for. At the top of the list is large language model development and application \u2014 but the next three are soft skills: people management, agile problem solving, AI strategy. \"Equally important are your soft skills, like critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and teamwork,\" Padmanabhan said. \"Like, how do you really think about user experience?\" Some executives say that entry-level candidates will take on higher-level types of work as AI automates simpler tasks. In software engineering, where AI tools are being adopted more quickly, that may translate to more engineers building products rather than focusing solely on code. Coursework and certifications can help showcase technical acumen \u2014 but you may need to go a step further in this job market to show you actually learned the skills, Padmanabhan said. That's why applicants should have some kind of project to show for the coursework or certification they learned, Padmanabhan said. \"When students are graduating, they're not going to have a lot of on- the-job skills to show,\" Padmanabhan said. \"But what they can show us? How have they been up-skilling themselves?\" She said that side projects can boost a candidate's chances by showing that they applied learnings from a certification program, academic degree, or course. \"If you don't have the coding experience, but you have a brilliant idea in your head, just build something,\" Padmanabhan said. With AI tools handling more coding tasks, there's a growing expectation that anyone can build out an idea. The executive said it's becoming a part of the interview process for candidates to show off a concept that they brought to life. Padmanabhan said many students have a GitHub repository of projects they've built. Padmanabhan said she's had candidates send her surveys based on 100 peer interviews to demonstrate the reasoning behind their product idea. She said it's important to validate your hypothesis from research before you start building. Then, you \"continuously test and iterate,\" she said. \"Showing how you go about building actually matters a lot, because that's what happens in the real world,\" Padmanabhan said. \"We do user research. You do user experience studies.\" The executive said that once candidates have that kind of experience under their belt, they can use the interview to share more color about their journey.

Some see their work weeks cut to zero hours.  I think that's they are calling \"job loss\".   ... if the companies have been wanting to do it, and if they economically can do it, then whether they have a useful PR \"excuse\" or not, it's still going to happen. So long as FAANG perceived that their success was based on eternal growth and attracting the best talent money can buy, they couldn't do layoffs.  Layoffs are for old tech companies like IBM and Oracle.  We're cool...we're hip...we give free lunches and have nap pods in our office and silly, crazy perks those \"old\" companies would never do...we're cool!!!...join our club...if you don't, you're just a loser, like all those IBM-ers.  Their real fear is they'd miss the AI or whatever future hype bubble because all the cool kids would go to a competitor that doesn't downsize.  If the employer is the buyer, we're seeing a shift from a seller's market to a buyer's market.  This is both due to interest rate hikes and 2 decades of largely unchecked growth at these behemoths...Facebook has all the engineers they need to run their shitty sites...same with Google.  Prior to the rate hike, they had all they needed, but didn't want to lose top talent to their competitors.  Elon did a reckless bloodbath at Twitter a year or 2 earlier and survived, so they colluded and layed off massive amounts of dead weight at the same time.    The most charitable narrative for AI is that they're hoping future AI will increase productivity enough that their existing staff would be able to add workload instead of adding headcount.  Everyone who has used these AI tools knows it doesn't actually increase productivity tangibly enough to change your staffing.

As regards IBM it was earlier than that, though they disguised it a bit. The first layoffs were actually some people at an IBM printer factory in Lexington, Kentucky. Hence Lexmark printers. Must have been around 1983? Major discussion topic during one of my early stints at the big blue place... It wasn't the first time IBM had sold (or shut down) a factory (or office), but it was the first time when the IBM employees were not given any option to remain with the company.

In some cases it's one thing, in some cases it's the other, in some it's even both \u2014 someone is looting a company and the people they're replacing are crucial. They can claim they were suckered in by AI companies' promises. I agree with you and I want to add some examples. Here is a story from 2016 how a cucumber farmer automated cucumber sorting with AI. I want to mention this, because many think that only LLMs are AI, but there are much simpler implementations of AI also that replace tasks and those have been around for a long time. Replaced tasks mean less need for workers:  https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/... [google.com]  Bigger example would be Amazon. If Amazon didn't have robots and AI doing work in their warehouses, they would have to em At least in my direct experinece, I've not been surprised by any of the cuts made that I see. AI is a likely excuse, but you'll find direct attribution from official sources scarce. Most of these cuts are performance based. Companies are getting lean, and if you're not going to lean in or are in core business adjacent roles, you're on the block. At the same time large swaths of customer service reps are being replaced. The quality of the customer service doesn't matterThe quality never mattered.  That is why they are being replaced. At the same time large swaths of customer service reps are being replaced.

I don't think a world run by average people would be better. It is not just layoffs. Everything good that is happening, is happening because of AI. Better sales, better efficiency, better bottom line etc, all because of AI. Why, because everyone will buy it. Otherwise you have to provide another story, and it might attract scrutiny. Of course they're blaming AI for headcount cuts now... the \"COVID excuse\" ran out by mid 2021, and the \"inflation excuse\" became stale by 2024. I guess that you could use the \"tariff excuse\", but then you risk offending Trump supporters. So... AI it is! Skilled jobs (engineers for example) being replaced by AI will be filled with warm bodies again, but in lower cost centres of excellence such as Romania, India, China. The work from home experience has shown that it's perfectly reasonable to have teams spread over different time zones due to tools like MS Teams that make collaboration easy. I'd not want the project manager role, though, with conf. calls at 5AM and 8PM... I\u2019d say the answer lies in those left behind still doing the very-much-still human jobs that require more than a ToddlerAI touch.  Are they cruising along just fine without their human co-workers lost to typhoon RIF and hurricane Headcount?  Today\u2019s Human Stress index reading Fully Medicated, says hell no. Are we seeing stock-padding whispershit talk in America like 996 schedules?  The Seasoned Slack Picker Uppers getting screwed out of life itself working sloppy second and third shifts barely aw  I have heard several claims that the only real jobs the AI can cut are Middle Management jobs.   AI is supposedly really good 95% of the time for their work, and the 5% of time they get it wrong, good Upper Management can stop the problem before it gets too big. Some people say it can also do it for upper management with the CEO acting as the break.  But no one seriously thinks upper management is going to replace themselves. ...to do all of the things that the hypemongers predict.Expert workers selectively use AI tools where they are genuinely helpful.Clueless noobs believe the fiction that they can \"vibe code\" their way to riches.Clueless executives believe the hype pitched by lying salesweasels and pay way too much for immature tech that fails to work as promised.Add to that the overall economic chaos and it's not surprising to see the results.It's complicated When question includes multiple variables and suggests that they're mutually exclusive when they're not, the answer is \"yes, all of the variables\". Job cuts are the responsibility of the decision-makers who decide to make those job cuts, not some piece of technology being used by the company. Assigning responsibility to AI is no different than assigning responsibility to hard drives. It seems like we'd be seeing lots of startups with only one or two employees (CEO \/ CFO), with an AI workforce - which doesn't seem to be the case. We DO hear about a lot of \"AI\" startups, but they boil down to marketing - selling repackaged \/ customized versions of ChatGPT and the like. Interestingly, if AI lived up to the hype, those startups we don't see would staff their CEO \/ CFO with AI first.  If you had limited \"super-human intelligence\" wouldn't you want to apply it to the post important decisions of a startup first? Meanwhile, all we really see being replaced by AI is propaganda generation.  Society is evolving to be non-merit-based, the best liar wins.  The best liars will be AI-assisted, the best truth-tellers won't be. AI was largely responsible for the job cuts, because it gave companies a good excuse to cut their belly flab and make them appear like they were at the cutting edge of AI, giving their stock prices a big boost and a great quarterly bonus to their executives. The companies would have made the job cuts regardless. Stating that they were due to AI was a move to save the executives' jobs, not the reason for the layoffs. By blaming AI, the executives could claim to the financial backers that they were finding efficiencies, rather than failing to meet their goals.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"There are numerous automotive engine configurations, from the 4-cylinder variety all the way up to 16-cylinder engines, which are extremely cool but have only been used in a few production cars. While it might seem like more cylinders is always better, many auto manufacturers have been getting impressive performance out of smaller turbocharged powerplants. Take, for instance, the Dodge Hurricane engine \u2014 the standard version produces up to 420 horsepower, which eclipses both the 5.7-liter and 6.4-liter Hemi V8s. So, if a more compact 4-cylinder can offer drivers an impressive power output, what about a 3-cylinder engine? Well, first off, 3-cylinders under the hood isn't a new idea, and they have been available in various economy vehicles in Japan for some time. But these small engines are finally making it Stateside, with select Buick, Chevrolet, and Nissan models offering 3-cylinder motors. As you may expect, 3-cylinder engines are more efficient than their larger brethren and sip fuel rather than guzzle it, which is a definite plus. However, they do tend to generate more vibration during operation, and they aren't suited for quick acceleration at higher speeds. Let's examine this compact engine configuration further, weighing the positives and negatives to help you determine if it's a good fit for your next vehicle. The obvious reason that 3-cylinder engines are more conservative with fuel than a 4-banger is that there is one less cylinder creating combustion. However, that's not the only reason for the enhanced efficiency. Fewer internal components results in a smaller engine footprint. And, more importantly, this results in a reduction of weight, which can have a significant impact on fuel economy. However, it's important to note that some assert that\u00a0miles per gallon isn't actually a good way to measure fuel economy\u00a0and point to gallons used per 100 miles as a better metric. Regardless, according to the U.S. Dept. of Energy, 100 extra pounds can lower miles per gallon as much as 2%, with smaller cars being more effected than larger vehicles. So, especially in a compact vehicle, the lighter engine contributes to better gas mileage. For example, the 2026 Chevy Trax \u2014 a subcompact SUV that sports a turbocharged inline 3-cylinder engine \u2014 tips the scales at just over 3,000 pounds and achieves a combined EPA estimated fuel economy of 30 mpg. The 2025 Honda HR-V EX-L, on the other hand, features an inline 4-cylinder engine\u00a0under the hood, is more than 260 pounds heavier, and gets a combined 27 miles per gallon. If you're looking for a car that feels buttery smooth while the engine idles, you'll want to avoid a 3-cylinder. These smaller engines run in a way that feels noticeably less refined than other configurations, due to the odd number of cylinders. The firing order is such that there is one cylinder firing during a rotation and then two going off in the next. This creates the perception that things under the hood aren't healthy, but it's just a quirk of the design. This is in comparison to how a 4-cylinder runs, where each rotation features\u00a0two cylinders firing in an even operation. While some turbocharged 3-cylinders like the Chevy Trax can manage a decent 0-60 time in 8.8 seconds, things are different on the highway. These smaller engines don't have gusto at higher RPMs and are lackluster in terms of power on the freeway. Also, it isn't just idling where these compact engines sound rough, it's also during acceleration. So, not only will you potentially struggle to pass another motorist on the highway, but your car won't sound particularly good doing it, either. When you drop an engines cylinder count to three, there aren't as many moving parts generating friction. Any time you have metal surfaces contacting each other, there will be something called mechanical friction loss. Essentially, as metal components rub against one another, heat is generated. This heat represents the energy used and lost\u00a0as engine components work against each other's surface resistance. This is present even when fluids and lubrication are at optimal levels. However, with one less cylinder, these compact engines not only use less fuel because of the reduced friction, but it could also translate into lower maintenance costs. Essentially, an engine with fewer moving parts has less potential points of failure. Many drivers fail to consider the price of their vehicles beyond the initial purchase. Just look at these car brands that cost the most to maintain and repair over 10 years according to Consumer Reports\u00a0for an idea of how bad things can get. Depending on the 3-cylinder, it could offer a less complex design than a 4-cylinder, potentially saving you money.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"Thanks to Kalshi, a so-called prediction market, sports betting is now legal everywhere\u2014even where it isn\u2019t. Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. Americans who want to bet on sports have many options. There\u2019s DraftKings, FanDuel, ESPN Bet, Caesars, and BetMGM. There\u2019s also BetRivers, Hard Rock, bet365, Fanatics, and Bally Bet. But none of those platforms are available in the 17 states where online sports betting remains illegal, including California and Texas. Kalshi, a prediction market, doesn\u2019t have that limitation. Gamblers can use it to wager on the outcome of sporting events in all 50 states. That\u2019s because, in the eyes of American law, Kalshi is not a gambling company at all; it\u2019s an exchange that facilitates the trading of legitimate financial products. Over the past year, the company has added sports to the range of events that can be wagered on, while arguing that it is beyond the reach of any state-level gambling ban. It maintains that it can be regulated only by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But under the second Trump administration, the CFTC has shown no interest in cracking down. The result is that sports betting is now legal everywhere\u2014even in the states where it isn\u2019t. Futures contracts have been around in the United States since the late 1800s. Midwestern farmers planted and harvested grain at roughly the same time every year, and then everyone went to Chicago to sell. This sudden abundance of grain would cause prices to plummet. Middlemen swooped in to help. They\u2019d buy the grain and store it nearby, selling it for a profit in the winter. This helped to stabilize prices, but some buyers wanted more certainty: a set amount of grain at a set price at a set date, so they could plan ahead. Middlemen obliged, writing contracts for the future delivery of grain. Soon after, people began trading the contracts. A bakery might buy a grain contract from a distillery. Farmers could buy the contracts, too, to hedge their bets: A Michigan farmer might buy a grain contract from a Wisconsin farmer, so that if Michigan had a bad harvest, he\u2019d still have some grain to sell. Speculators joined the party. If the cereal market was growing, a savvy market-watcher might notice, scooping up grain contracts that would be worth more later. That serves a useful economic function. Without these middlemen, the price of grain might stay artificially low for a long time, and then spike once everyone notices the growth. The speculator provides liquidity and, with it, stability. Keith O\u2019Brien: Sports can\u2019t survive prop bets At some level, the speculator is gambling. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is betting on whether the price of grain will go up or down,\u201d Karl Lockhart, a law professor who studies prediction markets, told me. As futures markets matured, states tried to step in, and politicians introduced anti-options bills. The federal government, however, intervened repeatedly to save the nascent industry. \u201cIt seems to us an extraordinary and unlikely proposition that the dealings which give its character to the great market for future sales in this country are to be regarded as mere wagers,\u201d Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote in a 1905 decision. With the government\u2019s blessing, the futures market continued to evolve. People began trading currency futures in the \u201970s, betting on the fluctuations of the pound or the franc or the Mongolian tugrik. Soon after, markets were created allowing banks to buy and sell bets on future interest rates. The banks were hedging, much like the hypothetical Michigan farmer\u2014if interest rates went up, they\u2019d be hurt, so they would bet on interest rates going up, and then their losses wouldn\u2019t be so big. Other financial firms would take the other side of the bet. Were they gambling? Maybe, but they were also helping banks stay solvent. Hedging opportunities are everywhere, and they don\u2019t always require a contract to buy or sell an underlying asset. In what\u2019s known as an event contract, a company might bet on a specific adverse development, such as its competitors merging. Kalshi, founded in 2018, specializes in event contracts, a category that it interprets very broadly. (The word kalshi means \u201ceverything\u201d in Arabic.) When Tarek Mansour, the company\u2019s CEO and one of its co-founders, was interning at Goldman Sachs in 2016, he told me, clients would ask the bank to design a way to hedge against Brexit or a Donald Trump presidency. (Imagine you run a company that makes offshore wind turbines, Trump\u2019s least favorite thing in the world. If you had bet on a Trump victory last year, you\u2019d be in better financial shape now.) Political betting was technically illegal, though the government tolerated it in small amounts, on sites run by academics and nonprofits for research purposes. Then, in 2023, Kalshi declared its intention to introduce political markets in which users could bet on which party would control Congress. The Biden-era CFTC decided Kalshi\u2019s political expansion was prohibited because it involved \u201cgaming and activity that is unlawful under state law\u201d and was \u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u201d Kalshi challenged the CFTC\u2019s order in federal court. The judge ruled in Kalshi\u2019s favor, reasoning that if betting on elections were to count as gambling, then so would betting on the weather, or a merger, or an earnings report, or interest rates. At issue, fundamentally, was where the line between gambling and investing really lies. The Biden CFTC appealed the court\u2019s ruling. Kalshi, in its response to the appeal, tried to make the boundary between futures trades and gambling clearer. (After Trump took office, the CFTC would drop the appeal.) A bet is gambling only \u201cif it is contingent on a game or a game-related event,\u201d Kalshi\u2019s lawyers at Milbank and Jones Day argued in a filing last November. \u201cThe classic example is a contract on the outcome of a sporting event.\u201d Political betting isn\u2019t gambling, the argument went. Sports betting is gambling\u2014and that\u2019s not what Kalshi was offering its customers. Less than three months later, Kalshi announced that customers could bet on the Super Bowl. When I asked about this discrepancy, Mansour told me that the legal filing had been written by \u201coutside counsel\u201d and that what it expressed was \u201cnot our view.\u201d Today, Kalshi is mostly a sports-betting company, but one whose users can live anywhere and need to be at least 18 years old, rather than the typical 21. Since football season started, early last month, sports betting has accounted for more than 90 percent of the activity on the platform. A freshly signed licensing deal with the NHL allows Kalshi to use team logos and names instead of soliciting bets on \u201cNew York J at Cincinnati,\u201d as it still does for football. Kalshi users can wager on more than just the outcome of a game. A football bettor, for example, could bet on the margin of victory, how many passing yards one of the quarterbacks will have, or how many rushing yards one of the running backs will have. They could even combine these three bets into a parlay, where the odds of winning are lower, but the payout for winning is higher. Kalshi calls this a \u201ccombo,\u201d perhaps to avoid using the no-no gambling term parlay. Charles Fain Lehman: Legalizing sports gambling was a huge mistake The day after Kalshi rolled out its combos, the stock prices of DraftKings and FanDuel\u2019s parent company each fell more than 10 percent. Kalshi knows that investors and customers think of it as a gambling company; in fact, its advertising encourages them to. One Kalshi social-media ad announces \u201cBREAKING NEWS: SPORTS BETTING IN TEXAS IN NOW LEGAL\u201d and that \u201cKalshi has legalized sports betting in all 50 states.\u201d (When I asked Mansour about this kind of advertising, he said, \u201cThe minute we basically saw them, we basically took them down.\u201d This type of ad was first spotted in February, and Kalshi re-upped them as recently as last month.) Kalshi insists that it is not a sportsbook, but rather an exchange that matches buyers and sellers of legitimate event contracts. Some of the events just happen to be sports, rather than mergers. A sportsbook makes money when you lose, which puts its incentives directly at odds with the interests of the user. Kalshi, by contrast, makes its money from fees. Even setting aside the formalism of the distinction, this argument is undermined by the fact that a subsidiary, Kalshi Trading, does take bets against customers. So does a partner, Susquehanna International Group, which provides a \u201cmarket making\u201d service for Kalshi by being on the other side of users\u2019 bets. The same goes for Kalshi\u2019s army of decentralized market makers who are compensated in return for providing \u201cliquidity\u201d to the market. All of these entities make money when ordinary users lose their bets. Tim Ford is a sports bettor on Kalshi. He uses an algorithm to determine probabilities for game outcomes, then buys or sells contracts that deviate from those probabilities. He has made more than $100,000 over the past month this way, according to Kalshi\u2019s public leaderboard. (His handle is CSPTRADINGonX.) Ford, who lives in Texas, doesn\u2019t defend the morality of Kalshi\u2019s end run around the state\u2019s gambling laws. But without the company, he would be significantly poorer. \u201cAt the end of the day, they are certainly effective,\u201d he told me. Kalshi facilitates more than $900 million in bets a week, keeping a steep percentage in fees (more than 5 percent for a $20 bet). Earlier this month, it announced that it had raised more than $300 million at a $5 billion valuation; now investors are trying to get in at a $10 to $12 billion valuation. The personal-investing platform Robinhood has embedded Kalshi\u2019s prediction markets into its savings app. Kalshi\u2019s rise has not been without controversy. Last November, FBI agents raided the home of the CEO of Polymarket, Kalshi\u2019s biggest competitor. Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, was being investigated for allegedly allowing Americans to use its platform in violation of a settlement with the CFTC. (In July, the company said that the probe had been dropped, and the CFTC has since declared that it can legally operate.) Following the raid, two white Kalshi employees persuaded the retired NFL player Antonio Brown to tweet \u201cthis nigga seem guilty.\u201d (\u201cThis was a mistake,\u201d Mansour told me.) If Kalshi\u2019s marketing can be disorganized, its legal strategy is not. To help navigate the regulatory environment, Kalshi employs Donald Trump Jr. as a strategic adviser, and has hired as its lawyer the Democratic superstar Neal Katyal, who has argued in front of the Supreme Court more than 50 times. The company argues that it\u2019s not subject to state gambling bans, because they are preempted by the presence of federal law regulating futures contracts. That argument is being tested in court. In response to cease and desist letters, Kalshi sued Nevada, New Jersey, and Maryland in the spring, asking courts to prevent the states from cracking down on them. According to Andrew Kim, a lawyer who has been tracking the litigation, the company has since added Ohio to the list and has been sued by the state of Massachusetts, three Indian tribes in California as well as one in Wisconsin, and private plaintiffs in seven states. In at least two instances, Kalshi has won preliminary injunctions to allow it to keep operating while the cases proceed. If states can\u2019t stop so-called prediction markets from facilitating sports betting, who can? According to Kalshi, no one besides the CFTC (or, in theory, Congress). The company classifies the transactions on its platform not as wagers but as \u201cswaps,\u201d which the post\u2013Great Recession Dodd-Frank financial reform law charges the CFTC with regulating. To qualify as a swap under the law, the event being bet on must be of \u201cpotential financial, economic, or commercial consequence.\u201d This requirement has led Kalshi to interesting places. Super Bowl bets must be swaps, Kalshi\u2019s lawyers argue, because the winning team generates additional revenue. Whether a player scores a touchdown in a particular game, Mansour told me, has economic consequences for the player\u2019s sponsorship deal. Even parlays have economic consequences, Mansour explained, because sportsbooks offer parlays and could use Kalshi to hedge by taking the other side of the bet. If Kalshi\u2019s bets are swaps, then regulating them is the CFTC\u2019s job and no one else\u2019s. This is very convenient for Kalshi. Four of the five CFTC commissioners have resigned since January, and the last one remaining on the commission, which is bipartisan by law, is a Republican who announced she\u2019d leave as soon as Trump\u2019s pick for chair, Brian Quintenz, was confirmed. Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, is on the board of Kalshi. On September 30, the eve of the government shutdown, there was finally some action. Six senators posted an open letter to the acting chair of the CFTC asking her to stop allowing sports-prediction markets. Trump pulled his nomination of Quintenz after the Winklevoss brothers told him that Quintenz would be too hard on crypto. And CFTC staff issued their first guidance on sports-prediction markets. In a letter to all approved exchanges, they wrote that they \u201care aware that certain registered entities and registrants are listing or facilitating the trading or clearing of sports-related event contracts, or may be interested in the future in doing so.\u201d Their advice? \u201cState regulatory actions and pending and potential litigation, including enforcement actions, should be accounted for with appropriate contingency planning, disclosures, and risk management policies and procedures.\u201d The letter perfectly closed the buck-passing loop. States had tried to regulate sports-prediction markets. The courts had suggested that responsibility belongs to the federal government. Now the federal government was telling the sports-prediction markets to beware of the states and the courts. For now, the industry, its investors, and its gamblers are in limbo. If they\u2019d like to hedge, Polymarket is taking bets on whether the Supreme Court will accept a case on sports-event contracts by July 2026.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"In October of 2025,\u00a0Toyota Motor Corporation and\u00a0Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. announced that the two companies have inked a joint development agreement to mass produce the cathode materials that will go into solid-state batteries that will be used in Toyota's electric vehicles (EVs). Toyota plans to launch these EVs with their solid-state batteries into the market in the 2027 to 2028 time frame. The promise of solid-state batteries and how they work is that the EVs using them will be the next generation of battery technology, going far beyond the capabilities of current liquid-based batteries. Solid-state batteries, made of a cathode, an anode, and a solid electrolyte, have been promoted as offering higher output, longer driving range, quicker charging times, and extended battery life.\u00a0Solid-state batteries are also touted as being smaller\u00a0and therefore lighter than liquid-based batteries, with a greatly reduced risk of EV fires, which is a hard battle firefighters face. Toyota and Sumitomo have been working together on solid-state battery research since 2021 and have overcome the issue of degradation of the cathode material during an EV's many charging and discharging cycles, using Sumitomo's powder synthesis technology. The result is a\u00a0\"highly durable cathode material\" for solid-state batteries. Between now and 2027-28, the two companies will be working to reduce the costs of solid-state batteries for mass production by improving the cathode material's safety, quality, and performance. This joint effort by Toyota and Sumitomo is more than just a technology development. It is an attempt by Japanese manufacturers to get back some of the EV momentum that has been lost to China. China is now the world's leading manufacturer of electric vehicles and has announced its plans to produce semi-solid-state batteries, which use less liquid electrolyte but are not pure solid-state batteries.\u00a0South Korea has also built up a lead over Japan in the race to produce EVs that are accepted by the world market.\u00a0 Toyota and the other Japanese manufacturers now realize that the home country must build a supply chain that can provide solid-state batteries for the next generation of EVs, whether they will be produced in Japan or in other Japanese-owned factories around the world. The total amount of Japanese investment in this domestic supply chain, by Toyota and other companies, is $7 billion. Toyota has also announced an alliance with Idemitsu, a large Japanese oil company. Idemitsu is building a factory capable of producing\u00a01,000 metric tons of lithium sulfide, an essential solid-state battery component, each year. Interestingly, the Idemitsu lithium sulfide plant also plans to manufacture solid-state batteries in 2027.\u00a0While these developments are promising by themselves, there are still many obstacles to be overcome as manufacturers rush to embrace solid-state batteries for their EVs, including the complexities of making them, expensive production costs, and where the solid-state battery materials will come from.\u00a0","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has a history of notable rallies. The stock increased by over 30% in less than two months during critical years such as 2010 and 2024, and even achieved a rare rally exceeding 50% in 2025 as investors became more optimistic about the company\u2019s prospects in the generative AI era.  This kind of momentum underscores the possibility for swift gains. If the past is any indication, certain catalysts may propel Alphabet shares to new impressive heights, benefiting investors who take advantage of these significant upswings.

It is certainly beneficial if the fundamentals are strong. For in-depth information on GOOGL, read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock. Below are some key figures. When considering the risk for GOOGL, it is useful to examine how much it declined during significant market downturns. The most substantial decline occurred during the Global Financial Crisis, which saw a decrease of approximately 65%. The Inflation Shock in 2022 also caused shares to fall by about 44%. The Covid pandemic led to a drop of nearly 31%, and even the correction in 2018 was significant, with a 23% decline. These figures illustrate that while GOOGL performs well on fundamentals, it is not insulated when markets become unfavorable. Drawdowns of this magnitude are essential to consider, even for major companies. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices.

A group of Democratic lawmakers wants to test a new kind of social safety net: a monthly paycheck provided by the federal government to spend however you want. New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said she is reintroducing a bill to establish a three-year guaranteed basic income pilot program that would offer a cohort of Americans across the country a no-strings-attached monthly payment \u2014 enough to cover rent for a two-bedroom home. \"Events like the Coronavirus Pandemic, economic fluctuations, and increasing automation and job losses threaten to wipe out what little savings they have, to finally push them to homelessness, to reinforce the fact that in the wealthiest nation in the world, too many families are just a single mishap away from financial devastation,\" Watson Coleman said in a press release. The legislation is called the Guaranteed Income Pilot Program Act of 2025. A guaranteed basic income is when the government distributes recurring and unrestricted payments to a certain demographic. It differs from a universal basic income, which would provide payments to an entire population. Many US cities have already experimented with guaranteed basic income programs to varying degrees of success. According to the bill, which is co-sponsored by nine other lawmakers, the pilot program would involve 20,000 people between 18 and 65 years old. Of that group, 10,000 would receive monthly payments equal to the \"fair market\" rent on a two-bedroom home where they live, or a similar amount to be determined by Health and Human Services. The other half would be the control group. The lawmakers said the proposed basic income would not only insulate Americans from economic instability but also from the potential impact of the AI revolution. \"Increasing automation and advancing AI have the potential to expand human flourishing. However, the concentration of control of those technologies into the hands of a few billionaires may mean the eventual loss of the livelihoods of millions of Americans,\" the lawmakers said in the press release. AI leaders such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have long supported the idea of a universal basic income in response to AI. Altman helped fund a large basic income study that ended last year. Passing such legislation would be a major lift in today's political climate. While Democrats generally support a basic income, some Republicans have criticized the cost of running the programs and raised concerns that it could discourage Americans from working. Some state legislators controlled by Republicans have sought to prevent basic income experiments in their states. Representatives for Rep.

Looking for a solid laptop that won\u2019t drain your bank account? HP just dropped one of the most aggressive deals we\u2019ve seen this year on Amazon: The HP 14-inch laptop with a full year of Office 365 included is now sitting at $279, slashed from its typical $799 price tag. You read that right, a 65% discount that makes this machine cheaper than most bare-bones budget laptops on the market. This configuration packs an Intel Processor N150, 4GB RAM, 256GB total storage and a full docking station with 8 ports. HP couldn\u2019t offer such a steep reduction on their official site, so they\u2019re quietly moving inventory through Amazon where the real laptop deals happen. See at Amazon Most people don\u2019t need a powerhouse machine that costs over a grand. You need something that boots up fast, handles your daily tasks without freezing, and doesn\u2019t die halfway through your workday. This HP 14 checks all those boxes with surprising competence. Under the hood, you\u2019ve got an Intel Processor N150 that can turbo up to 3.6 GHz when you need that extra push. That\u2019s a quad-core chip with four threads and 6 MB of cache which translates to smooth performance when you\u2019re juggling browser tabs, editing documents or video calling with your team. It\u2019s not built for gaming or heavy video editing, but for work and light content creation, it handles everything without the annoying lag. What\u2019s more, you\u2019re getting 4GB of DDR4 RAM which is honestly the bare minimum for comfortable multitasking in Windows 11, but it\u2019s enough for most everyday scenarios like working in Office apps, streaming content, and managing emails. The storage solution is interesting because HP splits it between 128GB of internal flash storage and includes a 128GB Micro SD card in the package. This gives you 256GB total to work with, and you can keep your operating system and programs on the internal drive while using the SD card for documents. The battery life is another strong point here: HP claims it lasts through a full day of work or study, and based on the specs and the efficiency of the N150 processor, that\u2019s believable. No more hunting for outlets in coffee shops or lecture halls. The connectivity is surprisingly good given it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a laptop of this price: You get the benefits of Wi-Fi 6, which is the latest standard for quick and stable wireless networking. The port selection is genuinely impressive. There\u2019s a USB Type-C port capable of 10Gbps transfer speeds, two USB Type-A ports for your legacy devices, HDMI 1.4b for connecting to external displays, and an SD card reader. But here\u2019s where it gets better: HP bundles an 8-in-1 docking station that expands your connectivity even further. You also get an additional USB Type-C port, an RJ-45 ethernet port for wired connections, two more USB 3.0 ports, both SD and Micro SD card slots, a headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port. That docking station alone would cost you $30 to $50 separately, and it transforms this laptop into a legitimate workstation when you\u2019re at your desk. The laptop comes pre-loaded with Windows 11 Home S mode. Windows S mode is a stripped-down version of Windows that will not install anything from outside the Microsoft store. The good news is you can switch out of S mode for free if you need to install traditional desktop programs. The best part of the whole deal is the addition of Office 365, an entire year of it. This costs a staggering amount of $69.99 annually: It provides users with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook as well as 1TB of cloud storage via OneDrive. For a student or a professional using office tools, this itself provides an amazing amount of worth to an immense portion of the purchase price.

HLTH is one of the biggest and flashiest healthcare conferences of the year, so it's no surprise that 2025's edition delivered the health AI hype in full force. But beneath the sheen lurked mounting AI fatigue, fears of formidable new competitors, and a plaguing awareness of an AI bubble. Healthcare VC is facing many of the same boons, and the same predicaments, as the tech world, albeit hundreds of billions of dollars short. Investors are pouring money into top startups promising enterprise savings, while critics fear those tools won't pay off as expected. Big Tech companies like Google and Microsoft, as well as new AI juggernauts like OpenAI and Anthropic, are threatening to snap up startup business. And complaints are growing that key markets, like hospital administrative AI, have become oversaturated. At this year's HLTH in Las Vegas, those tensions hid under plenty of buoyancy. On the conference floor, companies touting AI agents were ubiquitous. \"Your data. Our agents. Real outcomes,\" healthcare AI unicorn Innovaccer's booth read. Public voice tech company SoundHound suggested I \"say hi to our agentic AI agents for healthcare.\" Enterprise AI startup Regal's booth promised a free popsicle to anyone who called its phone number to talk to its voice AI agents. The show floor also boasted a massive \"AI Zone,\" complete with an \"AI Theater\" for startup presentations, distinctions that felt redundant at an event where AI was inescapable. To some attendees, the sameness was exhausting. \"Everyone is framing themselves as the most generic, enterprise-wide agentic AI solution. It makes me want to vomit,\" said one health system executive, who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak with the media. \"I get it, you want to tell this cool story about how many things you can do. But I need to know what your company actually delivers, today, in the real world.\" The apparent glut of homogenous startups wasn't surprising given the amount of capital going to healthcare AI. According to Rock Health, digital health startups raked in $6.4 billion in VC dollars in the first half of 2025, with 62% of that funding going to AI startups. But incumbent competitors are further complicating that investor optimism. While medical records giant Epic was conspicuously absent from the show floor, its presence loomed large. Epic said in August it planned to sell its own healthcare AI tools, including an AI scribe to compete with Abridge, the $5.3 billion startup that Business Insider reported Epic previously took a stake in \u2014 before selling those shares earlier this year. And, for the first time, an OpenAI executive joined Big Tech giants on HLTH's main stage. Nate Gross, OpenAI's new healthcare lead, didn't share many specifics about the company's healthcare plans during his panel with Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia on Tuesday; Gross only joined OpenAI in June, and the AI giant's healthcare product efforts are still early days. But investors and founders are already feeling the heat. \"In my portfolio, people view OpenAI and Anthropic much more as a threat than people have ever viewed Amazon or Microsoft,\" said Blake Wu, a partner at NEA. \"I think that's because OpenAI and Anthropic have just moved a lot faster than Amazon and Microsoft in expanding into every category.\" At times, HLTH is an oxymoron. The entire conference, from its daytime presentations to evening cocktail hours, takes place in the audacious Venetian Resort. The convention center is connected to a sprawling casino, carrying the faint clink of poker chips and the smell of cigarette smoke into pitch meetings. If gambling's not your thing, you can always ascend an escalator and ride a gondola in the hotel's indoor canal. And, as attendees often joke, you can easily spend HLTH's three-day run without ever seeing the sun. The show floor, even aside from the AI glitz, is just as ostentatious as the resort. This year, founders and investors could play pickleball at a WeightWatchers court in between booths, pet dogs at a puppy park sponsored by Zelis Healthcare, and take pictures with one of several inflatable or costumed unicorns. \"It's like the Dreamforce of healthcare,\" said Karen Knudsen, the CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. AI's presence in every panel, company booth, and sidebar conversation only added to the feeling of superabundance. Healthcare hasn't seen the same degree of AI bubble concerns roiling the broader tech ecosystem, seemingly because healthcare VCs haven't thrown nearly as much capital at industry-specific AI, and have mostly avoided the eye-popping valuation multiples. But VCs haven't been shy about backing new healthcare AI bets, either. On Monday, medical AI search startup OpenEvidence announced it had raised $200 million at a $6 billion valuation. It was the biggest raise announced at HLTH, but certainly not the only one. Hyro, the \"responsible AI agent platform,\" landed $45 million in a funding round led by Healthier Capital, the VC firm helmed by former One Medical CEO Amir Dan Rubin. Some investors defended healthcare AI's fundraising boom heartily. Dr. Brenton Fargnoli, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, said during an investor panel Tuesday that he's seeing some healthcare startups \"growing faster than you've ever seen before, more efficiently than any company ever before.\" For those AI-first startups, \"I think as much capital as possible is very important to grow a business and get as much market share as possible,\" said GV general partner Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Dame in the same panel. But that philosophy worries some other investors, including now that incumbents like medical records giant Epic and AI heavyweights like OpenAI are planning their own healthcare AI plays. Anthropic is pushing further into biotech and pharma \u2014 the company released Claude for Life Sciences on Monday \u2014 while OpenAI is nodding at potential pushes into consumer health and hospital AI. As Gross noted on his Tuesday panel, ChatGPT now sees around 800 million active users per week, a customer base unthinkable to any single healthcare company. Consumers, as well as clinicians, are increasingly asking ChatGPT their medical questions. As those users keep coming back to ChatGPT to seek more healthcare information over time, \"the real value comes from when you have a longitudinal relationship with that patient or that consumer so that the answers themselves can be improved,\" Gross said. Not all hospital stakeholders are sold that OpenAI or Anthropic can win big in healthcare. After all, Big Tech has tried to disrupt the industry many times, with a graveyard of health projects to show for it. \"I've seen a lot of really great technologies fail from other industries because they don't understand how it works in healthcare,\" said Mary Beth Navarra-Sirio, vice president of market development at UPMC Enterprises, the innovation and investment arm of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. \"You could have the best technology in the world, but if you really don't understand how it needs to support a clinical process, you won't win in this space.\" This year's HLTH attendees made friends by commiserating about the conference's sheer volume of AI mentions. In a LinkedIn post that by Friday had over 1,600 reactions, healthcare marketing advisor Brett Jansen wrote, \"Every booth at HLTH sounds exactly the same. 'AI-powered platform for healthcare transformation.' Cool. So is literally everyone else here.\" HLTH's organizers themselves acknowledged the problem in a panel titled \"If Everything is AI, Then Nothing is AI.\" \"The AI gold rush has reached its peak, where every startup with a ChatGPT integration is suddenly an 'AI company' and every pitch deck is seasoned with enough machine learning buzzwords to make a computer science professor cringe,\" the panel description read. Still, there were plenty of bright spots of AI's impact in healthcare. Several attendees noted biotech and pharma's prominent presence at this year's conference, an event typically dominated by healthtech. AI leaders from GSK, Novartis, and the cancer research center City of Hope told Business Insider in a Tuesday panel that they're embedding AI across their operations, seeing particular benefits for better, faster research and clinical trial recruitment. Women's health led several onstage conversations, a welcome sight for many industry advocates who've seen the sector be overlooked time and time again by researchers and investors. New winners in areas like menopause care are leading the charge: JPMorgan digital ads featuring Midi Health CEO Joanna Strober lit up in the conference's main hallway. And in an industry where the stakes of AI hallucination are so high, more healthcare organizations are pushing for careful AI development. Spring Health debuted a new benchmark, a set of large language models that evaluate how mental health chatbots handle concerning inputs from patients. The American Heart Association announced an AI assessment lab to validate predictive AI for cardiovascular diseases in partnership with Dandelion Health. \"Smart money is really thinking about startups that are worried about, how do we build this? It's not about shipping the fastest product anymore, it's about shipping responsibly,\" said Milad Alucozai, cofounder and general partner of Pamir Ventures.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"Mark Cuban\u00a0says that the elimination of billionaires would trigger a stock market crash, potentially erasing the savings of average Americans. In a post on BlueSky last week, Cuban opposed the idea\u00a0that wealth inequality could be\u00a0mitigated by taxing or capping the wealth of billionaires. Cuban, who has built a $6 billion fortune through tech startups, investments, argued that the existence of extreme wealth is a natural outcome\u00a0of the market system.  \u201cBillionaires\u00a0will exist as long as\u00a0stock markets exist,\u201d he stated. Billionaires will exist as long as stock markets exist.  Should we get rid of the stock market ? He warned that dismantling the\u00a0market would have catastrophic consequences for all, not just the wealthy.  In response to a user who noted that about\u00a090% of the stock market\u00a0is owned by the wealthiest 10% of US households, Cuban concurred but contended that forcing these investors to sell would damage everyone, not just the affluent. Also Read: Mark Cuban On His Kids And Downsides of His Wealth: \u2018Sometimes I Think They Don\u2019t Like It, Not That They Want To Be Poor, But It Sets An Expectation\u2019 \u201cAbsolutely true,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut\u00a0that 90 percent is trillions\u00a0and trillions of dollars, owned\u00a0by everyone else. If you\u00a0make the top 10 pct\u00a0sell 90 pct of the\u00a0market, how close to zero\u00a0value do you think the\u00a0ownership of the 90 percent\u00a0goes? You\u00a0would wipe out the savings\u00a0of more than half the\u00a0country.\u201d Absolutely true.  But that 90 percent is trillions and trillions of dollars, owned by everyone else.   If you make the top 10 pct sell 90 pct of the market , how close to zero value do you think the ownership of the 90 percent goes ? You would wipe out the savings of more than half the country While Cuban maintains that billionaires are an inevitable byproduct of flourishing\u00a0stock markets that benefit savers,\u00a0organizations like Oxfam and the\u00a0World Bank argue that ultra-rich accumulations are primarily\u00a0driven by inheritance, monopoly power,\u00a0and exacerbate inequality. Cuban also expressed skepticism about the practicality\u00a0of wealth taxes based on\u00a0stock valuations, posing the question:\u00a0\u201cIf it\u2019s the value of\u00a0their stock, will you refund\u00a0the tax if the stock\u00a0market corrects or crashes?\u201d Does making enough mean the value of their stock ? Or in cash from stock they sold ? If it's the value of their stock, will you refund the tax if the stock market corrects or crashes ? Despite his arguments, Cuban expressed support for a \u201cwindfall tax\u201d on individuals\u00a0earning $1 billion or more\u00a0in taxable income in a\u00a0single year. He also shared his perspective on what fairer capitalism might look like, suggesting that every employee should receive the same percentage\u00a0of their earnings in company\u00a0stock as the CEO.

As Stephanie Falk's three kids left for college, she started dreaming of trading her Westchester County suburb for New York City, where she'd lived in her 20s. But Stephanie's husband, Andrew, didn't want to give up the greenery and space their family had enjoyed for almost 30 years in their village about 20 miles north of the city. So the couple settled on a compromise: they'd sell their 100-year-old house in Edgemont, New York, and move to a more urban town in the county, preferably somewhere walkable to restaurants and the Hudson River or Long Island Sound. Around the same time, in the spring of 2024, the Falks were playing golf with their friends, Judy and Steven Cooperman, when they got to talking about their new home search. The Coopermans were in the same position, looking to sell the house they'd raised their kids in and find a more accessible, lower-maintenance home in a vibrant community. They were considering a new partially constructed, mixed-use development called Edge-on-Hudson in the riverside village of Sleepy Hollow. This piqued the Falks' interest. A few days later, Judy showed them around the area. The development checked many of both couples' boxes: a four-bedroom townhome would be big enough to host all of their kids and their partners comfortably, they'd be a stone's throw from the Hudson River and a walkable town, and they'd have an elevator in their home so that their aging parents could visit. Crucially, the densely built homes and shared amenities, including a park and pool, seemed likely to foster a lot of socializing with neighbors and a community-oriented feel. \"I just believe fully in community,\" Stephanie said. \"And I think as you grow older, from what I've learned and what I've seen, being stimulated and being around other like-minded people, it can be really beneficial.\" The Falks and the Coopermans, in their mid-to-late 50s, aren't ready to retire. Stephanie runs a mindfulness and meditation company called Pause to be Present, while Judy works remotely in administrative management at a law firm. Their husbands work in real estate and law in New York City. They also didn't want to shrink their living space by too much. Both couples sold their previous homes for a bit more than they spent on their townhomes, which start at $1.6 million. But the new homes will be easier to age in, as they're accessible. The couples aren't alone \u2014\u00a0they're part of a wave of Gen Xers and boomers who aren't quite ready to downsize or move into a retirement community, but they're \"itching for the next step,\" as Judy said. In an expensive, in-demand housing market, they managed to find a happy medium. \"We're right-sizing,\" Stephanie said. While the square footage they'll live in is similar, \"the actual lifestyle part of it just feels right for what we want.\" The development is still under construction, but will eventually include nearly 1,200 townhomes, condos, and apartments, and a park, grocery store, and hotel on 70 acres that previously housed a GM assembly plant. In late July, both the Coopermans and the Falks moved into Edge-on-Hudson rental apartments, where they'll stay until construction is finished on their townhomes. Other future neighbors might also be old acquaintances. Five other couples the Coopermans know have met with the developers to learn more about buying in the community, Judy said. So far, both women are excited about the change. The Coopermans sold or donated most of their furniture, which Judy said was freeing. While they used to see each other occasionally for golf or tennis, Judy and Stephanie now see each other more casually. \"It's very easy to just say, 'Hey, you want to go out for a walk?'\" Judy said. And they're already making new friends. \"People are friendly. People are out a lot,\" Judy said. \"It's kind of like going to college when you're a freshman; everyone wants to meet people.\"                  Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"Three Chinese nationals have been arrested in Georgia on suspicion of attempting to illegally purchase 2kg of uranium. Lasha Maghradze, deputy head of the nation's State Security Service (SSG), told a news briefing the group planned to pay $400,000 (\u00a3300,570) for the nuclear material in the capital, Tblisi, before transporting it to China via Russia. The alleged plot was unearthed by intelligence agents while one member of the group was attempting to buy the radioactive substance on the black market, he said. The three pleaded not guilty at a court in Tblisi and have been placed in custody to prevent them fleeing the country, according to public broadcaster Georgia Today. They face up to five years in prison under a provision of Georgia's criminal code banning the purchasing of nuclear material. Mr Maghradze told reporters the operation was being co-ordinated by other members of the group in China. SSG footage shows armed soldiers swooping on a car and detaining three individuals. It also shows two glass jars containing a yellow substance in a car boot, which tests identified as uranium.  It is unclear what isotope of uranium the men are alleged to have sought - though all can emit harmful radiation - and their intended purpose for it. As a former Soviet nation, Georgia had stores of nuclear materials following the bloc's collapse in 1991. The security of those materials has been an ongoing concern, with several serious incidents of uranium being illicitly sold in the years since. In July, the SSG arrested two people - one Georgian and one Turkish national - for attempting to trade $3m worth of uranium. Irakli Garibashvili, who was a loyal lieutenant of Georgia's de facto leader, is accused of corruption. The 58-year-old man, from East London, died after an incident at AWE Aldermaston in July 2023. It is understood her family has raised enough money to significantly reduce any jail time imposed.  Police used pepper spray to disperse demonstrators amid growing turmoil in the Caucasus country.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its busiest week, which includes an earnings report from five of the Magnificent 7 and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\/A, BRK\/B). 173 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Boeing (BA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), ServiceNow (NOW), Merck (MRK), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM). With 29% of companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates.  The earnings season preview from last week contains more details about the underlying drivers of earnings. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500\u2019s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 9.2% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar years 2025 and 2026 is unchanged at 11.0% and 13.9%, respectively. The continuation of the strong earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. In addition, the better-than-expected consumer inflation reading opened the door to a Federal Reserve rate cut this week, which helped stocks, particularly banks. The lack of additional \u201ccockroaches\u201d last week helped regional banks snap back from concerns over reported loan fraud. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) earnings were below expectations last week, and it was the only member of the Magnificent 7 that saw a stock price decline last week. Five of the Magnificent 7 report earnings this week: Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises from companies in the financials, information technology, and industrials sectors were the most significant contributors to the S&P 500\u2019s earnings growth rate increase last week. Within financials, Capital One Financial (COF) and Chubb (CB) were the most significant positive drivers. Intel (INTC) was the most crucial positive surprise in technology, while RTX (RTX) and GE Aerospace (GE) were the most notable positive surprises in industrials. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. However, sales growth at 7.0% is running well above expectations. So far this earnings season, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors have been the most critical drivers of improved sales growth. The government shutdown delayed September consumer inflation (CPI) readings, but the headline and core, excluding food and energy, were better than expected. The headline and core CPI were 3% year-over-year. The top-line numbers were more favorable than expected, despite concerns about price pressure from tariffs. In addition, the details were similarly comforting, with the pace of price gains for services and housing slowing. The 3-month annualized rate of CPI growth held steady, suggesting the recent inflation acceleration might be subsiding. With the government shutdown dragging on and delaying or withholding many US economic releases, the focus will be on the busiest week of the earnings season. In addition, five of the Magnificent 7 companies report earnings. This group has an outsized impact on the S&P 500\u2019s expected earnings growth rate. It is also an essential bellwether for gauging the health of the artificial intelligence boom and the technology sector as a whole. Despite the government shutdown, tariffs, and a cooling labor market, the economy continues to hold up well, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 4%. President Trump is scheduled to meet with China\u2019s President Xi this week, and markets anticipate some thawing in tensions between the countries, though a full-scale trade deal is unlikely. The friendlier inflation data last week sealed the deal for another 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) at their meeting on Wednesday. Financial markets expect another cut at the December meeting. Given the additional economic visibility issues arising from the government shutdown, management\u2019s forward earnings guidance will be even more closely watched. Since the Fed rate cut is a virtual certainty, Chair Powell\u2019s comments about the future path of monetary policy will be closely watched. He is unlikely to be forceful in his views, given the lack of visibility into the health of the labor market, but shouldn\u2019t buck expectations for another Fed easing in December.

You\u2019ll Probably Lose. (NY TImes) I wonder if the White House grounds would be big enough for Donny to build a casino on? Only billionaires allowed in of course. {croupier spins silver ball and announces: No More Bets!} \u201947 Red\u2019 During my gambling world tour, I tempted fate (it prevailed against me, as usual) @ the Walkerhill Casino in Seoul, which only allowed foreigners to wager. Looking back, that was pretty smart thinking on their part, but now Koreans are allowed to bet online, best laid plans. I spent a few evenings at the Walkerhill Casino back in the mid-80\u2019s when it was still foreigners only. I was in the US military at the time, hit the blackjack table, and actually walked out to the plus every time. But the last time I went there it got interesting\u2026 I was up a few hundred, a lot for a young non-com at that time, when the house suddenly changed dealers. Within an hour I had lost about 75% of my previous winnings, every bet a loser. Lesson learned. I never went back after that. His ballroom would make a nice casino. Slot machines would of course take $TRUMP coins. The problem here is that third way dems have been using the same math for many years, and trump is the collapse. The math doesn\u2019t work. The morality doesn\u2019t either. In this economy, individuals bear the downside risk, while corporations and the wealthy collect the upside. It\u2019s a rigged game where the house \u2014 seemingly, the already rich \u2014 always wins. The question is why this hasn\u2019t all collapsed yet. The answer is actually simple: time. Economic systems have inertia. Institutions built over decades don\u2019t crumble overnight.  The dollar\u2019s global dominance rests on 80 years of habit, and there really is no viable alternative. And as the economist John Maynard Keynes warned, markets can stay irrational longer than most people can stay solvent. \u201cWhat was in the East Wing of the White House before Trump demolished it?\u201d \u2018According to the White House Historical Association, \u201ca comprehensive digital scanning project\u201d and photographic record of the East Wing and gardens was conducted after Trump announced his ballroom project in July. The association told PBS that historic artifacts from the East Wing \u201chave been preserved and stored.\u201d \u2018 At least someone had some brains to do this before the place got bulldozed. True, that wing was only about 120 years old but it still meant something. Pity that the Rose garden has been lost- \u2018The Rose Garden used to feature a green lawn flanked by elegant magnolias and rows of rosebushes, commissioned by the Kennedys. However, the president transformed it into a \u201cRose Garden Club,\u201d paving over the lawn and adding white chairs topped with Mar-a-Lago-style yellow and white umbrellas.\u2019 https:\/\/people.com\/before-and-after-pictures-of-changes-donald-trump-is-making-to-the-white-house-11835181 Apparently Trump complained that women wearing high heels found it hard to walk on the grass so paved over it with tiles.

In defense of the White House ballroom Donald Trump vs. the NIMBYs  My favorite quote from the article: \u201cIt is absurd that tents need to be erected on the South Lawn for state dinners, and VIPs are forced to use porta-potties.\u201d http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/2025\/10\/25\/ballroom-east-wing-trump-white-house\/ The reactionary Trump is ignorant, and not capable of understanding the founders intent when the WH was built. The federalist design of the WH was along classic Greek and Roman lines. The WH would be elegant yet simple and austere, in order to project an image of a democratic republic rather than the grand palaces of royal Europeans. Forget the monstrous Versailles, even Buckingham Palace, which is roughly 850,000 sq. ft., is more than 15x larger than the 55,000 sq. ft. WH. If the founders wanted a palace to compete with kings and queens, Jefferson, who was an architect, could have helped find the right people to create it. Trump, on the other hand, thinks the WH is too plain, too ordinary, not grand enough to reflect the greatness, meaning rich like himself, of rulers of the US. I\u2019m aware the WH has been modified over the years but always fitting its intended design. Trump\u2019s so-called Ballroom, even the name sounds weird because Ballroom means Dance Hall, will be about twice the size of the entire WH. Tacky displays of gold is not what the founders wanted. If Trump had normal aesthetic sensibilities, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to live in an eyesore like Mar-a-Lago. trump probably doesn\u2019t know that the white house was built with slave labor, and probably wouldn\u2019t care to know. Private, erstwhile oligarch trump was well known for not paying workers contracted to labor at trump properties. He just blew them off with a sneer, and would tell them to take it to court, knowing the financial drain a legal challenge would impose, and that most could never dare undertake. They were forced to realize that they\u2019d been ripped off, and that bourgeois justice is always tilted to the rich and powerful. BTW, whenever a poster here complains that the poor, pitiful trump has been the victim of lawfare, get real. trump is a creature of fraud. It is his milieu. he\u2019s deprived many workers of their wages and stuck it to them; he can go to hell, and take his entourage of attorneys with him. This latest theft from the public, this ballroom where the elites may go one day to applaud one another and stroke themselves, preening for notice and self-importance, is being funded by the same mega-rich corporations that have bought the government, and who are only too happy, and content, to squeeze every last nickel from everyone else. The slaughter in ukraine and Gaza have only made them richer, and their contempt for human life has found a fellow true believer in the white house. I can well imagine the filthy rich lapping up champagne some evening in the bawl-room, as the murderer trump regales them with stories of how he\u2019s killed some drug dealers in boats, off the coast of Venezuela. Their purchase of the east wing and its occupant makes clear that the people\u2019s government no longer exists. It\u2019s been bought and sold. The demands of the trump market are being met each and every day. The pimp trump has made of the people\u2019s house, a whore house. Here is an interesting video on the White House and how it has changed over the years with mention how some Presidents on a whim made major changes- https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CidE4a2q374 (12:24 mins) Here\u2019s the official White House website:  https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/about-the-white-house\/the-white-house\/ Check out their timeline of major events, it has to be seen to be believed.

Kevin Walmsley came out the other day with a report on this development because he thought that it was so significant- https:\/\/kdwalmsley.substack.com\/p\/revolutionary-catapult-gives-chinese The US Navy still has to launch their F-35s using steam catapults and are really behind. Lots of damning facts in this article. Don\u2019t really know much about it, but my impression is that due to the complex maintenance system requirement for the F-35, the decision was taken to use the JFK CVN-79 for aircraft\/ship integration.  Not sure that EMALS was a consideration.  Certainly there has been extensive testing at the LBTS at the lab in Lakehurst. That said, sending Ford CSG to the Caribbean will probably impact the test schedule.  Note that the unified combatant commands establish the operational requirement.  They have no responsibility for testing so there\u2019s no incentive to prioritize the IOT&E test requirements, including surge and sustained sortie generation rate demonstration. But if the Chinese are using super-capacitors for energy storage, I can see that as a superior design.  Don\u2019t know about these caps, but I assume high accuracy is required to ensure uniform charge distribution as well as charge\/discharge rate.  That implies produce-ability requirements for manufacturing close tolerances.  So not just a design requirement but also manufacturing.  Could the US do that?  No idea.

What a stupid timeline. If Trump somehow makes it ok to run for a 3rd term they could bring back Bill Clinton. What could possibly make it ok? That there\u2019s been a kind of interregnum? Think that would be the theory.  Think the question went back to the split of the Rs when a faction pushed for the nomination of Grant in 1880.

County takes another step in creating tiny homes for the homeless in Lemon Grove This boondoggle is about 500 meters from where my family lived on the last lemon grove in Lemon Grove until the state bought the land to turn it into a freeway interchange. To say that this area is and has always been an undesirable neighborhood is a vast understatement. The project proposes to house 60 people. I can spot 60 unhoused people within a 2 kilometer radius of this area within 20 minutes. No lie. To call this more than a drop in the bucket just for the Lemon Grove\/ Spring Valley area, much less for San Diego County, is laughable. An actual solution to the shelter problem that is always rejected out of hand is a massive expansion of small trailer parks. This is last stand of NIMBYism in Southern California. Thanks for the perspective. My images of Lemon Groove are from the (romanticized) 80\u2019s. And the mobile home policy of which you speak is the same here in NW AR: prime landing spot for CA expats and homeless peeps! I couldn\u2019t agree more about allowing the mobile home parks. I live in the Midwest and there are some truly beautiful parks with mature trees and larger lots. Most of these were started by an individual and run treating the inhabitants very well.  The model where the owners pay a lot fee has become extremely exploitative, but a new idea to have the parks cooperatively owned by the people is working well. https:\/\/resources.uwcc.wisc.edu\/housing\/UWCC%20Webinar.Housing.pdf City development folks will not hear of the idea, so the industry has formed an association. Its a weird gig, zenith & nadir hanging out cheek by jowl, every house in the SoCalist Movement is worth near a million bucks, while those in close proximity might have a net cash worth of $14 on a day when panhandling action was brisk, because you borrowed another homeless person\u2019s dog for the afternoon. What will the tiny homes cost around San Diego? They need to be mindful of the competition with Los Angeles and San Francisco, where eye-popping costs, er, money-laundering and fraud, reign with minimal public oversight. Is Portland next? If you know people there have them look at how so many are existing in inhumane conditions.  The local politicians need to take accountability for allowing people to live in squalor and breeding grounds for disease. They won\u2019t act until somebody shames them! The video narrator says many but not all of the encampments and trash areas are hidden from view. Unhide them. An actual solution to the shelter problem that is always rejected out of hand is a massive expansion of small trailer parks. This is last stand of NIMBYism in Southern California. Privately owned trailer parks (almost all are), whatever size are extremely exploitative. These people want to own their own homes but cannot manage a house with land (another area of exploitation, to be sure) and want to escape the also exploitive apartment market. They are then trapped into that system. I have long thought that land for trailers (manufactured housing) should be on state offer (if not outright nationalization of the heretofore private practice). But then, I\u2019m for nationalization (or smaller collectivization) of most private property, though that is, obviously, against the overveiling grain. Here in Hawaii, we are too good to allow trailers.  Better to have Lahaina refugees living in the streets.  But we do push for \u201ckauhale\u201d (give it a Hawaiian name and all is good).  Places with communal kitchen and bath.  They look more like chicken coops to me, but maybe I\u2019m just biased. \u201cThe browser wars are back, and this time they\u2019re powered by AI\u201d I\u2019m trying to think of a good reason to use a ChatGPT-powered browser.

Ick. Why electricity costs so much in the UK (it\u2019s not all about the weather) TechXplore I believe the article is fair enough but something should we added when one compares electricity prices between countries. I am not sure if this article is comparing apples to apples. Is it comparing the actual bills that households have to pay or the average cost in terms of let\u2019s say pounds\/kWh?. This makes a difference because average demand, is about 12600 kWh\/year in the US, 6500 kWh\/year in France or 4130 kWh\/year in the UK. With such differences. IMO, this suggests that in the UK less money in per capita terms has to be invested to improve the grid or to reduce curtailment to obtain similar results compared with the US or France. On the other hand, because economies of scale, these investments in the UK have to be more carefully thought. I don\u2019t know, may be my head is overheated. Michael Hudson has been using the term Automatic Intelligence, but I think that still misses the key point. How about The browser wars are back, but this time they are powered by Average Intelligence. I really like Artificial Information.

Additionaly the extreme duress that their new uncertainty as to their health outcomes may lead. \u201cCan the West break China\u2019s grip on rare earths?\u201d Until you see university courses being taught in how to refine rare earths to undergraduates and professors that teach how to do it, then and only then can you say that the west is serious in doing this. But if this never happens, it is all jazz hands on the part of politicians and they are not really serious. Politicians and fund-raising \u2018investment\u2019 banksters. All that \u201ce-money\u201d, zeros and ones \u2014 including the latest vapor denomination of various cryptos\u2026 zooming around the earth at the speed of light\u2014 disruptive and damaging as all get-out. The only answer is to send musk\u2019s pop rockets into a space far far away from reality, and then use their returns to conquer the chinese\/russian menace. The answer is of course the west can mine and refine REE. The actual question is how long will it take to build the mines and refineries that will produce the what you need. I\u2019ve heard that if all goes well and that there are no problems that develop, that it will take about 30 years to catch up to the Chinese. Of course by then the Chinese would be 30 years more advanced. High speed rail from LA to Las Vegas is just a cover story to transport rare earths from Zyzzyx* Road-adjacent. * proper name Scrabble players whet dream of  name The ambient \/ electronic track \u201cZyzzyx Road\u201d, by Jon Jenkins: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D_ggNdbQl8Y Very nice! Thanks. You\u2019re welcome, Glen, glad you like it. I can also recommend his collaborations with David Helpling, notably \u201cTreasure\u201d. Your so negative,look at how germany is adapting to these challenges. the humiliating years of producing quality consumer durables are over, daddy has told them. some might say that\u2019s a bad thing,what with ww1\/2 and all that In the run up to the World Wars, Germany had large, mostly young, and fairly homogeneous population with a sense of self, whether we liked what that meant or not.  What does any Western country have now? US needs to greatly increase bauxite refining. One problem is REE ores are very low yield. Gallium ore is widely dispersed in bauxite.  Refining bauxite for aluminum produces very low yield for gallium ore.  Bauxite refining uses a lot of electricity.  US needs that for GPU chip use.  But, can\u2019t make the Gallium\u2026. China does a lot of bauxites refining US and Canada not so much now. Other REE may have similar advantages to China. A lot of REE are extracted from tailings of other mining, iron ore etc.  I don\u2019t actually see the US doing the mining or refining at scale due to high capex costs and low returns, and massive environmental issues. The later is a big reason for much of the mining\/refinjng done in China and not the US. I agree! But \u201cnational (in)security\u201d never worried about ROI! Guaranteed 6% return on \u201ccosts\u201d for R&D. This do?   Virginia Tech and the Canadian-headquartered Aclara Resources are taking a key step toward making green technology supply chains more sustainable. A memorandum of understanding between the university and Aclara\u2019s U.S.-based subsidiary, Aclara Technologies, lays the groundwork for a long-term academic and scientific alliance that includes Aclara\u2019s rare earths separation pilot plant at the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center in Blacksburg. The partnership underscores Aclara and Virginia Tech\u2019s shared commitment to strengthening a sustainable domestic supply chain for critical heavy rare earth elements. There\u2019s a lot of domestic interest in these kinds of things. There is a base of students who would like to pursue mining engineering as a career. We\u2019ll see if our market gods allow that double coincidence of want to produce something lasting. I may get in trouble with this one (assumptions about \u201cbest\u201d, but this is according to my retired mining engineer father-in-law), but let\u2019s see what\u2019s up at the two best mining universities in America: Critical Minerals \u2013 Colorado School of Mines https:\/\/www.mines.edu\/critical-minerals-research\/ MONTANA TECH RESEARCHERS AT FOREFRONT OF EFFORTS TO BRING RARE EARTH ELEMENT MINING, PROCESSING TO U.S. SHORES https:\/\/www.mtech.edu\/news\/mnews\/2023\/06\/montana-tech-researchers-at-forefront-of-efforts-to-bring-rare-earth-element-mining-processing-to-u.s-shores.html But I agree with you that the more important aspect is what our \u201cmarket gods\u201d want. This is pretty much the same brain trust that decided off shoring America\u2019s industrial base was a good idea. And that\u2019s really the problem, America\u2019s elites are constantly propped up, never allowed to fail, just blithely get to make bad decision after bad decision and still show up on a Sunday talking heads show as \u201cthe experts\u201d on how to run the country. \u201cUkraine: Donald Trump pivots again\u201d He does and he doesn\u2019t. He flip-flops in the same way that Macron does. One day he is all in on Zelensky and then a week later he is talking to Putin. But when you watch what he does, it tells a different story. He always escalates against Russia and arranges provocations, just so he can get \u2018leverage\u2019 over Putin. So he will send new weapons to the Ukraine, approve an attack on Russia\u2019s nuclear triad, does more sanction against Russia, especially it\u2019s oil industry, and now he is talking about Tomahawks. He never, ever eases off against Russia with any of these measures but just ramps up more and more. This is now absolutely Trump\u2019s war now as he has fully gone with the neocons and made this war his own. And if the Ukraine collapses, the failure is going to be entirely his lock, stock and barrel. Exactly, TRK. Remember when he said he would end the Ukraine war in 24 hours? Either it was never his intention and he outright lied, or he was deeply unserious making such an important claim; in both cases he should have never been permitted to occupy the presidency. How many people have preventably died since? It\u2019s all a consequence-free game to these psychos. \u201cVaccine Skeptics Said That COVID Shots Would Cause Mass Death. We\u2019re Still Here. Reason\u201d A couple of points. First, the author, Ronald Bailey, essentially sets up a straw man, which quickly becomes clear when he begins by quoting a small number of obviously extreme skeptics. Here\u2019s one example: In 2021, Dolores Cahill, an immunologist at the School of Medicine of University College Dublin, notoriously asserted in an independent documentary that \u201ceverybody who has an mRNA injection will die within 3 to 5 years, even if they have had only one injection.\u201d The category of COVID \u201cvaccine skeptics\u201d was extremely broad, but I think it fair to say that the vast majority were skeptical based on perfectly reasonable grounds. They would include at least one, if not a combination of these points: \u2013 the mRna vaccines had not been tested for long-term effects \u2013 they were being used on short \u201cemergency authorization\u201d notice, which, among other things, absolved their manufacturers from legal claims should things go wrong (i.e. a no-lose proposition for Big Pharma) \u2013 they were widely marketed dishonestly (e.g. as preventing COVID, and\/or its transmission) \u2013 they were pushed on everyone, despite a good deal of evidence suggesting that only those who were most vulnerable to COVID should have been mandated, or targeted Beyond that, the author ignores the very real side-effects issues that remain concerning.  On a related note, readers might find the following excerpt from a 2000 article of his, in the same publication. It was entitled: Earth Day, Then and Now The planet\u2019s future has never looked better. Here\u2019s why. Bailey uses something of the same technique in the earlier article, but I\u2019ve chosen two paragraphs from his conclusion: What will Earth look like when Earth Day 60 rolls around in 2030? Here are my predictions: As the International Food Policy Research Institute projects, we will be able to feed the world\u2019s additional numbers and to provide them with a better diet. Because they are ultimately political in nature, poverty and malnutrition will not be eliminated, but economic growth will make many people in the developing world much better off. Technological improvements in agriculture will mean less soil erosion, better management of freshwater supplies, and higher productivity crops. Life expectancy in the developing world will likely increase from 65 years to 73 years, and probably more; in the First World, it will rise to more than 80 years. Metals and mineral prices will be even lower than they are today. The rate of deforestation in the developing world will continue to slow down and forest growth in the developed economies will increase. Meanwhile, as many developing countries become wealthier, they will start to pass through the environmental-transition thresholds for various pollutants, and their air and water quality will begin to improve. Certainly air and water quality in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other developed countries will be even better than it is today. Enormous progress will be made on the medical front, and diseases like AIDS and malaria may well be finally conquered. As for climate change, concern may be abating because the world\u2019s energy production mix is shifting toward natural gas and nuclear power. There is always the possibility that a technological breakthrough\u2013say, cheap, efficient, non-polluting fuel cells\u2013could radically reshape the energy sector. In any case a richer world will be much better able to cope with any environmental problems that might crop up. In summary, I wouldn\u2019t have much confidence in the author\u2019s ability to proclaim when concerns about something should be considered to have been wrong.

Excerpt from a 2023 paper \u2013 not specifically about China however, it proposes an approach to dealing with conflicts in general: https:\/\/www.rand.org\/pubs\/research_briefs\/RBA1862-1.html What Is a Less-Hardline Approach? When two states are rivals or have significant differences, they can choose either a hardline or a less-hardline approach toward each conflict of interest. A state adopts a hardline approach when it tries to achieve its goals by outmaneuvering or coercing a rival and does not seek a resolution that accounts for the rival\u2019s interests. In contrast, a state adopts a less-hardline approach when it seeks to advance its own interests by proactively addressing what it perceives to be the rival\u2019s interests or concerns. We focus on less-hardline approaches in peacetime rather than concessions made in a crisis to avoid war or during an ongoing war to end the fighting. The defining feature of a less-hardline approach is a state\u2019s willingness to address the other side\u2019s concerns as a means of achieving its own goals. However, less-hardline approaches can vary in breadth and depth, from small compromises on peripheral issues to larger concessions on more fundamental conflicts of interest. In addition, a state can shift toward a more conciliatory policy in one area even as it sustains hardline policies in others. Moreover, a less-hardline approach can still involve a tough stance during negotiations. >Invisible luxury: How China\u2019s affluent are spending on intangibles Both the Communist Party and the general public in China disapprove of showing off material wealth.

Can Anyone Rescue the Trafficked Girls of L.A.\u2019s Figueroa Street? (NY Times via archive.ph) Imagine if Trump bothered to do any good with all his federal forces. Inside the effort to pull minors from \u2018the Blade,\u2019 one of the most notorious sex-trafficking corridors in the United States. \u2026 The Blade was an eight-minute drive from the University of Southern California, and yet another universe. Parents pushed strollers past the trafficked girls as they took their own children to school. Amid boarded-up storefronts were a few that catered specifically to the trade: a smoke shop with the banner \u201cfree Magnum condom with any purchase\u201d and a lingerie store named \u2014 in cursive \u2014 Sluts. Figueroa seemed to be the one street in all of Los Angeles where nobody ever honked: Customers waited politely, as if in line at a drive-through, to peruse the menu and take their pick. \u2026 In the shadows, Figueroa had become more violent. The younger the girl, the more customers would pay, which meant preteens were often being robbed and assaulted by groups of older girls trying to make quota. The traffickers who governed the street were worse. Tonight Ana was waving at cars in front of a tire shop when a trafficker pulled up on the wrong side of the street, climbed out and beat one of the girls near Ana over the head with a pistol. The girl had probably looked at him wrong, Ana decided. She knew better than to intervene. It\u2019s a thin line between the illusion of civil society and an openly brutal world. What\u2019s interesting is what\u2019s not discussed. Nothing about the John\u2019s, little about the slavers. Just the inescapable horror of it all and the understaffed local police attempt to temper it all. It\u2019s both unsettling and vacuous at once. No causality, no solutions, just raw horror. It\u2019s also hyper local. No comparisons to other cities or countries. Good observation, Jason.

The judges note that the plaintiffs do not allege that the pro-Palestine protesters engaged in name-calling that demeaned Jews. Rather, they are accused of having criticized the actions of the state of Israel. The plaintiffs maintained that criticizing Israel is antisemitic because so many Jews make Zionism part of their identity. The panel laughed this position out of court. \u201cPlaintiffs are entitled to their own interpretive lens equating anti-Zionism (as they define it) and antisemitism. But it is another matter altogether to insist that others must be bound by plaintiffs\u2019 view. Plaintiffs\u2019 equation finds no consensus support in dictionary definitions.

Oct. 25th https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/article\/diplomatic-solution-end-war-ukraine-russia-envoy-kirill-dmitriev\/ The only substantial actual quote by Dmitriev in this huge headlined text: re: Zelensky \u201cYou know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely. So actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out,\u201d Dmitriev said. On a secondary note: Is there a SINGLE US DEMOCRAT making public demands for a serious peace with Russia???  Considering that the fate of mankind is on the line if something really goes south (we got no 100% fail-safe) kinda in-te-re-sting. Speaking of responsibility & leftwing-ism vs. \u201cisolationist GOP\u201d, n\u2019 stuff\u2026 Currently the left rallying around the flag \u2013 to my humble and small European hill  perspective \u2013 couldn\u2019t be less provincial. Yes: Gaza. But then there is not much more, or is there? (Venezuela as of late but only because of those rubber boats getting blown out of the ocean by F-35s.) Apparently the US Left today is only capable of either coalescing with Neocon globalism (remember Matt Duss?) as a sick aberration of \u201cinternational concepts\u201d. Or ignoring the rest of the world altogether.   I at least don\u00b4t see the the big schemes of former Third World solidarity of the old era.  For the current moment is seems as if Mamdani\u00b4s very cautious \u2013 understandibly so \u2013 no-political-violence strategy utters such a fallout as to ignore all cases that do not fit immediate and undisputable contextualization in terms of good (Gaza) vs. evil (Israel). Out of question that one must acknowlegde that it is historic how that worked to his benefit. (However only thanks to the preceding formative bravery of thousands of students many of whom have ruined their career prospects for coming decades.)  On the other hand there is a reason why the old-style progressive lefitsts\u00b4 current platforms such as DemocracyNow, ZNet, The Nation, Common Dreams and a few more have mostly shifted their resources to Gaza.  Not least to the fact that almost all critical reporting is somehow tied to DJT. Speaking of agency\u2026 To give merit to Russia from a more classical Global Southern perspective is mostly limited to outliers such as Prashad or Michael Hudson, latter conveniently categorized as \u201chardcore\u201d economist. So no threat to political discourse from his side, they may think. Or when did Michael Hudson last give an interview to Amy Goodman??? (my search result says 2018) ZNET has been featuring him at least with Ben Norton around 6 times this year. Your email address will not be published.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Erin Smith, a 47-year-old a freelance marketer and founder of the travel blog Gluten-Free Globetrotter, who moved to Montreal in 2024. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I was born and raised in New York and spent my last twenty years living in Brooklyn. I just didn't want to be anywhere else. Not even in 2016, when I moved with my then-boyfriend, who is now my husband, to Santa Cruz. Even though it was beautiful there, I just wasn't happy. I had to get back to the city, back to New York. So we moved after only two and a half years in California. I thought I wouldn't be moving again, but in 2024, my husband got a really good job opportunity in Montreal. He's an agronomist who works in indoor agriculture. He had the opportunity to help start up a greenhouse division for a national company there, which was right up his alley. As you can imagine, there's not a lot of agriculture in New York City. I'm a freelance marketer and can work from anywhere, but for my husband, it really was the perfect job at the perfect time. We had to wait for my son to finish the school year in New York, so from January to July, we focused on planning the move. The thought of leaving New York was really hard. I mean, all my friends and family are there. And even though Canada isn't geographically far from New York, it's still a different environment \u2014 especially Quebec, which is a French-speaking province. I kept thinking back to when we moved to California, which hadn't been a good fit for us. \"Oh God, this is going to happen again,\" kept running through my mind. This, plus the overwhelming feeling of how much we'd have to learn about Quebec, led me to hire a relocation coach. She's a digital nomad who's lived all over the world, and she helped me a lot \u2014 not so much with the logistics of moving, but more with realizing that the things that were important to me in New York would still be important to me in Canada, and that there are ways to incorporate them into my new life. We visited Quebec a few times before our move to scout out neighborhoods and schools. It was important for me to visit during the winter because it's very cold and snowy here, which I wasn't used to living in New York City. Our last visit before the move was in April, and we literally had a week to find a place. Unlike in New York, where you can find a rental at any time of year, in Montreal, many leases start on July 1 and run through the end of June the following year. My husband works in rural Quebec, and we couldn't live there for many reasons, but we're very happy with where we landed. We live in a great neighborhood in Westmount, in the southwest part of Montreal. We're right near a metro station and can walk to downtown Montreal from our apartment. I feel very lucky. When we moved, our goal was to spend less on rent than we did in New York. In Brooklyn, we lived in a duplex with a backyard, which is pretty rare there \u2014 we got really lucky during COVID-19, when everyone was leaving the city. We paid about $3,500 there; here I'm paying roughly $1,000 less. While we've lost our outdoor space, we gained a washer and dryer, a luxury I never had in 20 years of living in Brooklyn. Quebec's primary language is French, so navigating the region's bureaucracy and school system has been challenging. In Montreal, there are two main school boards, one English and one French. We needed specific paperwork to qualify for the English system. My son now attends an English school with a French immersion curriculum. Making friends here hasn't been easy, either. Because I work for a New York-based company, I've really had to put myself out there to meet people. Most of my community has come from meeting other parents through my kid's school organizations and connecting with our neighbors. The biggest challenge we've faced has been setting up our finances. Since we had no financial history in Canada, we had no credit. Even basic things like getting a credit card or opening a bank account took about six to eight weeks to sort out. The cost of living here is pretty comparable to New York. We spend about the same on groceries, and while we're saving on housing, my husband spends more on gas because he's commuting and driving farther outside the city. I, however, work from home. I have been living with celiac disease for over 40 years. In Canada, it has been much easier to eat gluten-free due to the country's food regulations and labeling laws. And thanks to my work with gluten-free restaurants and brands \u2014 and my blog \u2014 I already had a built-in gluten-free community when I moved here. I've never lived in a place with socialized healthcare, so there has been a huge learning curve in finding doctors and handling prescriptions. I have to use Google Translate for everything. Health insurance is affordable here. We no longer pay out of pocket for coverage, which is a big change \u2014 in New York, health insurance for a family of three costs almost as much as rent. It's different from province to province, but in Quebec, you're required to have an assigned family doctor. Since moving here, I've had to see a few specialists for checkups, and the service has been covered. Sometimes, I still find myself waiting for a bill to show up, and it never does. Something else that surprised me about the medical system here is that you can actually make an appointment with a pharmacist, and they can prescribe medication if you have proper test results. I really love Montreal and I'm happy here. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. Life feels calmer \u2014 the city is beautiful, cleaner, and safer. People here are so much nicer; they have this polite, laid-back attitude. Our Canadian visas last for three years, but we hope to extend them. For now, I'd like to stay as long as possible. A year ago, I probably would've wanted to move back to New York. But now, especially with our child in school, I don't want to disrupt that. I also don't know if we could afford to go back. I'll always see myself as a New Yorker first and an American second; that's my identity through and through. But in New York, I never really felt like I could slow down. In Montreal, we're not in that constant, heightened state anymore. Life here just feels different.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"                 Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes        The spooky season is upon us, and it\u2019s time to put together those Halloween costumes. If you\u2019re dressing up as a vampire, a zombie, or a creepy skull, then you\u2019re likely in the market for colored contact lenses to elevate your look. But before you add those bloody red contacts to your cart, be sure they won\u2019t result in a real scare later on. Novelty contact lenses can be an extreme risk, leading to severe irritation or discomfort, eye infections, and sometimes even vision impairment or blindness, experts have warned. In order to avoid those risks, there are a few things to keep in mind when buying novelty contact lenses. Halloween costumes are worn once a year, so people typically tend not to splurge on those gnarly fits. Even if your costume is cheap (I\u2019m not judging), make sure those contacts aren\u2019t. As Halloween approaches, novelty contact lenses are sold all over the internet and at costume stores. However, it\u2019s best to purchase contact lenses at a reputable store that\u2019s more likely to have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If you can\u2019t buy contact lenses from your eye doctor, then look for a reliable online retailer that requires a prescription. Previous studies have found that over-the-counter cosmetic lenses contain chlorine and other harmful chemicals used for tint or color, which can lead to infections. These infections can sometimes lead to more serious issues such as vision impairment, cataracts, and secondary glaucoma. Researchers also warn that the colorants used for novelty contacts create an uneven texture, which can scratch your eyes and increase the risk of infections that may lead to blindness, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Also, since the contact lenses are not fitted to your eyes, they can lead to scarring, corneal abrasions, and ulcers. If you\u2019re using contact lenses for the first time, do not store them in water but instead keep them in a clean case filled with a specialized solution for disinfection. You should also not store them for an extended period of time, and make sure you clean out the case periodically. There\u2019s also this handy guide on how to wear contacts safely. With all that in mind, make sure the only scare you get on Halloween is from the gruesome outfits and not the safety of your eyes.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"Updated: 1 minute ago What do you get when you cross Hollywood, VHS tapes, and a bag of flour? If you were in Ghana in the late 1980s or 90s, the answer was pure, chaotic brilliance, hand-painted movie posters so wild, so bold, and so anatomically impossible, they\u2019re now considered collectible art. Welcome to the world of Ghanaian movie posters. They\u2019re gory. They\u2019re vibrant. They\u2019re often hilarious. And they\u2019re unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen. Back in the 1980s, Ghana was in the midst of a cinematic revolution. While most of the Western world had access to video rental shops and cable channels, in Ghana, things worked a little differently. Imported VHS tapes were shown at mobile cinemas \u2014 makeshift screenings often set up in open-air markets, community halls, or anywhere a crowd could gather. Enter the travelling cinema operators, armed with a television set, a generator, a VCR\u2026 and a bag of posters that didn\u2019t actually exist. See, most of these movies came without any promotional materials. No glossy posters. No slick advertising. So what did they do? They hired local artists to paint them. Often working with nothing but word-of-mouth summaries or bootleg VHS covers as reference, these artists let their imaginations run completely wild \u2014 and the results were absolutely glorious. The posters were typically painted on used flour sacks, sewn together and primed for colour. These weren\u2019t just any flour sacks either \u2014 they were durable, easy to roll up, and ready for reuse. And the designs? Let\u2019s just say they didn\u2019t rely too heavily on accuracy. Sylvester Stallone\u00a0often had twice the muscles. Freddy Krueger\u00a0was sometimes joined by snakes for no apparent reason. Terminator\u00a0had glowing eyes, extra arms, and sometimes a bazooka, just for good measure. It didn\u2019t matter if the movie was a romantic comedy or a horror flick \u2014 there was always\u00a0blood. Always at least one exploding head. And if you were lucky, a helicopter bursting into flames somewhere in the background. At first glance, these posters might just seem like bad art. But there\u2019s a raw charm to them \u2014 a punk energy that doesn\u2019t care about realism or proportions. A kind of outsider art that merges pop culture with folklore, action with absurdity, and makes every film feel like a blood-soaked fever dream. In some posters, you\u2019d swear the artist hadn\u2019t even seen the film (and truthfully, many hadn\u2019t). They often worked from second-hand descriptions or low-quality VHS box art, with creative liberties taken liberally. What mattered most was grabbing attention. And it worked. \u201cThese posters were part of the marketing strategy,\u201d said Ernie Wolfe, a collector and curator who helped bring these artworks to international galleries. \u201cThey were designed to get people to come to the screenings \u2014 and if that meant making the movie look crazier than it actually was, so be it.\u201d While they started as practical tools for cinema promotion, the posters gradually became art objects in their own right. In the early 2000s, international art collectors began taking notice. Exhibitions of Ghanaian movie posters began appearing in galleries in New York, London, Berlin, and Tokyo. The very posters once stapled to market walls were now being framed and auctioned off for thousands of dollars. One of the most famous collectors, Wolfgang Held, even described them as \u201cthe African equivalent of underground comic book art.\u201d Artists like Joe Mensah, Heavy J, and Stoger\u00a0have since become cult icons among poster enthusiasts. Their work is now appreciated not just for its aesthetic \u2014 but for what it represents: ingenuity, adaptation, and a fierce kind of visual storytelling. Here are just a few favourites from the genre that perfectly capture the \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d energy: \u201cTerminator 2\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Arnie\u2019s face is melting, he\u2019s shirtless, and he\u2019s riding a jet ski that doesn\u2019t appear in the film. \u201cEvil Dead\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Picture Ash but with a massive machine gun, a six-pack, and a demon emerging from his chest. \u201cRocky IV\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Stallone is in boxing gloves and\u00a0holding an Uzi, punching a guy who\u2019s already on fire. \u201cPredator\u201d\u00a0\u2013 The alien creature is ten feet tall, has five heads, and breathes fire. It\u2019s clear that accuracy wasn\u2019t the point. The goal was excitement \u2014 and by that metric, they succeeded tenfold. These posters are more than just curiosities. They\u2019re a glimpse into how global pop culture was interpreted and reimagined in West Africa. They show us what happens when traditional art practices collide with Hollywood cinema, in a setting with limited resources but unlimited creativity. They also stand as symbols of resilience. With minimal tools and even less information, Ghanaian artists created an unforgettable visual language \u2014 one that still fascinates designers, filmmakers, and collectors to this day. And let\u2019s be honest: in an age of Photoshop perfection, there\u2019s something deeply refreshing about artwork that dares to be weird, off-kilter, and full of personality. Hand-painted Ghanaian movie posters may be low-budget, but they\u2019re high-impact. They\u2019re messy, macabre, and magnificently over-the-top. And that\u2019s exactly why people can\u2019t stop looking at them. So the next time you see a dull, corporate movie poster at your local cinema, just imagine what a Ghanaian artist might have done with it \u2014 and wish, for just a moment, that you were standing in a dusty market square with a cold Fanta, a plastic chair, and the promise of carnage on VHS.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. \u201cChinese companies are pushing across the globe to conquer new markets, and U.S. financiers are making a mint by helping them.\u201d That\u2019s how the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Rory Jones reported it in a recent front-page article from the newspaper.  Jones reports that as of September, Chinese companies have raised $23 billion. Notable about the impressive sums of money raised for 65 newly listed companies in Hong Kong, Jones writes that \u201cMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the top banks for fundraising.\u201d The only \u201cclosed economy\u201d is the world economy. Robert Mundell lives!.  All of this is worth remembering as the Federal Reserve obsessed continue to \u2013 yes \u2013 obsess over whether the central bank will remain \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201ctight.\u201d The worrying is more than pointless as the China\/Hong Kong\/U.S. investment bank story indicates.  While it can\u2019t be said enough that the Fed has no credit to be easy with in the first place, it can be said that whether it\u2019s easy or austere is immaterial in a world of globalized credit. If machinations succeed in rendering the price of credit higher than the market itself, then it\u2019s safe to say that non-bank and non-U.S. sources of credit will eagerly pounce on financing opportunities that Fed fiddling might take away for certain U.S. sources of finance. The reasons are many, but just two will be mentioned here.   For one, credit is produced in the private sector as opposed to being allocated by central bankers. This being true, the only limit to investment, loan, or in-between credit is the amount of production in the world.  From there, or second, money goes to where it\u2019s treated well. Which is a reminder that assuming what\u2019s impossible to begin with, that the Fed can artificially elevate the true, market-based cost of capital, global sources of money will mobilize to profit from undercutting the Fed\u2019s vain stabs at price control. Markets always speak.  Jones adds that while Chinese companies used to simply raise money in New York, \u201cBeijing authorities have grown suspicious of U.S. listings,\u201d while conversely, U.S. stock exchanges have grown \u201cwary of wading into politically sensitive territory.\u201d Government barriers to the natural flow of capital? Most certainly, but also easily surmountable for reasons already discussed.  Hong Kong\u2019s capital markets are filling the funding breach, while aided by U.S. investment banks. Here\u2019s your \u201cclosed\u201d global economy, and here\u2019s the globalized rejection of popular notions that just won\u2019t die about the Fed causing \u201crecessions,\u201d and more ridiculous, supposed \u201ctightness\u201d from the Fed having caused the Great Depression. Not a chance.  That\u2019s because credit is an effect, not an instigator. It once again goes where it will be rewarded for going. Assuming Fed tightness in 2025, or Fed tightness in the 1930s, markets run roughshod over central bank intervention. Fewer dollars were circulating stateside in the 1930s precisely because there was reduced economic activity as a consequence of horrendous government policy.  Which is useful to keep in mind amid ongoing calls by Milton Friedman-worshipping pundits who claim a failure to dollarize is what\u2019s holding Argentina\u2019s economy back. No, not really. See Hong Kong once again. Since there are myriad innovative companies in China, dollars are being matched with them by American investment banks by the billions.  Dollarization, like credit, is an effect as opposed to an instigator. If Javier Milei wants dollars in abundance in Argentina, he\u2019ll have to attract the kind of human capital for whom dollars are always matched with.  Like central banks, decrees are toothless. Dollars migrate toward production, and run from a lack of it.   ","label":0}

I'm addicted to my car. Even in a densely-packed city like San Francisco, I couldn't imagine getting around without it. But I also hate my car. It's a little silly to think that I need to start and stop a couple-ton vehicle just to drive a few minutes to my friend's house or to grab groceries. I also think about the painful amount of money I've spent due to a cracked wheel from a pothole, flattened tires from a perfectly placed nail, or the driver who sideswiped me after they blew a red light. That was all within the past year. If I could get rid of my car, I would. ALSO, a startup that began as a skunkworks inside Rivian is trying really hard to replace our large vehicles \u2014 at least for some trips. \"The name ALSO is very intentional. It's not an either-or proposition,\" Ben Steele, ALSO's chief commercial officer, told me. \"I think what we're really seeking to do with our products is to say to people: 'The unexamined choice of just defaulting to a car? We want to reframe that for you.'\" I met the executives of ALSO on a Saturday afternoon at their office in Palo Alto, just across the street from Rivian's office, where they gave me a chance to try the product: a $4,500 e-bike. ALSO is calling it the T-MB for \"Transcendent Mobility Bike.\" Chris Yu, the president of the startup, told me that the \"genesis\" behind ALSO was simple: \"Why doesn't that magical experience you get out of a Rivian exist in anything smaller than a car?\" Having seen the bike up close and hearing the executives talk about the TM-B, I can clearly see where Rivian's vertically integrated approach and even the design language are ingrained into the bike. Yu said the startup is growing, from about 75 employees in March to over 150 employees today. ALSO is building a second office, located less than a mile away. Here's a closer look at the TM-B and the executives behind ALSO. Yu has an extensive background in biking. He told me he raced competitively in college and continued to do so throughout his years at Specialized Bicycle Components, a bike manufacturer, where he spent more than 10 years and led the company as the chief product and technology officer. Yu's not doing much racing these days, but he still bikes often with his son. Yu said he'd take his son to school on the back of his bike, one of the use cases ALSO kept in mind for the development of the TM-B. Both the father and son are intimately aware of the pain points for e-bikes. \"Every other bike that we've used when we hit potholes and the speed bump in his school parking lot, he'd always get bounced around, and he always just thought that was the norm,\" Yu said. \"The payload capacity to carry a 75-pound kid on the back does not exist,\" he added. Yu said that the TM-B was designed with a one-bike-fits-all approach. He said that one of the first pain points for consumers is deciding which type of e-bike to buy in the first place. \"We wanted to build in as much breadth of personality, utility, and capability into one platform as much as possible to remove that kind of initial friction and pain point,\" Yu said. I had the opportunity to try the launch edition, which has a starting price of $4,500. The base edition will start under $4,000. ALSO plans to launch in 2026. The TM-B stands apart from most e-bikes on the market due to its pedal-by-wire system. That means the pedals aren't mechanically linked to a chain that moves the tires. Instead, the pedals are attached to a generator, which provides the power to move you forward. That also means there's no gear shifting in the traditional sense. There is a manual mode where you can \"shift\" gears, and you'll feel a haptic feedback on the pedals that indicates when you're changing gears. I found that this propulsion system made going up a hill seamless. The bike didn't require much more pedaling effort when I went up a hill. The TM-B is a class 3 bike, giving a pedal-assist speed of up to 28 mph and a throttle that assists the rider for up to 20 mph. A standard battery pack delivers up to 60 miles of range. The large battery pack provides up to 100 miles of range. The regenerative braking system can extend the range by around 25%, according to the company. Riders can also use the battery as a portable charger for their electronic devices. Much like a Rivian, a rider can walk up to the TM-B to turn on the bike since it's connected to the user's phone. It's a \"software-defined\" bike, Yu said, which allows for over-the-air updates and an easy user experience straight out of the box. At around 70 pounds, the TM-B is not a traditional bike that a rider would lug up several floors of their apartment building. Yu said the company envisions riders treating the bike more like a car that you could feel comfortable leaving inside a parking structure. Kelly Veit, VP of software, said the bike is equipped with Wi-Fi, LTE, and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) connectivity for location tracking purposes and anti-theft protection. If the bike senses motion, the owner is alerted on their phone. If the bike is stolen, the owner can track its location and \"brick\" it, making it essentially unrideable. ALSO executives showed me three attachments: one for the solo rider, one that allows for up to 75 pounds of payload, including a small child or groceries, and a \"bench\" for more comfortable riding. All the modular seat attachments are equipped with lights on the back that also serve as turn signals. For bikers, that means no longer having to stick their arm out to indicate when they're about to make a turn. The headlight serves as a daytime running light and a turn signal. Yu said that the light can also indicate the battery charge status and show the progress of over-the-air updates. The throttle on the TM-B is set to a maximum speed of 20 mph, as per federal regulations for e-bikes, allowing the bike to reach that speed without pedaling. Saul Leiken, director of product line, said the bike was designed to accelerate \"basically as fast as a car can coming off of a stop sign.\" \"I'm not talking a zero to 60 type of thing,\" he said, \"but if you're running a little late to work, that allows you to ride with traffic instead of being in traffic's way.\" Yu said the throttle is helpful to quickly move out of intersections. Due to its fewer moving parts, Yu said the frequency of servicing the T-MB should be much lower than that of traditional bikes. The president said ALSO is working on several ways for riders to bring in their bikes: a \"small brick-and-mortar footprint across the country,\" a mobile service fleet, and a network of authorized service providers. Additionally, ALSO can notify users via telemetry if there is an issue with the bike, he said.

The Ray-Ban (Gen 2) glasses don't make major changes, but they didn't need to: It's still the best way to capture candid shots of your day or analyze your environment with your phone in your pocket, only with enough battery life so that you no longer have to worry they'll die mid-outing. Meta eventually wants true \"all-day\" glasses that record and respond to everything you see; these Gen 2 glasses aren't there yet, but they're getting closer. Major battery life upgrade Variety of styles, colors, and lenses for everyone High-res photos and stabilized action videos Contextual Meta AI insights Promise of regular post-launch updates Still too thick and heavy for non-techies Not as water-resistant as Vanguards No HUD  Why you can trust Android Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  When I reviewed the original Ray-Ban Meta glasses, I explained how much I liked them, but that others might skip them because of the Meta connection and privacy concerns. Instead, they became the world's best-selling smart glasses. Ray-Ban\/Oakley maker EssilorLuxottica is thriving thanks to AI glasses sales, on target to make 10 million units next year to meet demand. My Gen 2 review will focus on two types of people: the millions of Gen 1 buyers wondering whether these new glasses are enough to justify an upgrade, and smart glasses skeptics wondering whether to hop on the Ray-Ban train. For the first group, the Gen 2-to-Gen 1 gap is subtle, with some problems addressed and others unresolved. But just as Meta transformed the Gen 1s with Meta AI and Live AI months after launch, the best is yet to come for the Gen 2s \u2014 if you're patient. For smart glasses skeptics, I'll help you decide whether these Ray-Bans can replace your current combination of normal (sun)glasses, earbuds, and smartphone cameras. It'll come down to your personal style as much as hardware, but you probably won't like any current smart glasses if these are too thick or heavy for you.

Wayfarers have Standard or Large frame sizes to accommodate larger heads; Headliners have High and Low bridges. Skyler frames are one-size-fits-all. All styles and lens types let you add a prescription, though only through Meta or Ray-Ban directly. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler all start at $379 \u2014 $80 higher than the Gen 1 glasses. You'll pay $30 or $80 for Polarized or Transitions lenses, respectively.

Most of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) perks will be old news to Gen 1 owners, but are still worth explaining to new buyers. When I go out for a solo walk, run, hike, or round of golf, I think about wearing my Ray-Bans. They give me rich speakers for music or audiobooks to keep me motivated as I work out. I can snap first-person-perspective photos with a quick tap of the right temple button, and the five-mic array helps my voice come through crystal clear during phone calls. At any time, I can say, \"Hey Meta,\" and have the AI explain what plant species I'm looking at, set a reminder for where I parked, check my next appointment in Google Calendar, start playing a specific song or playlist, or message a family member. None of this is all that different from what you can do with a smartphone and earbuds, and they won't function without a phone. But it's a convenient combo package. The design isn't perfect, but the EssilorLuxottica partnership couldn't have worked out any better for Meta. The Ray-Ban manufacturer tapped its design expertise to make these glasses look normal (if thick) with dozens of variations; other tech brands can't offer this variety or leverage in-person glasses stores for fittings. The Wayfarers are the default look, boxy and a bit generic to \"blend in\" the most, while the rounded-edge Headliners and Skylers soften the thick-framed look somewhat. Whichever style you choose, I recommend splurging on the Transitions lenses. I don't use them indoors that often, but if I'm out for a long activity, they give me good eye protection to start and then switch to clear once the sun goes down.      As I wrote in my Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 first impressions, longer battery life is their most important upgrade. The old version had a 4-hour max but rarely lasted that long, and doubling the max capacity without the glasses getting noticeably heavier is worth praising. I've never hit Meta's eight-hour estimate, but only because I tend to use the Gen 2s heavily: nonstop music streaming, plenty of 3K videos, and Meta AI commands. Meta's five-hour estimate with music aligns with my experience, about 20% per hour while using all the main features. Whenever I've gone out and only taken photos or asked Meta a few questions, it's much closer to the 12.5%\/hour that Meta promises, with little battery use while idling. But with frequent videos or livestreaming, you'll burn through battery quickly.      - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Gen 1 - Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN - Oakley Meta Vanguard vs. Oakley Meta HSTN Camera quality from the 12MP ultrawide sensor hasn't changed since the Gen 1 glasses, and my thoughts from 2023 apply to the Gen 2s. Meta's camera is excellent at catching moving targets or adjusting to your movement; I've taken great shots while running. It captures a ton of detail, but no wayfinder means you'll have trouble knowing what you're actually photographing or how close to stand. Your height will also affect things; as a tall guy, I need to squat for the best close-up angle. Meta wants you to upload these directly to Instagram, but I find they usually need cropping and magic erasing in Google Photos first. Meta's post-processing tends to oversaturate photos, and Magic Eraser removes the unnecessary details. Be prepared to accept some trade-offs. Night photography is blurry, even with artificial light sources, and you won't find any alternative \"modes\" like portrait that blur things behind your subject. For natural, on-the-go, quick-snap photography, they're excellent; I can capture things I'd usually miss if I had to pull out my phone first. I just hope that by the Gen 3 release in a few years, we'll get landscape photography, a shortcut button to zoom in for faraway subjects, and other improvements. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses have the same video settings: 1080p or 3K at 30 FPS. Meta also says it'll eventually support 1200p at 60 FPS, but that setting still hasn't arrived as of late October. You can see the Oakley video test above from Android Central's Nick Sutrich showing how the new 3K video setting compares to 1080p on the Gen 1s. My findings are similar to his: 3K HDR videos give you more detail, better contrast, and less compression than the 1080p setting, especially in well-lit areas; in dimly lit rooms or at night, Ray-Ban videos are blurry and dull on either setting. For mobile videos \u2014 like recording while running a half-marathon \u2014 the 1080p setting is better, while 3K is distractingly shaky. Meta gave its sporty Vanguard glasses a smoother 60 FPS mode and customizable stabilization tools, so I'm assuming the Ray-Bans will get those soon.      My mom loved testing out my Ray-Ban Meta glasses; she went around her garden asking about every type of plant and taking photos. But after the novelty wore off, she handed them back and said she'd never wear them long-term because they're too big, both physically and aesthetically. I think plenty of people will agree with her that the thickness needed to fit the cameras, mics, and battery is very distinct, and might not fit their vibe. Meta will eventually have to pull off glasses that weigh slightly less if people are going to wear them all day, not just for outings.      I recommend trying them on at a local glasses or electronics store if you're uncertain. You'll have to decide if their 50g weight is oppressive and which size to choose. I find the Standard fit is more secure but digs deeper into my nose, while the Large fit is more comfortable but tends to drift down my face when I walk or run. Smart glasses have become much more mainstream, and the Gen 2 design blends in more than most XR glasses. But people outside the tech sphere still dislike wearable cameras that can start recording without warning, even with the white LED to warn them.      Some first-gen nitpicks have returned this generation, like the Ray-Ban logo being distractingly visible in the right lens, or Meta AI not being able to change glasses settings, only telling you where to look. You'll have to accept the noticeable audio spill; at the volume necessary to hear your music clearly, anyone else nearby will hear it, too. And I'd like Meta to add different audio profiles tailored to specific types of music (aka a bass mode) or to audiobooks and podcasts. Lastly, as I said earlier, Meta tread water on photography this generation, and I'd like to see improvements by next generation: A portrait\/ landscape toggle, optional zoom, better postprocessing, or other tricks.      If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. the Oakley Meta HSTN, you'll find they're virtually identical in hardware, differing only in style and Prizm lenses. But the Oakleys are theoretically tough competition if you prefer their aesthetic to Ray-Ban. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are more substantially upgraded: you get an extra hour of battery life, louder speakers, IP67 water resistance, and a more centered camera cutout. But they don't blend in like Ray-Bans, they have no Transitions or prescription options, and they're heavier \u2014 though the nose pads keep them in place. Then you have to compare the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses against the Gen 2s. Pay twice as much, and you get a built-in HUD for unique apps \u2014 map navigation, watching videos, reading messages, etc. \u2014 a viewfinder for better photography, and a neural band for gesture controls. But these glasses are notably thicker and heavier, available only in one style and two colors, and in limited stock.      You should buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... You shouldn't buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) if... Smart glasses newbies will either like the Ray-Ban style, easy photography, and AI insights, or get scared off by their size. The real question is whether Gen 1 or Stories owners will see enough to upgrade. Aside from battery life, the Gen 2 Ray-Bans won't feel that different from the last generation, but only because Meta has spent two years updating the Gen 1s. They didn't even launch with Meta AI, yet it's now the signature feature. We already know they'll get slow-motion and hyperlapse videos, Garmin integration, better video recording, and one-word commands like \"Photo\" by the end of 2025. And that should be just the start. Just look at Meta's AI glasses release notes \u2014 with eight feature updates so far in 2025 \u2014 to see what to expect. Ultimately, you won't find other display-free glasses that balance AI smarts, camera and speaker quality, and classic style so well, and I think Meta has done enough to tempt you to upgrade. However, if you're not convinced, check back in a few months \u2014 they might be even better by then.       Familiar tools, upgraded The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses have arrived with enhanced battery life, UHD video, and new styles to tempt long-time fans into upgrading. Unless an alternative Oakley style or the Display HUD really tempt you, you won't find a proper smart glasses rival to them. Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"ByRachel Wells, Contributor. I happened to be scrolling through job postings on Indeed just the other day and ran into this line: \u201cMust have experience using Generative AI tools for XYZ.\u201d What struck me wasn\u2019t the AI skills requirement itself, but the fact that the role being advertized wasn\u2019t connected to tech in any way. In fact, the organization hiring for the role wasn\u2019t even a tech employer. But this is not a unique situation. About \u201c51% of job postings requiring AI skills are outside IT and computer science occupations, with explosive 800% growth in generative AI roles across non-tech industries since 2022,\u201d Lightcast\u2019s analysts report. As our world and global workplace becomes increasingly digitized, we\u2019re finding more roles that are traditionally non-tech occupations, have requirements for tech skills such as artificial intelligence fluency and tools (applied AI), data literacy, and even aspects of software and web development. Think about it. Roles like: and many more, require some level of proficiency in at least one or more of these tech skills, which are now non-negotiable to include on your resume: This is because the roles I listed (especially management and leadership-level roles) will require digital and human collaboration, or at the very least, management and awareness of these systems so you can effectively lead your team and engage with stakeholders.  And beyond this, even as an entrepreneur, freelancer, start-up founder, or business leader in a small business setting, these skills are even more essential as your headcount will literally be a team of one or just a few to begin with, and you won\u2019t be able to outsource this expertise right away. Furthermore, each of these five skills have strong job growth potential in themselves, according to BLS data, and they\u2019re also high-income skills. As examples: To combat the tech skills gap and to ensure professionals have expertise from trusted, vetted industry professionals, different organizations like Adobe, Coursera, Codecademy, LinkedIn Learning, and Pluralsight have expert-led courses and certifications. You can include these certifications within your resume to demonstrate your proficiency and familiarity with specific tech skills and tools. I decided to pick one of these, Pluralsight, and include below five Pluralsight courses (which guide you to relevant certification tracks) to help you learn each of the five tech skills listed earlier in this article (taken from their website): Some courses are paid, and come with certifications. Others are free, and are a fantastic entry point to help you achieve baseline tech literacy \u201cand a broad introduction to the various tech domains,\u201d Chris Herbert, Pluralsight\u2019s Chief Content Officer, explains. \u201cOur free library gives learners an opportunity to take control  over their own learning by demystifying the lingo and explaining the tools and disciplines that exist within tech, and then they can use that knowledge to pursue further upskilling and reskilling.\u201d The on-demand courses are expert-led, meaning they\u2019re taught by professionals \u201cwho have at least 10 years of experience in their fields on average, and many authors have much more,\u201d he says. \u201cOur authors have built professional careers across various sectors within business and government, so we can help individuals gain insight into the skills that are in demand by employers across the board.\u201d Gaining a certification or completing an online upskilling course is nothing without hands-on practice, so I asked Herbert, \u201cHow do the hands-on labs work?\u201d \u201cLabs offer hands-on experience to accelerate the learning process,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are safe environments that are disconnected from an organization\u2019s critical systems so that technologists can practice their skills without putting their organization\u2019s operations or information at risk. Our labs enable learners to develop a stronger proficiency in a specific skill or technology through step-by-step instruction, practice exercises, and projects. Everyone learns differently, so we offer a variety of ways to learn, but labs help users practice and demonstrate their skills in an environment that simulates real-world working conditions.\u201d     The main takeaway here is that you don\u2019t need to directly work in tech to need tech certifications and skills on your resume. If you want to stand out in the job market, effectively lead your team, operations, and technology, and boost productivity and revenue while raising your own salary ceiling, pick up one of the courses and certifications from the providers I mentioned earlier (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, etc.) and start mastering these skills.","label":0}

Enter the Nothing Ear (3) \u2013 its latest flagship wireless earbuds with the now recognizable transparent look and some key improvements. While Nothing's naming scheme hasn't always been the most consistent, its earbuds have offered impressive hardware paired with a polished software experience. Ear (3) comes in with a more premium build, a dedicated microphone in the case and claims of improved sound output and superior noise cancellation. Did Nothing deliver a winner with the Ear (3), or is this just a generational update? The short answer is yes, these are arguably the best earbuds from the brand to date, but we'd also take some of the maker's claims with caution. Read on for our full breakdown. Table of Contents:  Design Features Sound quality and ANC Battery life Verdict  Design The design of Nothing products is pretty much its key selling point. The Ear (1) were unlike any other pair of TWS buds back in 2021 and the Ear (3) aren't going for a major redesign but rather a different choice of materials.  That's mostly visible in the case, which now incorporates a recycled aluminum base layer, which is cool to the touch and adds a more premium feeling than the all-plastic cases of the past. That premium feel comes at the expense of some heft as the Ear (3) case and buds now weigh 71 grams \u2013 10 more than their predecessor. The top and bottom portions of the case and the buds are still made from plastic with the same see-through look as on previous Nothing Ear models.  In terms of fit, the Ear (3) is identical to previous entries from the brand. Provided that you go for the correct silicone tip size for your ears, the buds will stay snug and we had no irritations even after multiple hours of continuous use. The other noticeable design change on the Ear (3)'s case is the addition of a Talk button, which, combined with the dual microphones and speaker, brings Nothing\u2019s Super Mic feature.     Nothing Ear (3) Talk button and microphone The idea is that you can use the case a portable microphone for calls, voice recordings or talk to your voice assistant.  As for the retail package, Nothing is offering its usual box which houses the buds and case, three sets of replacement silicone ear-tips and a short USB-C cable for charging. The buds and their case are IP54-rated for dust and water resistance. Features Nothing's flagship earbuds offer a healthy dose of features that are expected in the premium TWS market. These include 12 mm dynamic drivers with a 20 Hz \u2013 40 kHz frequency response range and adaptive noise cancellation up to 45dB, just like their predecessor. The new bit with the ANC system is that it now adjusts according to your surroundings at a 600 ms pace.  Ear (3) pair over Bluetooth 5.4 with multi-point pairing and support for Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair. These also come with spatial audio, though it does not support head tracking. You get support for the AAC, SBC, and LDAC codecs, as well as in-ear detection for automatic play and pause, and a low-latency mode for gaming and video. Nothing came with its signature pinch controls on the earbuds' stems. You get single, double and triple pinch gestures as well as single and double pinch and hold, which are programmable. Nothing also added 3x directional MEMS microphones in each earbud, alongside a bone-conduction voice pickup unit (VPU) per side.  Nothing Phone users running Nothing OS 3.5 or later have voice recordings automatically uploaded to the Essential Space app. Those recordings are also auto-transcribed, which is neat if you plan to use the buds and their case as a voice recorder. Nothing Ear (3) are managed via the Nothing X app, which is arguably the best and most feature-rich companion app on the market. It works equally well on Android and iOS and offers a great selection of controls and toggles to help you personalize the earbuds to your liking. Super Mic And then we get to the key new addition \u2013 Nothing's Super Mic system, which integrates two microphones on the case in the area next to the USB-C charging port. The feature only works if one of the earbuds is inserted in your ear and lets you use the new microphone setup once you press the Talk button located on the corner.  Nothing claims that the dual microphones on its case are powerful enough to isolate and pick up your voice in the noisiest of environments at up to 95dB. The premise is that you can use the case for calls in noisier venues, opt to capture voice notes or talk to your phone\u2019s virtual assistant. Sadly, the Super Mic system is limited to phone calls, your native voice assistant and native voice recording app. In our experience, Super Mic delivered noticeably better voice pickup than the microphones on the earbuds. Positioning the microphone close to your mouth works wonders for call quality.  While testing the Ear (3)'s Super Mic feature during calls, I routinely had people on the other end reporting that my voice sounds just as good as when talking via my phone\u2019s built-in microphone. So, if your current earbuds are always letting you down during calls, then the Ear (3)\u2019s case proves to be a powerful way to stay on top of your calls as long as you don\u2019t mind taking it out of your pocket. Sound quality and ANC Nothing has a long-standing history with over-pronounced bass in its earbuds and the Ear (3) are no expectation. Bass is definitely overpowering, but in a fun and enjoyable way. There\u2019s an instant oomph when you play music, especially noticeable in rap or EDM tracks.  The updated 12mm drivers come with a redesigned diaphragm, which it claims translates to better bass and treble reproduction compared to last year\u2019s model. They also feature a 20% larger radiating area, which further exaggerates the strong bass feeling. Overall, the Ear (3) delivers a wider sound stage than its predecessor, and there\u2019s less noticeable distortion going on. The new model feels livelier and more energetic than last year\u2019s Nothing Ear while also offering enhanced clarity in the mids and highs. Instrument separation is also improved.  Nothing's signature Advanced Equalizer tuning is present inside the Nothing X app with a fully customizable 8-band EQ. Ear (3) also gets some additional tweaks with the ability to select specific frequency values for each band and a Q factor, which offers controls for the shape of the equalizer curve and the bandwidth for more granular adjustments. You can save your custom profile and share it with others, or import ones from the Nothing community, which has plenty of options for different tastes. With the right EQ, the Ear (3) can deliver a more balanced sound stage, though that does take some tweaking, and we\u2019d appreciate it if Nothing is able to deliver that experience directly out of the box. ANC The adaptive noise cancellation on the Ear (3) is quite good, provided you have the right set of ear tips, though it's not as potent as something like the Sony WF-1000XM5, for example. In my testing, the Ear (3) held their own in the office, drowning out the AC, the water cooler, and keyboard clicks. With music playing in the background and ANC set to high, the Ear (3) helps drown out unwanted noises and makes for a great companion to your daily commute. Battery life Nothing claims up to 5.5 hours from the buds themselves with ANC on and an additional 22 hours from the charging case. These numbers extend to 10 hours and 38 hours, respectively, with ANC off. There's a 500 mAh battery inside the case, just like on last year's Nothing Ear, and 55 mAh in each earbud, which is a small upgrade.  In our real-world usage, we got 6.5 hours out of the buds with ANC on and audio playback primarily via the AAC codec. While not class-leading, this endurance is  respectable. Listening to audio via the LDAC codec limits playback to 3.5 hours with ANC on and 5.5 hours with ANC off. The case and buds take about 70 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% and you can also take the wireless route (at 2.5W speeds), though that will take even longer at 120 minutes. Verdict Nothing didn't re-invent the wheel with its Ear (3) but it did bring a better sounding pair of buds with improved build quality and a rich feature set befitting a premium product. The seemingly gimmicky Super Mic feature actually led to noticeably better-sounding calls, even if positioning the case near your mouth is not the best solution out there.       Nothing Ear (3)     $179 at Amazon US  \u20ac179 at Amazon DE \u00a3179 at Amazon UK   If we have to categorize audio coming from the Nothing Ear (3) it's punchy and loud, which will likely appeal to the general audience. If you\u2019re not a fan of the default V-shaped tuning, Nothing is offering granular adjustments with its Advanced Equalizer inside the Nothing X companion app.  While ANC is decent, competitors like Sony and Apple give you better sound isolation. Battery life is just okay but you can get more if you look elsewhere. At their core, Ear (3) are a great pair of earbuds, and Nothing\u2019s flashy looks and software polish are proving to be a differentiating factor in the crowded TWS market.

At their core, Ear (3) are a great pair of earbuds, and Nothing\u2019s flashy looks and software polish are proving to be a differentiating factor in the crowded TWS market. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.  Nothing has a long-standing history with over-pronounced bass in its earbuds and the Ear (3) are no expectation. Bass is definitely overpowering, but in a fun and enjoyable way. There\u2019s an instant oomph when you play music, especially noticeable in rap or EDM tracks. The updated 12mm drivers come with a redesigned diaphragm, which it claims translates to better bass and treble reproduction compared to last year\u2019s model. They also feature a 20% larger radiating area, which further exaggerates the strong bass feeling. Overall, the Ear (3) delivers a wider sound stage than its predecessor, and there\u2019s less noticeable distortion going on. The new model feels livelier and more energetic than last year\u2019s Nothing Ear while also offering enhanced clarity in the mids and highs. Instrument separation is also improved. Nothing's signature Advanced Equalizer tuning is present inside the Nothing X app with a fully customizable 8-band EQ. Ear (3) also gets some additional tweaks with the ability to select specific frequency values for each band and a Q factor, which offers controls for the shape of the equalizer curve and the bandwidth for more granular adjustments. You can save your custom profile and share it with others, or import ones from the Nothing community, which has plenty of options for different tastes. With the right EQ, the Ear (3) can deliver a more balanced sound stage, though that does take some tweaking, and we\u2019d appreciate it if Nothing is able to deliver that experience directly out of the box. ANC The adaptive noise cancellation on the Ear (3) is quite good, provided you have the right set of ear tips, though it's not as potent as something like the Sony WF-1000XM5, for example. In my testing, the Ear (3) held their own in the office, drowning out the AC, the water cooler, and keyboard clicks. With music playing in the background and ANC set to high, the Ear (3) helps drown out unwanted noises and makes for a great companion to your daily commute. Battery life Nothing claims up to 5.5 hours from the buds themselves with ANC on and an additional 22 hours from the charging case. These numbers extend to 10 hours and 38 hours, respectively, with ANC off. There's a 500 mAh battery inside the case, just like on last year's Nothing Ear, and 55 mAh in each earbud, which is a small upgrade.  In our real-world usage, we got 6.5 hours out of the buds with ANC on and audio playback primarily via the AAC codec. While not class-leading, this endurance is  respectable. Listening to audio via the LDAC codec limits playback to 3.5 hours with ANC on and 5.5 hours with ANC off. The case and buds take about 70 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% and you can also take the wireless route (at 2.5W speeds), though that will take even longer at 120 minutes. Verdict Nothing didn't re-invent the wheel with its Ear (3) but it did bring a better sounding pair of buds with improved build quality and a rich feature set befitting a premium product.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Ethereum\u2019s largest holders are stirring again, and if history is any guide, the quiet accumulation underway could foreshadow the next major market shift. Recent moves add to previous reports about Ethereum whale activity, suggesting returning investor confidence in the largest altcoin on market cap metrics. Data from Alphractal reveals that wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have steadily increased their balances since April. This marks one of the strongest accumulation waves since the 2021 cycle. The analytics source Alphractal shows that this group of whales, typically high-net-worth or institutional entities, has historically displayed the closest correlation with Ethereum\u2019s long-term price movements. \u201cWhen their supply went up in 2017 and 2021, ETH\u2019s price followed,\u201d CryptoRus noted. \u201cAnd 2025 is no different.\u201d The pattern suggests that while retail investors remain hesitant amid macro uncertainty and Bitcoin\u2019s recent consolidation, deep-pocketed players may be positioning for a longer-term breakout. Adding to the intrigue, on-chain tracker Lookonchain flagged a notable whale rotation from Solana to Ethereum. The entity reportedly sold 99,979 SOL, worth about $18.5 million at $185, and used the proceeds to buy 4,532 ETH at $4,084 after bridging the funds to the Ethereum network. A whale just rotated from $SOL to $ETH!A week ago, the whale sold 99,979 $SOL($18.5M) at $185 and bridged the funds to #Ethereum \u2014 then bought 4,532 $ETH($18.5M) at $4,084.https:\/\/t.co\/jVyQJtSFIphttps:\/\/t.co\/GivSWY6vQh pic.twitter.com\/phEeqtm731 The move highlights a subtle but growing conviction shift among sophisticated traders. They appear to favor Ethereum\u2019s relative stability and ecosystem depth over the faster-moving, higher-beta Solana market. However, not everyone sees clear skies ahead. Analyst Johnny Woo warned that broader altcoin markets, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, are flashing red on the weekly timeframe. \u201cSmart money and moon boys don\u2019t want you to see this chart\u2026TOTAL (excluding BTC and ETH) is flashing a sell signal\u2026 It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019ll get an altseason in the next two months. In my opinion, the next bullish phase will happen in Q1 2026,\u201d he wrote. Indeed, analysts are concerned about the altcoin market, withthe altseason yearly index now lower than November 2022. Altseason yearly index is now lower than November 2022.Let that sink in. pic.twitter.com\/R9HuFzGpFC That sentiment aligns with growing caution around Bitcoin\u2019s near-term trajectory. Analyst Mister Crypto highlighted that BTC is now hovering dangerously close to its 50-week moving average, a level that, historically, has preceded deeper corrections when lost. \u201cThe bear market always starts when we drop below the 50-week moving average,\u201d he warned. Together, these signals paint a market in transition, one where capital appears to be consolidating into major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum while liquidity drains from speculative altcoins. If Ethereum\u2019s whale activity continues to mirror past cycles, the quiet accumulation could be an early chapter in the network\u2019s next major expansion phase. However, as Bitcoin teeters on a key technical edge and altcoin sentiment cools, conviction, the one commodity whales seem to have in abundance, might once again separate the early movers from the late believers.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"It was, as everyone knew it would be, all about US President Donald Trump. He literally towered over everyone else at the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur where Cambodia and Thailand signed their agreement. He gave the longest speech - and made the biggest claims. It was all superlatives.  \"This is a momentous day for South East Asia,\" Trump said. \"A monumental step.\"  Describing the two slightly sheepish-looking prime ministers who were about to sign the deal as \"historic figures\", Trump recalled at length how he got involved in the Thai-Cambodian border conflict while he was visiting his Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July. \"And I said this is much more important than a round of golf... I could have had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun... saving people and saving countries.\" Trump had asked for this special ceremony as a condition for coming to the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit - a gathering US presidents have attended at times in the past, but not always. And he used it to press his campaign to be recognised as a great peacemaker.  \"The eight wars that my administration has ended in eight months \u2013 there's never been anything like that,\" he said. \"We're averaging one a month... It's like, I shouldn't say it's a hobby, because it's so much more serious, but something I'm good at and something I love to do.\" But what does the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accord\", as Trump has renamed it, actually amount to? Remember, both countries signed a ceasefire back in July.  That, too, was helped - or at least accelerated - by pressure from Trump.  Looking at the details of the latest deal, though, it isn't much of a leap forward. The two countries have agreed to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed border and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.  They have a new procedure for clearing landmines, and will set up what they call a joint taskforce to address the proliferation of scam centres.  They will replace missing border markers with temporary ones. This is progress - and Thai diplomats have told me they do feel Trump's involvement may help these agreements stick.  But the historic differences over the border remain unresolved and are at risk of flaring up again. After the ceremony, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow refused to call it a peace agreement - sticking instead to their own preferred title \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\", which doesn't exactly trip off the tongue. \"I would call it a pathway to peace,\" was as far as Sihasak was willing to go - a far cry from Trump's expansive claims for it. \"It's an extremely slight agreement for the president of the United States to be presiding over,\" posted Sebastian Strangio, author and South East Asia Editor for the Diplomat magazine. Cambodia has been a lot more enthusiastic, but then it has always sought to internationalise its dispute with Thailand - referring it to the International Court of Justice - something Thailand does not agree with.  At the ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet gushed with praise for the US president - reminding him that his government had nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charvirakul was more circumspect - mindful of nationalist pressure back home not to be giving too much away to Cambodia, a problem the authoritarian government in Cambodia does not have to worry about.  Thailand has always insisted the dispute should be resolved bilaterally, with no outside mediation.  It says it appreciates Trump's support, and describes the US and Malaysia as only \"facilitating\" this agreement. Neither country - nor the rest of Asean - could afford to spurn Trump's request for this ceremony.  South East Asia is the most export-dependant region in the world, far more reliant on the US market than China.  It has had a difficult year living under the existential threat posed by Trump's initial tariffs - up to 48% - and going through the nail-biting negotiations to bring them down to a more manageable 19-20%.  Trump is not even staying for most of the Asean summit.  After a couple of bilateral meetings and a dinner, he's off to Japan, and then to an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting - another multilateral grouping at odds with his brutally transactional style, but where he hopes to reset relations with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. But just having had the US president here in Kuala Lumpur for 24 hours will, Asean hopes, help restore some stability to their relationship. The US president announces he is adding 10% to current levies on one of the biggest US trading partners. Donald Trump has claimed to have ended another war, this time between Thailand and Cambodia. But what does this latest agreement actually amount to? The Treasury Secretary says the US has enough for the next military payday, but can't pay service members after that. US President Donald Trump in Malaysia: Dancing and a 'peace deal' The deployment marks a major escalation in what the US says is a campaign against drug traffickers, which Trump warns will include \"land action\".

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. Every company reaches a moment when standing still becomes the biggest risk. For Dine Brands Global, that moment has arrived. Three board seats are open. Franchisees are frustrated. Shareholders have watched the stock lose more than sixty percent of its value since 2021 while the CEO has collected close to thirty million dollars in compensation. We hold a one percent stake in Dine Brands. We did not invest in making noise. We invested because Applebee\u2019s and IHOP are iconic American brands with deep roots and recurring cash flow potential. What should be a steady compounder has turned into a textbook example of misalignment between management, owners, and operators. The next move will decide the company\u2019s direction and determine how much value remains. Franchise businesses work only when corporate leadership and local operators move in the same direction. That alignment has broken. The individuals operating the restaurants bear the responsibility, while the corporate center reaps the benefits. The numbers provide a clear picture. Since 2021, total shareholder return has been down more than sixty percent. The CEO has been paid roughly thirty million dollars. Franchisee costs have risen sharply. Same-store sales have stalled. Those figures do not lie. In past Forbes articles, such as What CEOs Still Get Wrong After GE\u2019s 400% Breakup Success and GE\u2019s 400 Percent Breakup Return Is a Wake-Up Call for Every CEO, I explained how misaligned incentives always destroy trust before they destroy value. Dine Brands is heading down the same road. Applebee\u2019s and IHOP were built on community and consistency. They work when operators feel supported and guests feel understood. When franchisees cannot reinvest or hire because of rising corporate fees and weak marketing, value evaporates from the system. A company cannot create shareholder wealth by starving the people who generate it. Talk to the operators and the message is consistent. Costs are up. Fees are up. Support is limited. When a franchisor acts more like a landlord than a partner, the foundation starts to erode. Franchisees are not employees. They are owners who invest their capital. They carry the risk of local competition, supply costs, and labor shortages. Their confidence is the true measure of the brand\u2019s health. One IHOP owner told me, \u201cThey take their bonuses before we even get a menu redesign.\u201d Another Applebee\u2019s operator said, \u201cWe cut overtime just to pay brand fees.\u201d These are not isolated complaints. They are warnings. Cultural decline begins when management stops listening. The board cannot fix what it refuses to see, and at Dine Brands, it has not been looking closely enough. Remove the corporate language and Dine Brands looks like a business with good bones managed for comfort instead of performance. Revenue has been flat for years despite higher menu prices. Leverage remains high, leaving little room to invest in the system. Capital has gone to buybacks and executive compensation rather than innovation or remodels. This is not how long-term value is created. It is financial engineering instead of operational improvement. We saw this pattern at GE and Boeing before their own turning points. Both GE and Boeing mismanaged their strong brands and valuable assets. GE changed course and unlocked value. Boeing still struggles. Dine Brands has not begun to face it. Despite the missteps, the opportunity here is real. Dine Brands owns two national restaurant brands with stable royalties and a loyal customer base. The market prices the stock as if a decline is inevitable. It is not. Our analysis suggests the equity could double or better over the next two to three years if governance and execution improve. A business that collects steady royalties from two recognized brands should not trade at a distressed multiple. It trades there only because investors no longer trust leadership. The three open board seats are a chance to change that. We will nominate experienced operators and disciplined investors who understand that value begins at the unit level. Our full plan, including governance reforms and operational priorities, is available at www.fixdinebrands.com. This is not theory. It is a practical roadmap based on what has worked at other turnarounds. The board of Dine Brands faces a choice. It can engage with shareholders and franchisees to rebuild trust or it can continue to defend the status quo. Governance is not about protecting management. It is about protecting value. The current board has allowed both to erode. Each quarter of denial adds more risk. The longer they wait, the harder the recovery becomes. Our approach is constructive. We prefer partnership to confrontation, but we will not stand by while value disappears. Our nominees are ready. Our proposals are public. The coalition of investors and operators supporting reform grows every week. The board must now decide whether it wants partners or adversaries. This is not just about restaurants. It is about market structure and behavioral traps. Investors often assume that a falling stock price reflects permanent decline. It usually reflects poor leadership and bad incentives. Both can be fixed. Dine Brands is a mispriced asset hidden in plain sight. When structure improves, capital follows. GE\u2019s breakup showed what happens when governance catches up with reality. Honeywell and Intel are now walking the same path. Fixing Dine Brands means aligning pay with results, rebuilding franchisee confidence, and restoring credibility to capital allocation. That combination expands earnings without expanding footprint. Shareholders who act early will benefit most. Those who wait will pay for complacency. The next twelve months will separate those who saw the inflection from those who ignored it. Our reform plan starts with basics that should have been obvious. These are the fundamentals of stewardship. Their absence tells you everything about how far off course leadership has drifted. The next few months will determine whether Dine Brands stabilizes or slides further. Franchisees will decide whether to reinvest. Shareholders will vote on who fills the open seats. If management embraces change, the business could become one of the best comeback stories in consumer dining. If they resist, the company will join the list of once-great franchises undone by arrogance. Markets forgive mistakes. They do not forgive denial. This company relies heavily on its franchisees. Shareholders are its backbone. Both have been neglected. This campaign is not about control. It is about alignment. The people who build value deserve to share in it. The board and management have forgotten that. In my earlier Forbes article, Ken Griffin Says AI Isn\u2019t Producing Alpha\u2014Here\u2019s Where It Still Exists, I explained that real alpha lives where inefficiency and inaction meet. Dine Brands is that inefficiency today. The next move will define its future and its value. For management, it is a chance to prove they still believe in the brands they lead. For shareholders, it is a moment to act, not hope. For franchisees, it is a chance to rebuild what made these names great. Our presentation is available at www.fixdinebrands.com. Dine Brands\u2019 future is simple. The only question left is whether the board wants to create value or keep explaining why it no longer exists.","label":0}

I'm sorry, but I can't stay quiet any more. I've watched too many household names on both sides of the pond waltz into new territories with misplaced confidence\u2026 only to retreat months later with a hefty hole in the balance sheet. And honestly? The mistakes are always the same. Take Liquid Death, the canned water brand that's made millions in the US with edgy punk-rock packaging and slogans like \"murder your thirst\". Brilliant in Brooklyn. Baffling in Basingstoke. They launched in the UK in 2023, scraped together \u00a32 million in sales over 18 months, then packed it in early 2025. Why? Because British consumers looked at a \u00a35.50 four-pack of water\u2014water\u2014and thought, \"nah mate, you're alright: I've got a tap.\" The problem isn't that Liquid Death is a bad brand. It's that they assumed what worked in one market would automatically work in another.\u00a0 The inconvenient truth is this: brand personality doesn't travel well. What reads as confident and cheeky in one country can land as obnoxious elsewhere.\u00a0 Americans are used to paying a premium for brand experience. But Brits? We're notoriously tight. Expecting us to shell out for fancy water when perfectly drinkable stuff comes out of the tap was always a stretch. Prime Hydration learned this the hard way too. The influencer-juice went from \u00a3120 million in UK revenue in 2023 to \u00a333 million in 2024; a 70% nosedive. Turns out that when the TikTok hype fades and teens realise they're paying through the nose for Lucozade with a YouTuber's face on it, they stop buying. Hype may get you in the door, but only repeat purchases keep you there.      None of this should be new to anyone. Think back to how Best Buy arrived in the UK in 2010 with plans for 200 big-box stores. They opened 11 before shutting shop in 2011, losing around $318 million. Their crime? Assuming UK shoppers wanted US-style megastores in out-of-town retail parks. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. We don't. We like our high streets. We like popping into Currys on our lunch break, not driving 40 minutes to stand in an aircraft hangar full of televisions. Best Buy didn't bother to understand how we actually shop. Tesco made the same mistake in reverse, with Fresh & Easy in the US. They rolled out small-format stores just as the 2008 recession hit. Americans prefer one massive weekly shop at a supersized store, not frequent trips to a dinky outlet with self-checkouts and shrink-wrapped veg. Tesco lost over a billion dollars before admitting defeat in 2013. Timing matters, too. Walmart entered Germany in 1997, thinking they'd revolutionise the market with low prices and high volume. But that nation's consumers already had Aldi and Lidl; homegrown discounters who understood the local market intimately. Walmart's attempts to impose US corporate culture (mandatory staff smiles, no unions) went down like a lead balloon. They left in 2006, a billion dollars poorer. Starbucks discovered something similar in Australia. They opened 85 stores but had to close 61 of them by 2008. Why? Because Australia already had a thriving caf\u00e9 culture serving genuinely good espresso. Starbucks' sugary, milky drinks felt like an insult to a nation of self-confessed coffee snobs.      Here's what baffles me: all these companies had resources. Market research budgets that could fund a small country. And yet they still got it wrong. Because they didn't truly listen to the market they were entering. They assumed their brand strength would simply steamroll local preferences and rivals. But culture isn't a bug to be ironed out; it's the whole thing. You need to understand why people buy what they buy, how they shop, what they value. And then, crucially, you need to adapt. The brands that succeed globally treat each new market like a fresh challenge, not a conquered territory. They localise not just their language but their entire approach. They're humble enough to admit they don't know everything. And if you don't? You'll end up as just another cautionary tale for the next cocky domestic brand that thinks it can conquer the world with a fancy logo and a fat marketing budget.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"When you cross into Loudon County, Virginia, one of the first things you notice is the hum - that's the sound of 199 data centres whirring in the background. Few people have heard of this inconspicuous part of northern Virginia, which also happens to be the wealthiest county in the US. But Loudon was on everyone's radar earlier this week, when a massive global Amazon outage downed everything from crucial banking services to fun Snapchat streaks for millions.  That's because the county is home to the world's largest swath of data storage and processing facilities - even outpacing China.  Data centres - dedicated spaces for computer systems that help power the internet and artificial intelligence - are essential to our global connectivity.  But while they have proven to be a lucrative business - contributing billions to the local economy - some residents worry the cost comes at too high a price. There are some 200 facilities taking up about 45 million square metres in Loudoun, giving the county the nickname Data Center Alley.  Data centres take up 3% of the total land area of the county and 40% of its budget. And now more facilities are on their way. Emily Kasabian was walking her newborn son along her picturesque neighbourhood road in Virginia earlier this year, when she saw something that stopped her in her tracks. A sign for a proposed data centre moving in across the street. Two years ago, when Ms Kasabian purchased her home she said she was relieved to be away from the data centres that have taken over other parts of the county. The lack of centres nearby was the reason many of her neighbours chose to live there, she said.  \"I never thought that a data centre would be built across the street from my house,\" she said. \"I would not have bought this house if I had known what was going in across the street.\" The reason she, and so many others, are opposed to these large facilities is not just because of their overpowering appearance - a typical data centre can be 100,000 square feet, turning whole streets into large industrial blocks - but some of their side effects, too. A massive bright blue concrete and glass data centre sits just steps from Greg Pirio's front door in Loudoun County. Thirteen years ago when he purchased his home that patch of land was filled with green trees and chirping birds.  Today, he deals with the centre\u2019s impacts in real time - the one that bothers him the most is the noise pollution. \"There are no birds around here anymore,\" he said, noting the humming or buzzing noise the centre emits scares away a lot of wildlife from his area.  In addition to the noise concerns, people who live in the area expressed frustration with rising electricity bills. In the past five years, wholesale electricity costs have gone up by as much as 267% in areas near data centres, an investigation by Bloomberg News found.  But while most locals the BBC spoke to opposed the data centres, the industry has many powerful proponents, including US President Donald Trump.  Data centres are essential to help grow the burgeoning industry of AI, a field that Trump has said he wants the United States to lead in.  His administration has said it will \"accelerate federal permitting of data center infrastructure\" to conjure \"a golden age for America manufacturing and technology\".  The centres can have big impacts on local and state economies, too. Annually, the data centre industry creates about 74,000 jobs, totalling $5.5bn (\u00a34bn) in labour income to Virginia's economy, according to a state audit.  Loudoun County was among the first to see the potential, about a decade ago, and begin growing this new industry.  Developers realised the area was the perfect place for data centres - it was filled with flat, cheap land. Local officials soon got on board and began giving corporations like Amazon and Google the green light to start building their facilities.  And the area had one more thing going for them in their quest to create a headquarters for a new burgeoning industry: the right talent.  \"Northern Virginia was really at the centre for the growth of the internet, [it was] where AOL was headquartered, and so naturally they have the talent, they have the people already there, it was just easier to make [the data centres] there,\" cybersecurity expert Thomas Hyslip said. Since the industry began booming rapidly earlier this century, regulations on the centres have been limited.  Virginia's Governor, Glenn Youngkin, vetoed state legislation that would have regulated the centres earlier this year. Dan Diori, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, said the industry needed to do a better job communicating the up-sides of these centres, and listening to people's concerns. But he doesn't think more regulation is necessary.  Data centres are not going anywhere, he said. They are and will continue to be the \"backbone of the 21st Century economy\".  But some residents, like Barbara Day, say people shouldn't have to choose between the economy and quality of life. \"These data centres are going up faster than we realised the implications of and then we're back-paddling to fix it,\" she said.  Market reports show that in August 2025, there were currently more than 1,100 data centres across the US, with almost 400 new centres being built. Activists like Ms Kasabian hope to chip away at those numbers, by lobbying state and local legislatures to delay or pause projects. \"This is a beautiful great place to live, but if this type of development continues to happen and they allow it to encroach they are eroding what makes this a great place to live and we'll start to see the consequences of that soon unless we start to course correct in a very major way,\" she said.  The mother of two knows she may not win this battle and the data centres may soon appear across the street from her idyllic suburban neighbourhood, forcing her family to make the difficult decision to move.  \"The question is, well, do we want to stay in the county, how do we know where we move next the same thing isn't going to happen?\" Video by Meiying Wu Platforms, including Open AI's Sora, have gone viral due to their ability to make hyper-realistic videos. One officer said pickpockets fly in from abroad and fly out once they've amassed a haul of phones. OpenAI hopes to upend the browser market currently dominated by Google Chrome, but it depends on paid users.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"REWIND and PLAY  Still, it was a relatively open secret that the ANS was heavily derived from existing Power Macintosh hardware, most closely the Power Macintosh 9500, and early \"Shiner\" prototype systems were even demonstrated with MacOS. This was apparently the underpinning of Apple's brief flirtation with NetWare as a server OS, variously codenamed Wormhole, Deep Space Nine and most famously Cyberpunk. Then-CEO Michael Spindler made public statements supporting NetWare on Apple hardware; Wormhole was reportedly demonstrated on an early prototype likely of the Workgroup Server 9150 and Cyberpunk was explicitly meant for Shiner. Cyberpunk will no longer run on an ANS with production ROMs, but reportedly did run on ANSes with pre-production ROMs that could still boot MacOS, and does run on early NuBus Power Macs like the Power Macintosh 6100, which is how we demonstrated it. However, potential customers strongly preferred a Unix option and Apple had an arrangement with IBM around AIX, and so as the last operating system still standing that's what the ANS ended up running. Production ANSes as sold with the standard Open Firmware 1.1.22 ROMs lock MacOS out entirely and you get a message like this:    Although an old nerds' tale circulated at the time saying you could pull 9500 ROMs, put in a video card and boot from an external hard disk (because the video chip and internal SCSI controller are unique to the ANS and weren't supported by the 9500 or MacOS), this couldn't possibly have worked because among other things the Bandits in the ANS are mapped differently. Lots of people, including yours truly, had certainly tried. Still, I was used to AIX as an AIX administrator since the 3.2.5 days on real RS\/6000 hardware and the ANS ran it splendidly, so today mine still runs it (4.1.5 is the last AIX release supported).    But to me the best thing about the ANS was that I got a big beefy RISC server for a summer's work, so I didn't have to plump down a credit card. For everyone else, the ANS was expensive (starting at $10,000+ in 1996, a cool $20 grand in 2025 dollars) and Apple wasn't moving many. CEO Gil Amelio had lured Ellen Hancock away from National Semiconductor as Apple's new CTO and tasked her with finding a new path for the MacOS, though in the meantime Apple had this big hulking midrange server that wasn't selling. So, as an attempt to juice sales, Hancock announced at Comdex 1996 that the ANS would be able to run other operating system choices, not just AIX. MacOS was an obvious one because it already had before, but Hancock also proposed Windows NT to the great surprise of attendees. While Windows NT was built to be system-agnostic and versions already ran on PowerPC hardware, and people have since hacked it to run on Power Macs, this would have been the first time it could officially ever run on an Apple machine.  Hancock's assertion was a simple ROM change would do it, and as it happens the ROMs on the ANS are conveniently on a small daughtercard that can be replaced. However, it seems that the market was sceptical this could work \u2014 heck, I was sceptical while doing the story research, since I knew no such ROMs were ever publicly sold \u2014 and the recently-returned Steve Jobs talked Amelio into cancelling the ANS line and OpenDoc both on the same day in 1997. Nothing more ever turned up about either option.      Recently a former employee who was on the business development team for Apple's server products posted on the Tinker Different boards: not only did he have the mythical MacOS ROM, he had it installed in a Deep Dish booting the MacOS. Deep Dish was the code name for the planned but unreleased ANS 300, a small rackmountable version (as opposed to the rackmount plates Apple sold for the 500 and 700 which take up a whopping 19U), so here was a prototype machine running development ROMs booting an operating system it was never actually sold with. More to the point, he confirmed the Windows NT ROMs actually did exist and worked as well.  Though he didn't have the NT ROMs, he did dump the two development ROMs he had (a third is in progress) which included the MacOS ROM \u2014 and now we have them for analysis. What's interesting is that both the explicit MacOS ROM and the Open Firmware 2.26b6 ROM he dumped seem capable of booting MacOS, though the 2.2 ROM has strings saying MacOS is unsupported, use at your own risk. and MacOS requires PCI video card and external SCSI boot disk. (which may lend credence to that old nerds' tale, assuming you had the right ROMs, not the 9500's). However, the full MacOS ROM reportedly \"just works,\" all the way to Mac OS 9; one wonders if with XPostFacto you could drag it into OS X that way, giving it another Unix option besides AIX, Linux and NetBSD, the driver issue notwithstanding. Though the MacOS ROM does not use the ANS's front-mounted LCD, which is one of its best features, it wouldn't seem difficult to come up with an INIT extension for it. A particularly tantalizing thought is this might also get Cyberpunk running on a Shiner for the first time since 1996, the very machine it was intended for.  To make all that happen, of course, we next need to get the MacOS ROM on an actual ROM card. The ROMs this individual had were flashable and I need to do some looking at mine, and the connectors aren't common. Nevertheless, the first step is to actually have the ROM and now we do. I'm hopeful that this breakthrough might encourage further exploration of my favourite Apple server and that someone out there has the NT ROMs and steps forward. The Apple Network Server was always a cult favourite as one of Apple's more notorious white elephants and now almost 20 years after its introduction there may be even more fun things to do on it.

Oh, totally we would need the HAL, but there is a prayer of rolling our own. The ROM would be much harder.By the way, you're doing the Lord's work with that NT hack! It's a great job. \"there is a prayer of rolling our own\", i mean I can probably write powerpc hals in my sleep at this point ;)...but it should be possible to get NT to boot on ANS without the \"special ROM\" for it though, you'd need to get a port of my ARC firmware running on it.that would need its own stage1 port though, because I decided to require a working Mac OS Toolbox ROM for Old World systems, partially for ease of development (being able to call into existing Mac OS graphics driver to do required mode switching instead of reimplementing it), partially for ease of use (NT being first class in Startup Disk) and partially for thinking about PowerPC NuBus systems without Open Firmware.(when I was doing research for that I was surprised to see SCSI Manager having support for AIX partition tables, and that support staying in place until the last New World tbxi!) Interesting! Though, given how intertwined AIX\/PowerOpen was with the PowerPC MacOS, not entirely unexpected. I'm sure Spindler was thinking about it given everything else he was shopping around.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":"The outcome of the elections could determine the future of Milei\u2019s economic programme and a vital $40bn US bailout. By Tim Hume and News Agencies Share Save Argentina has voted in midterm legislative elections that will gauge support for President Javier Milei\u2019s sweeping free-market reforms, which have caused austerity pains for many, at a critical juncture in his presidency. Elections were held on Sunday for half of Argentina\u2019s lower Chamber of Deputies, or 127 seats, as well as a third of the Senate, or 24 seats. The outcome could determine whether Milei\u2019s libertarian programme of hefty budget cuts and bids to deregulate the country\u2019s struggling economy will endure. Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party, a relatively new political force in Argentina, has only 37 deputies and six senators, amounting to less than 15 percent of seats in Congress. The party is aiming to boost that share to at least a third of seats in Congress \u2013 to help defend against opposition attempts to thwart the president\u2019s agenda, to shore up investor confidence and, crucially, to retain Milei\u2019s support from fellow right-winger United States President Donald Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t give up because we\u2019re halfway there,\u201d Milei told supporters at a closing campaign event in the port city of Rosario on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re on a good path.\u201d Reporting from Buenos Aires after polls closed on Sunday, Al Jazeera\u2019s Teresa Bo said that voter turnout was believed to be \u201cvery low\u201d. \u201cSome say that it\u2019s the lowest since Argentina returned to democracy back in 1983 \u2013 around 66 percent, and this could play against Javier Milei,\u201d Bo said.      Earlier this month, Washington pledged a $40bn potential bailout, including a $20bn currency swap to stabilise the value of the peso, and a possible $20bn \u201cfacility\u201d. But Trump has threatened to pull away if his populist ally performs poorly, warning that \u201cif he doesn\u2019t win, we\u2019re not going to waste our time, because you have somebody whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again.\u201d Trump\u2019s bailout plans have infuriated US farmers struggling amid his trade war with China, and many have questioned his \u201cAmerica First\u201d credentials. US Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa recently summed up the concerns: \u201cWhy would the USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers\u2019 biggest market???\u201d On October 19, a reporter asked Trump why he decided to aid Argentina despite concerns among US soya producers. \u201cArgentina is fighting for its life,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cYoung lady, you don\u2019t know anything about it. \u2026 They have no money. They have no anything.\u201d Currently, both chambers in Argentina are controlled by the left-wing and centrist opposition to Milei\u2019s party, with the Peronist opposition movement currently holding the largest minority in both houses. Milei, a brash, self-declared \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d, came to power in December 2023, promising to revitalise Argentina\u2019s long-ailing economy, wielding a chainsaw as a symbol of his intention to radically cut state spending. His presidency has seen tens of thousands of public sector jobs disestablished, spending on education, health and pensions slashed, and public works frozen. The austerity policies have been blamed for pushing millions deeper into poverty, but have slowed monthly inflation \u2013 down from 12.8 percent before Milei\u2019s inauguration to 2.1 percent last month \u2013 albeit while economic growth and consumption have faltered. Meanwhile, many of Milei\u2019s signature policies, including bids to privatise state-owned enterprises, have been blocked by Congress. Adding to his woes, members of Milei\u2019s inner circle have been implicated in scandals, including one tied to his sister, who also serves as his chief of staff. With Milei\u2019s approval numbers down, and following losses for his allies in bellwether provincial elections in Buenos Aires last month, pundits predict his party will struggle to achieve its target of a third of the seats up for grabs. Mauricio Monge, Latin America economist at Oxford Economics, told AFP that the US bailout was \u201cnot enough to counteract the growing likelihood that the election results will prevent further reforms\u201d. \u201cIf history has taught us anything about Argentina, it\u2019s that previous bailouts, when political support wanes, have proven futile,\u201d he said.

{"date":"2025-10-26","content":" REVIEW \u2013 We have seen wet\/dry vacuums flooding (heh) the small appliance market for some time now and I have loved many of them. However, if you have hardwood, tile, etc., and live in your home, what do you more than likely also have? Rugs. This is where I found such a shortfall of all my wet\/dry vacs. Sure, I could quickly mop up those outside puppy paw prints, but I have to go get a whole different machine to suck up the unsupervised catnip party the cat threw. Dreame must have heard my rumblings because they\u2019ve released the H15 Pro CarpetFlex that allows the user to choose a different roller for each floor type and clean itself afterwards.  \u2b07\ufe0e\u00a0Jump to summary\u00a0(pros\/cons) Price: $699.99 Where to buy: Amazon and Dreame  The Dreame H15 Carpetflex Pro is a stand-up cordless floor cleaner. All the floors! It comes with separate rollers for carpet and wood\/tile floors, and even emits a fine mist around the vacuum part to keep dust down. It\u2019s got a self-propelling motor for the wheels to make maneuvering over large open spaces easier. The charging base acts as the machine\u2019s cleaning system for washing the roller(s) and treating it to a heated dry function for 30 minutes, significantly cutting down on any funky odors.  The Dreame is designed to be as easy-to-use as possible. The clean water reservoir sits directly above the brush, allowing you to keep an eye on the water level while you\u2019re humanely relocating those dust bunnies.  The H15 Pro CarpetFlex has features I didn\u2019t even know I wanted. For example, a mist function to tamp down dust AND a quiet mode for those mid-evening cleaning sessions where waking the whole house isn\u2019t optimal. The dirty water tank is accessible from the front and the design does the job of keeping our hands away from where the used water gets dumped out. In fact, it can be removed while the CarpetFlex is drying to be emptied and rinsed without disturbing the roller dry mode.  The filter does a dynamite job of catching debris, like this oatmeal, and there is even a \u201clarger debris\u201d slide on the front of the machine for larger particles.  This also is helpful for thicker carpets when using the carpet roller.\u00a0 The CarpetFlex is made to lay flat to fit under smaller spaces and has assistive wheels for ease of use not to mention reduce fatigue.  I would be absolutely missing one of the best points in the CarpetFLex\u2019s self clean that not only has a pre-programed cleaning and drying set up for the wet dry roller, but also one for the carpet roller. The wash is relatively quick, with\u00a0hot water, then automatically transitions into dry mode. The H15 Pro CarpetFlex has one of the easiest assemblies. You attach the handle into the designated port on the top of the machine till you hear a click. Then, place on the dock and charge to 100% before first use.  That\u2019s it, and you\u2019re ready to roll.  Once charged, you\u2019ll fill the top tank with water and cleaning fluid and reattach to the machine. I will say, check these parts for shipping cardboard. It came VERY well packaged. I was really tough on this machine. As I wrapped up testing, the area where I live was hit with a nor\u2019easter and I used the H15 Pro EVERY. DAY. IT RAINED. It picked up not just the muddy gross water dripped in on the fur kid, it also sucked up all of the leaves that blew in while mother nature demonstrated her wrath.   I thought I would be disappointed with my peanut butter test.\u00a0 You know, because dogs poop in the house sometimes, and it\u2019s not going to be solid 100% of the time. Imagine my surprise when the self cleaning function worked so well that I wasn\u2019t haunted once by the ghost of peanut butter odors past.  I love the easy tab system to switch the rollers out. One flick and its ALMOST a one handed replacement. I sprinkled my rugs with a box of baking soda to test the suction. Not only did it pull from the low pile of my rugs, but never clogged once.  Granted, there are a few things I could take away points for, like the cleaning assist. In theory, I get it, it gives you a little push get things done a little quicker, sure. But these wheels are wild and almost too powerful for the machine. They constantly spin themselves, even with the adjusting speed feature.  I also noticed that with the front end of the machine, it\u2019s very hard to get into corners under the baseboards, which I notice only because I am the messiest baker this side of the Mississippi river and flour might\u00a0 be permanently in some of the areas of my house, but I digress. Trying to navigate head on didn\u2019t really pull any debris from those areas and didn\u2019t register on the \u201cclean meter\u201d.  I think the \u201cquiet mode\u201d should really be more accurately described as more of a \u201clower power\u201d mode since its only slightly more quiet than a normal mode and it\u2019s more of a help to battery life. All that being said, this is a really good all in one machine. I keep it close in the kitchen and know that I\u2019ll be super appreciative of it\u2019s self clean during the holidays full of events and visitors. \u00a0 \u00a0 Price: $699.99 Where to buy: Amazon and Dreame Source: The sample of this product was provided for free by Dreame.
