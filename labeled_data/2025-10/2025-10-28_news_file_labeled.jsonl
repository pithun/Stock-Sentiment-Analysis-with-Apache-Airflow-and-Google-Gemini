Sign up now Market musings In the market, entire weeks can pass without any real catalyst. Inspiration can run thin, which can lead to traders talking themselves into tepid moves based on minimal information. This is definitely not one of those weeks. In fact, every single one of the four main narratives is in play concurrently, setting up an unpredictable period of trading. After all, the market is not a kung-fu movie, dispatching developments in orderly fashion, one at a time. It's more like John Wick, with complications constantly coming from all angles, often multiple at once. Let's recap the landscape, and how each driver could shape markets in the near term: Catalyst 1: The Fed The next FOMC meeting kicks off today, with the culmination on Wednesday, when the central bank announces its latest interest-rate decision. The Fed is overwhelmingly expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. What could happen: A single rate cut is priced in with 98% certainty, so any volatility will result from Powell's comments. If he laments that inflation is peskily high, that could dent rate-cut hopes and send stocks lower. But if he complains about any other struggling economic force \u2014 like the labor market \u2014 that could stoke expectations of more aggressive cuts, giving stocks a boost. Catalyst 2: AI fever The latest big development in this space came on Monday as Qualcomm threw its hat in the ring by announcing new chips and computers. This sent the company's stock surging (see below) and lifted chip names overall. Another week, another shuffling of major AI players \u2014 and this time OpenAI wasn't even involved. What could happen: Even if the Qualcomm-adjacent stock moves are limited to a single day, the company's announcement further raises investor antennae for new products and cross-company collaborations \u2014 all of which have been rocket fuel for associated stocks. Catalyst 3: Earnings season This week is as big as it gets. Across Wednesday and Thursday, the following mega-cap tech giants report: Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. That's 25% of the S&P 500 right there. What could happen: At risk of stating the obvious, strong results should lead to stock gains. The question then becomes: what constitutes \"strong\"? For this group, which is enmeshed in the AI race, strength can be defined in a couple ways, namely: (1) better-than-expected future earnings forecasts and (2) tangible results of massive AI spending. Catalyst 4: Trade progress This is last chronologically, but certainly not least, since a reported US-China treaty was the main source of record highs for stocks on Monday. The main event comes on Thursday, with Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set to meet. What could happen: Looking at the index level, trade-war progress is unabashedly positive. Fewer tariffs and more global collaboration is a good thing, especially for US exporters. At the sector and single-stock level, it's a bit more unpredictable, although there has been an unwinding of trades that benefited from US-China gridlock. For instance, safe-haven assets like gold and US Treasurys gave up some gains on Monday, while US-affiliated rare-mineral stocks took a tumble. Expect this to continue if further progress is solidified. Let's play a game: Can you tell the exact moment that Qualcomm announced its new lineup of semiconductor chips, with the intention of challenging Nvidia? All kidding aside, this was a momentous moment not just for the share price, but for the whole AI race broadly. While Qualcomm is a comparatively late entrant to the battle for AI supremacy, the company argues that its existing mobile technology will differentiate its chips. The market certainly seemed to agree, lifting shares 11% on the day, up 22% at intraday highs. Interestingly, Nvidia didn't take a dive on the increased competition, and was instead pulled higher alongside other chipmaker stocks. Even when someone comes at the king, the king still wins. Today's chart comes from Torsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo. It shows that the US currently has more data centers built than all other major countries combined. It has 5,425, more than 10 times Germany, which is in a distant second place. \"The bottom line is that the rest of the world is far behind the US when it comes to AI,\" Slok wrote. Be sure to browse Business Insider's interactive map, which shows where data centers are all across the US. And check out the full investigation here. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. There's been plenty of recent chatter \u2014 and debate \u2014 about a potential AI bubble. Lance Roberts, the CIO at RIA Advisors, is leaning into the \"not a bubble\" narrative. He says the next few months are actually a good time to buy mega-cap tech stocks leading the AI trade, and he offers three main reasons why. The first is earnings, with Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple scheduled to report this week. \"They should all be good because we came into the earnings season with estimates brought down a bit,\" Roberts told BI about the bevy of tech stocks reporting. Second is buybacks, which have historically been a way for companies to engineer stock gains and signal to investors that they think their stock is affordable. Repurchases are up 16% year-over-year, and companies that do them have been rewarded, Goldman Sachs data shows. \"We're going to have about $6 to $7 billion a day in corporate buybacks starting in early November,\" Roberts said. \"That's going to provide an uplift.\" Third, he points out that discretionary traders from institutions like hedge funds are underweight tech stocks at the moment. Roberts thinks their re-entry can fuel a rebound. \"There's going to be a catch-up run, particularly in AI, as we approach the year-end reporting period,\" he said. For investors looking to follow his advice, funds like the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) offer exposure to mega-cap tech names. We're maintaining the First Trade index, an equal-weighted basket of five stocks that will be adjusted each week. After one rebalancing, we ended up with this group: Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and Tesla. Each week, you'll vote one stock out, and one in. Last week we added Tesla, and this week we'll be sliding in Nvidia. It doesn't have earnings this week, but it's wildly popular with retail traders and has been absolutely scorching for the past few years. Its inclusion will come at the expense of J&J, which will be removed. And with that, our portfolio has gotten even more tech-heavy, and more levered towards the AI theme that's ruled markets. How will it work out? Check back next Monday, Nov. 3, for an update. The First Trade team: Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"Apple just secured a $4 trillion market capitalization for the first time, becoming only the third public company ever to be worth that much, after Nvidia and Microsoft. The tech titan's stock price climbed to fresh highs of around $270 in early trading on Tuesday, boosting its market cap to just over $4 trillion, before retreating. Nvidia's market value is about $4.7 trillion, while Microsoft is worth close to $4.1 trillion. Apple's latest rally has been fueled by optimism around the new iPhone 17, after Counterpoint Research released data showing the smartphone outsold its predecessor in the US and China during its first 10 days of availability. Yet its stock has only climbed around 7% year to date as investors fear it could be left behind in the AI race. Nvidia, a key supplier of the chips that power AI models, has gained 44% this year. Microsoft, an investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, is up 29%. US stocks opened broadly higher on Tuesday after hitting record highs on Monday, fueled by earnings beats and receding fears of a US-China trade war. Apple has ranked among the world's most valuable companies for years, reflecting the immense scale and profitability of its business. Its latest annual report shows it generated net sales of $391 billion and net income of $94 billion last financial year, as it sold over $200 billion worth of iPhones, $96 billion of services, $30 billion of Macs, $27 billion of iPads, and $37 billion of other devices.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"                 Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes        On Friday, Microsoft announced that a new Halo video game would be coming to Sony\u2019s PlayStation, a longtime rival to Microsoft\u2019s Xbox. That prompted video game retailer GameStop to issue a press release joking about the console wars being over. But that\u2019s when things started to get weird, as President Donald Trump\u2019s team jumped in and sparked a back-and-forth of memes and chatter from the federal government that helps illustrate how much the online culture of the White House has changed. It began with a jokey press release issued by GameStop, formatted to resemble an official government proclamation. A Statement from GameStop pic.twitter.com\/GraJAT69aI \u2014 GameStop (@gamestop) October 25, 2025  From there, the X account Rapid Response 47 quote-tweeted the press release with \u201cNUMBER 9: President Trump presides over the end of the 20-year Console Wars,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s false claims that he\u2019s settled over half a dozen wars. Rapid Response 47 is an official White House account that serves as the online attack dog of the administration, disseminating propaganda to counter messaging that the Trump regime dislikes. Though, in fairness, that\u2019s pretty much every government social media account these days. NUMBER 9: President Trump presides over the end of the 20-year Console Wars \u00f0\u009f\u0095\u008a\u00ef\u00b8\u008f https:\/\/t.co\/TpeLhZt89Y \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) October 26, 2025  GameStop followed up with its own quote-tweet, including an image of Trump shaking hands with Master Chief, the main character of the game. https:\/\/t.co\/jI0ZrstLgz pic.twitter.com\/VS32cV0RG7 \u2014 GameStop (@gamestop) October 27, 2025  The main X account for the White House also got in on the jokes, sharing an AI-generated image of Trump as Master Chief without his helmet, along with the caption \u201cPower to the Players.\u201d Power to the Players https:\/\/t.co\/GqNu0qdgmw pic.twitter.com\/4Hw6G7i7aW \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 27, 2025  GameStop quote-tweeted the White House, this time with not just an image of Trump as Master Chief, but with Vice President JD Vance as the character Cortana, an intelligent AI from the game series. It\u2019s not just a straightforward image of Vance, though. It\u2019s one of those bloated Vance memes where he\u2019s made to have long curly hair and a beard. https:\/\/t.co\/8DRFpgbFv5 pic.twitter.com\/wWvOYrwSUR \u2014 GameStop (@gamestop) October 27, 2025  The CEO of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, is a big fan of the president. After the 2024 presidential election, he tweeted \u201cTrump has now won 3 elections in a row,\u201d in a reference to the false claim that Trump won the 2020 election against Joe Biden. By Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had created its own meme image, which took things even further. The agency tweeted a manipulated image from Halo along with the caption \u201cFinishing this fight.\u201d But the text on the image was even more extreme. It read, \u201cDestroy the Flood,\u201d a reference to the primary alien life forms fought by the good guys in Halo.\u00c2\u00a0 Finishing this fight. pic.twitter.com\/6Ezq9NUqMq \u2014 Homeland Security (@DHSgov) October 27, 2025  The Flood is a parasitic alien species that can infect other hosts. And it\u2019s not hard to see what DHS is implying by the call to destroy the flood. DHS even includes a call to join ICE, one of the agencies that\u2019s deployed masked goons to U.S. streets in an effort to purge immigrants, especially non-white people. 404 Media reporter Matthew Gault talked about the bizarre posts on Jordan Uhl\u2019s podcast The Insurgents, noting that comparing an out-group to insects or to monsters is what fascists do. \u201cThis is about as fascist as you get, right?\u201d said Gault. \u201cIt\u2019s directly comparing people coming into the country looking for a better life with monsters that are here to assimilate and destroy you. This is straight out of the fascism textbook.\u201d You can always count on DHS to take things even more extreme online. There\u2019s a significant mystery around who actually runs the DHS account, but they\u2019re clearly tuned in with the far-right and extremist meme culture. Just last week, DHS posted a dog whistle for Nazis with a video of the anti-ICE protests in Portland, Oregon, that included MGMT\u2019s 2018 song \u201cLittle Dark Age.\u201d The song was slowed down in a way that became extremely popular with white supremacists in the early 2020s. Border Patrol also posted a video in recent months that only gained widespread attention two weeks ago, featuring antisemitic slurs. DHS, which oversees Border Patrol, pushed back hard when Gizmodo asked about the incidents, an attitude that\u2019s another hallmark of right-wing grievance culture online. DHS didn\u2019t respond to emailed questions on Tuesday about its Halo content. The Halo references are all part of a trend now where the Trump regime uses video games and animation-adjacent videos to distort the meaning of the original pop culture references. Last month, DHS posted a video on its social media channels that used Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon characters and music to \u201ccatch \u2019em all.\u201d The thing they were catching, of course, was human beings. GameStop stock surged in premarket trading on Monday but has since fallen back to the downward trajectory that it\u2019s been on in recent weeks. The stock is down 1% today and down 11% over the past month, according to The Street. GameStop\u2019s stock is down 24% over the past year.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"        Greg Rosalsky       Earlier this year, the Trump administration shut down USAID and slashed spending on international aid and development. Development advocates worried \u2014 and continue to worry \u2014 that this will hurt the economies of developing nations and have deadly consequences for some of the poorest people on Earth. That story generated tons of headlines earlier this year. But Dean Yang, an economist at the University of Michigan, argues \"the anti-immigration actions of the Trump administration are likely to have an even bigger negative effect on the economic development of the world's poor countries\" \u2014 and that story has gotten much less attention. It's not just that migration is one of the best known mechanisms to lift people out of poverty. Studies suggest those who move from poor countries to work in rich nations like the United States often see a four-to-five fold increase in the amount they're able to earn, and sometimes way more. What leads Yang to argue this is that immigrants in the United States send a jaw-dropping amount of money back home to their families. These remittances, as they're known, have dwarfed the size of official foreign aid that the U.S. spends on things like economic development, health, and humanitarian assistance. In fact, the United States has far and away been the number one source of remittances in the world. According to the International Organization for Migration, which works with the United Nations, immigrants in the United States sent almost $80 billion to their origin countries in 2022 (the last available year of data). In an upcoming episode of Planet Money, which will be released Oct. 29, we dive into the disruption of these large financial flows in an era of immigration restriction. While some countries, including Mexico, have already seen a large drop in remittances from the United States in recent months, others are seeing a rather surprising pattern: a record-breaking surge. Our episode focuses on the causes and consequences of this surge and dives into the economics of remittances. This recent surge of remittances, however, is likely only going to be a temporary blip. Remittances will likely drop in the near future, with the large decline of immigration to the U.S., and the large numbers of immigrants already here getting deported. And that could have significant macroeconomic effects on a whole host of nations, especially in Central America. For countries like Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala, remittances account for a staggering share of their economies, ranging from around 20% to 27% of each country's GDP. These nations are already politically and economically fragile, which is a big reason why so many of their citizens immigrated to the United States in the first place. It's one reason why Yang believes the immigration crackdown could have severe consequences in the developing world. Stay tuned for our new episode of Planet Money that dives more into this story.

The move: PayPal stock jumped 10% on Tuesday. The digital payments company has struggled in 2025, with the stock down 10% year-to-date. Why: PayPal announced a partnership with OpenAI on Tuesday to incorporate its payments wallet into ChatGPT. Users recently gained the ability to shop on platforms like Shopify and through retailers like Walmart while using ChatGPT, but now they will be able to make instant purchases in the popular chatbot via their linked PayPal accounts. It marks the first wallet integration into ChatGPT. \"By partnering with OpenAI and adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol, PayPal will power payments and commerce experiences that help people go from chat to checkout in just a few taps for our joint customer bases,\" Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said in a statement on Tuesday. What it means: The move is a boon for PayPal, which has seen its stock sputter through 2025. The payments giant has struggled to integrate itself into the fast-growing AI ecosystem as the tech sector undergoes rapid changes. Partnering with top dog OpenAI will give it a leg up as the retail ecosystem shifts and becomes more integrated with AI systems. For OpenAI, it's yet another step toward deepening its roots in consumer-facing areas like e-commerce. ChatGPT users will soon be able t use the platform to shop with vendors on Shopify and Etsy, and buy from Walmart via the chatbot.      Jump to","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"                 Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes        If you were a lazy college student during Covid, imagine a time traveler from five years in the future telling you that something kind of like Chegg is coming soon\u00e2\u0080\u0094but this thing lets you be even lazier. In fact, in five years, Chegg will restructure its company completely because it\u2019s suffering so badly from competition with this new thing, this person says. You would probably ask Chegg to tell you why time travel is impossible, get an answer in fifteen minutes, and brush off this person as a lunatic. But as we all know, that thing is ChatGPT, along with other AI products like Google\u2019s AI overviews. A Chegg representative admitted as much on Monday, saying the \u201cnew realities of AI and reduced traffic from Google to content publishers have led to a significant decline in Chegg\u2019s traffic and revenue,\u201d according to Reuters. Between March of 2020 and January of 2021, the stock price of Chegg went up by 345%, according to a Forbes article. That piece notes that Chegg had two secret ingredients at the time: a searchable collection of 46 million textbooks that students could use to access instant answers during at-home tests and other assignments, and a workforce in India of \u201c70,000 experts with advanced math, science, technology and engineering degrees,\u201d on call to answer queries from students within minutes. At the time, Chegg cost $14.95 per month. But as of November of last year, the stock price had gone down 99% from its peak, a plunge that caused $14.5 billion to disappear. The cause was clearly ChatGPT\u00e2\u0080\u0094a fact so obvious that Chegg rolled out its own chatbot, but to no avail. In February of this year, Chegg filed a lawsuit against Google over AI Overviews, claiming that it provided Google with \u00e2\u0080\u009cproprietary content in order to be included in Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s search function,\u00e2\u0080\u009d only to have that content mined by Google\u2019s AI function, all \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout having to spend a dime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now, Chegg is eliminating 388 roles\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is 45% of the company\u2019s workforce according to the Reuters article, possibly because Chegg\u2019s vast legion of India-based experts ostensibly do not count as permanent employees who are subject to layoffs. The new CEO, Dan Rosensweig, is actually the company\u2019s old CEO from its more successful era. Chegg also apparently conducted a review about the possibility of going private or putting itself up for sale, but it\u2019s remaining public and bringing back its old CEO instead. It sounds like it\u2019s decided to live in the past and hope for a miracle.

In a major turnaround from years of criticizing government-subsidized Gulf carriers, Delta Air Lines is further deepening its ties with a new, state-run airline. On Monday, Delta announced a new nonstop route between Atlanta and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, set to begin in October 2026. The 7,000-mile flight \u2014 the first-ever by a US airline \u2014 will be operated with Delta's premium-heavy Airbus A350-900 featuring business class, premium economy, and coach. The news comes a year after Delta announced its strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia's second flag carrier, Riyadh Air, as part of the Gulf nation's \"Vision 2030\" project. The state-owned airline aims to boost business and tourism in the region and is backed by a nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund. Delta's new service coincides with Riyadh Air's soft debut on Sunday, flying its sole Boeing 787 from Riyadh to London with employees and \"select guests\" onboard. Based in the Saudi capital, the airline plans to serve more than 100 destinations by 2030. For Delta, the Riyadh Air partnership marks a sharp break from its years of criticizing Gulf carriers for what it saw as unfair, state-backed competition. Now, the airline sees market opportunities that it doesn't want to miss. However, Delta and Riyadh Air face a perception hurdle with American travelers. In an interview with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell on Monday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said \"Americans aren't quite sure\" about visiting Saudi Arabia due to long-standing political and cultural differences. Saudi Arabia remains among the world's lowest-ranked countries for gender equality in 2025. Although recent reforms have eased restrictions on travel and other rights, women under 21 still require a male guardian's approval for their choices about healthcare and education. Saudi rules also forbid the drinking of alcohol and require wearing loose-fitting clothes that cover the upper arms and below the knee. Bastian said that while the service will start \"slow,\" he expects Saudi Arabia to \"gain popularity\" and described the culture as \"embracing.\" Delta also already codeshares with Saudi Arabia's other flag carrier, Saudia, meaning they can each sell tickets on each other's flights and both airlines use their own flight number. Delta and Saudia are also part of the SkyTeam Alliance \u2014 further solidifying Delta's ties to the Middle Eastern nation. During the mid-2010s, Delta, American, and United (the so-called US Big 3) went to war with the three big state-owned Middle East airlines, Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways (the ME3). The Big 3, led by Delta, argued that roughly $50 billion in government subsidies let the Gulf carriers undercut prices, which squeezed US carriers out of key international markets and threatened US airline jobs. The trio said this violated the \"Open Skies\" agreement that governs flights between the US and the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. \"They're trade violators and they're cheaters,\" Bastian told the president of the Cranky Flyer website in 2017, referring to the ME3. \"And we need to hold them accountable.\" Delta ended its route between Atlanta and Dubai in 2016, citing \"overcapacity\" from Gulf carriers. United dropped its Washington Dulles to Dubai service that same year, and in 2017, United employees staged a company-sanctioned protest at Newark against Emirates' new route from Greece. Meanwhile, American temporarily suspended its codeshare with Qatar in 2018 after public disputes between the executives of both airlines. It also ended its agreement with Etihad, which is based in the UAE. But post-pandemic growth and changing market dynamics have prompted all three US carriers to reconsider. Partnerships with Gulf airlines provide better access to Asia and India, particularly amid ongoing Russian airspace restrictions. Delta was the last to fold. United launched flights between Newark, New Jersey, and Dubai in 2022 via a partnership with Emirates, and American restarted codesharing with Qatar in 2020. It also allows passengers who fly on Etihad-operated flights to earn points on American. Delta did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about the shift.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"This video can not be played Australian rugby league boss on potential investment in Super League Super League is heading for a \"train crash\" if it does not find ways to grow its revenue, the head of Australia's NRL has warned. Peter V'landys, chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission, told BBC Sport that the English elite game must look at restructuring its governance. He also claimed that Super League has missed a major marketing opportunity by not having London Broncos in next season's competition, and questioned how it will support an expanded 14-team structure in the long term. V'landys held talks with a number of Super League clubs and senior officials from governing body the RFL in London on Tuesday.  While he said the meeting was because Warrington owner Simon Moran and his Wigan counterpart Mike Danson had asked him to \"assist\" the English game, he also confirmed that the NRL taking a stake in Super League was \"an option\".  But in an exclusive interview, one of the most powerful figures in Australian sport said any investment depended on \"independent decision making\", while he also dismissed the idea of the NRL setting up its own competition in Europe. V'landys believes English rugby league is a strong product, but has major concerns about its business plan, with the current UK television broadcast deal due to come to an end at the conclusion of the 2026 season. \"All we've done is analyse the financial viability and I can see a train crash if they don't get the broadcast revenue they need to sustain a 14-team competition,\" he said. \"And it all comes back to the finances, and that's because eventually people will stop wanting to put money in their pockets and sustain losses, and that's what they're going to be doing in the short term, unless they can increase their revenue from broadcast.\" The RFL and RL Commercial - the body that manages its commercial rights - confirmed they attended Tuesday's meeting with V'landys and NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo, along with the owners of Warrington, Wigan and Hull FC. The talks came ahead of this weekend's second Ashes Test between England and Australia. Nigel Wood, RL Commercial's chair and an RFL senior executive director, told BBC Sport: \"It was an excellent meeting, positive and progressive in every way, with much to build on. We look forward to discussions continuing.\" Reece Walsh inspired Brisbane Broncos to victory in the NRL Grand Final earlier this month, emerging as a superstar of the sport V'landys claims the NRL is \"at the peak of its powers\" with record revenues and TV audiences in Australia, and this year it conducted the second of five annual season-opening trips to Las Vegas. Designed to grow the game's international fanbase, it featured a fixture between Warrington and Wigan.  It was while in the US in March that the NRL reportedly began talks to purchase a 33% stake in Super League, with clubs guaranteed more central distribution of media and sponsorship income, but on the basis that it would take management control.  V'landys said that there is no concrete offer in place for the NRL to buy into Super League and would not be drawn on what stake he wants, but insisted that any deal would depend on the creation of an independent governing body. Asked about the NRL taking a Super League stake, he said: \"We could. That's an option, if that's what they want us to do. \"There has to be structural corporate governance change for that to happen. You need an independent body to operate the competition and that's one of the reasons Australia has been so successful in rugby league. It's totally independent.  \"You've got to have independent decision making, because [it] always acts in the best interests of the game as a whole, and not for individual interest groups. \"We're just here out of loyalty to Mike Danson and Simon Moran to listen, and if there is a way we can help, we will help. But we're not here to force ourselves on anyone or be part of anything. We're here to listen and hopefully be able to assist.\" Super League's Grand Final was watched by a crowd of almost 69,000, the highest attendance since 2017, with TV viewing figures up 22% on last year.  V'landys also saw Australia beat England 26-6 at Wembley on Saturday, in front of 60,812 fans, a record crowd for a Rugby League Ashes Test in the UK. He argues that such numbers are proof of the interest in the sport in England - but feels the game's authorities have not helped themselves, suggesting a city the size of London should have a team in Super League. London Broncos, who are subject to Australian investment with Kangaroos legend Darren Lockyer among their backers, missed out on a place in the recently expanded Super League for next season. Instead, Bradford Bulls were promoted earlier this month at the expense of Salford Red Devils under the competition's grading system, and Toulouse and York selected to join them by an independent panel. Prior the announcement, the Broncos had already appointed former South Sydney Rabbitohs boss Jason Demetriou on a three-year deal to become their head coach and signed former Australia international Reagan Campbell-Gillard and Tonga hooker Siliva Havili for next season. V'landys said: \"London should have been the first one that they picked, because if you're going to market something, you've got to market to a populous city. \"You've got to grow your revenues. Sponsors would be interested in London. And they've lost that opportunity, in this round anyway. So yeah, they've got to be able to market the game better than they are at the moment... they haven't got the structure right at the moment to be able to take the product forward.\" When asked about Super League's expansion to 14 teams, V'landys said: \"Are they going to get extra broadcast revenue? Are they going to get extra eyeballs? Are they going to get extra participation? That hasn't been explained.  \"There's been no plan. They've got to have a road map and a plan moving forward for the next 10 years. Because 10 years comes very quickly and unless you have that plan, you're going in all directions with no purpose. \"There have certainly been some positives. Their attendances have improved, their ratings have improved, but you've also got to have a very strong financial base and at the moment that's not there.\" Rugby League Ashes 25 October, 1 November, 8 November Wembley, Hill Dickinson Stadium, AMT Headingley Watch all three Tests live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app V'landys has indicated that NRL investment in Super League would bring the competitions closer together. He said: \"Ideally in the long term, you'd have the club in Australia having a brother or sister club in England, and they share the resources, they share the players and so on.\" But pressed on whether that meant Super League teams acting as feeder clubs, he added: \"No, no, no. I wouldn't be saying that one's more powerful than the other. We'll be feeding them, and they'll be feeding us. It's a two-way street.  \"So some of our young up-and-coming players could be playing in Super League to develop, and some of the Super League players could be playing in the NRL to develop. So it's not a feeder club as such. It's sharing the resources.\" V'landys is adamant that whatever interest NRL takes in English rugby league, it would not involve setting up a separate European competition. \"No,\" he said. \"For us, it's philosophical. We want England to be strong. If you're going to have a global game, you need England to be as strong as possible. So we don't want to see them wilt. We want to see them succeed.  \"So it would be against our best interest if they do run into a train crash because we want them strong.\" Bradford bounce-back heralds new Super League era Rugby League Top 10: Aussie, Aussie, Aussie Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Duckett falls early for England against New Zealand in second ODI Beever-Jones 'asking questions' - should she start for England?

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"Apple's market capitalization briefly surpassed $4 trillion just after opening today, making it the third public company to reach that figure. Nvidia reached $4 trillion back in July and is creeping closer to $5 trillion, while Microsoft also hit $4 trillion that same month before dropping down to a $3.9 trillion valuation, but it too has passed $4 trillion again this morning. Market capitalization is based on the total value of all outstanding Apple shares. We won't have an updated share count until Apple provides its earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, so it is worth noting that the current market cap is not quite accurate. Apple's next earnings report will be shared on Thursday, October 30. Apple became the world's first $3 trillion company in January 2022, but it has not been able to keep up with Nvidia since then due to global demand for Nvidia's chips. No other publicly traded companies are close to the $4 trillion mark aside from Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft. Google parent company Alphabet has a market valuation of $3.25 trillion, Amazon is at $2.42 trillion, and Meta's market valuation is $1.90 trillion.

The Fed is set to make its October interest rate decision on schedule, even as the government shutdown drags on. In its seventh meeting of the year, the Federal Open Market Committee will likely opt for a quarter-point cut in its announcement on Wednesday. On Monday afternoon, CME FedWatch projected a 98% chance of a rate reduction, which would be the second of the year. The circumstances for this week's meeting are unusual: the government shutdown means that the Bureau of Labor Statistics didn't publish a September jobs report, and the inflation data release was delayed from October 15 to October 24. With Congress stuck at a budget impasse, it's unclear when the government will reopen \u2014 leaving Fed leaders without a full picture of America's economic health. Despite limited data, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce another cut after a summer of slow job growth and unemployment creeping up. Inflation, at 3% as of September, remains above the Fed's 2% goal. The Fed's economic projections released last month also penciled in two more normal-sized rate cuts for the year, which are expected to bring relief to borrowers looking to finance homes, cars, and credit cards. The Fed kept policy \"at a restrictive level\" earlier this year, Powell said. \"And we were able to do that over the course of this year because the labor market was in very solid condition, with strong job creation,\" he said at the September meeting, adding, \"I can no longer say that.\" Without the latest jobs report, Fed leaders will have to rely on other economic indicators to make their rate decision. Inflation data is crucial for one side of the Fed's dual mandate. The consumer price index, one measure of inflation, rose slightly below the 3.1% forecast in September, hitting 3% for the first time since January. Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told Business Insider he expected the Fed to make a rate cut regardless of the new inflation data, but feels that cooler-than-expected rate cemented the decision. \"Even if we got slightly higher inflation, even if inflation could come in exactly at expectations, the Federal Reserve had made it relatively clear that they were more comfortable with the level of inflation that we've had relative to now the deterioration in the labor market,\" Kates said. Pre-shutdown patterns in the job market also make a strong case for a rate reduction. Openings have declined, and unemployment has been creeping up, meaning the market isn't keeping up with the number of Americans looking for work. The central bank might not have the latest data, but Powell said last month that \"the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual,\" and called for a less restrictive policy position. The Fed may also lean on soft economic indicators to make its decision. A key marker of consumer sentiment, for example, dipped in October. It suggests that Americans are feeling the heat of high prices and limited job opportunities, meaning they're less likely to spend money. Another rate cut could help stimulate a seemingly sluggish economy. Not all Fed leaders agree on how much the bank should cut rates. A few committee members dissented from Powell's restrictive policy patterns earlier this year, and one member called for a 1.25% rate reduction by the end of the year last month \u2014 far more than any other voting members. President Donald Trump has also been vocal about his desire for more rate cuts. \"I really believe that Jerome 'Too Late' Powell is an OBSTRUCTIONIST!\" he wrote in an October 1 Truth Social post. A pattern of rate cuts could bring relief to consumers. Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to move up and down alongside the federal funds rate, though this can change if there are major swings in inflation and investor behavior. And, though it takes time for Fed decisions to trickle down to Americans, consecutive months of cuts could spell good news. Kates said Americans with high-yield savings accounts could see their interest earnings decline slightly over time. \"For people who are borrowing \u2014 so anybody who's got a mortgage, is itching for a refinance, or anybody who's got credit card debt or wants to take out a home equity line of credit \u2014 that's something that they should start to plot,\" Kates said.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"                 Reading time: Reading time 2 minutes        Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds 4 Pro wireless earbuds haven\u2019t been announced yet, but evidence of their arrival is starting to pile up. Last week, it was an icon spotted inside a leaked build of One UI 8.5 by Android Central, which sparked speculation that Samsung could be headed toward a potential redesign, and now, there are even more drips about some potential battery life improvements. According to a report from GalaxyClub, the Galaxy Buds 4 (and presumably the Buds 4 Pro) will get a battery bump with a case that comes with a 530mAh battery as opposed to the Galaxy Buds 3, which have a rated case battery capacity of 500mAh. That\u2019s not a massive leak by any means, but there is one more detail that emerged via Android Central that could give a better indication of what direction the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro are headed. Codenames spotted inside One UI 8.5 show references to \u201cHandel\u201d and \u201cBach,\u201d who are both classical composers and likely refer to the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro. That\u2019s notably a departure from the codenames of previous wireless earbuds, which included \u201cBerry\u201d and \u201cJelly.\u201d Does that mean there\u2019s going to be a heavy audio focus that leans towards hi-fi? Maybe. Are we reading too much into an unofficial codename? Also possible. In either case, when the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro do\u00c2\u00a0eventually arrive on the scene (potentially next year, along with the Galaxy S26), they\u2019ll have some tough competition in Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 3. AirPods are always tough competition in the wireless earbud market\u00e2\u0080\u0094for Samsung and everyone else\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it\u2019s going to be even tougher when comparing the two head-to-head. The reason? Apple managed to push the boundaries of what we even thought wireless earbuds could do. Its main method of doing that has been health features that include a way to monitor your heart rate while you listen to music. It\u2019s a small step towards making AirPods part health wearable, but I sincerely doubt that Apple is done adding health features, meaning its abilities as a fitness wearable could expand even further in the next generation. What does that mean for Samsung? Depending on whether Apple\u2019s health tracking appeals to you, it could mean that the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro are behind, and Samsung wouldn\u2019t be alone in its lack of health sensors, either. It\u2019ll be worth watching if Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro 3 push the rest of the wireless earbud market toward health tracking in an effort to maintain feature parity. That\u2019ll likely depend on whether people actually use health tracking features, but also whether makers of wireless earbuds even have the resources and infrastructure to make health tracking work. If there\u2019s one company that\u00c2\u00a0could\u00c2\u00a0make it work, it\u2019s Samsung, but we\u2019ll have to wait until next year to find out, most likely.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"Here in the heart of the Peak District, there is one main issue on people's minds: everyone in the laid-back spa town of Buxton, it seems, has a view on plans for a \u00a3100m redevelopment of the town centre. As part of the redevelopment, the River Wye, currently running narrow and shallow through the centre of town, is to be widened. When the plans were posted on one Facebook group, the first comment underneath read: \"Open up the river, yeah so the dinghies can [head] straight to the hotel!\" Illegal immigration, perhaps, is the second-biggest issue on people's minds - even though there are very few immigrants in this Derbyshire town of 20,000 people, known for its opera house and grand Georgian crescent. It was such concerns that helped Reform UK win control of Derbyshire County Council in May. The rise of Reform UK in the opinion polls, and the fact immigration and asylum is now the top concern for voters across the country according to YouGov, is not seen only in the places with most immigration. It is apparent even in small towns like Buxton, that has very little. In May, Reform UK won in one Buxton county council ward and came a close second to the Conservatives in the other. It is 250 miles from here to Dover, where the small boats arrive, and there are no hotels in Buxton housing asylum seekers. In fact, the latest government figures show that in June, of the nearly 103,000 asylum seekers being accommodated across the UK, none of them lived in High Peak Borough Council, the area that covers Buxton. Yet six months ago, in the county council elections in Buxton, almost a third of those who voted backed Reform UK. \"I do see faces that I haven't seen before,\" says Robert Stordy, standing by the town's market on a Tuesday lunchtime, although he admits he does not know where those new faces are from. The 74-year-old describes himself as disillusioned by recent governments, both Conservative and Labour. He believes most of the young men arriving on boats are here to work, not fleeing oppression. \"They're using our facilities. This country is strapped for cash - the NHS is all over the place, it's suffering greatly. It puts pressure on local doctors, local services.\" What is clear in Buxton is the chasm in opinion on illegal immigration between the town's young and old, a sentiment Ian Howarth, who runs the Queen's Head Hotel, hears regularly. Buxton's population is older than the England average. Describing the town as \"a large village really\", Mr Howarth, whose sister is a Tory MP, spends his days leading the charge over car parking spaces linked to the town redevelopment and lending an ear to vociferous discussions about immigration. \"It's a generational thing,\" he says. \"The younger crowd are very much against it [Reform UK] while the older crowd are very much for them.\" Indeed, an hour with some sixth formers at Buxton Community School brings home his point. The overwhelming sentiment of the 10 teenagers is that immigrants are being scapegoated. \"I think there's a lot of prejudice in this country about people who aren't white,\" says Henry. \"If the people coming over on the boats were rich and white, it would be completely different.\" Another pupil, Elliott, feels that asylum seekers \"are doing it because they've no other choice. Their only hope is to get away from the horrible things happening where they've come from and we're treating them like they're not welcome.\" The teenagers don't yet have a vote though, and in May's local elections, those who turned out gave Reform UK a sweeping victory - the party winning 42 of Derbyshire's County Council's 64 seats. The party also gained control of nine other councils across England. Among the new Reform UK councillors is Melandra Smith, who won one of the two Buxton seats. A fluent Japanese speaker, she was known as a local campaigner before she became involved in party politics. She pushed for Buxton to have a town council and for repairs to its many potholes - as Britain's highest market town, the weather often leaves its mark. She was also heavily involved in a campaign to stop the University of Derby turning its now empty 274-room hall of residence in the town into dispersal accommodation for asylum seekers. The plan, announced in 2023, was opposed by thousands of people in Buxton and dropped by the university in 2024. It was \"a wake-up call for the town\", she says. The mother of two acknowledges her local profile helped her electorally, but says that, increasingly, people are contacting her about illegal immigration. \"The university halls are still not being used for anything and there are other large buildings in Buxton that are not currently in use and [people] worry, 'Will they turn it into one of these dispersal centres?' I get a lot of questions about this. Sometimes it's a little bit irrational, too much of a worry.\"  Those ongoing fears, she feels, are, however, a consequence of government policies \"because there doesn't seem to be any thoughtful plan nationally to deal with the people coming in illegally\". On Spring Gardens, Buxton's main shopping street, people hark back to a bygone age. At first glance, the High Street appears to be holding up well in comparison with many towns. A steady stream of tourists means there are a raft of coffee shops and bakeries and few empty premises. However, \"there's nothing we actually need\", says Yvonne, 50, looking around at the local shopfronts. \"If you need to buy children's clothes and shoes, there's nothing.\" Her disappointment at what is happening locally is exacerbated by the national picture. \"I haven't got faith in anything any more - there is nobody out there that is offering me any hope. They tell you one thing and do something else, so it doesn't matter who you decide [to vote for].\" That sentiment of powerlessness, hopelessness even, permeates many conversations. Older people do not want illegal immigrants in their town, in their country, but feel they cannot stop them. And they feel similarly impotent over what they do want - a bustling High Street, a new medical centre. Plans for a \u00a320m health hub for Buxton, for instance, failed to get government funding in 2023, leaving the proposed site derelict and unsightly. There have been some immigrants who have come to Buxton. In 2022, about 150 Ukrainians moved to the town and people \"opened their houses, their hearts to us\", says Natalia. About 100 or so are still here, she says, sitting alongside two friends - Paulina and Yulia - on a bench in the centre of town. Most have moved into their own accommodation and found jobs, a lot in hospitality and cleaning. \"We don't feel like immigrants because we lived with British families and we are very closely connected with these families,\" says Natalia. \"I feel a part of society because I did not get any negative emotion from British people.\" Also on Spring Gardens, Liam McGuinness says he does not have a problem with the Ukrainians or indeed \"against families coming in that need help. It's more single men\". He brings up the University of Derby's abandoned proposals. \"I wasn't happy at the thought of maybe having 300 single blokes down here. They might be able to melt away in a big city, but if you've got them in the size of Buxton, it's a different matter.\" The 68-year-old, originally from County Armagh, says he would support the idea of housing asylum seekers in army camps - as well as allowing them to work, perhaps helping farmers or others in need of labour, to offset the cost of their accommodation. \"I would think the majority would want to work but the law does not allow them to work. Then they're going to sit around the towns and parks, which is obviously causing people problems.\" Supporters of legal migration often point to the benefits that immigrants bring, particularly to the NHS. But in Buxton, that is not so obvious, particularly as there is no major local hospital. The town, encircled by the Peak District, is about an hour from the nearest cities - Derby, Manchester, Sheffield and Stoke - and statistics show that Derbyshire social care and NHS workforce is significantly less diverse than the national average. Without any distinct benefits locally, perception of the national picture dominates residents' opinions. \"We've got enough people [living] on the streets that we need to look after ourselves,\" says Gail Hartington, 69, sitting by some late-blooming plants close to Miltons Tap bar. \"They're coming over and getting money from the government; we need to concentrate on [our] own first.\" In 2024, the Sunday Times named Buxton as one of the best places to live in the UK, describing it as a \"cultural powerhouse\", highlighting both the opera house and annual international festival. The town's new development proposals also describe it as a \"sleeping giant\". But those garlands do not impress the town's youngsters. A couple of the teenagers at the school actually want to leave Britain, never mind Buxton, so furious are they with the state of the country. One young man says he regularly argues with his grandmother and father over the small boat arrivals as \"both say as soon as they set foot in Dover, they should just be put on a boat and sent straight back\". The sense that Buxton's best days - Britain's best days, even - lay behind it has permeated the minds of these teenagers, too. Few feel optimistic, with worries about student debts, jobs and affordable housing being mentioned as well as the general state of the nation. One young woman does stand out, however. Asked what made her feel hopeful, Jodie says it is mainly because \"things can't really get much worse, to be honest\". Bridget Phillipson responds to a Reform council's plea over the distances pupils walk to school. Several members of the Reform-run council were expelled over a leaked video of an online meeting. The biggest shake up to renting rules in England for 30 years will affect millions of tenants. Solar Energy UK says idea solar farms are \"eco deserts\" is a \"tangent from reality\" It comes after a damaging video leak of the Kent County Council leader shouting and swearing.

A massive estate in Water Mill, New York, has hit the market for $125 million, making it the most expensive home for sale in the entire state. Like something out of \"The Great Gatsby,\" the property includes an expansive horse-training complex with boarding stables and polo fields, plus a 20,000-square-foot main house by Hamptons designer-builder Jeffrey Coll\u00e9. Surrounded by acres of protected farmland and minutes from the beach, the home has ultra-high-end amenities, including a pool, cabana, and sunken tennis court, solidifying its position among the Hamptons' most extravagant properties. Take a look inside the most expensive home for sale in New York. Listed by Bespoke Real Estate, the compound in Water Mill is more expensive than sky-high penthouses in New York City and other luxurious Hamptons homes currently on the market. Despite its high price tag, it's a fraction of the most expensive home ever sold in the US: a penthouse apartment in Manhattan purchased by Ken Griffin in 2019 for $238 million. The estate, which is also the largest equestrian compound in the Hamptons, encompasses three separate parcels of land totaling over 80 acres and is situated within a protected farmland area and a nature reserve. Property records cited by The Wall Street Journal showed that developer Ben Ashkenazy and his wife spent a total of $26.7 million acquiring the estate across two purchases in 2015 and 2016. Tucked between Southampton and Bridgehampton, Water Mill is known for its rolling farmlands, ocean access, and discreet luxury estates. The estate is situated minutes from beaches, marinas, and Hamptons villages, offering access to a range of high-end restaurants, farm stands, and luxury shopping. The estate includes a private full-service horse farm with boarding stables, paddocks, and professional-grade training facilities \u2014 rare amenities even for the Hamptons' most exclusive addresses. Coll\u00e9, known as one of the Hamptons' premier custom homebuilders, oversaw the construction of the mansion. His client list includes Wall Street executives and celebrities, including Alec Baldwin and Billy Joel. The primary residence has eight bedrooms, nine full bathrooms, and four half-baths, with interiors that combine modern elegance with traditional Hamptons charm. Multiple living and dining spaces open onto expansive patios and terraces, ideal for hosting gatherings or summer parties with breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. The luxury details throughout the home don't stop there \u2014 each bathtub in the home was hand-carved from Verona stone, with leftover material used in the home's floors and countertops, according to the listing. An expansive outdoor patio and terrace offer sweeping views of the 184 acres of surrounding farmlands and reserve, while columns add a touch of glamour to the property's outdoor design. An adjacent pool cabana with bar seating gives residents the space to entertain and unwind by the pool. The tennis court, situated on a lower elevation than the surrounding grounds, is designed for privacy and shielded from the wind, resulting in improved gameplay and viewing conditions. Pinnacle Farm is a full-service equestrian training facility and one of the largest of its kind in the Hamptons, with indoor and outdoor riding rings, jumping arenas, a storage barn, and a boarding facility for horses with 20 stalls, per the listing. The listing describes the property as \"a true sanctuary for equestrian enthusiasts.\" Though Water Mill may not be as well known as Montauk or East Hampton, the town is earning a reputation as a quieter, more private place for true Hamptons living. Zillow reported that the average price of a home in Water Mill, New York, is $4.7 million as of September 2025, representing a 2.9% increase over the past year.      Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByDan Runkevicius, Senior Contributor. There\u2019s a lot of talk about AI as a bubble. Since ChatGPT\u2019s launch, AI stocks have driven 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capex growth, according to Morgan Stanley data. But at this point, AI is no longer just a market story. The multi-trillion-dollar investments around it (emphasis on investment) have also become an anchor of economic growth. In fact, AI spending (proxied through investment in software and computers) accounts for 6% of economic output but contributes more to GDP growth than consumer spending, the backbone of the U.S. economy. The catch is that this boom is pure capex with a long and unclear ROI, driven by FOMO in an increasingly monopolistic, winner-takes-it-all tech sector. Even Big Tech execs admit as much. \u201cWhen you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting,\u201d Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during Alphabet\u2019s earnings call last August. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a possibility, based on past large infrastructure buildouts and how they led to bubbles, that something like that could happen here,\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the Access podcast this month. The risk isn\u2019t just in overspending but also in the concentration of that spending.By Morgan Stanley\u2019s estimates, the top 10 AI spenders now account for roughly 33% of total spending among the 2,000 largest U.S. publicly listed companies. That\u2019s well ahead of the 25% share from the biggest telecom infrastructure builders during the dot-com bust. \u201cWhile this narrative may have longer to run, analogies to the 1999\u20132000 \u2018Cisco moment,\u2019 when a few companies slowed investment on fears of overheating, are increasing,\u201d said Morgan Stanley CIO Lisa Shalett. But not all spending is built on unrealistic predictions. Gil Luria, head of technology research, says Big Tech\u2019s investment is still tied to real demand from real customers \u2014 not just hype. \u201cMicrosoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud have real demand from real customers and are deploying compute against that in a thoughtful way. Marginal players like OpenAI, Oracle and CoreWeave (and many others) are being propped up by NVIDIA generating demand that is not yet real,\u201d he told me. But for every megacap with real, cash-backed demand at the top, there are dozens of companies just trying to front-run a future that might never come. If or when things break, analysts say one of the earliest canaries in the coal mine will be the jobs market. \u201cInvestors should pay more attention to the labour market. The dot-com bubble only burst once U.S. jobs started to be cut,\u201d macro strategist Mike Bell told me. The bottom line is that both markets and economic growth are hanging by a thin thread of capex \u201cstimulus\u201d from a handful of companies. And if AI is a bubble, the economy could very well pop with it.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"   Manage your account  AI Audio Computing Gaming Home entertainment Phones Puzzle hints Science Streaming Tech news VPN Deals More ... Chinese automakers just unveiled a new solid-state battery that could revolutionize the electric vehicles industry. The technology boasts double the energy density of battery models currently available on the market, and could power an EV for an astonishing 800 miles without needing to be recharged. The innovation is just the latest piece of evidence pointing to China\u2019s near-total dominance \u2013 in terms of both technology and manufacturing \u2013 of the global EV sector. Solid-state batteries have been receiving increasing attention in recent years for their potential to improve EV range, increase safety, and reshape global supply chains for batteries and the materials that go into them. Lithium batteries, which currently dominate the market, are currently powered by lithium ions flowing through a liquid electrolyte. Solid-state batteries, by contrast, use a solid electrolyte which eliminates the need for a bulky separator component separating positive and negative electrodes. \u201cPlain and simple, solid electrolytes provide a safer and more stable environment for lithium ions to move through, enabling faster charging,\u201d reports Popular Mechanics. The result is a lighter, faster-charging model that does not include the flammable liquid that makes lithium-ion batteries a fire hazard. Reports on the new solid-state battery model introduced by Chery Automobile show the prototype \u201crunning flawlessly through a nail penetration test, also shaking off damage from a power drill without catching fire or producing any mystery smoke,\u201d the Popular Mechanics report goes on to say. The competition to corner the market on solid-state EV batteries is fierce. Toyota currently leads the charge on patents, with\u00a0 1,700 filed for solid-state battery technologies. But smaller start-ups like China\u2019s Chery have certain advantages, as they are able to iterate, pivot, and test prototypes faster than automaking behemoths like Toyota. Indeed, the speed and disruptiveness of innovation coming out of China is astounding. For years, China was thought of as a technological copy-cat, but all that is changing as the nation becomes the world\u2019s premiere clean energy innovator. \u201cOver two decades China has leapt ahead of other countries, churning out innovative designs for the energy mix of the future: solar and wind power, batteries and electric cars,\u201d reports the New York Times. In the year 2000, a mere 18 competitive clean energy patents were filed by Chinese applicants. By 2022, that number exceeded 5,000. According to figures from the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), Chinese institutions now account for 65.4 percent of the world\u2019s high-impact research publications in electric batteries. In comparison, United States institutions currently contribute 11.9 percent. Not only is China taking the lead on EV innovations, they also have a dominating lead on EV manufacturing, exports, and related supply chains. Today, China produces nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s EVs and over three-quarters of EV batteries. From 2020 to 2023 alone, China\u2019s global EV exports increased by a whopping 851 percent. \u201cThe Chinese government\u2014at both the federal and provincial levels\u2014has made EV competitiveness a national priority,\u201d reports ITIF. \u201cBut while China\u2019s EV industry has certainly benefitted from intense government support, Chinese EV and EV battery enterprises have become increasingly innovative in their own right across a number of dimensions of product innovation, process innovation, business model innovation, and even customer experience innovation.\u201d Chery\u2019s astounding solid-state battery achievement is indicative of this trend, but it is only a stepping-stone toward ever higher-performing EV batteries and greater Chinese dominance. Chinese companies are already reportedly working on making EV batteries with a 2,000 kilometer (km) (1,300 mile) range. For the most part, global automakers can\u2019t afford to lose time and money trying to achieve the same sorts of gains that China is already achieving. A Reuters report on how Chinese EV tech is reshaping global auto design notes, \u201cglobal automakers need Chinese technology to leapfrog development hurdles and launch new EVs quickly.\u201d By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com India Eyes Long-Term U.S. LPG Supply Putin: Oil Prices Could Soar Past $100 Without Russian Crude Europe\u2019s Steel Market Faces Turmoil as EU Moves to Double Tariffs Oilprice Intelligence brings you the signals before they become front-page news.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Tesla stock has surged by almost 2x from lows seen in March, driven by optimism surrounding the company\u2019s bets on artificial intelligence and fully autonomous driving and CEO Elon Musk\u2019s return to the company, following his brief stint in Washington.  However, we think that it might be an appropriate time to divest from TSLA stock. Overall, we hold a negative outlook on the stock, and a target price of $319 seems plausible. We perceive that there is a nearly equal balance of positives and negatives in TSLA stock, considering its general Moderate operating performance and financial state. However, given its Very High valuation, we regard the stock as Unattractive. Recent trends point to growing challenges. The EV market has cooled, and Chinese automakers are producing increasingly compelling models, making Tesla\u2019s vehicles less desirable\u2014especially in international markets. The much-hyped Cybertruck appears to be a dud, and Google\u2019s Waymo is proving that Tesla isn\u2019t the only serious player in self-driving technology, with its robotaxi service already having a significant head start. Is owning TSLA stock risky? Certainly, it is. High Quality Portfolio alleviates that risk.   Let\u2019s discuss the details of each of the evaluated factors but first, for quick background: With $1.5 Tril in market capitalization, Tesla offers electric vehicles and regulatory credits in the automotive sector, and designs, manufactures, markets, sells, and leases energy generation and storage solutions.

I'm not a financial advisor, but I am a lawyer who's spent enough time around markets to know how unpredictable they can be. I recently had some extra cash, and I wanted to invest it in something unique. I didn't want to put the money into the volatile stock market, bonds, crypto, or even real estate. When I ran out of options, I turned to an unlikely guide for help and found an even more unlikely answer. AI has been working well for me lately \u2014 helping me plan trips, organize work, and even write better, so I wanted to see what it could do with money. The prompt in ChatGPT was simple: \"Tell me something creative to invest in, something most people wouldn't consider.\" It started its answer with a disclaimer: \"This is by no means financial advice.\" After that, the AI thought for a moment and then confidently told me to buy trading cards, specifically Pok\u00e9mon cards. At first, I laughed. It sounded like the setup to a bad meme: AI gives you advice a 10-year-old could have written. But the longer I talked to the AI bot, the more serious the plan sounded. ChatGPT listed reasons such as scarcity, cultural value, nostalgic demand, and even intellectual property durability. It cited data that shows the cards can rival the S&P 500. In short, the AI pitched me a hedge fund made of cardboard and childhood. The Pok\u00e9mon trading-card world turned out to be far more sophisticated than I expected. There are first-edition base sets from the late 1990s, Japanese exclusives, holographic \"shadowless\" variants, and reprints that only collectors can tell apart. The market runs on rarity and condition; the slightest scratch or off-center print can cut a card's value in half. Professional grading companies such as PSA, Beckett, and CGC inspect every detail and assign ratings from 1 to 10. A perfect \"Gem Mint 10\" can sell for thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of dollars. Even new releases are graded, bought, and resold within days \u2014 a kind of day trading for nostalgia. Unopened booster packs and sealed starter decks have also become their own asset class. Collectors buy them purely for potential, hoping a rare card hides inside. Prices rise as sealed boxes become harder to find. Online tools now track card prices and sealed-pack indexes that look like stock charts, plotting Charizard's rise like Apple stock. It felt less like childhood collecting and more like a miniature Wall Street, powered by nostalgia instead of earnings reports. I needed to start somewhere that wouldn't be too expensive. If I were going to follow ChatGPT's investment advice, it made sense to begin at the lowest possible risk level, the kind of test that wouldn't make me regret trusting a chatbot with money. The first thing I did was call my mom in Mexico. I was sure that somewhere under my old bed there was a shoebox full of Pok\u00e9mon cards, the kind every millennial secretly hopes survived. She found it, still taped shut, and sent me photos. Most of the cards were in rough shape, but one stood out: an Eon Ticket, a promotional card from the Ruby & Sapphire era that collectors trade online for some money. I've since listed it on eBay for $300. Then I started looking for new cards myself. I thought it would be easy, like it was 20 years ago when every store sold them. It wasn't. After checking several shops around London, I finally found two starter decks, both from recent editions and among the most common types. I decided the best way to test ChatGPT's idea wasn't to open them but to leave them sealed and see if they gained value over time. Somewhere in that process, I realized the AI hadn't actually given me a bad answer. It had simply mirrored us: our obsession with nostalgia, with collecting, with owning little pieces of our past. AI may not understand markets the way we do, but it understands patterns \u2014 how emotion drives value, how stories become currency, and how scarcity turns sentiment into profit. It probably didn't tell me to buy Pok\u00e9mon cards because they're the next bitcoin. It told me because they represent the same thing all markets are built on: belief. I'm not saying you should invest in Pok\u00e9mon cards (though if you find an EON Ticket lying around, maybe check eBay). But sometimes the smartest algorithm in the room still leads you back to something surprisingly human.        Jump to","label":0}

Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company \"like the world's largest startup.\" Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs \"more high-value people.\" Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a \"Great Freeze,\" BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties \u2014 tariffs, AI, and the broader economy \u2014 meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling. Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns will now lead the company's metaverse efforts, per an internal memo sent by Meta's CTO, which was seen by BI. In a different memo \u2014 also seen by BI \u2014 Vishal Shah, who has helped lead its metaverse bets over the last four years, announced that he's moving to Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2. Tesla shareholders get an ultimatum. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm sent out a warning to shareholders regarding Elon Musk's coming $1 trillion pay package: Either approve the package or risk losing Musk as Tesla's CEO. The package has seen pushback from proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis. One thing he doesn't have to worry about: where he stands with the president these days. 3. Fake it till you make it. Tech hopefuls are putting San Francisco in their social media bios even if they don't live there. They do it to attract investors, for the clout, and to signal their commitment to the industry. 1. Everybody scream! (At the price of those Twix bars.) Prices of candy and gum have skyrocketed, increasing at a rate much faster than inflation. Tariffs are a contributor, whether on cane sugar, cocoa, or elsewhere. But hey, at least your dentist is probably happy. 2. Why Taylor Sheridan's Paramount departure matters. The guy behind \"Yellowstone\" is heading to Comcast's NBCUniversal. It's a big loss for Paramount owner David Ellison, who previously signaled that keeping Sheridan is a priority, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is set to lay off over 1,000 employees on Wednesday, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to BI. 3. Lessons about happiness after five years of mood-tracking. BI's Julia Pugachevsky tracked her moods every day for almost five years. She learned a lot about happiness, including one habit that greatly improved her mood than anything else.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"  Home \u00bb Travel After more than five decades of customer loyalty built on the promise that \u201cbags fly free,\u201d Southwest Airlines pulled the plug on one of its most beloved policies in May 2025. The decision to start charging $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second has generated heated debate among travelers, industry analysts, and investors. But six months into the new era, was this dramatic shift the right call for America\u2019s largest domestic carrier? From a purely financial perspective, Southwest\u2019s gamble appears to be paying off handsomely. The airline is on track to generate over $350 million in baggage fee revenue in 2025, with projections suggesting the policy could deliver up to $1 billion annually if sustained year-round. For an airline that collected just $73 million in baggage fees in 2023, this represents a massive revenue windfall. CEO Bob Jordan has been quick to tout the early success, noting that baggage fees are \u201cexceeding expectations\u201d and tracking toward the higher end of per-passenger costs compared to competitors. The move immediately aligned Southwest with industry standards, Delta, United, and American all charge between $35-50 for checked bags, closing a significant revenue gap that had persisted for decades. Wall Street certainly approved. Southwest\u2019s stock jumped nearly 9% following the announcement, while competitor stocks fell as investors recognized the threat to their own market share. The policy change is expected to contribute between $600-800 million to Southwest\u2019s bottom line in 2025 alone. The baggage fee introduction represents just one piece of a broader transformation at Southwest, driven largely by pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which secured five board seats in 2024. The airline has simultaneously introduced assigned seating (ending its iconic open-seating policy), launched basic economy fares, added premium seating options, and begun selling tickets through third-party sites like Expedia. Ed Rogowski, a former United Airlines auditor now teaching at the University of Illinois, explains this as Southwest finally embracing the ancillary revenue model that has driven profits at major carriers since the early 2000s. \u201cSouthwest\u2019s systems and models don\u2019t provide an opportunity for these additional revenue sources to the extent that their competitors do,\u201d he noted. \u201cThese changes allow Southwest to take advantage of the many ancillary benefits that increase profits for other airlines.\u201d The timing wasn\u2019t coincidental. Jordan revealed that Southwest\u2019s analysis changed after the airline began selling tickets through metasearch platforms, where customer booking behavior showed less value placed on the bundled free bag offering. Additionally, hiring executives with direct experience implementing bag fees at other airlines helped validate the new approach. Not everyone is celebrating Southwest\u2019s financial success. The decision sparked immediate backlash from loyal customers who viewed free bags as a core part of the Southwest experience. Social media erupted with complaints from travelers threatening to defect to competitors. \u201cIt was the only reason I flew Southwest,\u201d said MaKensey Kaye Alford, a 21-year-old singer and actress planning a move to New York. Her sentiment echoes thousands of customer complaints that flooded social media following the announcement. The impact extends beyond casual frustration. For specific travel segments like skiers, the change is particularly painful. A round-trip ski vacation now costs an additional $160 in baggage fees, making Southwest less attractive for equipment-heavy travel. Industry observers worry this could erode Southwest\u2019s market position in key leisure travel segments. Competitor airlines wasted no time capitalizing on the discontent. Delta CEO Ed Bastian noted that customers who chose Southwest for free bags are \u201cnow clearly up for grabs,\u201d while United CEO Scott Kirby predicted the change would benefit all other carriers. Perhaps most concerning for Southwest\u2019s long-term prospects is the potential erosion of customer loyalty, a cornerstone of the airline\u2019s success for decades. The free bag policy wasn\u2019t just a perk; it was part of Southwest\u2019s identity as the customer-friendly alternative to traditional carriers. Errol Joseph, a sales consultant who flies between New York and Dallas, captured the sentiment of many frequent flyers: \u201cWith the baggage policy change, there\u2019s pretty much no reason to be loyal.\u201d He now considers Delta when prices are comparable, noting amenities like seatback screens that Southwest lacks. The airline has attempted to soften the blow by preserving benefits for its most valuable customers. A-List Preferred members still receive two free checked bags, A-List members get one free bag, and Southwest credit card holders maintain the one-bag benefit. But this tiered approach may not be enough to prevent defections among mid-tier frequent flyers who no longer see sufficient value in the Southwest proposition. While the revenue boost is clear, the operational implications of the policy change are more complex. Southwest acknowledges that customers will \u201cundoubtedly carry on more luggage than before,\u201d potentially increasing boarding times and gate congestion. The airline has responded by equipping staff with mobile bag-tag printers and creating new carry-on size guides, but these measures may not fully offset the operational challenges. Early implementation revealed some hiccups. The rollout of basic economy fares saw \u201ca temporary reduction in the conversion rate\u201d on Southwest\u2019s website, forcing the airline to refine its booking process and increase promotional activity. These growing pains suggest that transforming a decades-old business model isn\u2019t without risks. Six months after implementation, Southwest\u2019s decision to charge for bags appears to be a financial success. The airline has generated substantial new revenue without the catastrophic customer exodus some predicted. Jordan reports no detectable impact on booking volumes or website traffic, suggesting many customers have grudgingly accepted the new reality. However, the long-term implications remain uncertain. Southwest built its brand on being different, the fun, customer-friendly alternative that didn\u2019t nickel and dime passengers. By adopting the same fee structure as traditional carriers, the airline risks losing the differentiation that made it special. The real test will come during economic downturns or when competitors offer aggressive pricing. Without the free bag advantage, Southwest must prove it can compete purely on price and service quality, a more challenging proposition in an increasingly commoditized industry. Industry analyst Jeff Windau of Edward Jones believes Southwest can weather the transition: \u201cAs long as Southwest maintains competitive pricing, we do not envision a significant loss of customers.\u201d But that analysis assumes pricing remains the primary factor in customer decisions, potentially underestimating the emotional connection many travelers had to Southwest\u2019s unique value proposition. As Southwest continues its transformation with additional changes planned, including airport lounges and international travel, the baggage fee decision will likely be remembered as a turning point. The airline is betting that increased profitability and alignment with industry standards will ultimately benefit shareholders and enable future investment in customer experience. Whether this gamble pays off depends largely on execution. If Southwest can use its additional revenue to improve service quality, expand route networks, and offer competitive pricing, customers may forgive the loss of free bags. But if the airline simply pockets the profits while service stagnates, it risks confirming customer fears that it has abandoned its customer-first principles. For now, Southwest\u2019s baggage fee experiment appears to be working financially. The question isn\u2019t whether the airline made more money,,it clearly has. The question is whether, in pursuit of short-term profits, Southwest sacrificed the long-term brand loyalty that made it one of America\u2019s most beloved airlines. Only time will tell if this was a strategic masterstroke or the beginning of Southwest\u2019s transformation into just another airline that happens to fly Boeing 737s.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"\"I think I might be an incel.\" It's the first line Jack Lowden speaks in The Fifth Step, a two-hander play that focuses on the relationship between a recovering alcoholic and his sponsor. \"The line is a bomb - a hot button thing that's really funny,\" says Martin Freeman, who stars alongside Lowden. From the opening line, audiences may think they know what kind of show they are about to see, but what follows in the 90-minute play isn't a social lecture, rather a darkly funny conversation between two men \u2013 one seeking redemption, the other offering it. \"The incel line doesn't sum the play up at all,\" says Freeman. \"It might touch on that, but it has a lot of other components too.\" Lowden agrees, describing it as a \"current and easy label\" that risks simplifying a piece about shame, honesty and the need to be understood. Written by David Ireland and directed by Finn den Hertog, The Fifth Step sees Lowden play Luka, a newcomer to Alcoholics Anonymous, while Freeman is an older sponsor guiding him through the 12-step recovery programme. The play was met with rave reviews by critics during its West End run earlier this year and it is now being released in cinemas by NT Live.  \"It's actually very TV and camera friendly,\" Lowden explains. \"It's just two actors in an open space and there's no complicated staging.\" \"Really the only thing that was different was that we had mics on,\" adds Freeman. \"The cameras are so well hidden that it's not intrusive at all.\" Both actors were drawn to the project for the writing's precision and nerve. Freeman says he wasn't in the market to do a play when he received the script just before Christmas but it was \"so enjoyable and some things come along that are too good not to do, and this was one of those\". Lowden, best known for Slow Horses and The Gold, has long admired Ireland's work and says it's \"purposefully very shocking and funny\". \"That's what I love to go to the theatre for, I get quite bored unless a show is one of those two things.\" We talk about how the play explores the confusion around modern masculinity and fatherhood, something both actors are acutely aware of - Freeman shares a teenage son and daughter with his ex-wife Amanda Abbington, while Lowden has just welcomed his first child with Saoirse Ronan. \"I think about the messages young people are getting all the time,\" Freeman says. \"There's so much that's very positive and hopeful in the world but there's also so much that's trash, awful and frightening. \"It can feel like a minefield sometimes and I'm very alive to those things, but I try not to lose my mind over it.\" Given how many topics the play touches upon, it's impossible for the actors to give it one neat label or find one overarching theme. \"I don't think this play is about the male experience of anything - it explores the relationship between an older and a younger man, but if you take 'man' out of that, it's just a generational exploration of shame,\" Lowden says.  In fact, the 35-year-old actor says he finds it \"reductive how society pigeonholes a piece of art straight away\", referencing how some people have focused too much on the incel culture aspect of the play rather than \"seeing it as two people talking very openly\". The Fifth Step is Lowden's first play since 2018 and critic reviews from the theatrical run praised his performance - The Times said he was \"staggeringly good as a young loner, Luka, all jitters and tics and swear words, who is trying to pull himself out of an alcoholic spiral\".  Similarly, The I's Isobel Lewis said Lowden's greatest triumph is that \"despite Luka's propensity for violence, extreme misogyny and casual homophobia, he's still ultimately empathetic, someone you come to understand as a product of his environment\". A four-star review from The FT summarised the play as \"interweaving serious questions with crisply funny dialogue and combining the absurd with the profound\". Freeman says it's that balance of darkness and humour that makes The Fifth Step so unique. \"It's shocking and violent, and people say things to each other that are horrible and funny in the same beat.\" Ultimately, the Sherlock actor wants \"people to take enjoyment out of it\" and doesn't want an audience to see this as a play that's good for them, but one that's interesting and enlightening. He tells me that every evening during the play's run at @sohoplace, the audiences would \"let out an enjoyable sigh, as if someone had just had a really good meal\".  Now, as The Fifth Step makes its way from the stage to cinema screens, Freeman and Lowden are hoping for that same collective sigh after each screening.  The Fifth Step will be in cinemas globally from 27 November - with select preview screenings across the UK on 18 November.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Qualcomm (QCOM) stock has returned a significant $87 Bil back to its investors through tangible cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. The company\u2019s cash generation is driven by its chipset sales in the mobile device, automotive, and IoT sectors, and high-margin royalty income from its extensive intellectual property portfolio in communication technologies. Interestingly, QCOM stock has achieved the 22nd highest return to shareholders in history. Let's examine some figures and compare how this payout capability measures against the largest capital-return companies in the market.     Why should you be concerned? Because dividends and share buybacks offer direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate the management\u2019s confidence in the financial stability and ability to generate sustainable cash flows of the company. Furthermore, there are additional stocks that fit this profile. Below is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by the total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Picking stocks tends to fail more often than succeed. High Quality Portfolio transforms insights from individual stocks into a robust portfolio strategy that outperforms the market. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return To view the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely related to growth potential for reinvestments. Companies such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a much quicker pace in a more predictable manner than others, yet they have returned a lower percentage of their market cap to their shareholders. That\u2019s the counterpoint to high capital returns. Indeed, they may be appealing, but you should ask yourself the question: Am I compromising growth and sound fundamentals? With that consideration in mind, let\u2019s review some figures for QCOM.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor.   Adobe (ADBE) stock warrants your attention. Why? Because it offers thick  margins at a reduced price. Here are some statistics. While growth in revenue is beneficial, this should not be viewed merely from a growth perspective. Pricing power along with high margins contributes to consistent and predictable profits and cash flows, which mitigates risk and enables capital to be reinvested. The market typically rewards such stability. Beyond the financials, a couple of structural advantages drive Adobe\u2019s outlook. The company is a leader in digital media and enterprise software, and has pivoted to a subscription model that drives recurring revenue. Its integrated workflow solutions create high switching costs, helping customer retention. The company is also witnessing growing adoption of its creative and enterprise tools enhanced by generative AI. For context, Adobe offers a range of software solutions globally, including its Creative Cloud subscription, catering to enterprise clients across Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors.   However, do these figures truly paint the complete picture? Explore Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe possesses an enduring advantage that remains resilient beneath the surface. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio has outperformed \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework can tilt the odds in your favor. Stocks Like These Can Outperform. Here Is the Data Here\u2019s our selection process: We target stocks with a market cap greater than $10 billion and filter out those exhibiting high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also exclusively focus on stocks that have significantly decreased in value over the past year. Below are the statistics for stocks where this selection strategy has been applied since 12\/31\/2016. However, Consider the Risks That being said, Adobe has encountered substantial declines in difficult times. It fell about 72.5% during the Dot-Com crash and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the decline was around 60%. Even the less severe downturns, such as those in 2018 and during the Covid pandemic, resulted in a loss of approximately 25% of its value. Therefore, despite the favorable aspects, Adobe does not escape the impact when markets decline. Nonetheless, the risks are not confined to major market crashes. Stocks can drop even during strong markets \u2013 consider events like earnings announcements, business updates, and changes in outlook.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"                 Reading time: Reading time 4 minutes        One of the most uncertain times during Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history was the so-called block size war, where the technical debate over how the network should scale to more users, among other disagreements, led to worries over whether the system would be able to resist protocol changes in the face of mounting pressure from large, corporate interests that had been building on top of it. In the end, a multi-layer approach to scaling that retains a high degree of decentralization at the base layer was the Schelling point where users landed. And with today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatively low level of activity taking place at the base blockchain layer, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat unclear what all the fuss was about. Now, there is another technical disagreement among Bitcoin users in terms of how the system should deal with spam and various other types of unwanted transactions. Of course, defining spam is somewhat paradoxical in a system that is supposed to be permissionless. Not all things that are problems have solutions, or if they do have solutions they can come with worse risks than living with the problem. Eg you could probably address spam by centralizing Bitcoin but then it wouldnt be permissionless or censorship resisitant. \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) October 12, 2025  Bitcoin Knots, which is led by longtime Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr, has enabled various automated filters that nodes can use to prevent certain types of unwanted transactions from being relayed around the network. However, those transactions only need a small minority of nodes to support them in order to find their way into new blocks generated by miners. Additionally, perceived \u00e2\u0080\u009cspammers\u00e2\u0080\u009d can simply send their transactions directly to miners who are willing to mine those transactions. For reference, Bitcoin Core is the node software client that has always been used by the vast majority of users on the Bitcoin network and descends from Satoshi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original implementation. Bitcoin Knots has also existed and been maintained by Dashjr since 2011, but it has increased in relevance during the recent debate over the use of \u00e2\u0080\u009cspam\u00e2\u0080\u009d filters. Up to this point, Bitcoin Knots users have not obtained enough network support for the filters they use to sufficiently ward off unwanted transactions. So, they are now proposing a change to the rules of the actual Bitcoin network regarding these unwanted transactions, which is a measure many of their opponents predicted they would be forced into earlier this year. The types of transactions that the Bitcoin users running Knots would like to see filtered vary, but it is usually related to the addition of arbitrary data to the blockchain. In particular, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) enabled on Bitcoin via the Ordinals Inscriptions protocol have been a key area of debate over the past couple of years. While those running Knots would like to take a more aggressive stance against the issue of the Bitcoin blockchain being used for alternative tokens and other use cases unrelated to the bitcoin asset, those who have stuck with Bitcoin Core as their node software client of choice see the idea of targeting certain transactions for filtration as an endless cat and mouse game with the fee market ultimately operating as the long-term mechanism to discourage spam. a lot of this Bitcoin Core \/ spam debate comes down to fees and coffees and i don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why im suprised this is all so lost of a lot of people 1: block sizes must be capped for decentralization(this was settled 10\u00e2\u0080\u0099years ago, so if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree just go away)  2:\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u2014 StopAndDecrypt (@StopAndDecrypt) May 2, 2025  To be clear, many proponents of the Bitcoin Core development path also very much dislike it when the Bitcoin blockchain is used for non-bitcoin things. However, they view the current \u00e2\u0080\u009cspam\u00e2\u0080\u009d as a temporary phenomenon related to the lack of adoption of bitcoin as money. In other words, the use of bitcoin as money should outbid the use of the Bitcoin network for other use cases over the long term. Recently, supporters of the Bitcoin Knots view have become more aggressive and active in their stance against Bitcoin Core\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development decisions. Some parties believe that a recent change in terms of the size of OP_RETURN transactions (which are meant to limit the damage caused by arbitrary data being added to the Bitcoin blockchain that will be relayed by Bitcoin Core nodes) will lead to an explosion of non-bitcoin activity on the network. This is not true. Here is what the 0.9 Bitcoin Core release notes say about OP_RETURN and data in the blockchain: pic.twitter.com\/Sm9JpL90hP \u2014 Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) October 8, 2025  Additionally, various people involved with the bitcoin mining pool Ocean have indicated that Bitcoin will die once this change is adopted by most of the network because someone will upload illegal content to the blockchain. This is a claim that is largely disputed by many of the lawyers who work in the Bitcoin industry, as this is a potential issue that has existed for many years prior to the latest release of Bitcoin Core. So far, the soft fork proposal from the Bitcoin Knots camp has not been taken seriously outside of those who already run that software client. For example, longtime Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd took the entire text of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) associated with the soft fork and put it on the Bitcoin blockchain in a way that would not have been filtered out or deemed an invalid transaction by the new rules implemented by the soft fork. Former Bitcoin Core contributor and Blockstream co-founder Greg Maxwell asked for the pull request associated with the BIP to be taken down due to it being referenced in fraudulent claims allegedly being made by Ocean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal representatives. For now, the pull request has been locked. if any bitcoin miners need help replying to a threatening letter that claims you have to run your business a certain way or face legal consequences, we are here to help \u2014 Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) October 27, 2025  In terms of general support among the Bitcoin network, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to see where support for this fork proposal currently stands. While some estimates say more than 20% of the nodes on the Bitcoin network are running Bitcoin Knots, the reality is that this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say much of anything about support from economic nodes or miners, which are the much more relevant factors to consider. Ocean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mining pool currently accounts for somewhere around 2% of the overall network hashrate. More than 20% of the hashrate already appears to be accepting of larger OP_RETURN transactions, and the head of mining pool F2Pool came out publicly against the recent soft fork proposal. The insanity of thinking that because some bozo wrote a BIP, the network HAS to upgrade else they are corrupt\u2026 Dude, write a better BIP. Authoritarian clownshow. https:\/\/t.co\/ILx7ThkTx5 \u2014 _Checkmate \u00f0\u009f\u009f\u00a0\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u0091\u00e2\u009a\u00a1\u00e2\u0098\u00a2\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00f0\u009f\u009b\u00a2\u00ef\u00b8\u008f (@_Checkmatey_) October 27, 2025  If Bitcoin Knots support is indeed rather lackluster in terms of its share of the greater Bitcoin network, then a fork could still be pushed through with minority support. However, additional tweaks could be needed to make sure that the blockchain continued, as Bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current mining difficulty level would be too much for the small minority of miners to overcome. Bitcoin Cash had to make similar changes when it originally forked off from the original Bitcoin network. Discussions have been had regarding practical changes that could be made to disincentivize spam on the network, but this first fork proposal does not appear to be it.

On Tuesday morning, some Amazon employees learned they had lost their jobs \u2014 through text messages. Amazon sent two text messages early Tuesday to inform employees their jobs had been eliminated, according to people familiar with the matter and screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One message urged affected employees to check their personal or work email before coming to the office. A second text directed them to call a help desk if they hadn't received \"an email message about your role.\" The texts, sent shortly after email notifications, were intended to prevent laid-off employees from arriving at the office and discovering their badges no longer worked, one of the people said.  The predicament of laid-off workers unable to badge in has become increasingly common during recent mass layoffs at companies such as Google and Tesla. An Amazon spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to speak to the press. Amazon eliminated about 14,000 jobs on Tuesday, saying the cuts were part of an effort to streamline operations and \"innovate much faster.\" Many of the affected employees in the US were retail managers, continuing a trend of reductions in that part of the company. A message from Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti, sent to affected employees and shared on the company's internal Slack, said laid-off workers would continue to receive full pay and benefits for 90 days, along with a severance package. In a separate blog post Tuesday, Galetti said the job cuts were driven by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, noting that Amazon was making changes despite the company's strong performance. \"What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,\" Galetti wrote. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).\" Have a tip?

Stocks may plummet unexpectedly, erasing months or even years of profits within weeks. Historical evidence indicates that abrupt market fluctuations can affect any company, regardless of how powerful it appears. The Risk That Is Brewing  Markets fluctuate. Quality persists. Discover how the High Quality Portfolio maintains balance. Is Risk Showing Up In Financials Yet? A thorough examination of the fundamentals can indeed aid in risk mitigation. For insights on JNJ, please read Buy or Sell JNJ Stock. Here are several key figures to consider.   How Bad Can It Really Get? When assessing the risk for JNJ, it's evident that no stock is shielded during significant market downturns. JNJ experienced a decline of about 35% during both the Dot-Com Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis. Throughout the Covid sell-off, it fell around 27%. Even lesser downturns, such as the 2018 correction and last year\u2019s inflation crisis, resulted in declines nearing 18%. This illustrates that even strong companies can suffer substantial losses when markets shift. Quality is important, but the risk of decline remains tangible during volatile times. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has consistently demonstrated a track record of comfortably surpassing its benchmark which includes all three \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor.   Yet another day of new records in the stock market on Monday as the S&P 500 was higher by 1.2%, the Dow up 0.7% and the Nasdaq up almost 2%.  This is an amazing run as seemingly big progress on the trade front with China, through in a start to a Fed meeting in which many are hoping for rate cuts and the seeming taming of inflation, and it adds up for the positivity we are seeing. The President statement \u201cwe feel good\u201d along with Scott Bessent talking about a path with the President and Chairman Xi to get a deal has helped to fan the optimism flame.  One of the stocks that helped significantly in this rally was Qualcomm, with very positive news on the chip front, as their new rack server lineup should give some competition to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in the AI space.  The news led to the stock rallying more than 11% on the day, and both of the other stocks up more than 2% on the day.  In the sea of green that was the day we had some casualties and that was led by Gold and stock related to that commodity.  We saw gold briefly touch below $4000 yesterday, even after seeing it recently go above $4400.  This helped bring down the stocks that are reliant on Gold, such as Newmont Mining Corp, which went down more than 4% on the down-move on Gold. As we look at today\u2019s market, of course we see a start of a two-day Fed meeting and we will have a press conference and announcement tomorrow as there is a high expectation that the Fed will ease, We add in the aforementioned meeting on Thursday between President Trump and Chaiman Xi.  The momentum continues with a slight rise to the S&P 500 Futures in premarket trading.  We see a bit more optimism in Dow Jones Futures and much of that is driven by United Health Care, up almost 5% in premarket trading.  The Company said their earnings have returned to stability and with that they have raised guidance for the year.  The other stock enjoying a very positive pre-market is United Parcel Service.  The stock is up almost 10% as they have reported earnings well received by the street.  The positive thing they are doing is realizing some write offs and putting costs in line with business.  The street sees this model as very sustainable. The last thing I want to touch on is that the VIX has quickly come off any warning sign and is now trading down near 15.  This is fantastic for the upside; however, I will warn not to get too complacent. There is a lot of news over the next 72 hours, and the market seems to be discounting the risk.  You may want to be a bit more careful on position sizing in this time.  As always, stick with your investing plan and long-term goals","label":1}

It can be hard to find overlooked stocks in the hottest corner of the market, but a few names might still be flying under the radar.   While the AI boom may be propping up the whole economy, it's also propping up investors' portfolios, and the most popular stocks look expensive.  UBS managing director Tim Arcuri said Monday that the AI trade doesn't look to be a bubble on the verge of bursting, despite concerns about huge capex by Big Tech and a relentless rally in the stock market in the past three years.  But that doesn't mean he's only focused on the Magnificent 7. He also sees ample opportunity in a few smaller AI stocks that have quietly rallied recently. In his view, the strength of companies like Nvidia will fuel growth among groups of more niche tech stocks, specifically those in the semiconductor equipment space. \"You've got this double whammy, where you have this huge increase in demand, but also you've got Nvidia trying to move and get a little more leading edge,\" he stated. \"And that's all going to trickle down to the supply chain.\" Arcuri shared his top picks for under-the-radar AI stocks that he thinks investors should be watching: Micron, which builds devices for memory storage, has still performed extremely well, despite a weak chip demand forecast that sent shares down in December 2024.  Arcuri doesn't think most investors are following its progress, but he believes it is poised for growth. In his view, the market's view of Micron stock is likely to shift as the company becomes more structurally stable, moving away from a historically cyclical business model. Semiconductor equipment producer Lam Research has also enjoyed a strong rally in its share price, and other analysts have touted it as a beneficiary of a weaker US dollar in 2025.  Arcuri added that it is his favorite stock in the semi equipment space, noting that he thinks it is poised to benefit from surging demand for computing power among AI hyperscalers.   \"If you run some numbers on how much compute capacity is going to have to get added, and how much memory that will have to [be] added, and you run some numbers on how much it will cost to put that capacity in place and how much equipment will have to be bought, it's a really, really big number,\" he speculated. Terydyne, the smallest company on Arcuri's list of under-the-radar AI stocks, builds automated test equipment for semiconductors, an area that he thinks will play a key role in the next phase of the AI boom as the infrastructure buildout accelerates.  \"There's two companies in the world that make the testers to test this stuff,\" he said. \"One is in Japan, and the other is Terydyne in Boston,\" he added, referring to Tokyo-based Advantest Corporation.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"Here's how the two current pairs of Google Pixel Buds compare.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.        The budget option Google upgraded the Pixel Buds 2a to feature better sound, active noise-canceling, and more battery life, while still targeting an affordable price point. The earbuds offer an excellent fit and a Tensor A1 chip, but lack a few niceties you'd get with premium buds.        All the features The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are the complete wireless earbuds from Google, packing superb sound quality and ANC, as well as the longest battery life. Powered by the Tensor A1 chip, they also sport exclusive features like Adaptive Audio and Conversation detection.  Google Pixel Buds are fresher than ever, with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 just turning a year old and the brand-new Pixel Buds 2a fortifying the lineup. To top things off, Google recently refreshed the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a new Moonstone colorway and a few new features. It's a great time to be in the market for a pair of Pixel Buds as a result, but which model should you buy? The company hasn't made it easy, because both the Pixel Buds 2a and the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are excellent earbuds with strong value propositions. Of the two, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are unsurprisingly the better option, with crisper sound, stronger ANC, and all the features. The Pixel Buds 2a tries to hit all the basics, including ANC and solid sound, while priced competitively at $129. There are key differences to know before choosing, so let's compare the Pixel Buds 2a against the Pixel Buds Pro 2.      The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 deviated from the Pixel Buds A-series design, ditching the wingtip design in favor of a silicone stabilizer. This made the Pixel Buds Pro 2 tiny and secure, without a large wingtip in the mix. Now, the new Pixel Buds 2a borrow the Pixel Buds Pro 2's general design. This reduces the overall footprint and improves comfort by removing the wingtip. Like the Pixel Buds Pro 2, the cheaper Pixel Buds 2a have a silicone stabilizer with four sizes of ear tips included. There are tiny design differences between models, with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 appearing slightly smaller.      Additionally, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have a tiny \"G\" logo carved into their plastic surface, whereas the Pixel Buds 2a logo is flat and painted. The main portion of the earbud is glossy on the Buds 2a and matte on the Buds Pro 2. Only the Pixel Buds 2a are completely colored \u2014 the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will sport a matte black finish apart from the outward-facing portion of the earbuds. These are purely superficial design differences. In terms of fit, both the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel Buds 2a will feel comfortable for those who prefer small earbuds. Without a stem, neither earbud will gravitate toward falling out of your ears. At 4.7 grams each, there's no weight difference between these pairs of Google earbuds. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android      A neat trick that'll help you find the perfect fit is to insert the buds and rotate them until the \"G\" logo is upright. When it's aligned straight, you know either the Pixel Buds 2a or Pixel Buds Pro 2 are fitted correctly. Both earbuds also support an ear tip seal check that will use a software test to determine whether you're using the right size ear tip. Compared to older models like the Pixel Buds A-series, the Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 should be more comfortable and secure for most people. However, the difference between the Buds 2a and Buds Pro 2 will feel minuscule, if noticeable at all.      On paper, the Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 look surprisingly similar. Both earbuds have custom 11mm dynamic speaker drivers and the Google Tensor A1 chip for audio and active noise-canceling (ANC) processing. They each have capacitive touch sensors, an IR proximity sensor for automatic play and pause, and Hall effect sensors in the case. The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 separate themselves by adding swipe support for on-earbud volume control, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a case speaker. The case also supports wireless charging and is noticeably taller than the Pixel Buds 2a case. That's likely because the Pixel Buds Pro 2 case has a larger battery, supporting up to 48 hours of total listening time with the case and earbuds with ANC off.

The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 have more features, like Adaptive Audio, which dynamically adjusts ANC and transparency based on your environment. It also has Conversation Detection for times when you need to briefly speak without taking out your earbuds. These aren't available on the Pixel Buds 2a, but both earbud models have active in-ear pressure relief.      Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 both feature Google's Silent Seal ANC tech, but the former uses the 1.5 version and the latter uses the 2.0 version. This means the Pixel Buds 2a has ANC that's 1.5x better than the Pixel Buds Pro, while the Pixel Buds Pro 2's ANC is 2x better than the Pixel Buds Pro. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 also have three microphones per earbud, compared to the Pixel Buds 2a's two, which helps with ANC and call quality.      In the real world, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 do beat the Pixel Buds 2a, but the experience is similar across both earbuds. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will block even more sound than the Buds 2a, handling a pressurized airplane cabin, a loud coffee shop, or a busy street without issue. The Pixel Buds 2a will do their best, and it's usually good enough when music is playing. Still, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 clearly have an edge. The lack of Adaptive Audio on the Pixel Buds 2a isn't a dealbreaker for me, because I mostly use stock ANC or transparency modes anyway. If you use your buds similarly, you won't need to splurge on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for that feature. Sound quality is pretty great on the Pixel Buds 2a, as long as you don't listen to them at the maximum volume setting. At low and midrange volumes, these earbuds have decent balance with a bass that makes its presence felt without overpowering mids and highs. That starts to change near max volume, where the soundstage starts to blur and the sound becomes muddied. Everything sounds crisper on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, especially at high volumes. The earbuds manage to provide detailed reproduction and separation of songs across genres, and the sound is customizable across a five-band EQ. Put simply, if you need the best sound quality, Pixel Buds Pro 2 are the definitive option from Google.      The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are the complete package, with major perks like better sound quality that shines with crispness all the way up to maximum volume. There's better active noise-canceling and exclusive modes like Adaptive Audio, too. You even get nice-to-have features built in, such as a case speaker for Find My Device, wireless charging support, and on-earbud volume control. At the right price, they're nearly impossible to beat among the best wireless earbuds. It's not hard to find the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for under $200 \u2014 at the time of publishing, they're just under that threshold at Best Buy. We've seen more aggressive sales around deal holidays, and expect to see the same when Black Friday and Cyber Monday roll around. If you can wait, snagging the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for around $150 would be a better value than buying the Pixel Buds 2a at full price. The cheaper buds do nail the essentials, but at $129, they're too close to the price of higher-quality earbuds \u2014 especially when the latter are on sale. The Pixel Buds 2a are a solid set of earbuds, although you should probably wait for a sale if you want the best value.       Only the basics The Google Pixel Buds 2a are the perfect budget earbuds for Pixel owners. They include all the basics, like ANC and transparency modes. However, at full price, the Pixel Buds 2a might compete with a discounted pair of Pixel Buds Pro 2.        Still the best The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are still the best pair of Google earbuds, and on sale, they're likely still the best value. For a bit of extra cash, you'll get better sound quality, stronger ANC, and more features.

Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. If you\u2019re still rocking the original 2022 Google Pixel Watch, an update is rolling out for you right now. But don't get too excited. This isn't the big, flashy Wear OS 6 and Android 16 upgrade that landed on the Pixel Watch 2 and 3 earlier this month. This is its final, guaranteed farewell. Google is pushing build BW1A.251005.003.W1 to the first-gen watch, and it\u2019s a minor patch. This update keeps the device on Wear OS 5.1, which is based on Android 15. The official release notes are brief, mentioning only \u201cSecurity updates and bug fixes\" (via 9to5Google). This makes it clear that the original Pixel Watch won\u2019t be moving up to Wear OS 6, a privilege reserved for newer smartwatch models. Launched back in October 2022, the first-gen Pixel Watch was Google\u2019s re-entry into the smartwatch market, built on a Samsung Exynos 9110 chip and running Wear OS 3.5 at launch.      Over the past three years, it received multiple updates that improved performance and battery management, as well as two major version upgrades \u2014 from Wear OS 3.5 to Wear OS 4, and then to 5.1. With this latest patch, Google is effectively closing the book on major system updates for the device. That said, Google isn\u2019t abandoning the watch entirely. Users will still receive app and service updates through the Play Store, ensuring that essential functions remain usable for a while longer. But when it comes to full Wear OS upgrades and long-term improvements, this is the finish line. If you\u2019re still wearing the first-gen Pixel Watch, it\u2019s recommended to install the October patch once it hits your device. You can check for it manually by heading to Settings \u2192 System \u2192 System Updates on your watch. It\u2019s a relatively small update, but an important one for maintaining stability and security. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android And while it\u2019s bittersweet to see support end, the Pixel Watch has had a solid run: three years of updates and consistent improvements. From here on out, it\u2019ll continue to work fine, but without the major Wear OS upgrades that the newer Pixel Watch lineup will enjoy. Jay Bonggolto always keeps a nose for news.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"T-Mobile isn't messing around with its latest deal.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Black Friday is a month away, but I just uncovered a new T-Mobile deal on the Google Pixel 9a that's making the big sale weekend seem, well, a little unnecessary. It works like this: buy the midrange smartphone on \"most\" data plans at T-Mobile and the Big Three carrier will hook you up with $499.99 in promo credits over 24 months.\u00a0 That's enough to make the Google Pixel 9a completely free, no trade-in required! As if that wasn't enough, T-Mobile will also throw in a free pair of Google Pixel Buds 2a earbuds, an additional value of $129. Why go searching for Google Pixel deals this Black Friday when the early offers are already this good?\u00a0 Google Pixel 9a 128GB: $499.99 FREE with most plans, plus Pixel Buds 2a at T-Mobile (Online Exclusive) Add a line on an eligible Essentials (or other) data plan at T-Mobile and you could score a FREE Google Pixel 9a, no trade-in required. To sweeten the deal, the legendary wireless carrier will also throw in a free pair of Pixel Buds 2a earbuds.  The Google Pixel 9a is easily one of the best cheap Android phones on the market today, balancing an accessible price tag with the latest AI features and a ton of flagship-level specs.\u00a0 The midrange masterpiece boasts a lovely 6.3-inch pOLED display straight out of the gate, while under the hood you get a reliable 5,100mAh battery and the same Tensor G4 chipset that powers the rest of the Pixel 9 family.\u00a0 The phone also guarantees seven years of OS and security upgrades, plus you get that legendary AI-powered camera tech that made Google so famous in the Android phone space.\u00a0      It depends on what you're looking for. If you prefer to buy your phones unlocked and can wait a few more weeks, it might be worth waiting to see what retailers like Amazon and Best Buy do with the Pixel 9a. The phone dropped to $364 during October Prime Day, for instance, and I wouldn't be surprised if it hit that same record low again when the Black Friday sales begin in earnest. On the other hand, if you're already a T-Mobile subscriber and you don't mind adding a new line to your wireless service, then this Google Pixel 9a deal is a truly unmissable opportunity that no Black Friday sale can touch.\u00a0 Black Friday historically falls on the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, which means the 2025 event is set to occur on November 28th. That sale will be followed by Cyber Monday on December 1st, and you can expect that entire weekend to be packed full of various sale events.\u00a0 We've been following leaks and rumors surrounding the Pixel 10a for months now, and our sources indicate that the latest midrange masterpiece from Google will likely be unveiled in March 2026. This phone will probably boast the same $500 price tag as past A-series Pixel releases, plus it's sure to be equipped with the Tensor G5 chipset, great cameras, and all of the latest AI software features. Is it worth waiting six more months to buy the new Pixel 10a? The choice is yours, but I'd say that the Google Pixel 9a is a worthy investment in the meantime.\u00a0 Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android After almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he\/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":" AmazonLayoffsLord of the Rings  Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, those cuts include halting a \u201csignificant amount of our first-party AAA game development work\u00e2\u0080\u0093specifically around MMOs\u00e2\u0080\u0093within Amazon Game Studios.\u201d The company had previously announced an ambitious Lord of the Rings MMORPG. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work\u00e2\u0080\u0093specifically around MMOs\u00e2\u0080\u0093within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, reports Bloomberg. Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021\u2019s MMO New World. It\u2019s only other hits like Lost Ark and Throne and Liberty were developed by external partners. It\u2019s currently set to publish the next Tomb Raider game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed Lord of the Rings MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It\u2019s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled. The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon\u2019s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar. Amazon has also reworked its Prime Game program and seemingly scaled back ambitions for its video streaming platform Twitch over the years. Its gaming retreat comes as companies race to exploit a new gold rush in AI technology. \u201cSome may ask why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reducing roles when the company is performing well,\u201d Amaozn\u2019s head of people experience, Beth Galetti, wrote in a new blog post on Tuesday. \u201cAcross our businesses, we\u2019re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen since the Internet, and it\u2019s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.\u201d Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Constellation Energy (CEG) experienced a remarkable increase of 76%, driven not only by a slight rise in revenue but also by a significant spike in the P\/E ratio and a squeeze in margins. Behind the scenes are pivotal developments: a transformative partnership with Meta, a strategic acquisition of Calpine, optimistic endorsements from analysts, and a rapidly increasing demand for both AI and nuclear energy\u2014altering its prospects in real time. What is going on in this situation? The stock soared by 76%, propelled by a 5.3% rise in revenue, a 24% decline in margins, and an impressive 118% increase in the P\/E ratio. Let\u2019s delve into the factors that contributed to these changes. Prior to examining the specific events that prompted the surge in stock price, it\u2019s worth noting what market insight reveals: Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a wealth management firm in the Boston area \u2013 whose asset allocation strategies delivered favorable returns during the 2008-09 downturn when the S&P plummeted by over 40%. Empirical integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation strategy to offer clients enhanced returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; presenting a much smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance statistics. Opinion: At present, we consider CEG stock to be unattractive. What\u2019s the reason? Check out the comprehensive story. Read Buy or Sell CEG Stock to understand what informs our current perspective. Risk: An effective way to measure risk is by analyzing how much CEG declines in significant market crashes. During the Inflation Shock, it fell approximately 24%. Although that\u2019s less severe than some other crises, it demonstrates that even strong stocks can suffer when the market experiences downturns. No stock is immune to abrupt shocks, regardless of its fundamentals. Consistently selecting winners is challenging \u2013 particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Alternatively, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 different stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this success? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a more stable investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance data.","label":1}

Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she\u2019s had. She\u2019s been on all of the best of lists. She\u2019s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it\u2019s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you\u2026 Barry Ritholtz: I know it\u2019s always, I always have so much, I\u2019ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It\u2019s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you\u2019re doing with the podcast and what you\u2019re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It\u2019s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would\u2019ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don\u2019t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty\u2019s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That\u2019s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so\u2026 Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty\u2019s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don\u2019t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That\u2019s amazing. And he was always the answer to, \u201cHey, do any of these technicians make any money?\u201d And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: \u00a0Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That\u2019s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That\u2019s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That\u2019s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that\u2019s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I\u2019ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said\u00a0Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They\u2019d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13]\u00a0 you end up go 13 years. Wow. That\u2019s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: \u00a0The inner voice said, you don\u2019t really love this that much. And there wasn\u2019t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn\u2019t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here\u2019s the universe, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn\u2019t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you\u2019ve been with Schwab for\u00a0a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it\u2019ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn\u2019t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: \u00a0So, so let, let\u2019s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that\u2019s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: \u00a0That\u2019s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let\u2019s dive into this. What are the, let, let\u2019s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion\u2026 Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You\u2019ll, get somewhere soon\u2026 Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That\u2019s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That\u2019s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little\u2026 Barry Ritholtz:\u00a0Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that\u2019s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that\u2019s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There\u2019s an institutional business, there\u2019s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn\u2019t Schwab work with? It\u2019s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we\u2019re actually referring to the part of the business that you\u2019re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that\u2019s how we defined institutional it of the, and I\u2019m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that\u2019s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that\u2019s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it\u2019s what we, but we we\u2019re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That\u2019s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we\u2019re, we\u2019re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I\u2019ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD \u2014 years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn\u2019t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, \u201cHey, you guys don\u2019t custody with Schwab and my money\u2019s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.\u201d Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there\u2019s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it\u2019s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I\u2019m making up stuff. KeyBank.\u201d But we just heard it so many times. It\u2019s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there\u2019s a, there\u2019s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know,\u00a0about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That\u2019s, that\u2019s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn\u2019t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it\u2019s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he\u2019s still up and about You were telling me he was, he\u2019s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That\u2019s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I\u2019ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it\u2019s obviously true about the entire industry. You\u2019ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it\u2019s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it\u2019s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it\u2019s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question \u2019cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: \u00a0True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn\u2019t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it\u2019s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don\u2019t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it\u2019s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I\u2019m not here to say that they\u2019re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it\u2019s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they\u2019ve been, they\u2019ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I\u2019m, I\u2019m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I\u2019m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there\u2019s more bifurcation and there\u2019s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they\u2019re not in conflict, but they\u2019re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn\u2019t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I\u2019m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: \u00a0Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they\u2019ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: \u00a0Although people still didn\u2019t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn\u2019t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. \u00a0So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it\u2019s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I\u2019m not picking stocks. I\u2019m not a trader. I don\u2019t analyze individual stocks. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she\u2019s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She\u2019s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it\u2019s jokingly, but it\u2019s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. \u2019cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what\u2019s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I\u2019ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don\u2019t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I\u2019m, I, I\u2019m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that\u2019s a very different audience that if you\u2019re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it\u2019s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn\u2019t matter, what shouldn\u2019t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there\u2019s really not that much practical value to that. It\u2019s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn\u2019t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It\u2019s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it\u2019s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis\u2019 book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that\u2019s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don\u2019t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market\u2019s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty\u2019s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn\u2019t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it\u2019s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don\u2019t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what\u2019s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there\u2019s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn\u2019t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn\u2019t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I\u2019m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don\u2019t know why everybody\u2019s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it\u2019s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it\u2019s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that\u2019s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There\u2019s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don\u2019t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it\u2019s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don\u2019t figure out the hard way whether there\u2019s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? \u2019cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what\u2019s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you\u2019re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there\u2019s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn\u2019t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don\u2019t know who you are. You don\u2019t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don\u2019t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn\u2019t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that\u2019s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn\u2019t have microphones in front of us. That\u2019s right. So it was, let\u2019s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it\u2019s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don\u2019t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there\u2019s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there\u2019s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don\u2019t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn\u2019t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it\u2019s 1130, I\u2019m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven\u2019t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I\u2019m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I\u2019m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you\u2019re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that\u2019s inter what\u2019s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s right. And it wasn\u2019t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it\u2019s not a precise contrarian timing, but there\u2019s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what\u2019s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you\u2019ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that\u2019s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We\u2019re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn\u2019t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant\u2019s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that\u2019s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that\u2019s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn\u2019t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It\u2019s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you\u2019re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You\u2019ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I\u2019m not an analyst, I don\u2019t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let\u2019s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we\u2019re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don\u2019t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what\u2019s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That\u2019s an institutional problem. If you\u2019re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it\u2019s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It\u2019s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there\u2019s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA\u2019s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there\u2019s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it\u2019s the concentrate, it\u2019s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who\u2019s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we\u2019ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I\u2019m trying to remember where we are now. I haven\u2019t looked at it recently, but when it\u2019s going up, it\u2019s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it\u2019s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I\u2019m, I\u2019m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It\u2019s number one right now. But it\u2019s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, \u2019cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you\u2019re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there\u2019s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It\u2019s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there\u2019s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I\u2019m Barry Riol, you\u2019re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I\u2019m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don\u2019t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that\u2019s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let\u2019s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it\u2019s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He\u2019s, I called himself tariff man, it\u2019s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn\u2019t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We\u2019re never going to have a trade surplus. They can\u2019t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can\u2019t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it\u2019s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn\u2019t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It\u2019s a VAT tax, it\u2019s evaluated tax on consumption\u2019s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we\u2019re not, we\u2019re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They\u2019re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I\u2019ve heard from friends who didn\u2019t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that\u2019s what\u2019s a little frustrating because there\u2019s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It\u2019s the US company. It\u2019s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it\u2019s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there\u2019s only so many dollars. It\u2019s finite. Right. If, if they\u2019re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There\u2019s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it\u2019s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn\u2019t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I\u2019m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it\u2019s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it\u2019s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we\u2019re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that\u2019s where I wanted to go. Since we\u2019re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn\u2019t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We\u2019re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What\u2019s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we\u2019re, we\u2019re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there\u2019s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it\u2019s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what\u2019s a trillion, but it\u2019s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn\u2019t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn\u2019t. But there\u2019s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don\u2019t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I\u2019m talking about, then there\u2019s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that\u2019s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let\u2019s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We\u2019ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don\u2019t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn\u2019t come down to the fed\u2019s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here\u2019s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it\u2019s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there\u2019s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There\u2019s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it\u2019s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That\u2019s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that\u2019s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn\u2019t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That\u2019s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it\u2019s not that the economy is contracting, it\u2019s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s not a contraction, it\u2019s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn\u2019t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I\u2019m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people\u2019s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not sure if the market\u2019s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It\u2019s like, Hey, you\u2019re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You\u2019re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn\u2019t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that\u2019s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it\u2019s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here\u2019s, here\u2019s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That\u2019s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, \u2019cause it\u2019s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here\u2019s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven\u2019t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn\u2019t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there\u2019s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don\u2019t pick up if you\u2019re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That\u2019s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we\u2019re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it\u2019s not so much what people aren\u2019t talking about, so I\u2019m gonna answer in a different way. It\u2019s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn\u2019t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it\u2019s y hated that, and I\u2019m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn\u2019t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You\u2019re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it\u2019s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don\u2019t even remember the symbol. I\u2019m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I\u2019m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here\u2019s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It\u2019s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It\u2019s, it\u2019s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we\u2019re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that\u2019s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don\u2019t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I\u2019m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There\u2019s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there\u2019s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it\u2019s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there\u2019s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there\u2019s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you\u2019ve, that\u2019s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They\u2019re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That\u2019s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there\u2019s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let\u2019s, let\u2019s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I\u2019m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we\u2019ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you\u2019re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you\u2019re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That\u2019s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it\u2019s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t don\u2019t clutter it up with jargon. That\u2019s right. Make it hundred percent. That\u2019s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let\u2019s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I\u2019m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don\u2019t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it\u2019s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It\u2019s the same. It\u2019s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that\u2019s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It\u2019s easy when you\u2019re traveling, if you\u2019re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you\u2019re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love \u2019em because they\u2019re long form and they\u2019re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They\u2019re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They\u2019re, they\u2019re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I\u2019m gonna tell you, I listened. I\u2019ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab\u2019s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I\u2019m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you\u2019re so exhausted after this life\u2019s tragedy is in your mind, you\u2019re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It\u2019s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I\u2019ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I\u2019m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There\u2019s a movie, I wanna say it\u2019s on Netflix called Black Bag. That\u2019s the same I\u2019ve heard about it. Same sort of I\u2019ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she\u2019s like, told it was great. Like, I\u2019m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There\u2019s, there\u2019s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that\u2019s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I\u2019m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I\u2019m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that\u2019s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that\u2019s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It\u2019s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We\u2019ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that\u2019s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it\u2019s essentially a first generation business. And so there\u2019s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that\u2019s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don\u2019t go in there and say, here\u2019s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it\u2019s, that\u2019s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you\u2019re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. \u2019cause we don\u2019t know anything about that. So we\u2019re bringing it\u2019s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn\u2019t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there\u2019s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would\u2019ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here\u2019s what, here\u2019s what I don\u2019t know. If I would\u2019ve believed that 40 years from that point, I\u2019d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time. My pleasure. Always really, really interesting. We have been speaking with Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief investment strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in client funds.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Thursday, October 30, 2025. Revenues are expected to increase by approximately 3% year-over-year to $2.41 billion, while earnings are anticipated to reach about $1.61 per share, representing an increase of about $1.55 compared to a year earlier. Recent quarters have seen growth propelled by stronger futures and options activity. Volatility in the energy markets has led to elevated trading volumes, and there has also been a rise in interest rate products as market participants adapted to shifting monetary policy. We might observe comparable trends during Q3 as well. The company has a current market capitalization of $90 billion. Revenue over the past twelve months was $13 billion, and it was operationally profitable, with operating profits of $4.8 billion and net income of $3.0 billion. While much will depend on how results compare to consensus expectations, understanding historical trends could work in your favor if you are an event-driven trader. There are two approaches to accomplish this: either understand the historical probabilities and position yourself before the earnings announcement, or examine the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns following the earnings release and adapt your positioning accordingly afterwards. That being said, if you are looking for upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative \u2013 outperforming the S&P 500 and delivering returns exceeding 105% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some observations regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Further data for the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized in the table below along with the statistics. A relatively less risky strategy (although not beneficial if the correlation is low) is to discern the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identify a pair that holds the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the most substantial correlation, a trader could take a \u201clong\u201d position for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data grounded in a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. It is important to note that the correlation 1D_5D pertains to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and ensuing 5D returns. At times, the performance of peers can affect the stock's reaction following earnings. In fact, the price adjustments might commence prior to the announcement of the earnings. The table below presents historical data contrasting the post-earnings performance of Intercontinental Exchange stock against that of peers who reported earnings just ahead of Intercontinental Exchange. For an equitable comparison, the returns of peer stocks also denote post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you are interested in achieving upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like Intercontinental Exchange, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and has logged over 105% returns since inception.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Elon Musk\u2019s net worth eclipsed $500 billion again Tuesday as Tesla\u2019s shares have risen in recent days, as the automaker appeared to benefit from warming trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, which accounts for more than one-fifth of Tesla\u2019s sales.  Shares of Tesla rose 2.2% to around $462.50 as of Tuesday afternoon, following a 4.3% rally on Monday.  President Donald Trump, who earlier this month threatened China with 100% tariffs after Chinese officials unveiled trade restrictions on rare earth minerals, said Monday the U.S. and China would likely \u201ccome away with\u201d a trade deal before Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that Trump\u2019s tariff threat was \u201ceffectively off the table\u201d after a \u201cvery good\u201d meeting with trade officials, sparking a broader market rally as trading opened Monday, which concluded with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closing at record highs. Tesla\u2019s annual sales in China, the automaker\u2019s second-largest market behind the U.S., rose 8.8% to a record high of more than 657,000 cars in 2024. Musk, who holds roughly 12% equity of Tesla, is the richest person in the world with a fortune estimated at $501.7 billion. His net worth rose by $6.6 billion (1.3%) on Tuesday as Tesla shares continued a rally. He became the first person ever to be worth $500 billion earlier this month, and it\u2019s possible he could be the world\u2019s first trillionaire should Tesla shareholders approve Musk\u2019s $1 trillion pay package. Some groups have opposed Musk\u2019s pay package, including Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services,  which advised Tesla\u2019s shareholders to vote against the payment plan. In a letter to shareholders on Monday, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm warned investors that Musk could leave Tesla if the pay plan is rejected, claiming, \u201cWithout Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to come.\u201d Tesla reported a record number of vehicle deliveries through its latest quarter, even as sales declined in Europe, yet its latest earnings report fell below Wall Street\u2019s projections. Revenues soared above $28 billion in Tesla\u2019s third quarter, boosted by the sales record, but the automaker reported earnings per share of $0.50, coming below estimates of $0.56. Some analysts attributed the rise in sales to the expiration of a federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, which Musk suggested earlier in the year could disrupt Tesla\u2019s upcoming quarters.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"             POPULAR SEARCHES                         BROWSE BY            The New England Patriots are spoiled rotten. They barely had to exist without a top-flight quarterback. New England enjoyed Tom Brady for two decades, and now, it seems Drake Maye has established himself as one of the league\u2019s best QBs.\u00a0 Heading into Week 9, he\u2019s\u00a0been the best quarterback. QB Stock Market isn\u2019t your typical quarterback rankings. I\u2019m focused on monitoring the fluctuations of a QB\u2019s performance throughout the season. No one \u2014 not even Patrick Mahomes \u2014 is safe at the top. No one \u2014 not even Justin Fields \u2014 is stuck at the bottom. There is room for quick ascent \u2014 and rapid decline. One question holds most important: What have you done for your team lately? Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\u00a0 The Patriots quarterback is making covered receivers look open and open receivers look like they\u2019ve exploited busted coverage.\u00a0 We all knew Maye had an incredible arm. It was clear at UNC, and it held true in his rookie year.\u00a0 But Maye has a newfound accuracy and touch that keep the Patriots on schedule. When Mack Hollins or Stefon Diggs run a route that\u2019s supposed to move the chains, Maye puts the ball exactly where it needs to be and with the necessary velocity. Everyone is going to buzz and gush \u2014 rightfully so \u2014 over the deep game. But even last year, that was a huge part of his toolbox. I\u2019m most impressed with Maye\u2019s mastery of the ho-hum quick game, of the way Maye recognizes, anticipates and attacks holes in zone defenses, and of the way Maye makes sure bad plays don\u2019t get worse.\u00a0 When you combine that fundamentally strong play with the splash plays, you have one of the NFL\u2019s hardest-to-stop weapons \u2014 even on a day when Browns edge Myles Garrett had a franchise-best five sacks. Simply put, there\u2019s a consistency in Maye\u2019s game that Caleb Williams (and Ben Johnson) could only dream of. But at this point in his career, we can stop comparing Maye to the guys in his draft class (from Williams to Jayden Daniels to Bo Nix). In these eight games, Maye deserves comparison with the league\u2019s best: Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. And since we\u2019re comparing Maye to those guys, let\u2019s point out the obvious. He has played better. This eight-game run has been comparable in New England\u2019s history only to Brady. Is Maye ready to entrench himself as one of the NFL\u2019s elite QBs? It helps that the Patriots\u2019 schedule in the second half of the season looks just as easy as the first. Love was not satisfied dinking and dunking in a duel against his former mentor, Aaron Rodgers. Particularly not when the Packers fell behind. Love started the game happy to take what the defense gave him. But there were moments where he pressed. Yes, that sounds totally wild when studying his statistics: 78.4 completion percentage, 360 passing yards, three touchdowns. The thing about those moments \u2014 where he took a risk that his coach wouldn\u2019t have advised \u2014 was that he and his teammates converted them. And the Packers probably wouldn\u2019t have won without these plays. In the third quarter, Love and the Packers trailed by nine points and the quarterback took a major risk from his own red zone, heaving the ball downfield to Tucker Kraft \u2026 on a prayer. Kraft fought for the ball and turned the play into a conversion and a 59-yard explosive gain. Coaches have told me about the \"NONONONONONO\u2014YES!\" throws that Love can make. This was one of them.\u00a0 It started as a terrible idea. And then it finished as the best play of the game. It was also yet another example of\u00a0Love\u2019s now-patented fadeaway jumper. Later in the game on third-and-7, Love alerted pre-snap to Christian Watson (probably seeing single-high safety coverage) and the Packers QB wanted Watson the whole way, rolling right until he finally zipped the ball downfield for a 33-yard gain (that was, frankly, in danger of getting picked off by that single-high safety).\u00a0 Ultimately, Love layered the pass to perfection. It was yet another outstanding week for Love, who turned big risks into big rewards. He did all that in a high-stakes game against Rodgers. With A-Rod watching from the opposite sideline, Love admitted afterward that there was an \"added level of pressure.\"\u00a0 But the young QB stepped up in many of the ways his Packers predecessors Rodgers and Brett Favre once did. His guys weren\u2019t open \u2014 not like they have been. The Denver defense made CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens work much harder than any other team this year. And in turn, Prescott\u2019s day looked ugly. There were spurts of strong play from the Cowboys, where they\u2019d string together a nice drive. But Prescott had interceptions at the end of the second quarter and at the beginning of the fourth quarter that were whiffs on potentially scoring drives. The Broncos, meanwhile, were simply outpacing the Cowboys on the other side of the ball. It served as a reminder to Dallas. If the Cowboys are going to win games, Prescott is going to have to be perfect. His receivers are going to have to be the best tandem in the NFL. Because it\u2019s a slippery slope for the Cowboys and Prescott. Prescott will spend the whole season trying to win in a shootout \u2014 and searching for the line between pressing and generating explosive plays. He couldn\u2019t quite find it against one of the league\u2019s best defenses in Denver. It might be a delight to watch the Colts' offense, but it\u2019s not as much fun to watch Daniel Jones. I don\u2019t mean that as a dig. Or maybe I do. But Indy's special sauce is the way the skill players complement one other perfectly to do what they\u2019re best at. Jones just needs to stand in the pocket and deliver the football. He\u2019s doing that job admirably. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to see Jones do something special \u2014 or make a throw that is specific to skill set. But in this offense and with these skill players, Jones can simply put the ball near the frame of Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce, Tyler Warren \u2026 or any of the other pass-catchers. They\u2019ll do the rest. In turn, Jones is playing quarterback at a high level without having to do a whole lot. And if you looked at his passing chart without knowing it was him, you\u2019d have a mighty hard time understanding how Jones got to 272 passing yards versus the Titans. The truth is that Jones' receivers had 126 yards after the catch. And the pass-catchers had countless circus catches downfield, including Pittman\u2019s incredible one-hander. Stroud had the type of performance that I thought he\u2019d build his career around. On one hand, it\u2019s great to see this version of Stroud. On the other hand, I can\u2019t help but wonder why he can\u2019t play like this more often. Regardless, this week, he seemed to have all the answers to the 49ers' defense. San Francisco blitzed on 33.3% of Stroud\u2019s dropbacks. The 49ers pressured the Texans QB nine times. And yet he took zero sacks by taking only 2.69 seconds to throw. He finished 30 of 39 for 318 yards and two touchdowns with an interception \u2014 the turnover (an overthrow deep near the sideline to end the first half) being his lone error from the game.\u00a0 My favorite throw was a third-quarter touchdown that proved to be the deciding score. The 49ers brought six rushers. With the pocket collapsing, Stroud found receiver Xavier Hutchinson streaking over the middle. Stroud placed the ball so Hutchinson didn\u2019t have to break stride on his way into the end zone \u2014 untouched. Stroud played with immense poise (knowing where to get the ball despite the rush) and discipline (taking the short, quick passes that the defense was giving him). The game always looked like it was within Stroud\u2019s control.\u00a0 It was a delight to watch. I just wish it wasn\u2019t such a rare treat. On this particular Sunday, the Giants were simply no match for the Eagles. Dart didn\u2019t stand a chance. He gave his pass-catchers several opportunities to make big plays, which they couldn\u2019t convert. Notably, tight end Theo Johnson dropped a target on third-and-six that could\u2019ve gone for 20 yards and put the Giants into the red zone. Dart also tried a deep heave to Darius Slayton on third-and-16 that the two nearly connected on, but Slayton couldn't quite corral the ball. That\u2019s the trouble with evaluating Dart. He doesn\u2019t have any playmakers following the injuries to Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo. And at this point in Dart\u2019s young NFL career, he\u2019s not equipped to make many big plays himself. Though there was an exception (in garbage time) when he eluded pass-rushers and peeled out to his left to hit Wandale Robinson for 34 yards. It was Dart\u2019s best play of the day. Dart\u2019s biggest weakness is that he takes sacks (rather than interceptions and fumbles). The Eagles got to him five different times on Sunday. But even while taking those losses, Dart rarely makes things worse for his offense with turnovers. He threw the ball away when he could and scrambled for short gains. That\u2019s probably how the year will go for him \u2014 he\u2019ll spend the year avoiding as many catastrophes as he can. It\u2019s on the Giants to surround him with better players to see what more Dart can do. But the sad reality is that might not happen until 2026. The Commanders are one of 12 teams to already start a different QB from their Week 1 option.

Your phone dies at the worst moments. Your laptop battery gives up mid-presentation. Power outages leave you sitting in the dark scrolling through a phone at 5% battery. Generic power banks help a little but they barely charge your phone twice before needing a recharge themselves. The Anker PowerCore Reserve changes the game with 60,000mAh of capacity that can charge an iPhone 17 over ten times. Amazon just dropped this powerhouse to $79, down from $149, hitting an all-time low price that costs barely more than a no-name 10,000mAh power bank. See at Amazon The power bank uses LiFePO4 battery types. Although it may sound complicated, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually very important: In normal Li-ion batteries used by those cheap power banks that last only a year at most, the charging cycle ends at 500 to 1,000 cycles. The power bank from Anker uses 3,000 cycles: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three thousand charging cycles or complete discharge cycles before the battery\u2019s capacity reaches 80%. That\u2019s around a decade of normal life. The true advantage of LiFePO4 over a standard lithium ion battery is more than endurance: This form of battery prevents thermal runaway. In technical terms, LiFePO4 prevents overheating of a battery that eventually leads to it exploding in a fire. The high temperature tolerability of LiFePO4 ranges from \u00e2\u0080\u00934\u00c2\u00b0F to 140\u00c2\u00b0F which makes it ideal for winter camping or summer road travel. The 192Wh battery capacity translates to 60,000mAh with a cell voltage of 3.2V. The battery provides enough power to charge a MacBook Air 2.9 times or power an LED light of 3 watts for 42.3 hours. The LED power duration comes in handy during prolonged power outages of several days when you may require constant illumination without having to recharge smartphones. The power bank comes with four charging ports: These include two charging sockets of 27W and 60W through the USB C charging sockets. The XT60 input port supports the connection of solar panels with a capacity of up to 60W: The Anker power station can now become a sustainable off-grid power solution (the solar panels are not included). The power station takes around four hours to recharge with a 60W USB C wall charger. The digital smart display takes over the face of the front panel and comes with information such as battery life, input power level, output power level, and estimated remaining life. This provides real-time data that helps you determine perfectly the amount of power being used and the remaining life based on current power levels. No need to guess whether you\u2019ll have enough power to last the night. The device measures 4.59 inches wide, 4.59 inches deep, and 8.17 inches high: That\u2019s comparable in size to a large water bottle. Weighing 5.1 pounds makes it heavy enough to be substantial but light enough to throw into a backpack or emergency kit.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is anticipated to announce its earnings on Thursday, October 30, 2025. Revenues are predicted to approximate $1.2 billion, reflecting a 13% increase year over year, according to consensus estimates, while earnings are expected to be about $0.09 per share. This growth is likely fueled by robust performance in Roku\u2019s platform operations, especially in its advertising division, which has been gradually expanding. Throughout the last two years, Roku has enhanced its integrations with third-party partners and demand-side platforms (DSPs) to more effectively meet the needs of enterprise advertisers, while the introduction of Roku Ads Manager has attracted small and mid-sized businesses. Furthermore, Roku\u2019s acquisition of Frndly, a subscription-based streaming service, in May 2025, is also anticipated to contribute to growth. The company currently boasts a market capitalization of $14 billion. In the past twelve months, revenue was $4.4 billion, and the company posted operational losses amounting to $-156 million alongside a net income of $-62 million. While much will hinge on how the results compare with consensus and expectations, gaining insights from historical patterns could favor event-driven traders. There are two approaches to accomplish this: grasp the historical odds and arrange your position ahead of the earnings announcement, or examine the relationship between immediate and medium-term returns following earnings and adjust your position after the earnings are announced. With that in mind, if you are looking for potential gains with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative \u2013 it has surpassed the S&P 500 and yielded returns greater than 105% since its inception. View the earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data on the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are compiled along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk strategy (though potentially ineffective if the correlation is weak) involves analyzing the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying the pair with the highest correlation, and executing the relevant trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader could take a \"long\" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is favorable. Below is some correlation data based on a five-year and a more recent three-year history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D signifies the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the subsequent 5D returns. Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a compilation of all three: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), delivering considerable returns for investors. Alternatively, if you\u2019re seeking upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like Roku, take a look at the High Quality portfolio, which has exceeded the S&P and achieved returns of over 105% since its inception.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Thursday, October 30, 2025. Revenue is projected to increase by approximately 16% year-over-year to reach $8.54 billion, according to consensus estimates, while earnings are expected to grow 11% to $4.32 per share. Revenue growth is likely to be driven by ongoing increases in gross dollar volume (GDV) \u2013 an essential metric of total spending across the Mastercard network \u2014 as global consumer expenditure remains robust. Additionally, cross-border volume is anticipated to remain strong, supported by a continued recovery in international travel and tourism, especially in Europe and Asia. Furthermore, Mastercard\u2019s growing array of value-added services, including data analytics, cybersecurity, and fraud prevention, is expected to contribute to some revenue growth beyond core transaction fees. The company currently has a market capitalization of $500 billion. Over the past twelve months, it has generated revenue of $30 billion and has remained operationally profitable, with $18 billion in operating profits and a net income of $14 billion. While the outcome heavily relies on how the results compare to consensus expectations, recognizing historical trends may give event-driven traders an edge. There are two methods to achieve this: either by analyzing historical probabilities and positioning oneself before the earnings report is announced, or by studying the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns following the earnings release, and adjusting strategies accordingly afterward. That being said, if you're looking for upside with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative \u2014 having surpassed the S&P 500 and yielding returns exceeding 105% since its creation.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"Apple hit a company milestone on Tuesday as its valuation reached $4 trillion for the first time. However, unlike previous trillion dollar milestones, Apple isn\u2019t the first company to reach this record valuation. Despite being the first company to hit $1 trillion in 2018, $2 trillion in 2020, and $3 trillion in 2022, Apple is third to reach $4 trillion after Nvidia and Microsoft. Nvidia surpassed $4 trillion in July, as the AI explosion continues to rely on the company\u2019s GPU hardware. Microsoft also hit $4 trillion for the first time in July before touching $4 trillion again today For Apple\u2019s part, it has a strong iPhone 17 hardware launch to thank for the timing of its $4 trillion milestone. The company is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, which will include iPhone 17 launch week data, although Apple doesn\u2019t break out unit sales. Still, we\u2019ll see quarterly iPhone revenue as an indicator of how iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 launch results compare. Apple hasn\u2019t yet closed with a $4 trillion valuation. After briefly touching the milestone, the stock price dipped back to the top of the $3 trillion range. While an arbitrary market capitalization number makes no material difference, these trillion dollar milestones do serve a few functions. First, they\u2019re clear indicators to investors that Apple has remained a growth company despite naysayers. Second, they provide context for competitive standing. Nvidia and Microsoft may have surged to $4 trillion before Apple thanks to the AI boom, but Apple\u2019s hardware and services businesses prove to be sustainable outside of whatever happens in AI world. Finally, the symbolism of the milestone shows that Apple continues to be an elite company among its peers. Even if it\u2019s not first, it\u2019s consistent.

Tesla's latest pitch to investors over Elon Musk's pay package gets straight to the point. The automaker's approach has gone from a focus on long-term growth and \"fairness\" to more explicitly addressing fears of losing him as CEO. In a letter to investors on Monday, Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, said passing his $1 trillion compensation plan was critical to Tesla becoming the most valuable company in the world \u2014 and to keeping him in the top job. Failing to create an environment that would motivate Musk with sufficient pay, Denholm said, could mean the company would lose his \"time, talent and vision.\" Those have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns, Denholm wrote. In 2018, the board persuaded investors to approve a 10-year compensation plan for Musk worth some $55 billion. It was then struck down by a Delaware judge in 2024. Tesla shareholders later voted to again approve the package, though a judge also rejected that effort, saying that Tesla's board was too beholden to Musk. That led Tesla to craft a new proposal. In 2025, the board's messaging has been more urgent. Here's how the approach has evolved: The board has long said it wanted to ensure Musk had sufficient incentive: \"Elon's compensation will be 100% aligned with the interests of our stockholders,\" the company wrote in 2018. Tesla said at the time that Musk's prior pay package had been \"instrumental\" in helping the company achieve its goals \u2014 and would be again. As with the latest proposal, some proxy firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, opposed the earlier pay package. After a judge tossed out Musk's 2018 pay package and Tesla decided to ask shareholders to vote again on it in an attempt to \"ratify\" the plan, Tesla leaned into language around fairness. In the lead-up to the 2024 re-vote, Tesla argued that honoring the original deal was a matter of fairness and \"upholding our end of the bargain.\" \"He delivered on his end of the bargain,\" Tesla wrote in a June 2024 proxy filing. \"It's time for us to deliver on ours.\" \"Fairness and respect require that we honor the collective commitment we made to Elon \u2014 a commitment that was, and fundamentally still is, about retaining Elon's attention and motivating him to focus on achieving astonishing growth for our company,\" Denholm wrote in a letter to investors that same month. She also began to allude to a line of messaging that Tesla would double down on in 2025: that Musk had other companies where he could build his vision. \"What we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\" Denholm wrote in a mid-2024 letter to shareholders. \"Nor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world,\" Denholm wrote. \"We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\" Denholm warned in her latest letter that, \"without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value.\" Such an outcome, she said, risked making it \"just another car company\" that would give up what it said is its edge in robotics. She described Musk's interest in voting power, describing \"meaningful voting influence\" as what he \"values most.\" To drive home that idea, unlike the 2018 stock options, which didn't give Musk voting power until they were exercised, the latest proposal involves shares, not options, said Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. The latest proposal includes an agreement that would allow Musk to vote with earned shares before they vest, Schloetzer said in a text to Business Insider. He said the additional feature would help Musk reach and maintain an \"influential ownership vote\" more quickly. Like the earlier package, the latest proposal contains significant pay-for-performance measures, Schloetzer said. The latest appeal to shareholders, in particular, appears designed to address concerns about its size by linking compensation to specific targets, Anat Alon-Beck, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told Business Insider. \"It's very sophisticated,\" she said. \"They're trying to make sure that when he does get paid in the future, they can really show that he's meeting these milestones.\" Tesla has been pushing to win shareholder approval for the package despite opposition from institutional investors and proxy firms. Tesla has taken out ads and put a countdown on its website, and Musk took time on the most recent earnings call to pitch it. In 2025, the underlying questions and concerns that existed in 2018 around the board's independence from Musk remain, said Schloetzer. Also in question, he said, is the board's \"willingness and ability to effectively monitor and control\" the management team. Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson wrote in a September letter to shareholders that the company's corporate governance framework allows the board to listen to shareholders' will. The company didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on the board's ability to act independently. In some ways, the proposals in 2018 and 2025 are similar in their ambition, Dorothy Lund, a Columbia law professor, told Business Insider. Then, as now, she said, many people were skeptical that he could achieve such major milestones. But shareholders have seen big gains. This time, Lund said, \"He's got to do a lot of pyrotechnics to get this company to where he earns that comp.\"    Jump to","label":0}

The world of sneaker drops can be a tricky place to navigate, but we\u2019re here to help. Behold, the best of the best of what's arriving on shop floors this week.  This week\u2019s selection sees new chapters arrive for long-established collaborations \u2014 New Balance x Auralee and adidas x Wales Bonner \u2014 as well as the debut of Palace's biggest collaboration ever.   The cream of the sneaker crop awaits you. What are you waiting for?  Release Date: October 31 Editor's Notes: \u201cIt had to be this big and this grand and this ambitious,\u201d Gareth Skewis, Palace's co-founder and CEO, told Highsnobiety ahead of the launch of its first Nike collaboration. \u201cWhen you've got the opportunity to do something like this, you gotta go for it. There are no half measures.\u201d The Nike x Palace Total 90 III sneaker, an early-2000s football sneaker now sporting Palace branding, is only one small part of the collaboration. Wayne Rooney cameos, community centers, and shape-shifting skate parks are also involved in this debut link-up.  Release Date: Available now Editor's Notes: San San Gear, a Seoul-based technical fashion label, has transformed the spiky-soled PUMA Mostro into something more stealthy. The techy dark-colored shoe looks like something from a 2000s spy film.  Release Date: October 31 Editor's Notes: AURALEE reimagines New Balance's classic court shoe, the CT500. And, as with all of the duo's creations, it's defined by a beautiful color palette. Release Date: October 30 Editor's Notes: The new Nike Shox MR4 sneaker is, essentially, a high heel that doubles up as a highly cushioned sneaker. The spring-loaded pillars that give Nike Shox their bounce are dramatically raised and only placed at the back of the shoe, making for a tall stiletto-like shape. Release Date: October 31 Editor's Notes:  Wales Bonner and adidas have been at it for five years, reshaping classic sneakers through elevated materials and madcap patterning. But this latest reinterpretation of the adidas Japan is on the more subdued side.  A lavender suede body, accented with deep burgundy leather detailing and ornamental stitching, makes for a quietly luxurious finish. Release Date: October 28 Editor's Notes: Italian mountaineering heritage meets a new-school Norwegian outdoor fashion brand. The fourth collaboration between Diemme and Hiking Patrol centers on the Roccia Vet boot, handcrafted in Montebelluna, northern Italy, using wool sourced from New Zealand and Great Britain. Warm and endlessly durable for any adventure, yet fabulously textured.  Release Date: October 30 Editor's Notes: These Crocs trail shoes come with ornamental metal details reminiscent of blooming flowers. It's an unorthodox way to dress up a trail sneaker, but it's also classic Simone Rocha.  Want to keep browsing?

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByKevin Rozario, Contributor. WHSmith is hoping to drive up sales in North America by making some of its stores a destination for higher-end sunglasses, an expanding but highly competitive fashion accessories category, that is new to the retailer.  The North America division of the UK-listed retailer\u2014now a pure-play travel retailer following divestments\u2014has forge a strategic partnership with Solstice Sunglasses to integrate premium eyewear into a selection of WHSmith locations across North America. The company hopes to lift average transaction values (ATVs).  The first Solstice shop-in-shop appeared at The Arts District Market store at San Diego Airport at the end of September, marking the first of 20 shop-in-shops planned to open through the end of 2026. The retailer\u2014which has more than 340 specialty retail stores across the continent\u2014said: \u201cThe rollout will extend across both resort and airport markets including key airports such as Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), Albuquerque (ABQ) in New Mexico.\u201d While Solstice describes itself as \u201ca luxury destination\u201d that is mainly online, the lines coming to WHSmith are not expected to include many top-end names like Cartier, Celine, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, or Loewe, in its portfolio. Nevertheless, confirmed designer sunglasses brands that will appear include Gucci, Ray-Ban, Maui Jim, and Michael Kors through the placement of branded Solstice Sunglasses displays.  For WHSmith, a specialty retailer in the airport marketplace that is best known for its convenience offering with accessible pricing, tapping into prestige sunglasses might be a gamble. The group has diversified in recent years and also includes Marshall Retail Group; InMotion tech stores\u2014a new one is coming to John F. Kennedy Airport T5 in mid-November; and it is creating blended retail offers as seen at London Heathrow,  Certainly the eyewear move, if successful, could improve margins given the upscale brands coming in. This would help to recoup some of the overstated profits WHSmith had to revise back due to a financial reporting error. The mistake has cost dearly in terms of the company\u2019s stock value. WHSmith North America\u2019s chief development officer, Roderick McOwen, described Solstice as a \u201ctrusted authorized reseller\u201d that would \u201cmeet a growing demand for luxury goods in travel retail\u201d and elevate the WHSmith offer. For Solstice Sunglasses, travel retail also opens up potential new opportunities. CEO Mikey Rosenberg, said: \u201cWe\u2019re bringing authenticated luxury eyewear to high-conversion travel environments where customers actively seek quality products.\u201d However, high conversion is not currently being seen in travel retail, especially not in North American airports. In a new report, management consultancy Kearney noted: \u201cOverall, U.S. travelers consistently rank among the lowest converters and spend-per-passenger in duty-free zones remains modest, especially when compared with European and Middle East hubs.\u201d  Moreover, travel retail has stalled in North America due to weak demand. Both Avolta, whose Q3 results are out this Thursday, and Lagard\u00e8re Travel Retail saw flat sales in North America in the first half. In Q3, Lagard\u00e8re saw North American revenue grow by just 3% (below the company\u2019s Q3 average of 5%), while South America soared by 35%, helped by a recovery in tourist traffic and new stores.  For sure, the sunglasses market per se remains buoyant. Revenue at EssilorLuxottica, the largest eyewear company in the world, climbed 11.7% in Q3. The owner of the Sunglass Hut retail chain with stores in airports, reported above average growth of 12.1% in North America, driven by both its Professional Solutions and Direct-to-Consumer segments.  This EssilorLuxottica numbers indicate that WHSmith is looking in the right general direction, but that the travel retail channel itself might prove challenging. The company will reveal its preliminary results on November 12. ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock has risen by 62.8% over the course of 21 trading days. The gains are driven in part by the company\u2019s major deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, to supply tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing capacity over the next five years.  However, the stock now appears expensive, leading to the question \u2013 what is the risk? Could it decline sharply? Consider the following information: While we prefer to take advantage of momentum if the fundamentals are solid \u2013 for AMD, see Buy or Sell AMD Stock \u2013 we remain cautious about potential bull traps. Particularly, it is important to consider if the situation worsens, and AMD falls 20-30% to approximately $182, will we be able to retain our shares? What could the worst-case scenario be? We refer to this concept as downturn resilience. Interestingly, the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during different economic downturns. Our evaluation is based on (a) the extent of the stock's decline and (b) the speed of its recovery. Investing in a single stock can be risky; however, there is significant value in a wider, diversified strategy. Strategic asset allocation and diversification facilitate ongoing investment. Did you know that investors who panicked and exited the S&P in 2020 missed out on significant subsequent gains? Trefis High Quality Portfolio and Empirical Asset Management\u2019s asset allocation strategy are developed to mitigate volatility, allowing you to stay the course. Below are the specifics; however, as a brief background: AMD develops x86 microprocessors, accelerated processing units, chipsets, discrete and integrated GPUs, data center and professional GPUs, as well as development services across computing, graphics, enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom sectors. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 Covid Pandemic 2018 Correction 2008 Global Financial Crisis It is essential to keep in mind how low AMD might drop during a downturn. Furthermore, you should examine the stock\u2019s performance in comparison to the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises a selection of 30 stocks, demonstrating a record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all three indices \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. What is the reason? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; presenting less of a volatile experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"        David Folkenflik                        Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, shown above next to his wife, Lauren Sanchez, and other digital titans, at the inauguration of President Trump in January, has written: \"When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The Post.\" The Post has published several recent editorials that did not disclose they focused on matters in which Bezos had an interest.                                                           Pool\/Getty Images\/Getty Images North America                                       hide caption  A year ago, in explaining why he had blocked the publication of an endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Washington Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos conceded that \"When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The Post.\" On at least three occasions in the past two weeks, an official Post editorial has taken on matters in which Bezos has a financial or corporate interest without noting his stake. In each case, the Post's official editorial line landed in sync with its owner's financial interests. In the most recent instance, the Post defended President Trump's jaw-dropping moves to raze the East Wing of the White House without any of the typically required studies or consultations as he seeks to build a vast ballroom. \"Trump's undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere,\" the Post wrote in its editorial, which first appeared online Saturday. As the White House had announced, Amazon was a major corporate contributor in helping to defray those costs. But the Post did not initially disclose that. On Sunday, the newspaper inserted an acknowledgement of the Amazon donation into the editorial \u2013 but only once the veteran news executive Bill Grueskin, now at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, noted its absence in a social media post and made inquiries at the paper. It did not flag the alteration for readers. In his posts, Grueskin, a former top news editor at the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, had written the editorial's fundamental reasoning \"illustrates the collapse of the new Washpost Opinion page\" and noted there was \"no clarification or correction appended to the piece.\" The Post and its new opinions editor, Adam O'Neal, did not reply to detailed requests for comment for this story. O'Neal was brought in by Bezos this summer after the corporate titan tore up his paper's opinion section. Bezos said he wanted a tight focus on two priorities: personal liberties and free markets. The top opinion page editor resigned. A raft of prominent columnists and contributors resigned or departed as well. Some were let go. The decision to cancel the Harris editorial led to more than 300,000 cancellations by digital subscribers. The subsequent changes in the editorial pages led to 75,000 more. Bezos' Amazon contributed $1 million toward the Trump inauguration; its video streaming service Amazon Prime paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported she is to receive the lion's share of that fee. For the newspaper's owner to have outside business holdings or activities that might intersect with coverage or commentary is conventionally seen to present at the least a perception of a conflict of interest. Newspapers typically manage the perception with transparency. The Post has resolutely revealed such entanglements to readers of news coverage or commentary in the past, whether the Graham family's holdings, which included the Stanley Kaplan educational company and Slate magazine, or, since 2013, those of Bezos, who founded Amazon and Blue Origin. Even now, the newspaper's reporters do so as a matter of routine. \"Believing very fervently that disclosure resolved a lot of concerns, we never knowingly failed to disclose\" such conflicts, Ruth Marcus, a former deputy editorial page editor at the Washington Post, tells NPR. Marcus resigned earlier this year, saying Publisher Will Lewis had killed a column she wrote on changes in the page's direction. She wrote in her resignation letter that Bezos' edict that the page would not include opposing viewpoints \"threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable.\" Two separate but recent incidents suggest the lack of disclosure on the editorial about the White House renovations was not an isolated case. On Oct. 15, the Post heralded the military's push for a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors. \"No 'microreactor' currently operates in the United States, but it's a worthy gamble that could provide benefits far beyond its military applications,\" the Post wrote in its editorial. A year ago, Amazon bought a stake in X-energy to develop small nuclear reactors to power its data centers. And through his own private investment fund, Bezos has a stake in a Canadian venture seeking nuclear fusion technology. Three days after the nuclear power editorial, the Post weighed in on the need for local authorities in Washington, D.C., to speed the approval of the use of self-driving cars in the nation's capital. The editorial was headlined: \"Why D.C. is stalling on self-driving cars: Safety is a phony excuse for slamming the brakes on autonomous vehicles.\" Fewer than three weeks before, the Amazon-owned autonomous car company Zoox had announced D.C. was to be its next market. \"It strikes me that the failure to do this [disclosure] is concerning \u2013 whether out of negligence or worse,\" says Marcus, the former deputy editorial page editor. \"I think telling your readers that there might be a conflict in whatever they're reading is always important. It's a lot more important when it involves whoever the owner is.\" In explaining his decision on the Harris editorial, which foreshadowed the more sweeping changes in the paper's opinion section, Bezos wrote, \"I once wrote that The Post is a 'complexifier' for me. It is, but it turns out I'm also a complexifier for The Post.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-28","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Mohawk Industries stock (NYSE: MHK) has declined by 7% over the last five days, whereas the S&P 500 increased by 1.2%, following another challenging yet slowly improving quarter. The news stories highlighted weak volumes and margin pressures, but behind the scenes, various operational insights demonstrate how the flooring leader is repositioning for a recovery led by the housing sector. Below, we outline the significant points that you may have missed in Mohawk\u2019s Q3 2025. However, if you seek upward potential with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly exceeded its benchmark\u2014a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its creation. What is responsible for this? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have produced superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, avoiding major fluctuations, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at \u2013 Google Stock To $300? Mohawk is refining its operational strategy. The company reiterated its $110 million annual productivity and restructuring savings goal, while incurring $30.7 million in one-time restructuring expenses this quarter to facilitate those improvements. The outcome is evident in the numbers: free cash flow soared to $310 million in Q3, showcasing enhanced working-capital management and inventory oversight. With manageable debt levels and share repurchases back on the agenda, Mohawk\u2019s financial flexibility appears more robust than its income statement might indicate. Management continues to highlight its luxury-vinyl-tile (LVT) plants on the East and West Coasts, which decrease reliance on imports and shorten delivery times. In an industry where product trends evolve rapidly, this local capacity could become a subtle yet sustainable margin driver. At the same time, projects in education and hospitality have bolstered demand for commercial flooring\u2014helping to balance weaker residential sales and supporting pricing discipline across various categories. Mohawk\u2019s operational procedures are becoming more transparent and disciplined. The company even revealed a $10.8 million sales adjustment related to shipping-day fluctuations, thereby allowing investors to better adjust for quarterly discrepancies. This kind of transparency, along with consistent cost strategies, suggests a company that is regaining control over its cycle, rather than merely responding to it. Mohawk\u2019s Q3 was not about explosive growth\u2014it was centered on tightening performance. A steady backlog, disciplined cash flow, and a clearer cost strategy suggest that the bottom of this cycle might already be behind us. If housing and remodeling activities increase in 2026, Mohawk\u2019s operational foundation could yield benefits sooner than the consensus anticipates. You may wish to consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide strong returns for investors. What is responsible for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible strategy to leverage favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets downturn, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":0}

In her 103 years on the planet, my grandmother has accumulated plenty of wisdom, but she keeps most of it to herself. If I were in my 10th decade of life, I'd be holding court constantly, dispensing advice to anyone who would listen. But my hunch is that my grandmother, whom my extended Southern family affectionately calls Mema, doesn't want to be presumptuous. (Apparently, humility isn't genetic.) Every so often, though, she'll share an insight so unexpected \u2014 and so on point \u2014 that it shifts something inside you, edging you closer to the version of yourself you want to be. I still think back to one thing she told me over a decade ago that changed the course of my life for the better. I moved to Washington, DC, right after college, and the city quickly burrowed into my heart with its 19th-century buildings, passionate people, and intellectual hum. Though I loved DC, I left after a few years to get a master's degree in journalism in New York City and later landed a reporting fellowship in South Africa. Then, the 2008 financial crisis struck, which seemed to just put an already struggling journalism market on life support. Jobless, I moved back to my hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana, to live with my parents and eventually found work at the city's local newspaper. I was gaining valuable reporting experience, building up my savings, and spending time with friends who gave me some of the funniest (and booziest) nights of my life \u2014 but I still felt stuck. Fort Wayne was a good place, but it wasn't my place. That title still belonged to Washington, DC. After four seemingly endless Midwest winters and countless cover letters aimed mostly at jobs in the capital, I got an idea: What if I quit my job and moved back with nothing lined up? When I floated the plan to my parents, they were skeptical. I was torn. Then one day, driving home from an interview with a prominent newspaper in Chicago, I called the last person I wanted to run the idea by: Mema. My grandmother has lived the kind of life I hope for \u2014 long, purposeful, and joyful \u2014 so seeking her advice seemed natural. A Cajun woman of understated elegance, Mema lives independently in a spotless Texas home filled with mementos from her travels, family photos, and her own paintings. She's lived through the Great Depression, World War II, 9\/11, a painful divorce, and the deaths of far too many loved ones. And yet, she rises each day to weed her garden, feed the squirrels, fire off a few emails, and get something brewing in the kitchen. She's on Facebook, learning French on Duolingo, and still refining her painting skills. When she answered the phone, I gave her the scoop: I'd just had a promising interview at a paper I admired, but I wasn't sure I wanted it. Maybe it was finally time to make the 600-mile leap back to D.C. I paused, nervous for her verdict. What had all those years taught her about balancing risk and reward, about stability's tug-of-war with yearning? \"Sounds like a great idea,\" she said, almost giddily, in her barely Southern, old-world lilt. \"Do what makes you happy.\" After those 10 words, I knew what to do. The scales tilted toward possibility, and a month later, I packed up my belongings, said teary goodbyes to friends, and set out on a road trip back to Washington. I moved into an apartment with a close friend from graduate school, quickly landed a journalism job I was excited about, and eased back into the city's familiar, soothing rhythms. Fifteen years later, I'm still here. I followed the listen-to-your-heart ethos, married an Argentine teacher, and stayed in the journalism industry. (We're not rich, and the industry is far from stable, but I am happy.) DC remains a center of gravity, but I have others now, too \u2014 including two (mostly) lovely kids. If my children have children, and I'm lucky enough to know them, I hope they'll seek me out when they're wrestling with a big decision. Whether by phone, hologram, or whatever they'll invent next, I'll tell them to trust their intuition, just as a wise woman once told me.          Jump to","label":0}

Chris Lewis has been trying to time the market on candy prices. The 36-year-old father of two in Florida has been biding his time, waiting for discounts and buy-one-get-one deals \u2014 but lower prices never came. \"It's just more bulk candy that we're buying, so we're getting bigger bags so that we can get a better deal versus the smaller ones,\" Lewis said. This year, families have added a candy-buying strategy to their Halloween challenges, in addition to trying to snag \"KPop Demon Hunters\" costumes. Bureau of Labor Statistics data up to September showed that prices for candy and gum have skyrocketed thanks to tariffs and climate events, increasing much faster than overall prices. Still, like overall inflation, the candy price spike doesn't seem to be deterring shoppers too much. Lewis, for example, is snagging whatever treats he can get. \"We've also got pretzels; we're throwing in kind of whatever we can find,\" he said. \"Whatever the deal is is what we're grabbing at this point.\" Groundwork Collaborative and The Century Foundation, using data from NielsenIQ, found that Hershey variety packs rose 22%, Hershey Peanut Butter Cup packs rose 8%, and Tootsie Roll lollipops rose about 34% between fall 2024 and 2025. Tariffs and weather are culprits. \"Whether it's cane sugar, whether it's cocoa, all of that has to get imported, and all of that's being affected by the tariffs,\" Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst, told CBS News. Lempert also said cocoa production has fallen in West Africa because of droughts and windstorms. A National Retail Federation survey of over 8,000 consumers, conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics in September, found that most were planning to buy candy and decorations. This could be a record year for Halloween spending, reaching $13.1 billion, and candy spending is expected to be $3.9 billion. We've been seeing this story economy-wide. The US consumer has still been spending despite persistently elevated inflation. Consumer spending rose 0.6% in August. For a first-timer like 25-year-old Kaleigh Merriweather, the price of Halloween candy was jarring when she went shopping this year. Typically, her parents are the ones who buy candy, but she has her own place to consider now, she told Business Insider. \"The increase definitely influenced the amount I want to spend,\" Merriweather said. \"I thought I'd be spending $30 at maximum, but it's closer to $50 for two large variety bags.\" It didn't deter her from spending the money, however. Merriweather said she did pay attention to how certain candy was priced. She bought less chocolate than she expected, and was \"disappointed\" to miss out on her favorite part of the candy bowl. Merriweather said that paying more for Halloween candy is still a must. It's for the kids, she said. Her only hope is that they enjoy their gummies as much as they would a Kit Kat. \"You have to pass out at least some candy. It's not the kids' fault that it's more expensive,\" Merriweather told Business Insider. For at least one family in North Dakota, the larger economic picture is changing Halloween this year. Chris Eschbach, a 42-year-old father of two, is planning to forgo candy. His family is thinking about those hit by the pause in food benefits due to the government shutdown. \"My wife had mentioned to me with the SNAP benefits ending and people being hungry and the economy being bad, what if we just hand out food?\" Eschbach said. They're thinking of handing out things like ramen, granola bars, and Hamburger Helper. \"I would much rather \u2014 not to take the fun away from the kids \u2014 but much rather do that knowing someone might get food that may go hungry than to just do some wasteful spending,\" Eschbach said.

I'd always wanted to explore Alaska, but not from a cruise ship. Although hundreds of thousands of people embark on Alaskan cruises each year, I wanted to connect with locals and see more than just popular port stops. When my cousin moved to Anchorage, visiting him gave me the perfect excuse to do all of those things and explore the massive state on my own terms. So, we spent a week in late June traveling through Alaska in his converted school bus, far from the tourist crowds. The trip was a great reminder of just how valuable it can be to stay flexible and connect with locals whenever you travel. My cousin suggested spending time around Homer, a small city on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, about four hours from Anchorage. He knew a local kayaking guide who lived in the area, and she invited us to a beach bonfire on our first night. Since it was the summer solstice, the sun blazed bright at midnight. We spent the night listening to stories from year-round Alaska residents and seasonal guides. I felt like a local rather than a tourist. These conversations proved invaluable throughout the week, opening doors to experiences typical tourists couldn't access. Later, we hiked the hills overlooking the peninsula at 1 a.m., a surreal and unforgettable experience in broad daylight. The only thing my cousin and I had booked in advance was a helicopter tour to remote islands for bear viewing, my ultimate Alaska bucket-list experience. On the morning of the tour, we received a call that it had been canceled \u2014 the weather had grounded all flights. We sat silently in the bus, both a bit gutted. I wasn't angry, as no one can control the weather, but the disappointment hit hard after months of anticipation. That's when my cousin suggested calling the local guide from the bonfire to see if we could still make something of the day. She and several other guides had the day off and offered an alternate plan: They could take us hiking to Grewingk Glacier Lake. What started as the worst day of our trip soon became one of our best adventures. After a 30-minute boat ride and a 45-minute hike carrying inflatable kayaks, we reached the pristine lake. Paddling among massive blue icebergs made the tough hike worthwhile. Ice chunks cracked loudly around us, creating a beautiful but slightly unnerving sound. Even the boat ride revealed hidden treasures as we detoured to what appeared to be an abandoned vessel floating in the water. When we pulled up, we discovered coolers full of fresh oysters and mussels, complete with a price list and a cash jar. It was a floating seafood market that ran on an honor system. Without our local guides, we would never have known about this gem. Since we were traveling by bus, we were able to venture off standard routes and follow tips and recommendations from our new friends. Throughout the trip, we'd pull off the main road onto dusty gravel paths leading to quiet lakes and empty beaches with secluded camping spots far from tourist-heavy trails. One evening, we parked beside a small lake and watched eagles swoop down, diving for fish. As an Australian, I'd never seen eagles in nature before and was captivated. It was better entertainment than any cruise ship could offer. Another unexpected highlight came through our new friendships. One of the guides from our glacier adventure mentioned his mother owned a house in the scenic town of Seward and, since she was away, invited us to stay there. After a three-hour drive from Homer, we found an outdoor sauna waiting for us \u2014 this was just one small example of the kind of hospitality we found across Alaska. After a week of following local recommendations instead of tour itineraries, I returned home with genuine friendships and insider knowledge of a place I'd never visited before. Alaska has incredible natural beauty and endless adventure opportunities. However, what I will remember most is the locals we met and the time we spent with them. Our bus didn't have evening shows or buffets, but it offered something better: the freedom to follow local recommendations and discover Alaska through the eyes of people who actually live there.
