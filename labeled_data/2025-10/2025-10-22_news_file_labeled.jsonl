{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"                 reading time 3 minutes        Netflix reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and revenue was $11.51 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094slightly below Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast of $11.52 billion. Earnings per share were $5.87, below an estimate of $6.94. (All of this is per Yahoo! Finance). Not catastrophic, but not great. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price went down by 5.6%. But hey, how about all that AI? In its shareholder letter, and then again in its earnings call, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters touted coming generative AI implementation as an exciting new development across content generation, user experience, and in advertising. All the AI talk made it feel like it was 2023 again. To illustrate how much AI seems to be on the CEOs\u2019 minds, at 26 minutes and 34 seconds into the earnings call, Peters gives an answer in which he rattles off what seems to be an ad-hoc list of six challenges Netflix faces as a company, starting with creating TV and movies around the world. Implementing AI is the second item he mentions. The shareholder letter kicked off the topic of AI with what is actually a pretty big truth bomb: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor many years now, ML and AI have been powering our title recommendations as well as production and promotion technology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truer than you might think. All the way back in 2008, Netflix found a genuinely fun way to publicize its use of machine learning: by asking the public to figure out why some people like Napoleon Dynamite and others don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, with math. Much has changed since those days, and now Netflix says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoehorning AI features into Netflix wherever it can. For instance, the earnings letter says a beta test is ongoing that adds a \u00e2\u0080\u009cconversational search\u00e2\u0080\u009d function, helping people \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscover the perfect title for that moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The goal here sounds easy enough to picture without speculating too wildly. I can picture saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a movie to watch with my mom on her 50th birthday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d into a Roku remote and getting a list of recs. On the techical side, Netflix says there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an effort afoot to use AI to \u00e2\u0080\u009clocalize\u00e2\u0080\u009d (which basically means \u00e2\u0080\u009ctranslate\u00e2\u0080\u009d) promotional assets into other languages and regions, which sounds like it could theoretically allow relevant\u00e2\u0080\u0094but obscure and foreign\u00e2\u0080\u0094movies and TV that I might love to come to me, even without readily available artwork and summaries in my language. Theoretically anyway. But most of all, Netflix says it will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cempowering creators with a broad set of GenAI tools to help them achieve their visions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For instance, the letter boasts that AI de-aging was used in Happy Gilmore 2, and that the producers of Billionaires\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Bunker used Generative AI tools for concept art. But how does Netflix regard Sora 2, the video generator that plunged the internet into copyright hell upon its release last month? Sarandos, for his part, is not telegraphing some kind of rapid slopification at Netflix\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he hastens to add that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not intimidated by Sora 2 currently. According to Sarandos, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u2019s likely to have a lot more impact on UGC creators the most in the near term. In other words, AI content replacing viewing of existing user-generated content. That starts to make sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth noting that Sarandos is already trying to convince influencers to leave YouTube. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a YouTuber who hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already agreed to a Netflix deal, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worried that Sora 2 is coming to eat your lunch, Sarandos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 suggestion that your business model is more vulnerable than his could be part of an effort to win you over. But Sarandos says AI \u201cdoesn\u2019t automatically make you a great storyteller if you\u2019re not.\u201d For once a tech CEO talking about AI doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s sharpening his layoffs ax. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster, and in new ways,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sarandos said, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re all in on that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Explore more on these topics    Share this story           Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Satya Nadella is getting his biggest payday since becoming Microsoft's CEO a decade ago. The chief executive's pay package jumped to a record $96.5 million for fiscal 2025, about a 22% increase from $79 million in 2024, according to the company's proxy filing on Tuesday. The bulk of Nadella's pay \u2014 about $84.2 million \u2014 came from stock awards tied to Microsoft's market value during the AI boom. Nadella earned a $9.5 million cash bonus and a $2.5 million base salary, with about $196,000 in other benefits. Microsoft's board said more than 95% of Nadella's compensation opportunity is performance-based, citing shareholder returns and growth metrics as the key factors. For fiscal year 2025, Microsoft achieved 15% revenue increase to $281.7 billion and a 16% jump in net income to $101.8 billion. The results \"demonstrate that Satya Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift,\" the board committee said, adding that products like Azure and Copilot drove the strong results. Representatives for Nadella at Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO in 2014. His total compensation has risen over the last decade: about $18 million in 2015, $55 million in 2022, and $79 million in 2024, before reaching this year's high of $96.5 million. Last year, Microsoft became the second company to reach a $3 trillion market cap, joining its rival Apple. The enterprise software giant is one of the most aggressive corporate investors in artificial intelligence. Microsoft is OpenAI's biggest investor and has plowed over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019. Microsoft's AI strategy has largely relied on a partnership with OpenAI, although the companies have drifted apart lately. Last month, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said during an all-employee town hall meeting that the company plans to make \"significant investments\" in its AI chip cluster to become \"self-sufficient in AI.\" \"It's critical that a company of our size, with the diversity of businesses that we have, that we are, you know, able to be self-sufficient in AI, if we choose to,\" Suleyman said. Microsoft's shares rose about 23% this year through Tuesday's close.              Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

Just a few years ago, housing markets in the warm, sunny parts of the US looked, well \u2026 warm and sunny. In the halcyon days of 2021 and 2022, cities like Austin, Tampa, Phoenix, and Atlanta attracted swarms of movers. Home listings reliably drew multiple offers above the asking price, and buyers plunked down all-cash offers to fast-track their purchases. Flash forward to today, and the big \"winners\" of the work-from-home reshuffle \u2014 metros that drew hordes of footloose workers and disaffected coastal dwellers \u2014 have turned into losers. Fewer people are moving to so-called Zoomtowns. Home listings are piling up on the market. Prices are dropping. The anxiety has shifted from buyers trying to elbow their way in to sellers just trying to offload their properties. A new report by the real estate analytics firm Parcl Labs, shared exclusively with Business Insider, shows that home sellers in the lower half of the US, also known as the Sun Belt, are the most desperate in the country. Housing markets in the Midwest and Northeast, on the other hand, are going strong. Inventory in those parts of the country remains tight, and prices are up. Homes are selling at a brisker pace than in the rest of the US. These cities didn't garner much attention during the pandemic (how many glowing headlines did you see about Buffalo, Cleveland, Milwaukee, or Detroit?), but sellers there have quietly held onto their bargaining power. By practically any measure, the country's real estate leaderboard has flipped. \"We are in a two-tiered housing market,\" Mike Simonsen, the chief economist at the brokerage firm Compass and the cofounder of Altos Research, tells me. \"It's really stark.\" At first glance, this might seem like a simple tale of supply: Builders flocked to the Sun Belt and put lots of shovels in the ground, setting the stage for an inevitable drop in prices when all those new houses hit the market. Sure, that's part of it. But this is also a story about even bigger shifts in the labor market, migration trends, and affordability \u2014 why people are (or aren't) moving, and where they're choosing to put down stakes. The Sun Belt isn't drawing movers like it used to, while the Midwest and Northeast are holding onto more people than they did during those peak pandemic years. Even more troubling, many Americans aren't moving at all. They're stuck in place, scared to quit their jobs or trade their cheap mortgage rates for more expensive ones. With no signs of a reversal on the horizon, the new housing-market winners could stay on top for years to come. Americans move in predictable patterns. Over the past few decades, the Northeast and Midwest hemorrhaged people to the Sun Belt, where jobs were plentiful, the weather balmier, and homes cheaper. Between mid-2018 and mid-2019, the last full year of Census data before the pandemic set in, the Northeast lost a net 294,000 residents to other parts of the country, while the Midwest lost nearly 162,000. The South, on the other hand, gained almost 408,000 people, and the West saw an uptick of 48,000. \"We've been moving from the North to the South for many years,\" Simonsen tells me. \"We build the houses in the South. We sell our homes in the North.\" Housing demand surged early in the pandemic \u2014 the country's homeowning ranks swelled by a whopping 2.2 million people between the first quarter of 2020 and the same point in 2022, an analysis by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies shows. But for all the talk of upheaval, movers more or less stuck to those pre-pandemic flight patterns \u2014 just at warp speed. People kept migrating from big-city centers to the suburbs and from the North to the South. Sun Belt states, including Florida, Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina, experienced the largest population gains from domestic migration between mid-2020 and mid-2021, per a Harvard analysis of Census data. The Dallas metro, for example, gained around 63,000 people from other parts of the country that year, a huge jump from just 19,000 the year prior. Phoenix, Tampa, Austin, and Charlotte recorded similar increases. Expensive states with large urban areas, including California, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts, saw the biggest losses. While migration may follow long-held trends, the idea of a \"national\" housing market is really a myth \u2014 every city, town, even ZIP code, has its own quirks. The chaotic reshuffle of the pandemic's early days, however, resulted in the closest thing we've seen to local markets around the country moving in the same direction: Prices went up, and inventory went down. Even if some states saw far more new arrivals than others, buyers all over the place jumped into the market in search of cheap mortgage rates, more space, and the promise of generational wealth, even if the move was just down the street. This led to higher prices practically across the board (with the exception of big cities that lost a ton of people, like San Francisco). Now, though, the country is splitting into two distinct markets. If someone's looking to sell a home these days, their prospects look a lot different depending on whether they're in Boise or Buffalo. In the Sun Belt and Mountain West, homebuilders saw the demand signals from the national moving moment and got busy. \"There's a herd mentality, for sure,\" says Ryan McKeveny, a managing director at the housing research firm Zelman, a Walker & Dunlop company. Homebuilders, he tells me, \"all gravitate to the same exact markets.\" The Census estimates that the housing stock in the South region surged by almost 3.3 million between 2020 and 2024, compared to just 750,000 in the Midwest and a measly 483,000 in the Northeast. Despite the rush to break ground, those homes didn't materialize all at once. It usually takes a couple of years for new homes to crop up. In the meantime, prices in the Sun Belt spiked. Take Austin. The Texas capital was the fastest-growing large metropolitan area from 2020 to 2022, Census data shows, adding a net 120,000 people for a population increase of 5.3%. Even with a surge in homebuilding, supply simply could not keep up: The typical home price in Austin jumped by more than 60% in that same time period, Zillow found. Eventually, though, the builders made up some ground. By last fall, Austin's for-sale housing stock had climbed by more than 76,000 units, or 8.34%, since 2020, Parcl Labs found, a monumental feat for a city that large. At the same time these new units came onto the market, however, the flow of people to Austin started to abate. Net domestic migration totaled less than 14,000 from mid-2023 to mid-2024, still positive but well below the high of 44,000 in 2021. Buyers were also pulling back in the face of higher mortgage rates, which translate into vastly more expensive monthly payments. Fewer buyers, more homes up for sale \u2014 you can imagine what happens next. Austin home values have dropped more than 23% from their peak in the summer of 2022, Zillow data shows. A recent Zelman analysis shows that pandemic-era hot spots like Denver, Austin, Memphis, Tampa, and Dallas have seen big upticks in active inventory, or the number of homes available for sale, while median prices are down year over year. In Denver, for example, inventory is up almost 50% from the same point in 2019, while the median price is down slightly from a year ago. Dallas prices are down almost 2% year-over-year, while inventory is up more than 20% from 2019. Net migration to Florida and Texas remains positive, according to a Zelman analysis, but is lower than in 2019. The Dallas metro added just 25,000 people via domestic migration in the 12-month period ending June 2024, down from 91,000 a couple of years prior. Tampa's increase of 11,000 was a fraction of its 54,000-person gain during the height of the relocation bonanza. A comedown from the pandemic-era frenzy may not come as a surprise. More interesting are the markets where sellers undeniably have the upper hand. These metros in the Northeast and Midwest mostly weren't subject to the huge price run-ups that were commonplace in the Sun Belt, but they didn't get a ton of new supply from homebuilders, either \u2014 those guys were focused on carving out new home communities down south. Inventory levels in places like Buffalo, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Cleveland are still below their 2019 watermarks, per Zelman's analysis, while prices have increased by anywhere from 4% to 8% compared to a year ago. People aren't exactly rushing to move to these areas \u2014 it's just that the decades of migration losses have seriously slowed. The Cleveland metro lost just 3,500 people on net in 2024, compared to nearly 10,000 in 2021. Same story in Milwaukee. The Minneapolis-St. Paul metro notched a slight increase last year after bleeding a whopping 14,000 residents via net domestic migration in 2021. The North-to-South movement still holds, but the North is losing fewer people, and the South isn't gaining like it once was. The most recent numbers, for the yearlong period ending in mid-2024, show net domestic migration to the South was down almost 38% compared to the first year of the pandemic. Domestic migration to the Midwest, on the other hand, is up about 60% in that same period, though it's still negative in absolute terms. The Northeast's net loss was down to 192,000 in the latest tally, compared to a loss of 390,000 at the height of the pandemic. With the migration tide receding, sellers in once-hot metros are getting real. In Denver, Charlotte, Jacksonville, and a smattering of other Sun Belt markets, more than half of single-family homes for sale have seen a price cut, Parcl Labs data shows. In the Boston, Philadelphia, and Buffalo metros, the share of listings in that bucket drops to fewer than a third. That's just one metric. To gauge sellers' desperation these days, Parcl Labs created what it calls the Motivated Sellers Index, which combines four factors: the number of price cuts on home listings, the time in between those cuts, the size of the price decreases, and the length of time homes are spending on the market. The higher the score, the greater the homeowners' urgency to sell. The lower half of the US, with the exception of much of California, is awash in high scores, indicating sellers are ceding negotiating power to buyers. Same goes for much of the West. The Midwest and Northeast, on the other hand, registered some of the lowest scores in the nation: Sellers there are sitting pretty by comparison. \"We have declining home prices in many of these pandemic-winning housing markets,\" Jason Lewris, a cofounder of Parcl Labs, tells me. \"The sellers in many of those markets are very motivated to get out.\" That index, Lewris says, is a \"pretty good proxy for where home prices may go.\" In other words, an abundance of motivated sellers today likely spells more price drops in the future. If homeowners are dropping their prices to meet the market, it shows they're not just testing the waters and hoping to get their dream amount. In the summer of 2024, sellers appeared content to hold out for top dollar. This past summer, though, marked a notable uptick in seller motivation, says Lucy Ferguson, another executive at Parcl Labs. \"Not only is there more stuff on the market, but there's a lot more price cutting,\" Ferguson tells me. \"It's kind of like sellers meeting reality. That's the big theme.\" With mortgage rates still well above their pandemic-era lows, millions of households are playing the waiting game. Existing homeowners are unwilling (or unable) to give up their plum mortgage rates, so they're delaying moves that they'd otherwise be making. Renters are hanging tight until the affordability math tilts in their favor. This helps explain why the relative level of demand is so much higher across the Midwest than somewhere like Texas or Florida. When people are stuck in place, the typical migration patterns break down. The South adds fewer new buyers, and the North holds onto more of them. The result is weaker price growth \u2014 or even falling prices \u2014 in places that were once dependable strongholds of rising home values. \"If I'm a young family in suburban Chicago or upstate New York, I would have bought my house from the guy who moved to Orlando,\" Simonsen tells me. \"But they didn't sell, and I still need to buy.\" The labor market also points to a stuck-in-place economy. Unemployment is low, but hiring is way down. The \"quits rate,\" or percentage of workers voluntarily walking away from their jobs, is lagging. People are wary of making big life moves that could leave them in the lurch if things go wrong. To look for signs of thawing in the housing market, Simonsen tells me he'll be watching for a pickup in the quits rate \u2014 if people are confident that they can leave their job and find a new one, it's a good sign that they're up for other major changes like a cross-country move. Until then, expect this reversal of the Covid-era winners and losers to hold. \"In a lot of these markets where home prices are kind of flat to lower, I don't exactly see a reason why all of a sudden home prices are going to reaccelerate meaningfully,\" McKeveny, the researcher at Zelman, tells me. The Sun Belt is still a long way from \"market crash\" territory \u2014 even places like Austin are still adding people on a net basis, albeit at a much slower pace. But the price cuts represent a serious reality check. With the rise of Zoomtowns now a distant memory, buyers across the South and Mountain West benefit from more bargaining power than they've had in years. Their counterparts up north, on the other hand, still face stiff competition and rising prices. You can count on the pendulum to swing in the other direction once people start moving again. In the meantime, places like Cleveland and Buffalo will continue to enjoy prime position atop the housing-market heap.

Walking into a gallery as an art world newbie is likely to be a somewhat humbling experience. Rebekah Bowling, a senior art advisor at Citi who works with ultra-high-net-worth clients in Citi Wealth to manage and build their art collections, knows that it can be \"really intimidating\" to start buying art. Galleries typically don't list prices, and new buyers often don't know much about the artists or shows they're looking at, she said. Even asking an employee at the desk about the works on display takes some courage. \"They, in turn, say, 'Let me get a director,' or, 'Are you a collector? Can you share a few details about your collection?'\" Bowling said. \"There's this vetting that happens at the front door. If you are not a known entity, there's the idea that you're not going to get treated as kindly.\" Sales in the global art market fell 12% last year, totaling around $57.5 billion, according to Art Basel and UBS' Art Market Report. Despite the drop, the number of transactions increased by 3%, mainly because of sales in the lower tier of the market. For those trying to get over the many humps and buy art for the first time, Bowling had a few pieces of advice. \"Education is the first point,\" Bowling said. She suggests that anyone seriously interested in starting a collection spend at least six months, or even a year, educating themselves on the market and their own taste. It's essential to become familiar with both the primary and secondary markets, which respectively sell pieces for the first time and as resales, she said. And though art can be a good investment \u2014 Morgan Stanley estimated 4.9% annualized returns on art and collectibles over a 20-year period in a report from earlier this year \u2014 Bowling doesn't think buying pieces only for potential profit is a smart strategy. \"If you're buying it for purely speculative reasons, hoping to hold it for a year or two and then flip it for a higher price, I think you will only be disappointed,\" she said. Bowling advises people to only buy pieces they genuinely love. Beyond galleries, Bowling said that auctions and art fairs can be \"more welcoming\" environments. Auctions often list price estimations and a few details about the artist, which can make the buying process less opaque. Art fairs offer new collectors an opportunity to explore a lot of work at once and \"immediately see what they gravitate towards,\" Bowling said. The Art Basel and UBS report found that the total value of sales at auctions fell by 20% to $23.4 billion in 2024. That said, the number of transactions grew 4%, spurred by growth at the low end, or pieces sold for less than $50,000. Though some might only associate the art market with the Picassos and Matisses of the world, Bowling said emerging artists are a great place to start a collection, since their work tends to be less expensive. She advises visiting what she calls \"incubator galleries,\" which might be located in neighborhoods like the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the East Side of London, or the East Side of LA. \"They're giving them their first, second, third, solo shows, focusing on showing this work to institutions, to curators, to tastemakers within the business,\" Bowling said.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Elon Musk talked up future products and railed against critics of his proposed $1 trillion pay package in a call with analysts following Tesla's third-quarter earnings. Tesla posted record quarterly revenue but its profit came in below Wall Street's expectations. The stock was down about 1.6% after hours following the results and dipped further still during an analyst call. Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.50, trailing the consensus analyst estimate of $0.54. It did, however, report revenue of $28.1 billion, an all-time high that exceeded forecasts after it delivered a record number of vehicles in the quarter. Musk hyped up the next generation of its Optimus humanoid robot multiple times during the call, a product he said was \"challenging\" to manufacture but held huge upside. He teased a reveal of Optimus V3 expected in \"February or March.\" The Tesla CEO said the EV maker was working to expand vehicle production \"as fast as we can,\" and that he expects Robotaxis operating in \"eight to ten metro locations\" by the end of the year, including in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona. Tesla said in its earnings release that it faces \"near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy.\" The EV giant said in the report that its operating income decreased 40% year over year, due to various factors, including higher average cost per vehicle, partially due to an increase in tariffs. Musk also had some harsh words for two major proxy firms critical of his proposed Tesla pay package, ISS and Glass Lewis, whom he described as \"corporate terrorists.\" Shareholders will vote on the compensation package on November 6. Catch up on the full play-by-play from the analyst call below: Tesla's CFO closes off the call by urging shareholders to vote for Musk's $1 trillion pay package. Musk chimes in to talk about the importance of having more voting control, saying it's not really possible for him to get \"supervoting\" stock grants like some other tech founders have, since Tesla is already a publicly traded company. Musk says he doesn't feel comfortable building a robotics arm at Tesla and then \"being ousted\" because of a hypothetical recommendation from major proxy firms like ISS and Glass Lewis, whom the Tesla CEO called \"corporate terrorists.\" (Both firms have recommended shareholders vote against some or all of his proposed $1 trillion pay package.)

Musk narrows his estimate a bit, saying Tesla will have a \"prototype ready to show off in Q1, probably February or March.\" He says Tesla plans to build a million unit Optimus production lines, hopefully stating at the end of next year. He says the company will make \"rolling changes\" with Optimus and there will be \"continued iteration\" on the hardware design, because the team will discover things along the way. Musk says xAI's Grok and Tesla AI are on \"opposite ends of the spectrum.\" Musk says Grok is \"trying to solve for artificial general intelligence with a massive amount of AI training compute and inference compute.\" He says Tesla AI models are about less than 10% \u2014 or closer to 5% \u2014 the size of Grok's. \"You could not possibly squeeze Grok onto a car, that's for sure,\" Musk says, adding that Grok competes with OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini frontier models. Musk says the Optimus engineering team is \"very talented,\" and credits a lot of the recent engineering progress for the robot to those engineers. He says Friday night Optimus meetings sometimes go until midnight, and the segment is \"crucial\" to Tesla's future. The CEO names various parts of the business, including the battery packs, supercharger network, chip design team, and the AI software team. He says Optimus at scale is the \"infinite money glitch.\" Musk describes a world in which working will be optional and Optimus will achieve 5x the productivity of a person per year, because it can operate around the clock and doesn't need to charge. Musk and the other Tesla execs are now fielding questions from Wall Street analysts. Musk teases a number of AI improvements for Tesla vehicles that he says are \"quite radical.\"\"It might almost be too much intelligence. I do wonder, like, how much intelligence should you have in a car? It might get bored,\" Musk says. Musk says it could happen in less than 24 months if the supply chain can keep up with that pace. \"So I think we're going to expand production as fast as we can, as fast as our supplies can sort of keep up with it,\" Musk says. He says the \"single biggest expansion in production will be the Cybercab,\" which is set to begin production in the second quarter next year. Over the summer, Tesla struck a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung for the company to produce some of Tesla's new chips from the manufacturing plant it is building in Taylor, Texas. The plant is expected to open in 2026. Musk sought to clarify the arrangement on the call, saying both TSMC and Samsung would be building Tesla's A15 self-driving computer chip.

Musk sought to clarify the arrangement on the call, saying both TSMC and Samsung would be building Tesla's A15 self-driving computer chip. \"Our goal, explicit goal, is to have an oversupply of AI5 chips,\" Musk says. He adds that Tesla is \"not about to replace Nvidia,\" but if Tesla has too many AI chips for the cars and robots, it can always use them for its data center. Musk says Nvidia has multiple clients to provide chips to, but Tesla only has to serve itself. Musk says creating a humanoid robotic hand as capable as a human's is a \"difficult engineering challenge.\" He says manufacturing is also a key challenge because the supply chain for humanoid robots doesn't exist.

He says any visitor can come by and ask the Optimus robot to take them somewhere and it will bring them to meeting rooms or other building locations. The company says that the timeline depends on \"various regulatory approvals.\" Tesla says it continues to operate its fleet in Austin, covering more than a quarter million miles without anyone in the driver's seat. Tesla's CFO says tariffs had an impact on Tesla's energy storage business, despite the segment delivering record gross profit and margins. \"The other thing to keep in mind is we are seeing headwinds in this business, given the increase in competition and tariffs, the total tariff impacts for Q3 for both businesses was in excess of $400 million, generally split evenly between them, services and other demonstrated a marked improvement sequentially,\" the CFO says.

He adds that the ramp of Tesla's Shanghai megafactory is helping it avoid some impact, because the factory can supply non-US demand. CFO Vaibhav Taneja is going through Tesla's financial results and providing additional context. Musk says Tesla is \"on the cusp of something really tremendous\" with Optimus. Musk says Tesla is excited to unveil Optimus V3, \"probably in Q1.\" \"It won't even seem like a robot, it will seem like a person in a robot suit,\" he says.

(You might remember that the company first unveiled its humanoid robot ambitions with humans in robot suits.) Musk says Tesla has \"the ingredients of real-world AI and exceptional electrical, mechanical engineering capabilities\" and the ability to scale Optimus production. Musk opens the call by talking up Tesla's efforts toward fully autonomous driving. The CEO says FSD and robotaxis will change the transportation sector, and there are billions of Tesla cars that are capable of becoming fully self-driving vehicles with a software update. Musk says he plans to expand production as fast as Tesla \"reasonably can.\" After a short delay, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is on the call along with CFO Vaibhav Taneja. The executives begin with prepared remarks about the third quarter results before answering a sampling of previously submitted retail investor questions and live questions from analysts. The stock has inched up a bit since dipping around 2% after the results crossed but is still in the red after hours. Tesla retail investors submitted just over 2,000 questions on Tesla's online Q&A forum ahead of the investor call, with queries about FSD taking the lead. Tesla typically answers some of them on the call.

Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in a note that Tesla's revenue beat \"should carry more weight with investors than the EPS miss.\" \"Given the overall challenging environment for EVs and discretionary spending seen in other reports, this is a particularly positive sign,\" Monteiro said. \"Now that the legacy EV business has likely bottomed, future timelines are more important for investors than today's numbers as that will drive growth,\" said Andrew Rocco, Stock Strategist at Zacks Investment Research. Tesla bull Dan Ives echoed the same sentiment. Shortly after the earnings release, he wrote in a post on X that \"Tesla is now entering its most important chapter of growth with the autonomous era kicking off.\" The new Roadster is listed as \"Design Development\" \u2014 the same status as recent quarters. The electric supercar, a follow-up to Tesla's first-ever vehicle, was first unveiled by Elon Musk nearly 8 years ago at a November 2017 event. Musk in 2024 thanked the \"long-suffering deposit holders,\" saying that the Roadster hadn't come out yet because \"it's the cherry on the icing on the cake\" \u2014 and there are \"other projects taking precedence before its launch.\" The new Roadster is listed as \"Design Development\" \u2014 the same status as recent quarters.

Popular YouTuber MKBHD recently canceled one of his two reservations for the vehicle. Here's what Tesla said in its earnings release: Volume: It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade and fiscal policies on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up our vehicle, energy and other future businesses for growth, the actual results will depend on a variety of factors, including the broader macroeconomic environment, the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts and production ramp at our factories.

Cash: We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during periods of uncertainty. Profit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardwarerelated profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits. Tesla says the Cybercab, Tesla Semi, and Megapack 3 are scheduled for volume production starting next year. It also said that first-generation production lines for its Optimus humanoid robot \"are being installed in anticipation of volume production.\"In August, Business Insider reported that Tesla shifted to a vision-only approach for the Optimus program, focusing on recording videos of workers to teach the robot how to do basic tasks, like folding clothes. Previously, Tesla used motion capture suits and virtual reality headsets to record data and operate the robot remotely. Tesla says in its earnings release that it faces \"near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy.\" The EV giant said in the report that its operating income decreased 40% year over year, due to various factors, including higher average cost per vehicle, partially due to an increase in tariffs.

In its last earnings report, Tesla similarly stated that it was experiencing a \"sustained uncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs, unclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment.\" THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg It's worth keeping an eye out for any commentary about the Cybertruck, the distinctive vehicle that has struggled to sell as well as expected. Tesla sold 5,400 of them in the second quarter \u2014 down 62% from the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive. It's worth keeping an eye out for any commentary about the Cybertruck, the distinctive vehicle that has struggled to sell as well as expected. Tesla sold 5,400 of them in the second quarter \u2014 down 62% from the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive. Back in 2023, Musk said Tesla could expand production to 250,000 a year. But just 16,000 Cybertrucks have been sold so far this year. Tesla began a limited rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi service in Austin in June, with safety drivers present in the passengers' seat, and investors will want a status check on the rollout's progress and possible expansion. Musk previously shared plans for the robotaxi service to be in many cities by the end of 2025, and also predicted there would be \"millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year.\" Tesla began a limited rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi service in Austin in June, with safety drivers present in the passengers' seat, and investors will want a status check on the rollout's progress and possible expansion.

In Tesla's last earnings call, Musk said owners would be able to do so \"next year.\" Coming without features like Autosteer and rear screens, the high price tags of the more affordable models underwhelmed some commentators. Andy Palmer, a former Nissan executive often called the \"godfather of EVs\" told Business Insider the models don't do enough to fend off competition from China's EV giants. BYD, whose cheapest model starts at less than $10,000 in China, sold more EVs than Tesla in Europe for the first time in April.

Both are referred to as the \"standard\" version of the models and drop a number of features offered in the higher-end models, including the radio and Autosteer. The Standard version of Tesla's most popular Model Y will cost $39,990, and the Model 3 Standard costs $36,990.

While customers and investors eagerly awaited the more affordable model's release, Wall Street analysts largely expressed disappointment at the vehicles' price points. \"We are relatively disappointed with this launch as the price point is only $5k lower than prior Model 3's and Y's,\" Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors after the announcement. Tesla said in its second-quarter earnings release that the Semi and Cybercab production were both expected to reach volume production in 2026. With just a few months left of 2025, investors will want to know if the EV giant is still headed toward that timeline. Tesla recalled nearly 13,000 vehicles built this year, due to a defect that regulators said can cause a sudden loss of battery power and increase the risk of a crash. The issue involves 2025 Model 3s and 2026 Model Ys, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration filing on Tuesday. While many past Tesla recalls were remedied through over-the-air software updates, impacted owners this time around will have to take their vehicle in to replace the part in question, the battery part contactor. The part replacement will be free of charge.

Tesla's Field Reliability team began investigating identified incidents in August, and as of October 7, it had identified 36 warranty claims and 26 field reports related to the condition, the recall report said. There were no collisions, injuries, or deaths related to the issue. Andres Sheppard of Cantor Fitzgerald wrote this week that the focus will be on the biggest catalysts for the stock price. Specifically, he cited \"several upcoming key material potential near-term catalysts, including: continued rollout of Robotaxi in Texas and California, ramp up of the Model 3\/Y standard (lower-cost vehicle), FSD adoption in China and Europe, launch of the cybercab in 2026, and an update on the timeline for its humanoid Optimus Bot.\" Cantor has a $355 price target for the stock, implying downside of about 20% from current levels. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote earlier this month that they're eyeing a handful of key updates from the carmaker. The bank has a price target of $425 a share and a \"Neutral\" rating on the stock. The analysts said they expect Tesla to deliver 475,000 vehicles this quarter, down slightly from nearly 500,000 delivered in Q3 Analysts at RBC have a price target of $500 for Tesla stock, representing 12% upside from Wednesday's price. Their thesis hinges on a \"sum-of-the-parts\" methodology that values the company on revenues related to all of its business units, with its auto unit ranked lower than things like AI and robots. The bank's Tom Narayan upped his Tesla price target after speaking with the company's management team about production of its humanoid robot, Optimus, which they say has a total addressable market worth $9 trillion. Morningstar's Dave Sekera thinks the big updates from the call will be around robotaxis, but news on the company's cheaper Model 3 and Model Y cars should also be on investors' radar. The company unveiled the lower-priced versions of its most popular cars earlier in October, and Wall Street is eager to hear if the move has stimulated more demand for Teslas. Morningstar is relatively bearish on the stock.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Written byandrew.packer Edited byMohammad Shahid The first wave of crypto ETFs allowed investors to onboard crypto assets into traditional brokerage accounts \u2013 and tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Given the long-term return potential of cryptocurrencies, that\u2019s a win-win. But cryptos are still volatile. Last week\u2019s $19 billion leveraged wipeout in bitcoin surpassed the wipeout at the Covid bottom in March 2020. And the FTX collapse in late 2022.\u00a0 Investors in traditional assets like the upside potential of crypto. But the downside volatility is a bit much to stomach.\u00a0 They want products that take some of the extreme swings out of it, even if it means a lower upside. Today, a new wave of ETFs are coming online. They boast higher fees, but more active management.\u00a0 There are currently 155 crypto ETF filings tracking 35 different digital assets. \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com\/nLgZccjplR Not content to simply buy and HODL, they\u2019re employing different strategies to take advantage of the higher volatility in cryptocurrencies. For more cautious investors, crypto income ETFs may be attractive investment opportunities. But as with anything, buyer beware.\u00a0 A peek under the hood of some of the income ETFs show that \u2013 whether in a crypto-specific ETF or a basket of crypto stocks \u2013 there aren\u2019t great total returns.\u00a0 On paper, crypto income ETFs offer investors most of the upside from cryptocurrencies, but with income along the way. But there\u2019s a catch. Actually, quite a few. The most important is that these ETFs use crypto futures, rather than hold crypto itself.\u00a0 Being able to manage crypto futures allows for the ability to create income. By buying long-dated futures and then selling short-dated futures, income can be generated from price swings. Some of the income returns look good, at least during a bull market. For instance, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) boasts a dividend yield of over 50% annualized. However, investors need to look at the total return. BITO shares are down nearly 20% year-to-date. With the underlying asset of Bitcoin up over 20%, BITO has generated only a modest gain on top of that. Anyone who has to sell shares of BITO will experience capital loss despite having to pay taxes on dividends received.\u00a0 And on top of that, investors are paying a 0.95% management fee. Using futures, ETFs effectively buy an asset with a time premium that decays. During a bull market, the impact is muted. But in sideways markets or a crypto winter, the losses can be brutal. Combine that with leverage, and the results can get pretty bad, pretty quickly. The Defiance Leveraged Long Income Ethereum ETF (ETHI) launched at the start of October.\u00a0 Designed to return 150-200% of the daily performance in Ethereum and using credit spreads to generate income, shares dropped 30% within their first few weeks of trading. October 10\u2019s liquidation massacre is the immediate culprit. But the way this ETF is structured, it would likely bleed out over time. Currently, crypto income ETFs are set up to make investors only during a hot bull market \u2013 not a crypto winter, or even a sideway market.\u00a0 But the crypto space is now more than just cryptocurrencies themselves. There\u2019s an ETF for everything after all, and it\u2019s no surprise that crypto stock ETFs are making a debut. ETFs tracking crypto-related stocks have started to launch this year. In theory, these may be more attractive for investors compared to a single-crypto income ETF, since they offer some diversification. Let\u2019s take a look at two of them:\u00a0 At the start of the year, the REX Crypto Equity Premium Income ETF (CEPI) launched.\u00a0 Boasting a monthly dividend payment, the ETF owns shares of several crypto-related companies, from mining companies, Bitcoin treasury company MicroStrategy, and even credit card giant Visa. Shares have been volatile since their launch, in a rising market for stocks \u2013 not good. But the dividends paid out have exceeded 20% year to date, for a positive total return. A second ETF that launched this year, the long-winded YieldMax Crypto Industry Portfolio Option Income ETF (LFGY), has a reported distribution of 19.9% annualized. Yet the ETF, which holds assets such as Coinbase, IBIT, MARA Holdings, and other runaway stock winners this year, is down nearly 25% since inception. With less than $200 million under management, it\u2019s clear that this ETF is failing to attract investors. And with these returns in the first year of operation, it\u2019s easy to see why. Despite the increasingly mainstream integration of cryptocurrencies, the October 10th massacre in altcoins serves as a painful reminder. Cryptocurrency is volatile. And while that volatility should decline as crypto assets gain traction and become integrated with traditional finance, it\u2019s still subject to big swings. Investors looking to get into the cryptocurrency space don\u2019t want to sit through a 30-50% decline \u2013 or more. They want the upside volatility, but may be willing to give up some gains if it means reducing the risk of having to sit through massive declines. But for now, crypto income ETFs are living up to their name by providing income \u2013 but they\u2019re failing to hold their value. That\u2019s a problem over time.\u00a0 Given the number of new crypto ETFs coming online, more competition in the space should drive ways to improve returns.\u00a0 For crypto enthusiasts, the ETFs are no reason to switch out of owning the real asset.\u00a0 For investors looking for crypto exposure, the spot ETFs that hold the underlying crypto still appear to be the best game in town.

Gen Z watch lovers are all about Cartier right now. The luxury brand's Swiss-made watches are hot commodities among Gen Z buyers on the secondary market, according to a new report by watch marketplace Chrono24 and publication Fratello that was shared with Business Insider. Cartier's share of the total purchases by Gen Z on Chrono24 rose from 1.7% to 6.8% over a seven-year period as of the first half of 2025, according to the report. That share outpaces the brand's overall growth on the site during the same period. Three models are driving the interest from Gen Z: the entry-level Tank, the sportier Santos, and the dressy Panth\u00e8re. The Tank is often considered an entry point to Cartier's luxurious offerings, with a starting retail price of around $3,500. New Santos and Panth\u00e8re lines, depending on the material, can easily go for well over $10,000. \"The unyielding demand for the Tank and Santos fuels desire for the brand, with the hard-to-get factor driving lots of newcomers to the secondary market \u2014 many of those skewing younger, enticed by a more accessible way to reach luxury,\" Balazs Ferenczi, Chrono24's head of brand engagement, told Business Insider. Cartier didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Dress watches overall are having a moment among young adults. The report describes them as smaller in size, often in gold, and paired with a leather strap \u2014 more elegant than the rugged look of stainless steel sports watches. Cartier's Tank model, for example, often comes with a leather band in an array of sizes. Gen Z's interest in secondhand dress watches is stronger than any other demographic, the report said, with 12% of all watch purchases during the first half of 2025 being dress watches. These days, luxury watches are more than fashion statements. One recent study found that high-end watches can appeal to investors seeking to diversify their portfolios with potentially lower-risk investments. Pop icon Taylor Swift also appears to be a fan of Cartier. The singer was spotted wearing a Cartier Santos Demoiselle in her engagement announcement photos in August. Chrono24 said in August that searches for the Cartier Santos Demoiselle surged 2000% in the two days after Swift's engagement compared with the days before. The report's findings show it's more than Swift's star power driving the interest in Cartier.

Capturing aerial footage used to mean dealing with FAA paperwork, spending serious cash, or settling for toy-grade quality. The DJI Mini 4K solves all three problems at once, and Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $239 (down from $299). This is DJI\u2019s most affordable drone, weighing in at under 249 grams, which means you can skip the entire FAA registration process for recreational flights. It\u2019s small enough to avoid bureaucracy but powerful enough to satisfy both beginners taking their first flight and experienced pilots who want a grab-and-go option that doesn\u2019t compromise on image quality. See at Amazon The sub-249-gram weight matters more than you might think: In the United States, any drone weighing 250 grams or more requires FAA registration and Remote ID compliance. The Mini 4K sits just below that threshold which saves you the hassle of paperwork and keeping you compliant without extra steps. You can throw it in a backpack for a hike, take it on vacation or bring it to a family gathering without worrying about legal headaches. 4K Ultra HD camera and 3-axis gimbal yield footage professional-looking. The gimbal accounts for motion in tilt, roll, and pan directions, so your recording remains smooth even as the drone experiences gusts or makes sudden turns. This makes the difference between shooting a sunset over the sea or a person riding their bike downhill. If you don\u2019t have gimbal stabilization, your footage gets jerky and unusable. The DJI classifies this drone for Level 5 wind resistance, which means winds of up to 38 kilometers per hour\u00c2\u00a0or 24 miles per hour. Consumer drones typically suffer in any breeze stronger than light, but the brushless motors on the Mini 4K give you the power you need to provide steady flight where other, cheaper drones would be forced to the ground. Those same brushless motors also allow you to use the drone at altitudes of 4,000 meters or 13,100 feet, so if you are trekking through mountains or flying in higher altitudes, this drone won\u2019t suffer loss of power as the air grows thinner. Battery life is an area where most budget drones are weak but the single-battery offering included with this price provides 31 minutes of flight time. That alone should be long enough to scout a location, position your shots and make numerous takes without repeatedly switching batteries. The 10-kilometer video transmission range is absurdly generous for a drone at this price point. You\u2019ll almost certainly run into line-of-sight legal restrictions before you hit the technical limits of the transmission system. In practical terms, this extended range means you maintain a clear, lag-free video feed even when flying the drone several hundred meters away, and gives you confidence that you\u2019re framing your shots correctly without constant signal drops or pixelated previews. For beginner pilots, the DJI Mini 4K has auto safety options to prevent most errors new flyers would make. GPS Return to Home automatically brings the drone back to where you started should the battery drop too low, should you lose signal, or should you trigger the return yourself. You won\u2019t need to be experienced in throttle control to lift the drone off the ground thanks to the one-tap landing and takeoff. The bundle comes with the RC-N1C remote controller which attaches to your smartphone for live viewing and camera control. At $239, the DJI Mini 4K undercuts almost everything else in its capability class by a significant margin. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

A third major proxy advisor has weighed in on Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion Tesla pay package, giving it a partial thumbs up, but with some serious caveats. Egan-Jones Proxy Services said it would recommend shareholders vote for the 2025 CEO Performance Award, but only under its \"Wealth-Focus Policy,\" which prioritizes shareholder returns and pay-for-performance alignment. Under all its other policy frameworks, including ones focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles and broader corporate accountability, the firm urged investors to vote against the deal. The split stance makes Egan-Jones the first major proxy firm to partly back Musk's record-breaking compensation plan, setting it apart from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, which both told Tesla shareholders to reject it outright. Under the wealth-focused framework, Egan-Jones argued Musk's massive potential payout is justified because it's fully tied to performance. To unlock the full $1 trillion, Tesla would have to hit 12 operational milestones, including reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization, generating $400 billion in adjusted earnings, delivering 20 million vehicles, and reaching 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions. \"If Mr. Musk fails to meet the specified milestones, he will receive nothing,\" Egan-Jones wrote in its analysis. \"If he succeeds, both Mr. Musk and shareholders stand to benefit significantly,\" it said. The firm estimated that, if all targets are met, Tesla shareholders' stock value could rise by about 800% over 10 years. But under its other policies \u2014 the Blended, ESG, Catholic, and Taft-Hartley policies \u2014 Egan-Jones flagged major governance and fairness risks. These policies are designed for investors who value strong corporate oversight, equitable pay, and social responsibility alongside profits. The firm cautioned that if Musk hits every target, his total ownership could climb to 28.8%, potentially giving him greater control over Tesla and reducing other shareholders' influence on company decisions. It also pointed to the massive gap between Musk's potential earnings and employee pay, saying that if his proposed equity stake were shared evenly among Tesla's 125,000 workers, each would receive about $8 million in stock. Egan-Jones said that such a vast disparity could eventually hurt morale and pose long-term risks to Tesla's workforce and reputation. Those concerns echoed warnings from the other proxy firms. ISS said Musk's plan could undermine shareholder rights and governance standards, while Glass Lewis called it \"excessively dilutive,\" arguing Musk could earn billions in stock awards even if he hits just one of the 12 performance tranches. Tesla has fiercely disputed the proxy firms' criticism, calling their analyses \"misguided\" and \"robotic.\" In a series of posts on X this week, the company accused ISS and Glass Lewis of relying on \"one-size-fits-all checklists\" that ignore Tesla's unique business model and history of defying industry norms. Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm doubled down in an open letter to shareholders, which Tesla shared on X on Tuesday, urging them to \"vote yes to robots, and reject robotic voting.\" She said ISS and Glass Lewis use a \"simplistic, one-size-fits-all framework\" that can't assess a company as unconventional as Tesla, and argued that Musk's 2025 play plan is meant to \"supercharge Tesla's next phase of exceptional growth and value creation.\" \"Elon gets nothing unless shareholders enjoy exceptional investment returns,\" Denholm wrote. She dismissed concerns that the plan would shrink existing investors' stakes, saying the package should be seen as \"an investment, not dilution,\" since shareholders would only give up value if Tesla's market capitalization grows more than sevenfold. Denholm closed by challenging investors to make a choice: \"If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis.\" But if you believe in Tesla, \"under the visionary leadership of Elon,\" she added, \"then you should vote with Tesla.\"                  Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

America's annual holiday shopping rush is usually preceded by a hiring sprint as retailers beef up their front-line workforces to meet the masses. But this year, there aren't as many jobs available at major retailers as there have been in years past. Retail hiring rates are at their lowest since 2009, according to analysis by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \"The cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge,\" the firm's senior vice president, Andy Challenger, said in its report. Data from the jobs site Indeed also shows that retail listings at the beginning of October were lower than the same point in each of the prior four years. \"Things have really slowed down in the seasonal hiring space in the last couple of years,\" Indeed economist Cory Stahl told Business Insider. \"Even of the postings that remain, we're seeing that they're not pushing as hard to get people into these jobs as quickly.\" While employers are slowing down, Stahl has found that more people are looking for jobs \u2014 a lot more. Searches on Indeed for seasonal jobs are already well outpacing last year's rate, which was notably higher than prior years, according to Stahl's analysis. With the broader US labor market in a quasi-frozen state, seasonal jobs look increasingly like a lifeline for workers who are trying to earn some income and get moving with their careers. Retail jobs typically represent about two-thirds of seasonal hiring each year, Indeed found. \"Employers are just not hiring,\" Stahl said. \"The best comparison we have is the years immediately following the Great Recession in terms of hiring \u2014 and that's not a comparison you really want to draw.\" To be sure, some major retailers are still adding seasonal staff. Bath & Body Works plans to hire 32,000 people; Dick's Sporting Goods is adding 14,000; Kohl's has a few thousand seasonal listings on its careers page. And there's Amazon, which said it is picking up some 250,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal positions across its US transportation and fulfillment network. But others are notably absent from what might otherwise be the tidy list of big, round-numbered hiring targets of yore. Target said it plans to primarily rely on a combination of additional hours for existing staff, a \"flexible workforce\" of some 43,000 people who are available to pick up additional shifts, and an unspecified number of seasonal members across its fleet of stores. A Walmart spokesperson similarly told Business Insider that instead of a massive hiring push, the retail giant intends to offer most of its additional hours to existing staff, like it did last year. \"There may be some hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority will be giving those hours to current associates,\" the spokesperson said. Macy's and UPS, which have previously staffed up big during the holidays, did not respond to requests for comment for this story. \"There's been a real shift more broadly in the labor market towards saying, 'Hey, we're not going to bring new people in. We're going to make do with the people we have,'\" Indeed's Stahl said. \"It's not surprising to then potentially see that carrying through into some of these seasonal hiring decisions as well.\" That may be of some comfort to those who have jobs already, but those who were hoping for a holiday hustle might be disappointed with the limited options.

Desktop gaming (usually) means building a tower PC or shelling out premium prices for something capable. The GMKtec K8 Plus flips that equation by packing serious gaming hardware into a mini PC that now costs less than Apple\u2019s base Mac Mini, and Amazon just dropped it to a record low of $519 (down from $738). With an AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, integrated Radeon 780M graphics, and a 1TB SSD, this pocket-sized system handles AAA gaming at 1080p. See at Amazon The AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor brings 8 cores and 16 threads with a boost clock up to 5.1GHz which puts it in the same performance bracket as many full-sized desktop chips. The 16MB L3 cache helps the CPU access frequently used data faster and reduces bottlenecks during gaming and heavy multitasking. What separates the 8845HS from the similar 8745HS model is the inclusion of an NPU, a dedicated chip designed to handle AI workloads like Windows Studio Effects, Copilot tasks, and local AI processing without burdening the main CPU cores. If you\u2019re experimenting with AI tools or running productivity features that leverage machine learning, this NPU accelerates those tasks considerably. 32GB of 5600MHz DDR5 RAM provides you the breathing room you require to run your games, dozens of tabs open in your browser, Discord, stream software, and your video editor all at the same time without lag. DDR5 is also higher bandwidth than the older DDR4, so data travels between the CPU and the RAM more quickly\u00c2\u00a0and this provides you better game frame times and better application responsiveness. Storage arrives through a 1TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD which gives read speeds of 5,000-7,000 MB\/s or so, depending on the drive you choose. This makes a difference when you are loading bigger game files, launching Windows, or transferring footage to where you\u2019ll be editing it. PCIe 4.0 is double the speed of PCIe 3.0, and the ability to upgrade to 8TB makes it so you won\u2019t have to replace the original drive should you decide you want to add another drive. The AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics is where this system surprises people: Built on the RDNA3 architecture with 12 compute units and 768 stream processors clocked up to 2,700MHz, it outperforms the previous generation 680M by a significant margin. This GPU handles demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 at minimum settings around 30-40 fps at 1080p, and less demanding games like FIFA 23 or Fortnite run at medium to high settings with smooth frame rates. The Oculink interface is something you won\u2019t usually find on retail mini PCs: Oculink gives you a high-bandwidth external GPU connection so you can attach a full desktop graphics card in an external enclosure should you, someday, desire increased gaming muscle. It carries exponentially higher bandwidth than Thunderbolt or USB4 where external GPUs are connected, and gives you much less loss of performance and providing you with a real upgrade path without having to replace the whole system. What\u2019s more, two USB4 ports at 40Gbps each have Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4\u00c2\u00a0so you can attach fast storage, charge gear, and power displays all out of the same port. HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1 outputs have 60Hz 8K resolution support, and the system can power four displays at 4K resolution. For multi-monitor productivity configurations or creative applications where you want the extra desktop real estate, this connectivity makes the K8 Plus into a real workstation. Dual i226V 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports support the speedy and rock-solid wired connections of 2.5 gigabit Ethernet, which makes a difference for big file transfers or reducing latency in internet gaming. At $519, the system costs you less than an entry-level Mac Mini but gives you gaming power Apple\u2019s system lacks and expansion-room flexibility so you\u2019ll have wiggle-room later to upgrade.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Apple has been designated with strategic market status (SMS) in the United Kingdom for iOS and iPadOS, a move that empowers regulators to impose binding requirements that could compel changes such as permitting rival app stores and direct software downloads. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed the designation today in a press release, announcing that Apple and Google both met the legal tests for substantial and entrenched market power across operating systems, app distribution, browsers, and browser engines on smartphones and tablets. The CMA said the designation follows investigations opened in January under new powers granted by the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which came into force in January. According to the regulator, the designation does not in itself impose remedies but enables the CMA to initiate targeted interventions designed to open the platforms to greater competition. The CMA said its analysis and consultation with more than 150 stakeholders concluded that iOS and Android collectively account for 90\u2013100% of UK mobile devices and that users rarely switch platforms once embedded. The CMA believes that developers seeking to reach UK users must pass through the companies' platform rules and distribution channels, giving the two firms a position of strategic significance. The CMA said Apple and Google may be limiting innovation and competition through platform rules governing things like app reviews, in-app payments, storefront search ranking, browser distribution, and cross-platform switching. It also said emerging AI features are unlikely to erode the firms' market power within the five-year duration of the designation. Apple told the BBC that users in the UK could lose access to new features, as has happened in the European Union, which the company attributes to heavy regulation. For example, some Apple Intelligence features which have rolled out in other parts of the world are not available in the EU. Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate, and we work tirelessly to create the best products, services and user experience. The UK's adoption of EU-style rules would undermine that, leaving users with weaker privacy and security, delayed access to new features, and a fragmented, less seamless experience. The CMA added that the designation is not a finding of wrongdoing. The measure simply enables regulatory action that could include requirements for fairer and transparent ranking in app stores, allowing developers to steer users to outside payments, and changes to user-experience barriers when using non-default app stores or directly downloaded software. The CMA noted in its press release that jurisdictions including the United States, EU, and Japan are adopting similar measures aimed at mobile platform gatekeepers.

Staffing and recruiting firm Kelly Services is cutting about 2% of its corporate workforce, the company confirmed to Business Insider. Kelly, which has about 5,000 corporate employees, is making a \"targeted reduction\" to its organizational structure, a spokesperson for the Troy, Michigan-based company said in a statement. The move is designed to meet \"the evolving needs of our client portfolio while further streamlining our organizational structure,\" the spokesperson said. At 2%, the layoffs would affect about 100 workers. The cutbacks come early in the tenure of Chris Layden, who took over as CEO in September after Kelly's former chief retired. The reductions also arrive as the US labor market appears to be slowing. While overall layoffs remain low, many job seekers are struggling to land roles, especially in the corporate world. As of September, US employers' hiring plans were at the lowest year-to-date level since 2009, the staffing and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Kelly, which had revenue of $4.3 billion in 2024, places more than 400,000 workers a year in fields including science, tech, education, manufacturing, retail, and finance. Kelly shares fell less than 1% in afternoon trading on Wednesday. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at tparadis@businessinsider.com or Signal at tparadis.70.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"The Motorola Razr Ultra packs a major punch, though it normally retails for well over $1,000.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Those in need of a good foldable phone deal have come to the right place, especially if they're in the market for one of Motorola's phones. Buyers can currently get up to $400 off on the 2025 Motorola Razr Ultra at Best Buy as part of an ongoing Halloween sale, so long as they let the retailer connect the phone to a carrier for them. For those who would rather activate the phone themselves, they can still get $300 off on the price, bringing it down to just $900 or $1,000. The Razr Ultra is normally deep into the expensive side of the phone spectrum, retailing at full price for $1,300. This particular deal is for the 512GB storage version of the device, and for the Pantone Scarab color. Still, Best Buy is offering slightly reduced discounts of $100-$200 off for the Pantone Mountain Trail and Pantone Rio Red colors, if you prefer those and don't mind spending a little more. The Razr Ultra is our top pick for the best foldable Motorola phone on the market, and in no small part due to its super functional cover screen, its long-lasting battery, its sturdy build, and its powerful performance with a wide range of AI features. It also boasts a solid set of cameras with an ultrawide lens, as well as fast charging capabilities. Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 (512GB): $1,299.99 $899.99 with activation at Best Buy Best Buy's Halloween sale includes up to $400 off the price of the expensive Motorola Razr Ultra with activation through the retailer. Those who prefer to connect the device to a carrier themselves can still save $300, bringing the price down to under $1,000 in either case. \u2705Recommended if: you're looking for a powerful, performance-heavy flip phone with a durable build and highly functional cover screen; battery life is an important factor to you when it comes to buying a phone; you want access to Motorola's latest AI features available. \u274cSkip this deal if: you aren't willing to spend premium prices of $900 or more on a phone; you'd prefer a phone that offers a long-term software update promise; you'd prefer slightly more mature, user-friendly operating systems like those from Samsung and Google. The 2025 Motorola Razr Ultra is a worthy flip phone competitor, offering the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite CPU for optimal performance, as well as 16GB of RAM for high-powered multitasking. It also comes with a beautiful 7-inch pOLED internal display, a highly useful 4-inch pOLED cover screen, each with an impressive 165Hz refresh rate. It also comes with a 50MP front-facing camera, and a pair of 50MP rear-facing cameras, including both an ultrawide and regular camera. It is worth noting that Motorola only offers three OS upgrades and four years of updates for this phone, which falls far behind its Google- and Samsung-made rivals. However, if that isn't a dealbreaker for you, $900 or $1,000 is a pretty solid price on this phone, so it's definitely worth considering.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Apple and Google have been designated as companies with strategic market status by the British Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is likely to result in new restrictions and regulatory obligations for both companies. Here are the details. Last July, the UK\u2019s CMA concluded a six-month investigation into Apple and Google, and said that it would consider designating both companies as having strategic market status (SMS) under the country\u2019s new Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act (DMCC). The law, which closely follows the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), aims to \u201ctake targeted and proportionate action to improve competition in digital markets, helping to drive innovation, investment and growth across the UK economy,\u201d per the agency\u2019s own words. Now, the CMA has issued its conclusion that Apple and Google, in fact, have strategic market status in their platforms: \u201cThe CMA has heard from more than 150 stakeholders and had constructive engagement with Apple and Google. Having analysed the feedback, the CMA has confirmed Apple and Google both have substantial, entrenched market power and a position of strategic significance in their respective mobile platforms and have been designated with SMS.\u201d The competition watchdog notes that the designation is not an accusation of wrongdoing, but rather a conclusion that will enable it to \u201cconsider proportionate, targeted interventions to ensure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google and Apple can have confidence that they are treated fairly.\u201d In its investigation, the CMA also concluded that British users are unlikely to switch between Android and iOS, that developers and businesses must rely on both platforms to reach consumers, and that the rise of AI is unlikely to diminish Apple or Google\u2019s market power over the next five years. These three arguments contributed to its SMS findings. Commenting on the CMA\u2019s decision, the watchdog\u2019s Executive Director for Digital Markets, Will Hayter, said the following: \u201cApple and Google\u2019s mobile platforms are used by thousands of businesses right across the economy to market and sell products and services to millions of customers, but the platforms\u2019 rules may be limiting innovation and competition.\u201d He also noted that 1.5% of the UK\u2019s GDP is generated through the so-called app economy, \u201cwhich is why it\u2019s crucial these markets work well for business so they can invest, innovate and drive the growth this country needs.\u201d It is not clear yet which, if any, actions will be taken following the designation. In Apple\u2019s case, the company may be required to allow sideloading and alternative app stores. Apple, for its part, has criticized the CMA\u2019s approach in the past with the following statement, as reported by Reuters: \u201cApple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate, and we work tirelessly to create the best products, services and user experience. (\u2026) The UK\u2019s adoption of EU-style rules would undermine that, leaving users with weaker privacy and security, delayed access to new features, and a fragmented, less seamless experience.\u201d What do you think will happen following Apple\u2019s SMS designation?

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's promise to cut energy bills by \u00a3300 could be \"wiped out\" by rising electricity costs, according to the expert behind the savings estimate. Miliband's pledge - which he has stood by in the face of fierce criticism from opponents who say it is unachievable - is based on a 2023 report by energy think tank Ember. But the author of the report, economist Pawel Czyzak, has told the BBC the analysis needs to be updated to take into account changes to the cost of offshore wind and other factors. A spokesperson for Miliband's department said the UK government remained \"determined to bring down bills, for good, and stand by our commitments\". It comes as former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's think tank calls for the UK government to shift it focus from clean power to cheaper electricity. In a new report, the Tony Blair Institute says if the transition to renewable energy \"continues in a way that raises costs, weakens reliability and weakens growth, it will fail both practically and politically\". The report suggests the government's Clean Power 2030 plan should be reframed as Cheaper Power 2030, and argues carbon taxes on gas should be axed to lower energy bills. The UK government insists its plan for clean power to meet 95% of electricity demand by 2030 will lower bills by that date. The mission was \"exactly how we will deliver cheaper power and bring down bills for good\", a government spokesperson said. Miliband's department has insisted it is already delivering many of the policies the Tony Blair Institute has called for, including expanding nuclear power and speeding up grid connections. Gas and electricity bills went up by 2% for millions of people in England, Wales and Scotland under energy regulator Ofgem's latest price cap this month. Last week, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC the Labour government stood by its promise to lower energy bills by \u00a3300 by 2030. He said energy bills were high in the UK \"because of our dependence on fossil fuels\" and the spike in the price of gas since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Energy prices increased drastically in 2021 following the invasion, and although costs have gone down, they have remained high by historical standards. Energy experts say higher wholesale costs have primarily been driven by the UK's reliance on gas and its exposure to its volatile prices on international markets.  Ember's analysis was first included in a Labour press release about the party's energy policies in March 2024 and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) has since confirmed the pledge was based on Ember's forecast. In its 2023 analysis, the think tank said UK households \"could save \u00a3300 every year on their electricity bills in 2030 if the government completes its switch to a mostly clean power system by then\". Ember said its baseline for measuring these savings was Ofgem's price cap between July and September in 2023. The analysis said savings from renewables would \"far outweigh the total investment costs required\". Czyzak told the BBC Labour's pledge could still be achieved in a number of ways, including removing costs such as green levies from energy bills, or financing grid investments through rises in general taxation. But when asked if the \u00a3300 savings estimate still stood, Czyzak said it was now \"a much different situation than it was in 2023\". He said the projected savings in his analysis were dependent on a significant drop in the wholesale cost of electricity in a scenario where renewables become cheaper and the dominant source of power in the UK. \"I think the question now will be whether the high cost of offshore wind doesn't disrupt some of these wholesale energy savings,\" Czyzak said. He said if the cost of upgrading the electricity grid increased, and wholesale prices don't go down as much, \"then it's going to be hard to generate savings\". He added: \"So then, yes, there is a risk of these savings being wiped out if we can't get the actual electricity cost down, and that might happen if offshore wind is too expensive.\" Czyzak said Ember never suggested the \u00a3300 pledge was \"the best solution to everything\". \"I think it's generally quite a tricky one because of the volatility around everything. Everything in this market is very volatile. So if you're just looking for a fixed single number, it's not that easy to deliver,\" he told the BBC. While DESNZ has accepted market conditions have changed, it argues that new renewables are still cheaper to build than new gas-fired power plants. A DESNZ spokesperson said lowering bills was \"central to every decision we make and why we have already consented a record amount of clean energy\". They added: \"By making Britain a clean energy superpower we are getting the UK off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and onto clean, homegrown power that we control.\" The cost of household energy bills has become a prominent political battleground, with the Conservatives and Reform UK blaming net-zero policies for higher prices. Both opposition parties say they would ditch climate targets and focus their efforts on making energy cheaper. The latest report by the Tony Blair Institute comes after the former prime minister called for a major rethink of net-zero policies earlier this year. The government has not heeded his call and is pushing back against the think tank's latest report, which backs net zero by 2050. Blair and his think tank have come under scrutiny over the clients they have worked with and their links to oil and gas. A DESNZ spokesperson said the think tank's report \"rightly recognises that clean power is the right choice for this country\". \"Our mission is relentlessly focused on delivering lower bills for the British people, to tackle the affordability crisis that has been driven by our dependence on fossil fuel markets,\" the spokesperson added. \"That's why we have launched a golden age of new nuclear, consented a record amount of clean power, and welcomed the announcement of over \u00a350bn private investment into the UK \u2013 as our mission delivers economic growth and good jobs across our country.\" The home secretary's response comes after The Times revealed a report calling the Home Office \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. The former deputy PM says her resignation had been \"incredibly tough\" on her family in an emotional speech.  Volunteers plan to revive the Cheddar Yeo's power - once used to mill paper and corn.

It's Tesla's earnings day, which means another chance for Elon Musk's company to trade in its EV label for AI. From robotaxis to humanoid robots, Tesla has moved well beyond its initial core of just building electric vehicles. BI's William Edwards has a breakdown on all the big projects Wall Street analysts are keen to hear more about on this afternoon's earnings call. Tesla has been subtly pivoting its strategy for years, but it's now reaching a tipping point. The end of the federal EV tax credit last month and the undeniable rise of Chinese rivals have made selling EVs difficult, to say the least. Sure, Tesla just launched an affordable version of some of its models. But the rollout for those long-awaited cars was somewhat subdued, and reactions were mixed. Meanwhile, despite concerns about a bubble, AI valuations show no signs of slowing down. So swapping \"EV\" for \"AI\" makes a lot of sense these days. There's just one problem: The EV side of Tesla is the one bringing in the real money. As big and promising as many of Tesla's AI plans are, they're just that \u2026 plans. That puts Musk and Co. in a tricky spot. They need to answer tough questions about the portion of the business that keeps the lights on while trying to keep investors' eyes on the big wins they say are just around the corner. Tesla's AI narrative has been a good pitch so far. After a brutal start to the year, Tesla's stock is up nearly 100% over the past six months. A big part of that run has been recent, with shares rising roughly 34% since September. Although Musk definitely helped things along when he disclosed the almost $1 billion worth of Tesla stock he bought. Musk obviously plays a key role in all of this, but he's been noticeably quiet. After a high-profile run at the White House, followed by a spectacular breakup with President Donald Trump, he hasn't made too much noise. True, he did just take a shot at Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, but by Musk's standards, it was pretty mild. He has good reason to keep his head down. In fact, he's got 1 trillion of them. That's what his new proposed pay package could be worth if he hits certain milestones. There's no guarantee it'll be approved when it goes to a vote at Tesla's annual meeting on November 6. Some major proxy-advisory firms are coming out against it, warning it's too generous and could shrink shareholder stakes. But another quarter successfully transitioning Tesla from EV to AI could go a long way in winning him some votes.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":" Borderlands 4Final Fantasy TacticsGhost of Yotei  Ghost of Yotei was the fourth best-selling game in the U.S. for September with just three days out on the market, according to the latest figures from Circana. Sony\u2019s latest open-world blockbuster appears to be doing just fine despite an attempted boycott by online grifters and their followers. \u201cWith one week in market, the US sales performance of Ghost of Yotei was basically flat to that of Ghost of Tsushima,\u201d the research firm\u2019s Mat Piscatella wrote on Bluesky. \u201cIt did great. Ghost of Tsushima launched in July 2020 (if you\u2019ll recall, stuff was happening at the time that significantly boosted gaming), and the PS4 installed base at the time was significantly higher than the PS5 is today. Like, anyone with \u2018concern\u2019 about this title should be looked at with a side eye.\u201d Ghost of Yotei was behind Borderlands 4, NBA 2K26, and EA Sports FC 26, which isn\u2019t surprising considering those are multiplatform best-sellers and the samurai revenge tale remains exclusive to PS5 right now. Sales were still enough to make Yotei the 18th best-seller of the year so far by revenue and the second best-selling game on PlayStation during the period, just behind NBA 2K26 but ahead of Borderlands 4 which had two additional weeks on the market. September 2025 Top 20 Best-Selling Premium Games \u2013 U.S. (Dollar Sales, Physical and Digital from digital data sharing publishers, excludes add-on content) \u2014 Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) 2025-10-22T13:00:13.232Z   Ghost of Yotei has been on the receiving end of a slow-burn reactionary backlash from online culture warriors ever since it revealed its protagonist was a woman named Atsu. She\u2019s played by Erika Ishii who was attacked by the usual suspects for being queer and for posting about about defunding the police during the 2020 George Floyd protests. The flame war intensified after a Sucker Punch developer posted a joke about the Charlie Kirk assassination, with some calling for a boycott of Yotei even after the developer was fired for the remark.\u00c2\u00a0Boycott or no, it seems to have had little meaningful impact on Yotei\u2018s trajectory, at least at launch. The September sales figures have some other interesting nuggets to chew on. Borderlands 4 posted some impressive Ws but with a few major caveats. It was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the month and instantly hit number three for the entire year, with 30 percent higher dollar sales at launch than Borderlands 3. But Borderlands 3 was $60 instead of $70, didn\u2019t have a Super Deluxe Edition selling for $130, and wasn\u2019t initially available on Steam, where Borderlands 4 appears to have sold a good portion of its copies. 2K Games hasn\u2019t released any official sales figures yet. Borderlands 3 sold over 22 million copies and before that, Borderlands 2 hit 30 million. My guess is that Borderlands 4, a return to form hampered somewhat by PC issues at launch, ends up tracking somewhere in-between. In other news, the PS5 has already outsold the entire PS3 generation in under five years. It has a couple of years left to beat the PS4 globally. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever beating the PS2. Not even the Nintendo Switch. But my favorite sales data point of all from last month is Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. It came in ninth overall, and second on Switch, which is extra impressive when you remember it\u2019s selling for only $50. Square Enix hinted at a possible sequel if it does well enough, or at least more strategy RPGs. I\u2019m buying everyone I know a copy for Christmas.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ: BYND) is experiencing an incredible rally, increasing over 700% in the last five days to $6.73 and continuing to rise during intra-day market activity. For a stock that many had dismissed, this increase is astonishing, particularly when compared to the S&P 500\u2019s modest 0.7% rise during the same timeframe. What ignited this? A newly expanded distribution agreement with Walmart, which will make select Beyond products, such as the Beyond Burger 6-Pack and Beyond Chicken Pieces, available in over 2,000 U.S. Walmart locations. This is a significant visibility enhancement for a brand that has been struggling to maintain its relevance. Retail expansion announcements like this usually generate optimism about a possible sales recovery, but in the case of Beyond Meat, the excitement seems to be driven more by momentum than by strong fundamentals. That being said, if you are seeking upward potential with less volatility than holding a single stock, you might want to consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has considerably outperformed its benchmark\u2014a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has provided returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What explains this? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, avoiding major volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, take a look at \u2013 Buy The Fear? Why Deckers\u2019 50% Slide Could Be Overdone The company has been rebranding itself, even omitting \u201cMeat\u201d from some of its materials to communicate a transition toward being a more expansive plant-protein company. This is a narrative strategy aimed at informing investors that Beyond is no longer solely focused on faux burgers, but on transforming how consumers perceive protein. Despite this, the underlying fundamentals are still severely challenged. Revenue has continuously decreased, down approximately 5% over the last year and averaging a 13% annual decline over the last three years. In its most recent quarter, sales dropped nearly 20% year-over-year, highlighting that consumer interest in plant-based meat has diminished from the high levels experienced during the pandemic. Beyond Meat\u2019s financials depict a bleak outlook. The company recorded an operating loss of around $160 million over the last year, with an operating margin of approximately -53%. Its net margin is equally concerning, at -51%, and cash flow is also significantly negative. In summary, every dollar of revenue incurs a substantial cost. Inflationary pressures, increased competition from both traditional meat producers and new plant-based entrants, along with a decline in consumer excitement, have all impacted profitability. Compounding the challenges, Beyond Meat\u2019s balance sheet appears under pressure. The company has around $1.3 billion in debt, and despite having $103 million in cash available, liquidity is constrained and leverage risk is considerable. This disparity leaves little margin for error. For a company that is still consuming cash, debt refinancing or capital raising could become a continuous issue if the underlying fundamentals do not improve. So, what accounts for the sudden rally? Part of the answer lies in market psychology. Beyond Meat is among the most shorted stocks in the market. When buying pressure arises from retail investors trying to capitalize on news or shorts rushing to cover their positions, prices can skyrocket quickly. These meme-style surges are powerful yet often temporary, and they tend to diverge significantly from the company\u2019s actual business performance. Long-term investors should keep in mind: Beyond Meat has experienced volatile cycles previously. The stock plummeted 97% from its peak of $192 in 2021 to less than $6 by late 2023 and still trades at a small fraction of its previous value. Even with the recent surge, it remains far from the path to recovery. Beyond Meat\u2019s expansion with Walmart provides a much-needed increase in visibility, but visibility does not equate to viability. The company\u2019s sales are declining, losses are significant, and debt levels are alarming. The latest rally in the stock may be thrilling. However, unless Beyond can convert partnerships like Walmart\u2019s into substantial, enduring growth and demonstrate that its new \u201cplant-protein\u201d identity genuinely resonates with consumers, this movement appears more speculative than foundational. At this time, BYND still represents a high-risk turnaround narrative with abundant narrative momentum but limited financial support. If this degree of risk makes you uncomfortable, you might want to consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns to investors. What is the reason for this? The rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a flexible approach to take advantage of favorable market conditions while minimizing losses in downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":0}

It's fine if you have a distribution center just out of a city and the route is to drive around the city and then back. But it wouldn't work for something like appliance delivery to customer's homes which would be all over the place. By the times you made the morning deliveries you'd be under 50% of the range, and you wouldn't have 5-10 mins to refuel and get back on the road. Though you normally wouldn't need to refuel at that range with an ICE, norma  You're correct, if your route is not predictable then that could be a problem. But there are loads and loads of applications where this isn't a problem, or where the organization that would use them for their own technicians, mechanics, and other support personnel are geographically constrained to where it would be difficult to even come close to that sort of range anxiety. At one point I worked for a K-12 school district doing IT support, and that district had hundreds of vans as part of the \"white fleet\", s  There's also the very large cost to construct the charging infrastructure to support a fleet of that size. Add in that the BrightDrop is $66,000 MRSP, while gas powered vans of roughly the same cargo capacity are $15-20,000 less. That could be two to three fleet replacements cycles to break even on the construction costs when calculating out the total cost of ownership. Realistically for that school district the construction costs for charging infrastructure would not have been as bad as for say, private entities, the school district as a political subdivision of the state had self-inspection and self-permitting powers on its own properties, and that process was incredibly streamlined.  They could have realistically had the grounds underground-located by the utilities using their own records (\"Blue stake\"), and then had some underground-detection done to confirm specific a  That was my city example. 177 miles \/ 8 hours = ~22 miles to drive per hour giving time for loading\/unloading, etc. Many scheduled routes will be 50% if not longer than that.   AND EVs bring additional inconveniences.  AND ICEs bring additional inconveniences. A lot of delivery and vans spend the entire day tooling around the same city. This is very predictable, and the ranges aren't huge. Electric vans are better in stop\/start conditions, need less maintenance and don't even need refuelling, you just plug it when it's returned to the depot, end electricity is cheaper than fuel. The other thing that's frankly weird about American is the obsession with huge pickup trucks. They're like The stupidest thing about pickups is the actual load bed is almost vestigial in a lot of models - it's so short it's useless for anything. Gravel, topsoil, debris....

Even if it still had the subsidies, there's no way for it to survive a 25% import tax.  Every problem in this story is uniquely American. When EV pricing in the U.S. is on par with comparable ICE vehicles, or cheaper, then EV sales will dominate.Used EVs are cheaper than used ICE cars, but that hasn't significantly improved the uptake.

With the increased range we're starting to see on EV models in the US this problem is becoming irrelevant to most Americans. EVs add nothing to long distance travel in Europe due to rules about maximum time behind the wheel without a break, but even in the US you are looking at an additional hour per 10+ hours of driving at most. Maybe that's the issue. Contractors instead of employee drivers. What is wrong with the US that businesses can't take advantage of the obvious cost savings that EVs offer?The USA isn't as densely populated as Europe, that means often driving longer distances.  With lower population density and few EV drivers yet there's something of a chicken and egg problem of finding places to put EV chargers where they can be profitable.

I was speaking specifically of socioeconomic stuff but yes, those as well. The use of first, second, and third worlds were originally about political affiliation.

Just about every van manufacturer in Europe now offers an electric version of their van product. And yet the lack of policy, availability and willpower of the governments isn't driving fleet sales, bonus points that tax credits are being rolled out. In the meantime DHL has partnered with Peugeot, Ford, Renault, Fiat, and VW to effectively electrify their entire European fleet. It's not just a DHL thing either. American companies such a FedEx have moved to exclusively purchasing Mercedes eSprinters, UPS has new IVECO eDaily trucks as part of their delivery fleet. There seems to be enough fleet orders to  It also helps that in Europe, many big cities ban ICE trucks from doing deliveries during the day to limit pollution. Of course, EV trucks are fine. EV trucks are also rather zippy - their ability to accelerate means they fit in very well with traffic - you're not having to deal with the dread of being stuck behind one where the light will turn red before they're even clear the intersection. In Europe these types of van are used for all sorts of things beyond delivery. Because they are enclosed you can build a little workshop in there, or at least have nicely organized tools on shelves and racks. With seats they can be used for crew transport as well. Basically most of the times an American would have a truck, Europeans have a van. Transit\/Sprinter\/Crafter\/etc do not have exactly square rear bodies like the Rivian and Brightdrop vans though. Basically most of the times an American would have a truck, Europeans have a van. Also... doesn't it rain in America? We have drop side vans (i.e. small lorries, but they're built on van chasses) in Europe which are functionally equivalent to pickups, except with usually a bigger bed, better visibility and lower loading. The pickup covers people use are very low and they have very little storage compared to a van. A small percentage of Americans could barely get used to cab over vansDriving a cab over is not hard. We got a diesel pusher bus where you're way further out in front of the front axle than that, and the only adjustment really is turning a little later. You get reasonably used to it in short order. If you don't have to deal with an 8' vehicle in a 10' wide lane (yeah they're meant to be 12' but then there's bridge crossings and such) then I bet it's not even scary.

GM's plan was to sell to the large fleet buyers -and they did... but now the winds are against going electric if your business is big enough to garner government attention.  Gotta get along to stay in the game! The Ford EV Transit van was a better choice for small businesses & tradesmen than the GM van.  Cheaper, customizable, and similar to the gas  Transit vans most were already driving. This sounds like a hot potato nobody wanted from the beginning. It couldn't survive as a separate project under the BrightDrop name, so it gets brought back into the GM fold. Then it gets \"assigned\" to Chevrolet. Yeah, maybe these were warning signs. If a tax credit is required for it to be a viable sale, then no, people don't want it sufficiently to be a viable product. These aren't people. They are corporations exclusively focused on cost. People were the ones who voted a government in that introduced tax credits. The people wanted it. Corporations will fuck you over any way they can if it saves them a dollar. They don't \"want\" their current diesel trucks either. They want the diesel truck of your granddaddy, the one that belches black fumes as it drives down the road giving you cancer. Corporate decisions are made by people....... As for private citizens...yeah, I don't know anybody who cares primarily about cost. Not me, not my neighbors....not anyone. Cost is at the bottom of their list of things to consider when making a purchase........yeah...that's the ticket.

They are definitely good at making a part cost less -- removing fastener counts, reducing casting complexity -- they have massive talent there.  But they're design for use has always been terrible, as have most of their marketing decisions. The BrightDrop vans were odd, because they were a really nice design.  They were more fit-for-purpose than any delivery van ever made by GM. I completely agree with you that the guys at GM didn't want to do it.  How do you shave costs  Maybe it was a hot potato at GM, but Rivian seems to be doing just fine with its Electric Delivery Van, used by Amazon. I'm seeing that there are shortages in a lot of minerals that are critical to adoption of renewable energy and battery storage that will slow and\/or delay any \"next industrial revolution\" in energy. One thing that can help speed things along is some relaxation and reform to environmental rules on mining in the USA.

Ever since the release of Prismatic Evolutions in January 2025, it has been close to impossible for even specialist stores to stock new sets of the wildly popular game, online stores are wiped clean in seconds, and larger retailers see anything put out on shelves gone in minutes. This is in large part thanks to scalpers, who buy everything they can at once in order to sell it at inflated prices. It really sucks, so actually watching someone do it is breathtakingly gross. Er, you can do that below. It would be easy to assume that scalping is just a bit of an annoyance, an act done by a few to cash in on the\u00c2\u00a0Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon TCG\u2018s current epic boom, causing people to gripe when they see unopened product on eBay for astronomical prices. But what\u2019s happening at the moment is far more fundamental than this, with its now being normal to be unable to buy any packs of cards at all from any of the sets launched in the last year and a half. Even the official Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Center websites, in every country, crash under the weight of bots and scalpers buying up everything the moment new sets are launched. This is despite purchase limitations and queues to access the sites, with bots seemingly able to easily exploit these barriers. And despite repeated promises from The Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Company to address this with higher production rates, nothing seems to be changing or improving. My recent attempts to get a statement from the company regarding this have all been met with silence. In fact, this weekend I spoke to owners of three independent specialist stores in three different towns about stock issues, and they all told me the same thing: they cannot even get enough stock to fulfill pre-orders, let alone have any left to sell on their shelves. One told me, under the promise of anonymity, that he recently attended a conference for stockists, and the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon rep began his talk by saying, \u201cI won\u2019t be discussing supply issues at all.\u201d He literally opened with that, and refused to take questions on it. It\u2019s really grim out there, for both the customers who want to play the game and collect the cards, and also for the specialist stores that struggle to get people through the door when they\u2019ve no cards to sell them. So, it\u2019s in all this context that this piece of shit acts like this: CRAZY Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Scalping At Walmart \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0088 #pokemon #viral #followme #pov #lucky   \u00e2\u0099\u00ac original sound \u2013 jamesthescalper    What\u2019s even more revolting here is this isn\u2019t someone recording a video of a scalper they spotted in a store: this is the scalper recording themselves in the act, on a TikTok channel called \u201cjamesthescalper\u201d, to boast about their actions. The clip above has especially caught people\u2019s eyes because of the kid in the cart, being surrounded by rack after rack of cards that this asshole is taking to sell at higher prices, as real customers try to take a pack or two before he snatches the lot. In this video, you can watch people swarming a shelf to strip it the moment the boxes have been put out: X2 POKEMON RESTOCK!!? \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00af \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a9.      #pokemon #pokemoncards #pokemontiktok #pokemongo #pokemoncommunity #pokemontcg #pokemonscarletviolet #cards#cardshop#charizard#picachu#fun#funny#funnyvideos#funnyvideo#happy#happybirthday#sportscards#investor#investingforbeginners#ebay#ebayseller#ebayfinds#reseller#thrift#thrifting#follow#like#repost#support#walmart#walmartfinds#kids#kidsoftiktok#dad#dadsoftiktok#whatnot#hustle#scalper#scalpers#cool#lucky  \u00e2\u0099\u00ac original sound \u2013 jamesthescalper    And in this video, we get to see him boasting about how he managed to break the two-box limit at CostCo by waiting for people to go on bathroom breaks, and then hiding boxes of cards inside luggage in the store to be able to get more the next day. Scalping Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Prismatic Evolutions Costco #pokemoncards #pokemon #costco #costcofinds #cards #tcg #scalp #fun #pokemontiktok   \u00e2\u0099\u00ac original sound \u2013 jamesthescalper    Clearly this is a very low-level scalping outfit, a guy showing off as he dumps boxes and packs on his child in a cart, clearly loving the attention. But as you can see in a bunch of his videos, he\u2019s not the only one doing it at any of these restocks, and it\u2019s happening in every store. And of course it\u2019s nothing compared to the online scalpers using bot armies to strip-mine sites before real customers can even notice anything\u2019s on sale. Purchase limits and the like are only sticking plaster solutions to a far deeper issue, and the only effective response is to increase production to meet demand. If there\u2019s no one to sell the scalped products to, then the scalping goes away. As I\u2019ve said before, if this isn\u2019t addressed, it\u2019s going to have long-term effects on the companies involved. But if anything, The Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Company is leaning hard the other way, with its most recent set deliberately including cards with such astonishing scarcity as to put rocket fuel under the situation. It\u00c2\u00a0will burst, because these bubbles always do, but until then it\u2019s making things miserable for many. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

The HP OmniBook 5 14 (G1q) sets the standard for how to do a value Windows laptop right. It's slim and portable, with a balanced set of quality features, best-in-class battery life, and an unbeatable price tag \u2014 with caveats. Building your own direct from HP will cost you a lot more, but you can get a stellar deal just by choosing one of the pre-built configurations. Sleek metal design with a comfortable keyboard Phenomenal multi-day battery life Great all-around computing experience Incredible value with default configurations Not a great port selection Not meant for high-performance tasks, like gaming  Why you can trust Windows Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  Earlier this year, I went hands-on with the HP OmniBook 5 14 (G1q), and I said it \"could be the best value AI laptop of the summer.\" It took me longer than expected to get my hands on a full production unit, but now I've had enough time with this laptop to decide if my initial impressions were spot on or off the mark. My verdict? HP made a truly great value-driven Windows laptop... but whether it's the best value depends on how you get yours. You can build your own from $899.99 at HP.com, but every option will add a sizable chunk to your final price tag. No, the way to get the OmniBook 5 14 is by sticking with the pre-built configurations. My favorite OmniBook 5 14 model is only $699.99 at BestBuy.com, and that's a sleek and capable AI PC with multi-day battery life, a vibrant OLED display, and the perfect amount of power for casual computing. That is my top value laptop of 2025, and I'll spend some time telling you exactly why. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by HP. HP had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. I recently reviewed the Dell 14 Plus (DB14255), another value-driven AI laptop in the same price range as the OmniBook 5 14, and comparing the two shows just how much HP's offering punches above its weight. \u2022 Display: 14-inch OLED, 16:10 aspect ratio, FHD+ (1920 x 1200) resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, 0.2ms response time, 300 nits max brightness, optional multi-touch support\u2022 Chipset: Up to Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 cores), Qualcomm Adreno GPU, Qualcomm Hexagon NPU (45 TOPS)\u2022 Memory: Up to 32GB LPDDR5x @ 8,448MT\/s\u2022 Storage: Up to 1TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD\u2022 Dimensions: 217 x 58 x 12.7mm (8.56 x 2.28 x 0.5in), 1.29kg (2.84lbs) This laptop is slim and light (under 13mm and 3lbs, while the Dell is around 17mm and well over 3lbs), looks more modern with its sleeker display bezels, and has superior build quality with less panel flex and tighter seams. The OmniBook 5 14's build quality definitely isn't as good as the most premium machines, but it's better than you might expect for a laptop that starts at less than $700. I like it a lot, but I do wish the port selection was more impressive. On the left side, you're looking at two USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 (10GBps) ports with 65W Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4 capabilities, and on the right you'll find one USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 2 (10GBps) drop-jaw port and a 3.5mm audio jack. I like that we still get a legacy USB-A port on such a thin laptop, but it would've been nice to get one USB4 port for more docking options. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The display is another area where the OmniBook 5 14 absolutely trounces the aforementioned Dell 14 Plus with its 1200p, 60Hz OLED panel shared across all configurations (with optional multitouch support). It's a beautiful screen, with vibrant and accurate colors (100% of sRGB and 93% of DCI-P3 color gamuts are covered in my testing), excellent contrast and viewing angles, and impeccable performance. Sure, it's not super sharp or smooth, but it's still a fantastic screen for the price point. I have to knock it down a peg, simply because it's also very dim. The OmniBook 5 14 couldn't even hit its rated 300 nits in my testing, which is very easily overwhelmed by any bright, direct light source. This screen looks amazing, but you won't be able to see it well if sunlight is a regular visitor to your workspace.      The OmniBook 5 14 (G1q) is not a powerhouse, but it was never meant to be. This is a thin-and-light Ultrabook designed with casual users in mind, and it's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon X series. This Windows on ARM laptop is all about efficiency, so it's not a strong performer when it comes to gaming, photo and video editing, or other intense workloads (especially those that rely on heavy legacy programs). For most users, though, this laptop is a splendid performer. It's snappy and responsive for web browsing, email, Microsoft Office, video conferencing, and beyond. With Microsoft recently celebrating that Windows 11 users now spend over 90% of their time in native ARM64 applications, too, performance really isn't a concern with this laptop. Trade-offs in performance are made worth it when you consider battery life. There's a meager 59Whr battery inside the OmniBook 5 14, but it still boasts some of the most impressive endurance I've seen. Looping an hour of Microsoft Office tasks and then an hour of an HD video through the Procyon benchmark suite drained just 6% and 4% of the battery, respectively. Battery life is genuinely exceptional, and it's not difficult to get two full days of work out of this machine. When you do need to charge it, HP includes an ultra-compact 65W GaN charger in the box, and it can get you a full day of usage in just 30 minutes of charging. Performance on and off the charger is practically identical, too, which is one of the greatest advantages of Qualcomm silicon. The OmniBook 5 14 avoids the new \"lattice-less\" keyboard design of some of HP's other recent releases, which is a major positive in my eyes. This keyboard is spacious, legible, and feels pretty great for typing. The keyboard backlight can be a little slow to turn on at times, but it's even and highlights every letter and symbol on the keyboard. The touchpad is more basic, with average build quality, but it's at least consistent and responsive with Microsoft Precision drivers. There's not much else to say \u2014 HP did a great job with the keyboard and touchpad. The OmniBook 5 14 is a Copilot+ PC, so it benefits from all the latest and greatest artificial intelligence features in Windows 11. Even if you don't find value in these features now, this laptop is future-proofed for years to come, and that's definitely worth something. I also appreciate HP's own AI companion, which is tastefully designed and packed with features. Overall, the OmniBook 5 14 offers an enjoyable, stable software experience... but I will criticize HP's fragmented software and injected bloatware with every consumer laptop I review from it. There's just too much fluff to remove when setting up. When it comes to the extremities, the OmniBook 5 14 never disappoints. The 1080p front-facing webcam is more than solid enough for video conferencing, and it offers Windows Hello facial recognition for quick sign-ins and a built-in physical privacy shutter. The dual, bottom-firing speakers performed better than I would've guessed, reaching shockingly high volumes with massively deteriorating in quality. They're not best-in-class by any means, but I was able to enjoy listening to music without any real complaints. Your wireless connectivity needs are handled by Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, and reflect my experience with the rest of the OmniBook 5 14's features \u2014 it's more than good enough for the price range, but it's not going to best any of the most premium laptops out there.      I had high hopes for the HP OmniBook 5 14 (G1q) when I first used it, and it's awesome to see those hopes met and then some. It's often difficult to get excited about value-driven hardware, but HP did such a fantastic job with balancing this laptop's features, performance, and price. I still like the ASUS Zenbook A14 (2025) I reviewed a little more and consider that the better laptop, but it also costs up to $300 more for similar specs. For just $699.99 at BestBuy.com (easily the best deal), there's really no other laptop that's beating the OmniBook 5 14 (G1q) for sheer value right now. HP delivered the complete package with this machine, with multi-day battery life to boot. It's an excellent companion for casual computing and is guaranteed to enjoy years of new features through Windows updates. I only wish the port selection was better.       The OmniBook 5 14 (G1q) is everything most people need from a thin, light, and long-lasting Windows laptop. It's the complete package, and it also delivers unbeatable value \u2014 especially if you get the most aggressively priced configuration from Best Buy.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"                 reading time 3 minutes        The auto giant GM announced today that it is reinvigorating its fleet with a series of new artificial intelligence and machine learning features, all expected to be rolled out within the next three years. From a new centralized computing platform to equip all of its cars to in-vehicle conversational AI chatbots customized to your needs and preferences, GM is preparing for what it believes to be a coming AI-driven auto industry. GM\u2019s buzziest feature, which will debut in 2028, is reserved, at least so far, for an electric vehicle offering. In three years, drivers of the Cadillac Escalade IQ electric SUV will be able to drive completely autonomously, not just with their hands off but also with their eyes off the road, the company claims. As long as the car is on mapped highways, you can read, text, or do whatever you want behind the wheel as the car drives you to your location, GM said. A turquoise light will flash across the dashboard and the side mirrors to signal when a car is in eyes-off driving mode. The system is equipped with lidar, radar, and cameras to build perception, while real-world driving data trains the decision-making model. \u201cOur goal is to bring to market the most trusted and scalable eyes-off driving technology on the path to personal autonomy,\u201d GM said in a press release. The revamp announcement comes as the American electric vehicle industry stands at the precipice of a giant sales drop. Since the electric vehicle tax credit expired on October 1st, electric vehicle prices in the U.S. have become even more expensive, and demand is dropping as automakers scale back EV production. GM announced that it will be taking a $1.6 billion hit this quarter, stemming from a drop in the value of its EV plants and equipment, and supplier contract cancellation costs. GM has become one of the leaders of the American EV industry, and despite scaling back production of some of its electric vehicles, company executives insist, as recently as during yesterday\u2019s earnings call, that electric vehicles are still the company\u2019s north star. The company has made a significant commitment to completely electrify its fleet by 2035. During the earnings call, GM executives forecasted that EV demand will continue to suffer into early 2026 before it levels off and finds its natural state. Once demand hits its natural stride, GM executives are confident their \u201cquality and the range of vehicles\u201d will bode well for sales in their EV division. Buzzy features like full autonomous driving could help drive sales of some of GM\u2019s electric offerings. Tesla is also ramping up efforts to scale its full self-driving technology, despite federal investigations, lawsuits, recalls, and fatal crashes miring its autonomous driving efforts. GM\u2019s chief product officer, Sterling Anderson, who recently joined the company, is a former Tesla executive who led the team that worked on Tesla Autopilot. GM has significant experience with autonomous driving, as the automaker was the first to offer rudimentary hands-free driving with Super Cruise in 2017. But it has also had its fair share of experience with the risks of autonomous vehicles. The company had to shut down its robotaxi division, Cruise, on the heels of an external probe into the company for lying to regulators about an incident in which one of its robotaxis struck a pedestrian and dragged them 20 feet. The automaker has since refocused its energy completely on Super Cruise, its autonomous driving technology for personal vehicles that is currently in use for 23 GM models. That technology is making up the foundation of the newly revealed feature as well. Among the other announcements on Wednesday was an in-vehicle Google Gemini AI chatbot to debut next year, allowing drivers to have conversations with their cars. It\u2019s the first phase of a grander plan to introduce a custom-built AI for GM vehicles, one that would be fine-tuned to your car\u2019s inner workings and your own personal preferences. The custom-built AI, which currently has no timeline except for a vague \u201cin the future,\u201d would know your food preferences to recommend a dinner spot en route to your destination and alert you about potential maintenance issues in the car. \u201cTogether, these advancements mark a turning point: AI that drives for you when you want it to, talks with you when you need it to, and gets smarter every day,\u201d the company said.

With all the AI talk, it feels like 2023 again at Netflix.                     GM is refocusing its strategy on gas-powered vehicles and cheaper EVs.                     Wikipedia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s human traffic is declining as more people rely on AI tools for answers.                     We're headed towards a real life Robocop.                     A new study found that they emit way more carbon than regulators estimated.                     The Gaming Copilot feature is currently as pointless as it sounds.          \u00c2\u00a92025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"The Xbox Ally X was quickly selling out across the UK, but has recently regained stock at Currys for a limited time.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  2:46 PM BST: Sold out! That was fast. Currys is officially out of stock of the ROG Xbox Ally X, barely two hours after this announcement. We'll keep an eye out for more availability. It's been nearly a week since the launch of the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X, and the latter has already sold out throughout the United Kingdom at various retailers. Fortunately, the UK-exclusive store, Currys, has brought in a fresh new batch of Xbox Ally handhelds for \u00a3799.00, so UK Xbox fans have another chance to get their hands on this powerful gaming handheld before it sells out again.  \"ASUS ROG and Microsoft have hit it out of the park with this next-gen handheld gaming PC. Its solid performance, sleek design, comfortable grips, and useful ports work together to make it one of the best Windows handhelds on the market right now.\u00a0\" \u2014 Rebecca SpearWindows Central review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\ud83d\udc49 See at: Currys (UK)      The Xbox Ally X is one of the most powerful gaming handhelds on the market that builds upon the foundations laid by its predecessor, the ASUS ROG Ally X. It can run games at a smooth 60+ FPS with a 1080p resolution thanks to its Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 7-inch FHD IPS touchscreen, which features a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz and AMD FreeSync Premium. The Xbox Ally X also includes efficient cooling systems to prevent it from overheating during many hours of use while being silent, so it doesn't distract you. Plus, it has extra comfortable grips that rest well within your hands and won't cause your wrists to strain if you use them for several hours. Additionally, it has USB4-C and USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports so you can charge it and plug in accessories at the same time.      The only major drawbacks of this Xbox handheld are that Windows optimization isn't up to the standards of home PCs yet, as of this writing, it does not have an OLED screen, and it doesn't feature touchpads or Hall Effect sensors for its joysticks and triggers. Plus, the Xbox Rog Ally Xit has a short battery life of up to 2 hours when running AAA games, roughly 6 hours when playing less-graphically intense indie games on Silent Mode, and approximately 14.5 hours when used for general browsing or office work tasks in Windows Mode.      If you don't mind those flaws, as well as having the budget to meet its exceedingly high MSRP of \u00a3799.00, then the Xbox Ally X is a worthy handheld for those who wish to experience premium handheld gaming. Even Shuhei Yoshida, a former PlayStation executive, can\u2019t get enough of the Xbox Ally X, so you know this handheld is something special. You'd better act fast, however, as it's quickly selling out all over the place across the UK, so there's no telling how long it will remain in stock at Currys for \u00a3799.00 before it's gone. Certainly, as you will be able to play your digital games on the Xbox Ally X if they have Xbox Play Anywhere support, or if they can be streamed via remote play if they are part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's library. Yes. You can play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on the Xbox Ally X when it becomes available to download, Day One, on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, and stream via Xbox Cloud Gaming. No, the Xbox Ally X can only play digital games via the Xbox Store, Xbox Remote Play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, or Steam. Yes, you can play games offline on the Xbox Ally X, provided they are fully downloaded with their post-launch updates from the launchers you bought them at before activating their offline modes.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Our machine-driven multifactor analysis suggests it may be time to sell JNJ stock, as we hold a pessimistic outlook with a potential target price of $134. The company\u2019s Moderate operating performance and financial health, combined with its High valuation, make the stock appear Unattractive. Several concerning trends are emerging. First, Stelara - J&J\u2019s blockbuster drug for autoimmune diseases like Crohn\u2019s and psoriasis - is seeing steep sales declines as biosimilar competition intensifies, signaling growing pressure on one of J&J\u2019s key profit drivers. Second, the ongoing talc litigation continues to escalate, with thousands of lawsuits and recent adverse verdicts highlighting persistent legal overhang. Finally, drug pricing reforms under the Inflation Reduction Act are expected to weigh on revenue across major therapies such as Stelara, Xarelto, and Imbruvica, tightening margins and challenging growth visibility.    Below is our evaluation: Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant benefit in the diversified approach we utilize with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock that appeals to you or create a portfolio structured for success across different market cycles? Our analysis demonstrates that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed the uncertainties of stock selection into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is integrated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a wealth manager based in the Boston area and partner of Trefis \u2013 whose asset allocation framework yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 financial crisis when the S&P lost more than 40%.

The factors behind this upward trend include exceptional earnings, a surge in deman d for AI chips, and significant innovation\u2014creating an environment for a market growth that is unprecedented. Let\u2019s explore the elements that genuinely fueled this increase. So what\u2019s going on? The stock price surged by 101%, powered by a 24% increase in revenue, a 13% rise in net margin, and a 40% increase in P\/E multiple. Let\u2019s examine the main drivers behind these advances. Before delving into the specifics of the events that resulted in the stock spike, it\u2019s useful to note what market wisdom indicates: Investing in individual stocks can carry risks, but a broader diversified strategy offers significant value, as emphasized by our approach with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, reflect on the potential long-term performance of your portfolio if you included 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Opinion: At present, we consider LRCX stock to be fairly priced. Why is this the case? Read the complete story. Check Buy or Sell LRCX Stock to understand what underpins our current viewpoint. Risk: To gauge the risk associated with LRCX, observe its performance during past market declines. The stock fell approximately 75% during the Dot-Com Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis. The Inflation Shock decreased it by over 56%, while both the 2018 Correction and the Covid Pandemic caused declines of nearly 45%. Despite strong fundamentals, LRCX is not protected against severe market sell-offs. These downturns serve as a reminder that no stock is entirely secure amidst widespread recessions. Picking consistent winners is a challenging endeavor\u2014particularly given the volatility that can accompany individual stocks. Therefore, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which contains 30 stocks, has demonstrated a consistent ability to outperform the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; the experience has been less volatile, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Intuitive Surgical stock (NASDAQ: ISRG) experienced an impressive 17% increase in extended trading on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, after significantly exceeding investor expectations with its Q3 results across all key metrics. The pioneer in medical robotics not only posted strong quarterly figures but also revised its full-year guidance upward, indicating ongoing momentum within the robotic surgery market. In the sections below, we will explore ISRG\u2019s recent quarterly performance and assess the stock\u2019s valuation after this notable surge. That said, if you\u2019re looking for upside with reduced volatility compared to holding individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has consistently outperformed its benchmark\u2014which includes a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014achieving returns of over 105% since its inception. Why is this? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have generated better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they have experienced less volatility, as indicated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. ISRG\u2019s Q3 results were remarkable. The company achieved revenue of $2.51 billion, representing a substantial 23% increase from $2.04 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP earnings per share reached $2.40, vastly surpassing analyst forecasts of $1.99 and reflecting a 30% rise from $1.84 in the same quarter of the previous year. What drives this growth? The main factor remains strong procedure volume, with global procedures utilizing da Vinci and Ion systems together increasing by about 20% year-over-year. Da Vinci procedures rose by 19%, while Ion procedures experienced a remarkable 52% surge. Looking forward, management has elevated its full-year guidance for da Vinci procedure growth to 17-17.5%, exceeding analyst expectations of 16.4%.\u200b Is ISRG stock overvalued following this surge? We don\u2019t believe so. Currently, ISRG stock trades at roughly 71 times its reported earnings for the trailing twelve months, which is indeed lower than the four-year average of 75 times. Even when considering adjusted earnings, the P\/E ratio generally aligns with its historical average in light of the recent uptrend. However, with the company forecasting superior growth rates, investors might justifiably consider a higher multiple than ISRG\u2019s long-term average, potentially leading to additional upside for the stock. Overall, ISRG stock offers a unique opportunity: monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. The company's core strength lies in its pricing power and sustained profitability, which generate consistent, predictable profits and cash flows. This stability significantly reduces risk and allows for continuous capital reinvestment\u2014qualities the market tends to reward. *LTM: Last Twelve Months Despite this exceptional financial profile, the stock appears to be available at a discount. Its current Price-to-Sales (P\/S) multiple of 18 represents a 23% discount compared to a year ago. Could we be mistaken in our optimistic evaluation? ISRG stock has historically shown vulnerability during market downturns, frequently suffering steeper declines than the benchmark S&P 500 index. During the inflation shock of 2022, ISRG stock plummeted 50% from a high of $365 on November 8, 2021, to $183 on October 14, 2022, in contrast to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. Similarly, amid the COVID pandemic in 2020, ISRG stock fell 40.5% from a high of $206 on February 20, 2020, to $123 on March 23, 2020, compared to a 33.9% decline in the S&P 500. These historical trends indicate that ISRG\u2019s premium valuation makes it particularly vulnerable to broader market fluctuations and economic uncertainty.\u200b See, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has consistently outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), generating strong returns for investors. Why is this? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a strategic approach to maximize benefits during favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The company\u2019s consistent ability to exceed expectations while raising guidance showcases the strength of its competitive advantage in robotic surgery. With the accelerating adoption of the da Vinci 5 system and growing traction for the Ion platform, ISRG seems well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing transition toward minimally invasive procedures. While the stock\u2019s premium valuation necessitates ongoing successful execution, the combination of robust procedure growth, expanding market opportunities, and proven operational excellence implies that ISRG continues to be an appealing long-term investment, even after the recent surge.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"     The new, stripped-back versions of the Model Y and Model 3 have a more affordable starting price.    This is the Tesla Model Y Standard model in white driving on an LA road. Notice the front opts for regular headlights instead of the light bar from the regular version Tesla has finally delivered on the demand of many\u00a0electric car\u00a0shoppers, unveiling entry-level versions of the\u00a0refreshed Model Y\u00a0and\u00a0Model 3. As expected, Tesla didn't launch an all-new car, but rather more stripped-back configurations of the existing models that lower the entry price, making it easier for more buyers to step into Tesla ownership. This is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see this as a move that could significantly increase Tesla ownership. While the EVs have been appealing, the price has remained a sticking point.\u00a0 The idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by cutting out the extras most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move. It comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be looking for cheaper options. According to June figures from\u00a0Kelley Blue Book, the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $48,644. That's 2% lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about 13% more than prices in June 2021. This is what the rear of the Tesla Model Y Standard looks like -- it keeps the same light bar from the regular version. The Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated 321 miles of range, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD. Inside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and 4-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen without physical buttons.\u00a0 Tesla includes a 7-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not. The rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed off internally with a fabric headliner for better insulation, and the mirrors are manual-folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter. The Model Y Standard rides on 18-inch wheels as standard, with 19-inch wheels available as an additional option, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\u00a0 The front of a Tesla Model 3 Standard driving along a road. It looks identical to the regular Model 3. Meanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\u00a0 Tesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation. It retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\u00a0 Charging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options. Both cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\u00a0 Full Self-Driving is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance. I think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\u00a0 In my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet. Pricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\u00a0 For now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"We all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands.  In an industry worth \u00a35.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics. The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right. Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair.  Ever shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair?  Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair.  \"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in. She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin. If you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution. Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it. Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair. \"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\" She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution. Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue. \"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\" You may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all.  But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\"  Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too.  Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\". Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.   Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it. Finding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower.  Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes.  The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out.  \"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says.  \"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\" Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) has quickly emerged as one of Wall Street\u2019s most exciting narratives. The stock has risen more than 100% over the last month, driven by an influx of optimism regarding U.S. lithium policy, government support, and increasing confidence in its key Thacker Pass project. For a company that spent a significant portion of the previous year in obscurity, this surge has been truly extraordinary \u2014 prompting investors to ponder a new question: after more than doubling, could LAC potentially double again? However, if you are looking for growth with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark\u2014a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has generated returns exceeding 105% since inception. Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment experience, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In addition, take a look at What\u2019s Next for Navitas Semiconductor Stock? The rally commenced after news emerged that the U.S. government is considering a minority equity investment in Lithium Americas as part of its initiative to secure critical minerals. This potential support, along with renewed progress on the company\u2019s $2.26 billion Department of Energy loan, fundamentally altered how investors perceive the stock. Thacker Pass \u2014 LAC\u2019s enormous lithium project in Nevada \u2014 is one of the largest identified lithium resources in North America, and federal backing would mitigate the financing risks while establishing the U.S. as a significant player in the global battery supply chain. Investor sentiment shifted almost instantly. What was previously viewed as a long-shot development play quickly began trading as a strategic national asset. Lithium spot prices have also rebounded, electric vehicle demand remains robust, and the political emphasis on domestic supply independence has provided the sector with a substantial tailwind. This blend of government attention, macro momentum, and speculative excitement has driven LAC\u2019s rapid ascent. At approximately $7 per share and a market capitalization close to $1.7 billion, Lithium Americas is no longer considered inexpensive, but the rationale for further growth is clear if the company follows through. The first stage of Thacker Pass aims to produce around 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) annually. At current market rates of approximately $20,000 per tonne, that output could yield roughly $800 million in yearly revenue once it is fully operational. If operating margins eventually reach 25%, that results in about $200 million in annual profit. Applying a moderate 20\u00d7 earnings multiple, which aligns with other clean-energy growth opportunities, suggests a potential valuation close to $4 billion \u2014 or roughly $14\u2013$16 per share. That essentially represents a doubling from current levels. The calculations are not based on extreme assumptions \u2014 they present a realistic \u201csuccess case\u201d if the project progresses smoothly, lithium prices stay strong, and dilution is minimized. In summary, the market is wagering that Lithium Americas can evolve from being a story stock into a cash-flow-generating domestic producer in the coming years. If that occurs, the stock could indeed see its valuation increase \u2014 but the margin for error is narrow. On top of the numbers, there\u2019s a compelling narrative at work. The concept of a U.S.-based lithium mine supported by federal financing aligns perfectly with the current strategic themes that captivate markets. For years, the U.S. has fallen behind China, Australia, and South America in establishing lithium supply chains. A fully funded, government-backed Thacker Pass project could alter that landscape. This situation is no longer solely about a mining company \u2014 it\u2019s intertwined with energy independence, national policy, and the future of electric vehicles. That\u2019s why the stock has witnessed such heightened momentum: institutional investors, retail traders, and speculative capital are all rallying around a singular idea \u2014 that LAC could emerge as the first major American lithium producer at scale. Yet, amidst all the enthusiasm, substantial risks remain. The DOE loan has not yet been finalized, and any shifts in political priorities or financing conditions could postpone or derail the agreement. The project itself is intricate, necessitating billions in initial capital, careful environmental management, and years of construction before production can commence. In mining, timelines frequently slip, and any delays can diminish market confidence. Lithium prices also represent another major variable. The profitability that makes Thacker Pass appealing at $20,000 per tonne could diminish significantly if a global oversupply drives prices back toward $10,000. Additionally, Lithium Americas may still need to secure more capital, which could lead to further dilution of existing shareholders. After experiencing a threefold increase, investors will have limited tolerance for unexpected developments. Lithium Americas\u2019 extraordinary rally reflects the market\u2019s conviction that it has transcended being just a small mining developer \u2014 it has become a cornerstone of America\u2019s clean-energy aspirations. The stock is now viewed as a leveraged bet on U.S. policy, momentum in energy transition, and lithium\u2019s long-term significance to the EV supply chain. Could it double again? Mathematically, yes \u2014 if Thacker Pass operates as intended and the government financing materializes, a $4 billion valuation is attainable. However, the path to that goal is fraught with challenges, and any misstep could lead to a significant decline in the stock price. For the time being, LAC remains a high-risk, high-reward opportunity at the intersection of policy, mining, and the clean-energy future. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period \u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. .

Here's what you need to know today.   Stock futures are little changed after the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record high Tuesday, boosted by big gains for a couple of blue chip companies that reported strong quarterly results. The earnings calendar is busy again this morning, but the big release is scheduled for after the closing bell, when Tesla (TSLA) is due to report. Futures tied to the Dow and the benchmark S&P 500 were hovering near unchanged in recent trading, while Nasdaq futures slipped 0.2%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $107,900, down from a high on Tuesday of around $114,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can affect mortgage rates and other consumer loans, was at 3.94%, down from 3.96% at yesterday's close and trading at its lowest levels since early April.   Gold continues to lose ground after the precious metal recorded its steepest one-day decline in a dozen years on Tuesday. Gold futures were down 1.4% at $4,055 an ounce in recent trading, after dropping nearly 6% on Tuesday. Investors are anticipating an end to the\u00a0U.S. government shutdown and a potential U.S. trade deal with China, both of which could help calm the market uncertainty that pushed gold to a series of record highs recently as investors turned to safe-haven assets. Silver futures, which also have been trading at record highs, were down this morning after a steep decline yesterday.   Tesla (TSLA) is scheduled to report third-quarter results after markets close today, the first of the Magnificent Seven major technology companies to release results this earnings cycle. Tesla vehicle deliveries in the quarter topped analysts' expectations, and Wall Street will be looking for further details on consumer demand and the rollout of low-cost models. Investors will also be eager to hear updates on full-self driving software, robotaxis and humanoid robot Optimus, as the company leans into its AI transformation. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect Tesla to report revenue of $26.6 billion and net income of $1.5 billion. Options pricing suggests traders expect Tesla shares to make a big move after the earnings report. The stock, which gained 33% over the past three months, was little changed in premarket trading.   Netflix (NFLX) shares are falling after the streaming giant\u2019s quarterly income came in below analysts' expectations amid a tax dispute in Brazil. The company reported earnings per share of $5.87 and revenue of $11.51 billion, lower than the EPS of $6.92 on revenue of $11.52 billion that analysts tracked by Visible Alpha anticipated. Netflix officials said that a charge related to a 10% Brazilian tax on certain payments was not in its forecast and affected its bottom line. \u201cOur operating income would have exceeded our forecast absent the Brazilian tax matter,\u201d Co-CEO Gregory Peters said on a conference call. Shares of Netflix were down more than 7% ahead of the opening bell.   DraftKings (DKNG) shares are higher after the firm announced it would acquire Railbird Technologies, providing an opportunity for the sports betting app to enter the lucrative predictions market. The move comes as prediction markets, which aren't subject to the same types of regulation as sports betting, have boomed this year, with companies such as Kalshi and Polymarket attracting significant investor interest. \u201cWe are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business,\u201d said DraftKings CEO Jason Robins in a release.

Even the less severe downturns delivered significant losses, so it\u2019s important to keep that in mind when evaluating risk. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, and outlook changes. Read the META Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Business is booming at Microsoft, and its CEO isn't going to go hungry.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Microsoft has had a great fiscal year, and for his trouble, CEO Satya Nadella is being compensated to the tune of $96.5 million, up about 22% compared to his $79 million last year. While a lot of that compensation comes in the form of stock awards \u2014 about $84 million of it \u2014 the other $9.5 million is awarded in cash incentives, according to a proxy statement filed on Tuesday. The rest of the take-home is based on Nadella's standard $2.5 million salary before incentives and bonuses. Nadella's windfall arrives in the wake of the AI boom that Microsoft has been so keen on driving with its hardware, software, data centers, and partnerships. In July, Microsoft became the second company to hit a $4 trillion market cap, following NVIDIA into the exclusive club. While that number has fallen below $4 trillion in the months following, it's undoubtedly been a stellar year for Microsoft's revenue. According to Microsoft's 2025 Q4 earnings report, the company pushed its overall 2025 revenue to $281.7 billion, an increase of 15%. Perhaps most notable was the impressive 34% revenue increase driven by Azure, which surpassed $75 billion in revenue for the first time. Much of that growth is based on meeting the ever-growing demand for AI compute power. The proxy filing includes details regarding Nadella's AI-specific achievements: According to Microsoft's Compensation Committee, in a letter attached to a proxy statement, \"Satya Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift, enabling Microsoft to drive long-term growth through innovation, security, and quality.\" All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Satya Nadella is Microsoft's third CEO, taking over for Steve Ballmer in 2014. Since his appointment, Nadella's pay has grown steadily. In 2015, for example, he took home about $18 million, a small sum compared to 2025's $96.5 million. Nadella published an annual letter to shareholders at the same time as the proxy filing was made public, reiterating Microsoft's main goal in 2025: \"We must earn our permission to operate every day, in every country, every community, and every customer interaction. That\u2019s why we remain grounded in our mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\"      It wouldn't be much fun to drool over these massive pay packages without acknowledging the fact that Microsoft has laid off a lot of employees in 2025. The running tally at this point has climbed to more than 15,000 cut jobs, which began in January 2025 with layoffs across multiple sectors, including gaming and security. In May, it was reported that Microsoft was cutting 3% of its workforce, targeting management. This resulted in roughly 6,000 jobs lost. In June, Microsoft cut another 305 Washington-based employees. Following Microsoft's end of fiscal year in July, the company announced layoffs for 9,000 workers worldwide, affecting various \"levels, teams, geographies, and tenure.\" And, finally, in September, more than 40 roles were axed in Redmond, Microsoft's home base. In the grand scope of things, a company as big as Microsoft with around 228,000 employees is bound to suffer layoffs. Nevertheless, it's always a sad story, and it's entirely too common for a company raking in billions of dollars in revenue. But, as we all know, that's how capitalism works. Earlier this year, Microsoft's CEO shared a public message on the Microsoft blog in which he expressed his \"sincere gratitude to those who have left.\" Before anything else, I want to speak to what\u2019s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations. These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we\u2019ve worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with\u2014our colleagues, teammates, and friends. If you're wondering why CEOs like Nadella don't take pay cuts to offset layoffs, ex-Microsoft HR VP Chris Williams can offer some insight. According to Williams, cutting executive pay wouldn't be enough to offset the gains achieved from layoffs. A company like Microsoft can incur up to a billion dollars in costs for about 10,000 employees, which is far more than someone like Nadella pulls in. The $96.5 million compensation package is just that \u2014 a package, containing salary, bonuses, and stock options. Nadella takes home about $12 million outside of stock, which is far from enough to keep 15,000 employees behind a desk at Microsoft. I'm not making excuses for the layoffs; just demonstrating that it's a convoluted system of compensation. As Windows Central Executive Editor, Jez Corden, remarked while discussing the long-term impacts of Microsoft's 2025 layoff spree, Microsoft's strategy of boosting stock price rather than providing high-quality products could come back to haunt the company.

Dealmaking is heating up again, and founders eyeing an IPO or sale are facing a new kind of challenge: what to do with the sudden wealth that follows. A new 25-page report published by Goldman's private wealth and investment banking professionals lays out the decisions founders need to prepare for once they cash out. It outlines six steps that company leaders should take: be clear about your business's future, consider tax structures, set up a family and estate plan, organize liquidity, factor in existing loans and liabilities, protect your assets and family, and develop a philanthropic strategy. The message is especially important for founders right now: mergers were up this past quarter, and the IPO market was regaining steam before the government shutdown. But the bank didn't generate the report because of the hot merger market; instead, its findings are meant to be educational for founders anytime, Kerry Blum \u2014 global head of the firm's equity structuring group, which helps some of the world's wealthiest business people structure their portfolios \u2014 told Business Insider. The report \u2014 \"Beyond the Build: A Wealth Planning Guide for a Business Exit or IPO\" \u2014 walks readers through how to structure a deal, manage new liquidity, and prepare the next generation for a sudden influx of wealth. \"When I look at the work that we do with founders and entrepreneurs, we really have to think about the entire life cycle\" across the corporate and personal lenses, said Blum, a Goldman partner. Here's a look at four of their top takeaways. Founders should consider \"personal planning\" \u2014 how they'll handle their newfound assets \u2014 around the time they begin diligence on potential acquirers or even before. Why? \"The timeline of a delay could be derailed entirely by delays stemming from personal planning objectives missed in the early stages,\" the bank warns. Founders should be upfront about their goals \u2014 including the selling price and ongoing ownership structures \u2014 and should be deliberate in selecting the right exit plan. A merger? A private sale? Sales and public offerings can convert years of illiquid equity into cash, the report says, suggesting that the sudden liquidity landslide can be overwhelming without support. Each path comes with its own tax considerations, as well as the level of control, cash, and future influence the founder will maintain. \"I've seen entrepreneurs who very much want to maintain a sense of control as part of the exit,\" Blum said, adding: \"I've seen entrepreneurs who have decided that maybe in their next phase they want to pass off some of the operational elements.\" Assembling a strong team well before a transaction closes can help crystallize such decisions, the bank says. At Goldman, \"in many cases, it will be that the banking team is well engaged with the client, and they think there's an opportunity for the client to benefit from the expertise that we can offer on the wealth management side. And so they will introduce a two-way dialogue,\" Blum said. To that end, Goldman urged, do not delay in appointing these trusted advisors. CEOs need to bring together not just their C-suite counterparts, but also personal advisors, including wealth managers and trust officers. The questions this team can help you answer are manifold: Should you sell to a strategic or a financial sponsor? Is a public offering really the right route? \"We try to make sure founders carefully evaluate how their day-to-day would be different and the type of scrutiny they'd face if taking their company public, compared with selling to a sponsor or strategic buyer,\" Alekhya Uppalapti \u2014 a managing director in the investment bank's global technology, media, and telecommunications group \u2014 says in the report. The report's most technical section delves into different kinds of business structures that founders should consider: an S-corporation doesn't pay federal taxes at the corporate level, whereas a C-corporation pays taxes on its profits. Navigating the thicket of this jargon can be confusing, so the firm suggests using an estate planning attorney to \"align\" immediate-term goals around tax efficiency with long-term needs like setting up a professional trustee to protect newfound wealth. Trusts such as grantor-retained annuity trusts or charitable lead trusts can help transfer wealth and reduce tax exposure. Blum said tailoring those choices to each client's objectives is one of the most complex steps in the process. \"That is certainly one where understanding the individual's goals and objectives,\" she said, \"whether it's regional or generational wealth planning, philanthropy, et cetera, is incredibly important. And matching that with the jurisdictional considerations is key to getting it right.\" Beyond that, entrepreneurs should consider organizing a will, a revocable or living trust, a healthcare proxy, and guidance for end-of-life medical instructions, the bank added. It is not only the founder's life that changes after a major sale or IPO, the report suggests, but also the lives of family members. Goldman's guide devotes an entire section to preparing the next generation. \"Regularly scheduled family meetings, which can be facilitated with the support of your financial advisor, can help effectively convey lessons on the responsibilities of wealth and philanthropy,\" it says. Blum said Goldman brings clients together in small forums where they can share insights and experiences, a think tank of sorts for those about to step into a new way of life. Privacy is also a consideration. \"Different types of transactions bring different levels of visibility,\" Blum added. The report recommends consulting your financial advisor about a wide range of topics, including physical and digital security protocols, as well as private aviation.

Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Samsung\u2019s move into extended reality (XR) is off to a surprising start. Only a few hours after the Galaxy XR headset launched, its optional controllers sold out in the U.S. The Galaxy XR made its debut in the US and South Korea with a hefty $1,800 price tag, marking Samsung\u2019s return to the high-end headset game. The company also offered a pair of tracked controllers for an additional $250, or $175 during a brief launch discount. However, the option to purchase them vanished from Samsung\u2019s U.S. website shortly after the headset went live. While it\u2019s still possible to grab a few units in South Korea, the U.S. stock seems to be wiped out completely, and Samsung hasn\u2019t said when more will arrive. The situation is more than just a case of high demand for accessories. The Galaxy XR is designed to operate on its own, using a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google\u2019s collaborative software. That\u2019s great for casual mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or spatial apps. But for anyone hoping to dive into more immersive VR titles or PC-VR content, the lack of controllers is a serious setback since many games simply won\u2019t work without them.      Interestingly, Samsung has been clear that gaming isn\u2019t the main focus of the Galaxy XR. Instead, it\u2019s pitching the headset as a device built for productivity, creativity, and entertainment rather than the kind of intense VR gaming that Meta\u2019s Quest lineup targets. That might explain why the controllers are sold separately and weren\u2019t bundled with the headset at launch. Still, given how quickly they sold out, it\u2019s obvious that plenty of buyers are eager to use the Galaxy XR for more traditional VR experiences. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android For now, Galaxy XR owners in the US are left with two options: wait for Samsung to restock the controllers or make do with the built-in controls until then. Either way, the rapid sell-out shows there\u2019s strong interest in Samsung\u2019s new mixed-reality platform, perhaps even more than the company anticipated. If Samsung plans to expand the Galaxy XR\u2019s availability beyond its initial two markets, it might want to ensure its accessory supply can keep up with the growing excitement.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. RTX (RTX)\u2018s stock surged by 43%, driven by rising profitability and a healthier P\/E ratio, propelled by a strong Q3 performance, increasing demand, and significant contract wins. With high hopes for engine upgrades and positive analyst opinions, the upward trend appears far from finished. So what is going on? The stock price increased by 43%, primarily due to a 31% rise in net margin, in addition to a 7.5% growth in the P\/E multiple and a modest 2.3% increase in revenue. Here's what contributed to this growth. Before we delve into the details of the events that caused the stock surge, here is what market wisdom suggests: Investing in a single stock can be risky, however, there is substantial value in a diversified approach. If you are looking for potential gains with less volatility than holding a single stock, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) \u2013 HQ has outperformed its benchmark \u2013 a mixture of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, yielding returns beyond 105% since its initiation. Managing risk is essential \u2013 think about what long-term portfolio performance might look like if you combined 10% in commodities, 10% in gold, and 2% in crypto with HQ\u2019s performance metrics. Opinion: We presently consider RTX stock to be unattractive. Why is that? Take a look at the complete story. Read Buy or Sell RTX Stock to understand what informs our current view. Risk: A practical method to assess risk with RTX is to observe its most significant declines during major market upheavals. It fell around 52% during the Dot-Com Bubble and similarly dropped about 53% during the Global Financial Crisis. The Covid selloff also saw a 52% decrease. Even less severe occurrences, such as the 2018 Correction and Inflation Shock, resulted in declines of approximately 28% and 33%. Therefore, regardless of any strengths the company demonstrates, these figures remind us that RTX is not immune when the market declines. Identifying winners consistently is a challenging endeavor \u2013 particularly due to the volatility linked with single stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, boasts a history of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? In aggregate, the HQ Portfolio stocks provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they offered a smoother ride, as depicted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Here is our perspective on why Gartner (IT) stock deserves attention: It is expanding, generating cash, and is currently priced at a considerable valuation discount. Let\u2019s examine the figures. Free Cash Flow Yield is defined as free cash flow per share divided by stock price. Why is this significant? If a company generates a substantial amount of cash per share, it can be utilized to fuel further revenue growth, or simply disbursed through dividends or buybacks to shareholders. For a brief overview, Gartner offers research, conferences for professional development and networking, as well as consulting services that include market research, custom analysis, and support services. Investing in a single stock can involve risks, but there is considerable value in a wider diversified strategy. If you are looking for potential gains with lower volatility than that of holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) \u2013 HQ has surpassed its benchmark \u2013 a mixture of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, achieving returns that have exceeded 105% since its inception. Effective risk management is crucial \u2013 consider the potential long-term performance of a portfolio blended with 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside HQ\u2019s performance metrics. But do these statistics present the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell IT Stock to find out if Gartner still possesses an advantage that withstands scrutiny. The following statistics are derived from the \u201chigh FCF yield at growth and discount\u201d selection strategy since 12\/31\/2016. The stats are calculated based on selections made monthly, assuming that a stock, once selected, cannot be chosen again for the next 180 days. That being said, IT stocks are not shielded from significant declines. They dropped 75% during the Dot-Com bubble and over 70% during the Global Financial Crisis. The corrections in 2018 and the inflation shock were not as severe but still exhibited declines of around 26% and 34%. Even the Covid sell-off came with nearly a 50% drop. Strong fundamentals provide some buffer, but when the market shifts, sharp declines are part of the landscape. However, the risk extends beyond significant market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions \u2013 consider events like earnings releases, business updates, and outlook revisions. Read IT Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines in the past. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor \u2013 particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"There\u2019s been a lot of doubt about the number of iPhone Air orders being placed by customers, given that delivery times have never slipped between launch and today.. A Nikkei report today adds fuel to the fire, suggesting that Apple has slashed its own orders to suppliers to levels normally only seen as a product winds down to the end of production \u2026 One key sign of a new Apple product\u2019s popularity is just how quickly estimated delivery times slip. For new iPhone models, that can sometimes happen literally within minutes of a model going on sale. But availability of the iPhone Air remained immediate for both delivery and in-store pickup at launch, and that hasn\u2019t changed at all since then. Both analysts and market intelligence agencies have also pointed to very muted demand for Apple\u2019s slimmest ever iPhone. Morgan Stanley predicted boosted production of the other three new iPhone models, but notably did not do so for the iPhone Air. Counterpoint Research pointed to strong demand for the base model iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but again nothing on the iPhone Air. A new Nikkei Asia report claims that Apple has slashed its production orders for the iPhone Air to nearly end of production levels, despite what was initially reported to be strong demand when the model went on sale in China. Apple is drastically cutting iPhone Air production orders [\u2026] Nikkei Asia has learned. Production orders for the iPhone Air have been cut nearly to \u201cend of production\u201d levels, despite it only becoming available in China last week, due to weak demand in other markets, multiple sources briefed on the matter said [\u2026] \u201cThe total forecast has almost entered end-of-production mode, dropping significantly compared to earlier projections, to only about 10% fewer orders compared with September starting in November,\u201d one of the component supplier managers said. The good news for Apple is that overall production across the new iPhone range is said to be in line with its forecasts. That is, \u201cunexpectedly robust demand\u201d for the iPhone 17 models has compensated for weak demand for the iPhone Air. By contrast, demand for the iPhone 17 model and iPhone 17 Pro has exceeded expectations. Apple has increased production orders for the baseline iPhone 17 by about 5 million units and also added orders for the high-end iPhone 17 Pro, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. They are trying since the iPhone 12 to put a fourth model in their main lineup\u2026 they went small then big then different. It is time to acknowledge that may be there is no room for a fourth iPhone until possibly the foldable one! 3 seemed like the good number (8\/8Plus\/X all the way to the 11\/11pro\/max) Using indirect signals as a proxy for demand for a new Apple product is never an exact science. While delivery times for one phone quickly slipping and another model remaining immediately available does certainly give strong clues as to likely demand, it can also just mean that Apple got its initial sums wrong. For example, if Apple expected iPhone Air orders to make up 15% of total demand, and stock-piled accordingly, then it would continue to have immediate availability if actual orders comprised 14%. In this case, however, the totality of the evidence does strongly suggest that the iPhone Air has proven significantly less popular than Apple had hoped.

While many cars today encourage you to keep your eyes on the highway, General Motors has unveiled a new \"eyes-off\" self-driving feature that will allow the opposite. Arriving in 2028, GM said the new eyes-off driving will be offered in its Cadillac Escalade IQ, an electric SUV, during highway driving. GM said that as long as there's turquoise lighting on the dashboard and outside mirrors signaling the system is working, drivers can read or go through their inboxes \"while the vehicle handles the drive.\" The upcoming feature is part of GM's roadmap to autonomous driving, which CEO Mary Barra outlined at a Wednesday event in New York. While the eyes-off feature will be limited to highways when it arrives, Barra described GM's vision for a fully autonomous future. \"Let's fast forward a few years. Imagine you step into your vehicle, you push a button, and it drives you to the office. You catch up on work, send emails, or watch an episode of your favorite show,\" Barra said at the GM Forward event. \"The car drops you off, and it notices it's time for a break inspection, and heads to the dealership,\" Barra said. \"Then it goes to get your dry cleaning, take out for dinner, and it comes back in time so you can drive your kids to their soccer game.\" Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson said at the event that GM is starting with eyes-off driving on the highway \"because that's where autonomous technology delivers the greatest immediate impact.\" Commuters, he said, spend on average five hours each week doing \"monotonous driving.\" GM also said that drivers will be able to chat with AI as soon as next year, when the company integrates Google Gemini into its vehicles. Drivers can send messages and plan detailed routes by talking to the AI, and the company plans to integrate its own custom AI system into its vehicles, which will give information on things like maintenance needs and the best routes. The future system could, for example, coach a driver through parallel parking, queue up an audiobook, or flag an unusual vibration and give directions to a nearby servicing center, senior vice president of software engineering David Richardson said. GM's announcement comes on the heels of better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday. The stock for the country's biggest automaker ticked slightly up following the news, and is trading up more than 25% since the start of the year. GM's eyes-off technology relies on Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR, a sensor that scans a vehicle's environment with laser beams and measures the time it takes to get a return signal. Waymo's robotaxis use LiDAR, but Tesla's vehicles don't. Instead, Tesla uses a vision-only system that relies solely on cameras. Elon Musk has repeatedly criticized LiDAR, calling it unnecessary and expensive. Tesla's stock was trading down more than 1% after the announcement. At the GM Forward event, the company also said its engineers are developing software for collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" that are hitting the ground at assembly plants this year. \"These are robots designed to work side-by-side with people,\" Anderson said, adding that, ideally, the cobots will eventually be able to \"adapt to any role.\"               Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Among all the growth-minded investors who have seen their portfolios soar through this year\u2019s AI craze, one familiar name has outperformed the rest. Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 87.1% in the last year, outperforming every other ETF and mutual fund tracked by the American Association of Individual Investors as of the end of September aside from single-stock funds. Its gains have been largely fueled by AI-related stocks like Palantir Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Tempus AI, and its longtime largest holding, Tesla, which Wood tells Forbes is the \u201clargest AI project on earth,\u201d marveling at its work developing robotaxis. The last time Wood was riding this high following her flagship fund\u2019s 157% return in 2020, her idealism and stubborn conviction soon backfired, leading to a 14% loss in 2021 and a dreadful 67% crash in 2022. Even after it has tripled since then, it remains 42% below its February 2021 peak. The flagship fund has $8.3 billion in assets under management, down from $17 billion at the end of 2020, signaling that most investors abandoned her fund during its slide. Wood dismisses any notion that she is being swept up in another bubble like the Covid-19 stock surge. \u201cThe companies investing in AI are some of the most profitable companies in the world,\u201d says Wood. \u201cThe reasoning models are astounding people in terms of how much more they can do if you give these models time. I think there were a lot of people expecting at some point the performance would level out. It's not leveling out at all.\u201d Almost every AI stock has performed well this year, but Wood, Ark\u2019s 69-year-old founder, CEO and chief investment officer, has had a nose for the biggest winners even relative to their peers. Ark owns more AMD than larger competitor Nvidia, two semiconductor stocks that make up 4.0% and 1.1% of ARKK\u2019s portfolio, respectively, a prescient choice with AMD doubling in value this year compared to Nvidia\u2019s more modest 36% gain. Wood says AMD\u2019s lower valuation at less than $400 million, while Nvidia\u2019s market cap is $4.4 trillion, makes its growth prospects more appealing, and its superiority in chips with more expansive memory is becoming more of a differentiator. Palantir has done far better, gaining 337% since last November. Its data analytics technology helps government agencies and commercial customers blend and find patterns in massive datasets, and its 12-month sales have grown 39% year over year to $3.4 billion, with $763 in net profit. But Palantir is the poster child for the AI stock bubble, according to most value oriented investors. Its $430 billion market cap is a jaw-dropping 126 times its sales. Though Wood has taken profits in Palantir, selling 70% of Ark\u2019s stake since August 2024, it still makes up 4.2% of its flagship fund as its ninth-largest holding. \u201cIf Palantir were not at its current valuation, given its position in the platform-as-a-service space, and we think they effectively own that space, it would be right up there with Tesla [in our portfolio],\u201d says Wood, referencing her firm\u2019s 11.9% holding in the electric vehicle giant. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it out there.\u201d That\u2019s high praise from Wood, who has loved and owned Tesla for almost a decade. It was a key contributor to her 2020 performance with its 731% gain that year, then it mirrored her fund\u2019s crash in 2022, losing 68%. Last year, Ark raised its price target for the stock to $2,600 per share by 2029, implying a market value of around $9 trillion. Tesla shares currently trade for $443 and has a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. Ark estimates that by 2029 86% of Tesla\u2019s earnings will be attributable to its robotaxi business, which it just launched in Austin, Texas this June. \u201cEVs are one and done\u2014you sell a car and hope the customer comes back in five years, and they're very low margin,\u201d says Wood. \u201cWhen analysts look at what robotaxis are, they have to use a different model. It's more of a subscription or recurring revenue model, and it's very high margin.\u201d With $1 billion in ARKK invested in Tesla, the holding is twice the weight of its second largest position, Coinbase, but aside from that investment, Wood generally doesn\u2019t invest very much in $1 trillion market-cap tech giants. Amazon, Meta and Nvidia are all in her portfolio, but not in the top 15. Avoiding mega tech stocks but doubling down on the smaller-cap stocks turned out to be a grave mistake for Wood in 2022. Virtual health business Teladoc Health lost 88% in 2021 and 2022. Game development firm Unity Software fell 80% in 2022. Bets on biotech and life sciences firms like Ginkgo Bioworks, Exact Sciences, Beam Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics all floundered. \u201cWe had no idea that we were going to run into a buzzsaw. Many people think it was interest rates, and sure, all long duration assets got killed,\u201d Wood reflects. \u201cBut our bigger problem was the supply chain shocks that lingered for so long. Because what drives our models is unit growth. The more unit growth, the faster costs can decline with new technologies.\u201d In hindsight, Wood concedes the \u201ccorrect thing to do\u201d would have been to find shelter in larger-cap innovators that were more resilient to supply chain issues and rising interest rates, but she thinks today\u2019s policy environment is far more favorable to her strategy. A longtime Donald Trump supporter, she applauds his move in January to rescind parts of a Joe Biden executive order that aimed to set some standards for AI regulation. New depreciation schedules in Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act have also eased corporate tax burdens. \u201cThe amount of deregulation that is taking place in this administration is astonishing,\u201d she gushes. \u201cI don't like tariffs, but I would take tariffs if you also gave me what this administration has given with deregulation and much lower tax rates.\u201d What investors think of Wood depends largely on when they invested. ARKK\u2019s 31.8% three-year annualized return as of September 30 is better than the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 24.9% figure, but its -0.8% five-year number looks terrible compared to the market\u2019s 16.5% annual gains. But rewinding further, a 15.3% annual return since inception in 2014 is back to outperforming the market by two percentage points. It trails the Nasdaq 100 Index\u2019s 16.9% annualized returns in that span, but it\u2019s narrowing that gap. It\u2019s hard for any investor to come back from an 80% loss from peak to trough, but the Nasdaq similarly lost close to 80% during the dotcom bust, and has gained about 2,000% in the quarter century since. Wood is hopeful that decades from now, its 2022 collapse will similarly look like a blip on ARRK\u2019s long-term stock chart.","label":1}

Travis Kelce is busy on the football field, but that hasn't stopped the Kansas City Chiefs tight end from building his business empire. Kelce, 36, has seen his fame grow since he began dating Taylor Swift in 2023. The couple announced their engagement in August. Besides focusing on his football career, Kelce has expanded into acting, hosting, and investing. The three-time Super Bowl winner has an estimated net worth of $70 million, per Forbes. Representatives for Kelce did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Here's a look at the new retail and entertainment ventures Kelce has added to his growing portfolio. In September 2022, Kelce launched the \"New Heights\" podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce. The podcast has featured several celebrities and sports stars, such as Brad Pitt, LeBron James, and, most recently, Swift, when she revealed details about her latest album \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" The \"New Heights\" podcast won the podcast of the year award at the 2024 iHeartPodcast Awards. In August 2024, the brothers signed a three-year deal with Amazon's podcast network, Wondery. That deal was worth more than $100 million, per multiple media reports. In September, Kelce opened 1587 Prime, a steakhouse located in Kansas City. Kelce had entered into the venture with his Kansas City Chiefs teammate and quarterback, Patrick Mahomes. Kelce and Mahomes cofounded the restaurant in partnership with Noble 33, a fine-dining brand. 1587 Prime started taking reservations in August, and tables have been fully booked through late October, per Business Insider's reporting. On Tuesday, Kelce said in an Instagram post that he was partnering with hedge fund Jana Partners to invest in the Six Flags theme park brand. \"To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn't pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families!\" Kelce wrote on Instagram. Jana Partners said in a statement on October 21 that they now own about 9% of Six Flags' stock, which is worth about $200 million. Six Flags' share price went up by nearly 18% on Tuesday.              Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Warner Bros. Discovery is actively seeking a sale, likely in pieces, driven by high debt and business challenges, despite its stock's strong performance and CEO incentives.Any full acquisition faces severe antitrust hurdles; Netflix has the highest chance of approval via partial asset purchases or behavioral remedies, while Paramount and Comcast bids are highly improbable due to extreme market concentration and vertical integration risks. Warner Brothers Discovery stock is up 91% so far this year.  Will the stock rise another 50%? After turning down a second takeover offer from Paramount Tuesday, Warner Brothers Discovery has put itself in play.  Whether the stock rises more \u2013 to reach the typical control premium of 30% more could depend on the financial wherewithal of potential acquirers and the knotty antitrust issues facing potential bidders \u2013 such as Paramount, Comcast, or Netflix. Below is a ranking of the potential bids based on ability to pay and antitrust risk: Despite these challenges, the company is likely going to be sold \u2013 most likely in pieces. One big reason is the incentive for Warner CEO David Zaslav to do a deal. \u201cThis summer, after consulting with his longtime mentor, the media magnate John Malone, Mr. Zaslav signed a new contract that pays him millions of dollars if the company changes hands,\u201d reported the Times. Read on for the antitrust challenges these companies bids may encounter and how they might be resolved. WBD is a leader in streaming, film production, premium content, and cable. The company controls 116.9 million streaming subscribers through Max and Discovery+, major film studios including Warner Bros. and DC, premium content libraries (Harry Potter, Game of Thrones), and cable networks reaching 1.1 billion global viewers, according to Sports Video Group. WBD\u2019s business challenges make a sale increasingly attractive. That\u2019s due to the company\u2019s $34.6 billion in debt, loss of NBA rights costing $600 million annually, noted Fast Company, and accelerating decline in linear TV decline. The critical question is whether regulators will permit further consolidation in an already concentrated media industry. Warner Discovery already has rejected two offers from Paramount, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company said Tuesday it would review strategic alternatives after receiving \u201cinquiries for all or some of the company,\u201d added the Journal. WBD would prefer to split itself in two public companies. Zaslav would lead the TV and movie studios and HBO Max while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels would run the company\u2019s cable networks, including CNN and TNT, the Journal wrote.  Netflix presents the most interesting antitrust scenario because it would face less scrutiny than Comcast or Paramount due to zero traditional media overlaps, yet still confronts significant obstacles from streaming market concentration. However, Netflix does not see itself as an acquirer. The company indicated skepticism about \"big media mergers,\" Co-CEO Greg Peters recently stated according to Variety. \"We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers,\" he added.  If Netflix merged with WBD, the streaming market share would likely trigger monopoly-level concentration. The combined market share of as much as 37% \u2013 Netflix\u2019s 21% to 22%, noted Variety, and WBD\u2019s 10% to 15%, wrote The Hollywood Reporter \u2013 would top the 30% threshold that triggers presumption of illegality, according to White & Case. Regulators\u2019 primary concern for this deal would be Netflix\u2019s power to withhold content from rivals \u2013 thus foreclosing competition. Netflix would have both the ability and incentive to withhold must have content \u2013 HBO\/Max premium content from Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, and Peacock, noted Variety. A so-called behavioral remedy could overcome this antitrust problem. This might take for form of a seven to 10 year agreement requiring Netflix to license key WBD content \u2013 such as HBO originals, Warner Bros. films, DC content, and Discovery programming -- to competitor streaming platforms on reasonable terms. This would be similar to what the DOJ required for the completion of the Comcast-NBCU deal. The potential Paramount deal to acquire Warner has been rejected twice already and is likely to be blocked or abandoned. There is an estimated 60% probability the antitrust math and news concentration concerns mentioned above will block the deal. With 28% of domestic box office, the combination of Warner with Paramount\u2019s 6.5% would top the 30% threshold mentioned above \u2013 triggering illegality.   Moreover, the combined companies \u2013 consisting of CNN, TNT, TBS, HGTV, Food Network, and Discovery networks alongside CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and Showtime \u2013 would control 35% to 40% of the linear TV market. This is \u201clikely among the biggest sources of potential regulatory push back,\u201d MoffettNathanson analysts said, according to Variety. Finally, the combined companies would control 15.4% of the streaming market between Paramount+\u2019s 8.7% share and Max\/Discovery+\u2019s 6.7%, noted Statista. With large divestitures \u2013 disposing of either CNN or CBS News, substantial cable network portfolio sales, and streaming platform separation \u2013 the deal would have a 30% chance of being approved. Finally, there is perhaps a 10% chance political, rather than antitrust considerations will prevail \u2013 leading to approval with light conditions. Since regulators blocked the Comcast-TWC merger on vertical integration grounds in 2015, the same logic would likely block a Comcast-Warner Discover deal. The key antitrust problem is Comcast\u2019s position as an unavoidable gatekeeper to 32 million subscribers representing more than 40% of the U.S. broadband market in 40 states, according to the DOJ. Moreover, the deal would result in 36% combined market share in movie theaters, accumulation of more must-have sports rights \u2013 Sunday Night Football (NBC) and March Madness (WBD), and news market dominance \u2013 consolidating NBC News, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, and HLN \u2013 would echo the Comcast-TWC antitrust argument. More specifically, a Comcast-WBD merger would likely be quashed because it features \"potential competitive problems not overcome by significant merger-specific cost savings or consumer benefits,\" noted the Antitrust Institute. Analysts see other potential bidders \u2013 throwing Amazon and Apple into the mix, reported the Journal.  They are divided on whether a Paramount bid is likely. \u201cWe struggle to see a credible stand-alone future for Paramount as the kind of company it aspires to be,\u201d Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon told the Journal, who said WBD owns \"the assets everyone wants.\u201d  Another analyst expects Paramount to win the bidding. \u201cWe continue to think that a transaction with Paramount is reasonably likely,\u201d TD Cowen analyst Doug Creutz wrote in a note to clients Tuesday, according to Variety. \u201cUltimately, we believe Paramount remains the most likely to succeed in acquiring WBD,\u201d agreed MoffettNathanson analysts Robert Fishman and Craig Moffett.  Comcast would face longer odds. \u201cGiven past commentary against all-things-Comcast from both the White House and the FCC over the past year,\u201d Moffett noted, \u201ca successful Comcast acquisition of almost anything seems nearly unthinkable,\u201d Variety reported. With a rocky ride ahead, risk-loving investors may profit from buying $WBD.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Cities and architecture across the world are increasingly being influenced by the fundamentally anti-democratic principles of places like Dubai, argues academic Quinn Slobodian in this interview. Slobodian is a Canadian historian based at Boston University. His 2023 book Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy charts the rise of special economic zones \u2013 areas with deregulated trade laws designed to attract investment. These zones have proliferated since the 1980s, with more than 5,400 across the world today. Examples include Shenzhen, Singapore, Hong Kong and Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai. \"Smoothing out\" of architecture Often, they are associated with a particular genre of statement architecture, which Slobodian believes is mainly aimed at grabbing the attention of potential investors. \"You bait the hook with these big prestige projects for more infrastructural projects,\" he told Dezeen. An example is the flurry of development that followed the completion of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai in 2010 \u2013 still the world's tallest skyscraper. But the phenomenon can be traced back to the earliest special economic zones, he said, and can be seen today in \"blank-slate urban experiments\" such as Neom in Saudi Arabia. Initial projects were characterised by cutting-edge architecture in high-tech and parametric styles, typified by buildings such as Foster + Partners\u2019 HSBC Main Building in Hong Kong, completed in 1986. However, Slobodian argues that the projects have become less experimental over time, and predicts that such buildings will continue to get more homogenous. \"There will be a smoothing out, actually, of any attempts at adventurous building or forms of cohabitation, because they are more risky than is necessary,\" he said. Instead, architecture in cities influenced by special economic zones is increasingly characterised by the prioritisation of privacy and security and a detachment from local culture, Slobodian claims. \"If you take the gated communities as a prototype, what you actually get is like radical conformity and homogeneity across spaces,\" he said. \"Why? Because they're all designed for people with insurance companies and investment in security primarily in mind, so you can't deviate from the same boilerplate set of terms and conditions.\" Cruise-ship urbanism Slobodian predicts that future cities built in the mould of special economic zones, such as The Line in Saudi Arabia, could function like cruise ships. \"There would be checkpoints entering this private city, which would filter out people who they would want and wouldn't want, on the model of the cruise ship or the theme park, which are other favorite prototypes for these libertarians and private city boosters,\" he suggested. Though he paints zone cities as dystopian manifestations of \"capitalism without democracy\", Slobodian warns that they cannot be written off as fringe experiments. \"These microstates and city-states such as Singapore and Dubai have become not exceptions within the world economy, but templates for how the whole landscape of the world economy may be reconfigured,\" he said. \"What frightens me is the private city, the gated community that seeks to enforce Dubai-like conditions on the existing organic complexity of cities and produce hard barriers of exclusion and inclusion based on superior economic utility,\" he added. \"Imagining that now at scale is quite terrifying. The sad truth is people are willing to give up some of their freedoms for security.\" Signs of anti-democratic urbanism are already spreading in Western cities, argues Slobodian. \"There's the Hudson Yards effect, where you walk into it, and suddenly feel like you walk through a portal into a different city and it's mostly uninhabited,\" he said. Donald Trump's political ascendency in the United States, given his background as a property developer, has only increased the power of crack-up capitalism, according to Slobodian. \"He sees himself as a real-estate person who has a slew of incredible photographs of himself holding copper moulds of the building or whatever, and who has been taking advantage of these practices of zoning since the 1980s at the latest,\" Slobodian said. He points to Trump administration's Freedom Cities plan \u2013 a proposal for up to 10 new deregulated cities on federal land in the US that is reportedly enthusiastically supported by several billionaires. Nevertheless, Slobodian remains hopeful that more equitable urbanism could make a comeback \u2013 pointing to Berlin and Montreal in the 1990s, which were considered by investors at the time to be in a state of decline. \"Rents collapse, informal economies thrive, and public order is corroded through forms of subcultural recreation,\" he said. \"Those are the cities that I've felt the strongest love for in my life.\" Dezeen In Depth If you enjoy reading Dezeen's interviews, opinions and features,\u00a0subscribe to Dezeen In Depth.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) possesses a strong historical precedent for delivering rapid, significant share price appreciation, including rallies of over 30% in under two months (as seen in 2010 and 2024), and an even rarer surge of more than 50% in 2025. This established momentum highlights the stock's potential for high-velocity gains, which investors can capitalize on when specific business catalysts align. The current market strength is anchored by recent performance across three core business segments, all detailed in the company's Q2 2025 results. The primary drivers for continued growth are: These quantifiable operational successes provide a strong fundamental basis for another powerful upswing in Alphabet's share price. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GOOGL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark\u2014a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It certainly helps if the fundamentals check out. For details on GOOGL, read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock. Below are a few numbers that matter. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When thinking about risk for GOOGL, it helps to look at how much it fell during major market crises. The biggest hit was the Global Financial Crisis, with a drop of about 65%. The Inflation Shock in 2022 also pushed shares down by around 44%. The Covid pandemic brought a dip near 31%, and even the 2018 correction wasn\u2019t mild, with a 23% decline. Look at \u2013 How Low Can GOOGL Stock Really Go \u2013 for more details. These numbers show that while GOOGL is strong on fundamentals, it\u2019s not immune when markets turn sour. Drawdowns of this size are something to keep in mind, even for big names. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

For a company that has long been praised for its steady growth and strong margins, this decline raises questions and possibly reveals a chance for investment. Deckers\u2019 current valuation appears reasonable, its growth prospects remain strong, its profitability is impressive, and its balance sheet is incredibly sound. The main concern lies in market sentiment: should the forthcoming earnings report fall short of expectations or if HOKA\u2019s growth shows signs of slowing, the pressure could continue. However, despite the temporary market fluctuations, the underlying fundamentals still present a strong case. For those investors looking for reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative that has outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns above 105% since its launch. Additionally, take a look at Micron Stock A Better Bet Than Analog Devices? Despite its significant selloff, Deckers does not appear overpriced relative to the wider market. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.7, which is lower than the S&P 500 average of 24.2, and a price-to-sales ratio of 3.0, slightly below the market\u2019s 3.2. In essence, investors are acquiring a company with superior margins and two leading brands (HOKA and UGG) without incurring a premium. Deckers is not just barely surviving. Over the last three years, its revenues have surged approximately 16.5% per year, which is nearly three times the growth rate of the overall market. Even in the past twelve months, sales rose another 16%, with the first quarter recording a 6.5% increase year over year. This is what makes the ongoing selloff so perplexing: the company\u2019s fundamentals are not deteriorating. The market may simply be re-evaluating the stock following several years of growth, without factoring in a real slowdown in demand. This is where Deckers excels. The company\u2019s operating margin stands at 23.6%, well above the S&P\u2019s 18.6%, and its net margin of 19.4% indicates that it retains pricing power even amid a softer consumer landscape. Cash generation is equally remarkable, with $1 billion in operating cash flow over the last year and a cash flow margin of 21%. Few consumer brands can claim this level of efficiency. Deckers boasts one of the cleanest balance sheets in the retail sector. With only $277 million in debt compared to a $15 billion market cap, the company\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio of just 1.8% is insignificant. Additionally, it possesses $1.9 billion in cash, signifying that more than half of its assets are liquid. That level of financial flexibility is invaluable when market sentiment declines. It enables Deckers to continue investing, repurchasing shares, or weathering short-term disruptions effortlessly. Deckers has weathered challenging periods before but tends to emerge stronger. During the inflation shock of 2022, the stock plummeted by 48%, yet it rebounded to pre-crisis levels within 308 days, which was quicker than the S&P 500\u2019s 464-day recovery. In the Covid market crash, it decreased by 55%, but fully recovered in just 76 days. Even during the financial crisis of 2008, when the stock fell more than 77%, Deckers managed to bounce back within approximately 15 months \u2014 significantly faster than the broader market. In summary, when Deckers stumbles, it typically gets back on its feet quicker than most. Deckers\u2019 fundamentals continue to be strong, supported by robust growth, high margins, and a solid balance sheet, although market sentiment remains weak. A positive earnings surprise or optimistic guidance could quickly elevate the stock. Investing in a single stock can carry risks, but there is significant value in adopting a broader diversified approach. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver significant returns for investors. The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible strategy to take advantage of bullish markets while minimizing losses, as demonstrated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"\"Common misconception is that it's like gambling, it's like red or black, but that's not how the stock market works,\" says Chief Investment Officer of Whelan Financial, Taylor Whelan. Whelan is setting the record straight, and there are steps you can take to manage the risk. \"If you invest in a conservative and diversified way, the odds are in your favor,\" says Whelan. Picking an individual stock isn't necessary. Whelan says, \"You can go out and buy something that's an ETF or a mutual fund that spreads your dollar over many, many different companies and what that allows you to do is diversify. So, you're not reliant on one single company to do well or lose all of your money.\" Fractional shares help buy expensive ETFs with smaller amounts, and as long as you're not selling when things are down, you're not losing anything. \"In a well-diversified investment, if the value goes down, you still have the same amount of shares in the mutual fund or ETF. So nothing has changed except there's a different value there, so you don't realize a loss unless you sell those investments,\" says Whelan Whelan goes on to say that you don't need a lot of money to get started. \"The best thing today with access to apps, you can go online, open an account in five minutes, you can invest with as little as $1.\" Look for beginner-friendly investing platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity and Charles Schwab. \"There's apps out there that allow you, when you make payments at stores, it'll round up your dollars and it'll put it into an investment fund for you. It's a way to automate investing, and I think that has been so key for younger individuals learning about investing sooner and are now more aware,\" he says. Some brokerage firms offer promotional perks, but when deciding which platform is best for you, experts say do your research on how they align with your values. As for market volatility, a lot of times, when the market goes down, it's the perfect opportunity to put cash into the market. There's this concept of buying the dip. Another myth: cash isn't always king. Inflation shrinks the purchasing power of so-called mattress money. There are high-yield savings accounts and CDs that might be a better option, but it's always best to check with your financial advisor or banker.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByJeff Benjamin, Senior Contributor. Following the acquittal of founder Kim Beom-su over a two-year investigation of alleged stock manipulation involving fellow pop-culture titan SM Entertainment, stocks under the Kakao conglomerate jumped across the board on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. After Kakao Corp\u2019s stock fell to its low for the month on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) on Friday ahead of the impending court decision, the stock has shot back up, closing at at 62,300 KRW (about $43.57), gaining 3,600.00, (about $2.52) to deliver a 5.95% gain for the day. Meanwhile, the stock for KakaoPay Corp, the digital wallet and mobile payment service under the company, also rose on KOSPI, hopping to 53,100 Korean won ($37.14), gaining 2,000 KRW ($1.40), for a 3.91% increase. Meanwhile, the stocks for KakaoBank Corp (the financial institution focused on mobile banking services and finance tech) and Kakao Games Corp (the globally focused gaming publisher) both rose as well, respectively climbing 3.34% and 2.84% on the KOSPI and the Korea Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (KOSDAQ) for the day. The stock bump is more welcome news for Kakao\u2019s founder Kim Beomsu who was acquitted regarding charges of stock-price manipulation when his ultimately company acquired SM Entertainment in a highly publicized battle with HYBE. The prosecution had demanded the maximum 15-year sentence in prison for Kim in its sentencing guidelines back in August. Several former Kakao employees alongside Kim were also acquited including Bae Jaehyun (the former head of investments), Kim Sungsoo (former CEO of the Kakao Entertainment subsidiary), and Hong Eun-tak (former Kakao CEO). However, Ji Changbae, the CEO of private equity fund One Asia Partners, was indicted on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust in the case and was sentenced to three years in prison with a four-year probation period. In February 2023, Kakao signed a contract to acquire new shares and convertible bonds from SM Entertainment which would allow the company to secure approximately nine percent of SM\u2019s shares at 91,000 Korean won (about $63.66) per share at a discounted price. The historic SM label was largely seen as a way for Kakao to become more competitive in the global music scene. SM Entertainment\u2019s stocks soon began rise in the coming days as Kakao faced obstacles from SM founder Lee Soo Man filed a request to suspend Kakao\u2019s stock acquisition and HYBE made a public offer to purchase shares at 120,000 KRW ($83.96), which was higher than market price. The prosecution argued that Kim manipulated SM\u2019s stock price by fixing the purchase price higher than HYBE\u2019s public offer to ultimately block the competiting acquisition and the executive was indicted in August 2024. However, the court ruled that the market manipulation charges were not proven and Kakao\u2019s purchases were an effort to gain shares.  \u201cThe mere fact that purchase activities affected the market price cannot be deemed market manipulation,\u201d the court stated according to a report from The Chosun Daily. \u201cEven after reviewing Kakao\u2019s purchase ratio, timing, and order volume, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the orders were manipulative,\u201d adding that the stock\u2019s rise was to be expected even after HYBE\u2019s offer concluded. With SM\u2019s stock peaking close to 150,000 KRW at its highest in March 2023, the stock suffered big drops in 2024 but has since returned to its peak during the 2023 acquisition and remains high today, closing at 119,600 KRW ($83.65) on Tuesday. The court also judged that the individual Lee Jun-ho, the former head of Kakao Entertainment\u2019s investment strategy division and had testified that Kakao and One Asia Partners colluded to manipulate SM\u2019s stock price, had provided false statements possibly under duress.  \u201cLee was investigated not only for this case but also for unrelated matters, with multiple bench warrants issued, placing him under extreme psychological pressure,\" the court stated. \u201cAfter a separate seizure and search, he retracted his previous statements and testified in line with the prosecution\u2019s claims\u2026Lee sought to avoid investigation and expected that testifying in line with the prosecution\u2019s claims would lead to the closure of his case. He applied for a leniency program after testifying in accordance with the charges and was not indicted in this case. His motive and reason for providing false testimony are clear.\u201d The Chosun Daily adds that Lee had been under investigation over a breach of trust for \u201callegedly causing Kakao Entertainment to overpay for the acquisition of drama production company Baram Pictures.\u201d  The prosecution stated it would decide on an appeal after analyzing the verdict. Looking ahead, Kim Beomsu and Kakao spoke excitedly about the future expected to accelerate internal reforms. \u201cI sincerely thank the court for carefully reviewing the case over a long period and reaching this conclusion,\" Kim said immediately after the ruling. \"I hope this becomes an opportunity for Kakao to escape the shadow of accusations of stock price manipulation and market manipulation.\u201d  Kakao also stated that, \u201cThe Kakao Group faced numerous difficulties due to the two years and eight months of investigation and trial. It was particularly painful that we struggled to respond swiftly to rapid market changes. We will strive to make up for this and fulfill our social responsibilities.\u201d  Kakao Corp\u2019s stock is up nearly 60% for the year.","label":1}

Google is once again stripping back management layers, this time by flattening teams in its core US ad sales unit, Business Insider has learned. US employees in the Google Customer Solutions (GCS) division were informed last month that several changes to the leadership structure would take effect in January, in a memo sent by its vice president, John Nicoletti. This latest restructuring shows how even the most profitable corners of Big Tech are moving to run leaner and faster. Google's ad business, which still accounts for the bulk of its revenue, is flattening management layers to speed up decisions and reduce bureaucracy as growth slows and competition from AI-driven rivals intensifies. In an all-hands meeting in August, Google leaders told staff that the company had reduced the number of managers overseeing small teams by 35% over the previous year. The changes inside GCS, which serves midsize advertisers, reflect a wider trend across the tech industry: the end of cushy managerial hierarchies in a cost-conscious era. One change will be to remove the layer of \"Managers of Managers,\" or MoMs, across several teams, Nicoletti said in the memo, which was reviewed by Business Insider. No layoffs were mentioned in the email, which said the affected employees would move into other roles. The exact number of manager roles being removed could not be learned \"Unlocking our next stage of growth means building our team strategy and structure for the long term,\" Nicoletti wrote. A Google spokesperson confirmed the changes to Business Insider. \"Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and better serve our customers,\" the spokesperson said. Nicoletti said the changes in ad sales in January would \"Empower our teams, with a focus on agility to accelerate decision-making, and keeping leadership close to the work by simplifying our organizational structure.\" Ad sales is a critical part of Google's business, and GCS \u2014 which focuses on midsize clients \u2014 is the central engine. In the September memo to staff, Nicoletti described GCS as \"managing a portfolio the size of a Fortune 100 company.\" As part of the upcoming January changes for GCS, Nicoletti said all managers across select teams would become \"Heads of business\" and report directly to directors with no management layer in between. This would include removing a layer within its mid-market sales group \u2014 a role known as account strategy management \u2014 that previously stood between account executives and managers, and the heads of business. He also told staff that Google would reopen account executive roles \"to continue investing in capacity for deep customer partnerships.\" \"One of the reasons that we've been so successful is that we're outstanding at driving momentum through continuous change,\" Nicoletti wrote. \"This will be no different.\" Google is not alone in reducing management layers. In recent years, tech giants such as Intel, Amazon, and Microsoft have also flattened their management structures in an effort to become more efficient. GCS was the only division mentioned in Nicoletti's memo, but it's not the only team in ad sales. It also has teams working on Large Customer Sales (LCS), which focus on the biggest and most complex customers. In January 2024, Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, told staff that GCS would become the \"core channel for scaling growth\" as the company pared back teams on LCS.

The change of season is a great time to freshen up your look, whether you're in the market for a new outfit or a new hairstyle. That's why Business Insider asked hairstylists and barbers which trendy haircuts and styles their male clients are asking for the most. Here's what they said. Francis Catanese, a senior stylist at Julien Farel Salon and Spa in New York City, said his clients are into the modern mullet, which has clean, faded sides and a longer, textured back. \"Men love the modern mullet because it combines retro flair with a bold, updated twist that stands out without feeling over-the-top,\" Catanese told BI. The modern mullet offers a rebellious yet stylish look that's surprisingly versatile. Samantha Lawrence, owner of Chromatique Salon in Washington, told BI that Gen Z clients favor the \"broccoli cut,\" which features a curly or heavily textured, rounded top with a tight taper or fade on the sides. \"This cut is playful, fashion-driven, and makes a strong statement without requiring a lot of daily styling. The contrast between structure and texture gives it wide appeal,\" she said. According to Lawrence, her clients are loving \"tightly faded sides that lead into a tousled, dimensional top.\" She said this cut can be styled to feel effortless and undone, and is versatile enough to work across different hair types and textures. Lawrence told BI it's popular among professionals who want a low-maintenance style that \"feels current and cool.\" Gabby Fishman, a hairstylist at Art\u00e9 Salon in New York City, told BI her clients have been liking the soft layered look. \"Clients love this look because it feels masculine without being overly styled, and it grows in really well with little maintenance between appointments,\" Fishman said. She said the style works well with naturally textured hair types, especially wavy hair. Elvis Amezquita, a barber manager at Famous Fadez in Illinois, told BI that men who love a style with some flexibility are opting for the burst fade \u2014\u00a0 a short or bald cut near the ear that fades into longer hair toward the top and back. \"The burst fade is flexible with many hair textures and is normally less maintenance compared to longer hairstyles,\" Amezquita said. According to Amezquita, another popular style combines a tapered back and sides with a slicked-back top to achieve a smooth appearance. This cut offers a stylish and clean look, especially around the ears, neck, and forehead. \"The slick back offers a smooth, controlled top, while the taper keeps the sides clean, giving a sharp, professional, and stylish appearance,\" Amezquita told BI.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past ten years, Apple (AAPL) stock has delivered a massive $847 billion back to its investors in tangible cash in the form of dividends and buybacks. In fact, AAPL stock has provided the highest returns to shareholders of any company in history.  Continuing this trend in 2025, Apple raised its quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share, reflecting a 4% raise. Apple\u2019s board has also authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of common stock.  Let's examine some statistics and see how this payout ability compares to the market's largest return-of-capital entities.   Why should you be concerned? Because dividends and share buybacks represent direct, tangible capital returns to shareholders. They also reflect management's confidence in the company\u2019s financial stability and its capacity to generate sustainable cash flows. Moreover, there are other stocks exhibiting similar traits. Here is a list of the top 10 firms ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there\u2019s significant value in the broader diversified approach we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend beyond just equities. What about a portfolio comprising 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities and bonds - is it likely to yield greater returns in the next 1-3 years and offer better protection if the markets fall by 20%? We have analyzed the figures. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return For the complete ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What catches your attention here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market cap seems inversely correlated to growth potential for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are expanding at a much quicker rate, in a more predictable manner, compared to the others, yet they have returned a significantly smaller portion of their market cap to shareholders. That represents the downside to high capital returns. Yes, they are appealing, but you must ponder: Am I compromising growth and robust fundamentals? With that consideration, let's review some data for AAPL. (refer to Buy or Sell Apple Stock for more information) Apple Basics   That provides a good summary, but assessing a stock from an investment standpoint requires much more. This is precisely what Trefis High Quality Portfolio accomplishes. It aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside. AAPL Historical Risk Nevertheless, Apple is not insulated from significant declines. It fell roughly 81% during the Dot-Com bubble and suffered a 61% drop in the Global Financial Crisis. The 2018 correction and the Covid sell-off also experienced reductions of around 31-39%. Even the recent inflation shock caused it to decline by approximately 31%. Strong firms can endure storms more effectively, yet sharp market downturns can still be severe. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decrease even in favorable market conditions - consider events such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Check AAPL Dip Buyer Analyses to understand how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark that includes all three - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. What accounts for that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.  ","label":1}

If you\u2019ve ever watched Star Wars and found yourself mesmerized by those rolling, shield-generating battle droids that gave the Jedi such a hard time, you\u2019re definitely not alone. The Droideka has always been one of the most visually striking droids in the entire saga with its menacing tripod stance and devastating firepower. Now LEGO brings this iconic destroyer droid to life in a way that lets you display it proudly on your desk or shelf. And here\u2019s the kicker: this premium collectible is currently down to just $48 on Amazon, slashed from its original $64 price tag. This is the first time this set has gone on sale since its release, and with a stellar 4.9 out of 5 star rating, it might run out of stock quickly. See at Amazon The LEGO Star Wars Droideka brings interactivity to your collection with movable arms that replicate the realistic shooting motion these droids are famous for in The Phantom Menace and The Clone Wars. You can pose it in full attack mode, arms extended and ready to unleash a barrage of blaster fire or you can fold it into its iconic ball configuration for that classic rolling transport mode. The construction of the build itself is very rewarding for the adult constructor looking for something interesting but not intimidating. Articulation points are well-crafted and provide solid movement within the arm joints without the flimsiness or looseness. You are able to remove and reattach the legs easily which makes the wheel transformation seamless and natural. Apart from the actual main Droideka model, the set comes with thoughtful additional pieces to make it go beyond just an ordinary build and become an actual display item. You receive your own exclusive stand along with an information plaque to provide context of the Droideka within Star Wars history. You also get a special Lego Star Wars 25th-anniversary brick to commemorate a quarter century of the popular sets. For good measure, the set even comes with your own buildable, but smaller, Droideka model to sit atop the display stand. The color scheme remains true to the original with metallic and bronze shades that evoke the threatening demeanor of these war droids. They are proportioned just right too, the tapered shield generators and signature head shape instantly recognizable to any Star Wars buff. That attention to detail makes it ideal for display with your other Star Wars collectibles or even just as a display item that\u2019ll spark conversations. At this lower price, you are getting wonderful value for the upscale LEGO set designed specifically for adult fans. That original price of $64 was already quite reasonable for the number of pieces and quality of display, but at $48, this is the absolute bargain for any Star Wars fans.

GDDR7 brings much higher data transfer rates than the older cards\u2019 GDDR6, so textures load sooner, stuttering is reduced, and you enjoy smoother action in memory-hungry titles like Cyberpunk 2077 or Microsoft Flight Simulator. 12GB capacity means you\u2019ll have no VRAM bottlenecks at 1440p or even 4K resolutions in most titles, and provides you with headroom through the next couple of years as titles increasingly require increasing amounts of resources. The RTX 5070 uses a 3.125-slot design which means it\u2019s slightly thicker than traditional two-slot cards but not quite as massive as some three-slot monsters. This extra space allows for a more robust cooling solution without turning your case into an oven. Asus equips it with axial-tech fans that spin in alternating directions to reduce turbulence and increase airflow efficiency. Upgrading to the RTX 5080, you\u2019ll be getting 16GB of GDDR7 memory and the more substantial 3.6-slot build. This card aims directly at gamers who won\u2019t compromise, running 4K resolution with ray tracing and still demanding triple-digit frame rates. That extra 4GB of VRAM over the 5070 makes all the difference when you\u2019re gaming at higher resolutions and ultra textures or you\u2019re doing content creation like video editing or 3D rendering on the side. Vapor chamber cooling on the RTX 5080 is an evolution of the older heat pipe technology. Instead of using the latter\u2019s hollow tubes to conduct the heat, the vapor chamber distributes the thermal energy on a wider surface area, keeping the hotspot under control and delivering steady results even through long gaming marathons. Both boards are PCIe 5.0 capable, doubling the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0. Now, you won\u2019t be seeing huge real-world improvements to gaming these days, but future software and applications are going to be increasingly making use of that extra bandwidth. DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI connectivity adds future-proof readiness of the next generation of monitors, including those scaling well beyond 4K resolution and higher refresh rates. If you have come to consider one of those new 240Hz 4K monitors, these cards actually have the ability to properly feed themIt manufactures these TUF Gaming cards using military-grade components and provides protective PCB coating. At $584, the RTX 5070 undercuts what many people paid for last generation\u2019s mid-range cards while delivering current-gen performance and features. The RTX 5080 at $1,349 brings flagship-tier gaming within reach of enthusiasts who don\u2019t want to take out a loan for their hobby. Given that both cards have strong review scores on Amazon (4.7 stars for the 5070 across over 2,000 reviews, and 4.6 stars for the 5080), stock my sell out quickly.

A cross-market study of 2,709 AI-assistant responses found 45% had significant issues and 81% had some issue. Gemini had the most issues with sourcing. Leading AI assistants misrepresented or mishandled news content in nearly half of evaluated answers, according to a European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and BBC study. The research assessed free\/consumer versions of ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Perplexity, answering news questions in 14 languages across 22 public-service media organizations in 18 countries. The EBU said in announcing the findings: \u201cAI\u2019s systemic distortion of news is consistent across languages and territories.\u201d In total, 2,709 core responses were evaluated, with qualitative examples also drawn from custom questions. Overall, 45% of responses contained at least one significant issue, and 81% had some issue. Sourcing was the most common problem area, affecting 31% of responses at a significant level. Performance varied by platform. Google Gemini showed the most issues: 76% of its responses contained significant problems, driven by 72% with sourcing issues. The other assistants were at or below 37% for major issues overall and below 25% for sourcing issues. Accuracy problems included outdated or incorrect information. For instance, several assistants identified Pope Francis as the current Pope in late May, despite his death in April, and Gemini incorrectly characterized changes to laws on disposable vapes. Participants generated responses between May 24 and June 10, using a shared set of 30 core questions plus optional local questions. The study focused on the free\/consumer versions of each assistant to reflect typical usage. Many organizations had technical blocks that normally restrict assistant access to their content. Those blocks were removed for the response-generation period and reinstated afterward. When using AI assistants for research or content planning, these findings reinforce the need to verify claims against original sources. As a publication, this could impact how your content is represented in AI answers. The high rate of errors increases the risk of misattributed or unsupported statements appearing in summaries that cite your content. The EBU and BBC published a News Integrity in AI Assistants Toolkit alongside the report, offering guidance for technology companies, media organizations, and researchers. Reuters reports the EBU\u2019s view that growing reliance on assistants for news could undermine public trust. As EBU Media Director Jean Philip De Tender put it: \u201cWhen people don\u2019t know what to trust, they end up trusting nothing at all, and that can deter democratic participation.\u201d Featured Image: Naumova Marina\/Shutterstock                  Matt G.

The steady progression of Cam Ward.\u00a0\u00a0 The quarterback play in the NFL this past week gave us plenty of highs \u2014 and an abundance of lows. In a roller-coaster Week 7, we saw the continued brilliance of the likes of Drake Maye, Dak Prescott and Daniel Jones. We also witnessed new depths found by Tua Tagovailoa, Geno Smith and Justin Fields, the latter of whom was benched in the Jets\u2019 loss Sunday to the Panthers.\u00a0 Welcome to this week's QB Stock Market, where we track the fluctuations of NFL starting passers throughout the season. That means combining the essence of the performances each week against the totality of each quarterback's season.\u00a0 Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Let\u2019s dive in:\u00a0 The\u00a0dominant Patrick Mahomes we saw at the beginning of his career as a starter? That\u2019s been back on display as of late, which puts him atop the QB Stock Market for the first time since Week 1.\u00a0 The two-time NFL MVP got No. 1 wide receiver Rashee Rice back this past week after a six-game suspension to start the season. And Mahomes\u2019 connection with Rice was the big takeaway as he carved up the struggling Raiders for 286 yards and three touchdowns (two to Rice) with no interceptions in just three quarters.\u00a0 Patrick Mahomes is happy to have WR1 Rashee Rice (left) back on the field for the first time since September 2024. (Photo by Todd Kirkland\/Getty Images)  Sunday marked the first time that the Chiefs' top three wide receivers \u2014 Rice, Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown \u2014 played together in a regular-season game. What\u2019s scary, though, is that Mahomes was already playing at an elite level before Rice\u2019s return. So with the third-year receiver back in the fold, Mahomes & Co. are resembling Kansas City\u2019s explosive offenses of several years ago. \u00a0 Since Week 4, when Worthy returned from a dislocated shoulder, Mahomes has completed 71.3% of his passes for 1,131 yards (282.6\/game), adding 13 total touchdowns (11 passing, 2 rushing) against just one interception with a 117.2 passer rating. In that span, Mahomes has been sacked only five times. He\u2019s also pacing for a career high in rushing yards.\u00a0 As a result, the Chiefs have scored at least 28 points in four straight games for the first time since 2021.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, the best quarterback of this era is back playing at an MVP level.\u00a0 Even with WR1 Puka Nacua sidelined by injury, Matthew Stafford threw five touchdown passes in a Week 7 Rams rout of the Jaguars in London. That's a first for an NFL international game. (Photo by Bradley Collyer\/PA Images via Getty Images)  Jared Goff is a perfect example of why being a \"game manager\" isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u00a0 Sure, he may be a bit scheme-dependent and unable to truly carry an offense. But with the right personnel and coaching around him \u2014 like he\u2019s had in Detroit the past several years \u2014 he\u2019s as deadly as any passer on the planet. His 74.9% completion rate this season ranks second in the NFL.\u00a0 He\u2019s perfectly fine managing a game, too, like he did Monday night, when running back Jahmyr Gibbs (218 scrimmage yards) and the Lions\u2019 defense did the heavy lifting against Tampa Bay. Goff had some miscues, including two turnovers and overthrowing rookie receiver Isaac TeSlaa on a fourth-and-2 in the end zone in the first half, but made the plays he needed to make. Monday was one of Goff\u2019s worst performances of the season, but it was still respectable in totality \u2014 20-for-29 for 241 yards and a touchdown with a 91.3 passer rating, plus the two giveaways. \"Bad\" performances for Goff aren\u2019t the lows they once were in his days with the Rams.\u00a0 Entering Week 8, Goff leads the NFL with a 116.1 passer rating.\u00a0 Baker Mayfield was hounded by the Lions' pressure in Week 7. He had a season-high four sacks and a season-low 66.1 passer rating. (Photo by Steven King\/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)  Aaron Rodgers is turning back the clock with the Steelers.\u00a0 Of course, the four-time MVP doesn\u2019t move all that well at age 41, but you can tell he\u2019s more comfortable navigating the pocket being another year removed from the Achilles injury he suffered in September 2023. And he apparently still has the arm talent that makes him arguably the most gifted thrower ever. His Hail Mary attempt at the end of Pittsburgh's Week 7 loss to the Bengals traveled 69.8 air yards, the longest recorded pass attempt since at least 2017, according to Next Gen Stats.\u00a0 Rodgers is playing at a level we haven\u2019t seen since the end of his Green Bay days. He recorded four passing touchdowns against Cincinnati, his second four-TD performance in six games this season. The last time he had at least two games with four passing touchdowns in a season was 2021, when he won his fourth MVP award. His 105.1 passer rating so far this year is also on pace to be his best mark since that MVP year.\u00a0 By many metrics, Bo Nix has taken a step back from his impressive rookie season, when he finished third in Offensive Rookie of the Year voting and helped lead Denver to the playoffs.\u00a0 But you can\u2019t say he\u2019s not clutch.\u00a0 In the Broncos\u2019 historic comeback victory on Sunday, when they scored 33 fourth-quarter points (second-most in league history) to stun the Giants, Nix led the charge. Last year\u2019s No. 12 pick had four total touchdowns (two passing, two rushing) and orchestrated the game-winning drive in the final 14:08. It was a masterclass from Nix in resilience, composure and dual-threat quarterbacking down the stretch.\u00a0 The former Oregon star needs to play high-level football more consistently, though. He\u2019s posted a passer rating above 100 just once this season (Week 2).\u00a0 Bo Nix celebrates with fans after defeating the Giants 33-32 in a miraculous comeback on Oct. 19. (Photo by Justin Edmonds\/Getty Images)  Caleb Williams still has a long way to go with Ben Johnson.\u00a0 Last year\u2019s No. 1 pick had his worst performance of the season in Sunday\u2019s win over the Saints, going 15-of-26 (57.7% completion rate) for 172 yards and a touchdown with an interception. It marked his first time throwing for fewer than 200 yards in 2025. And on the pick play, in the first quarter, he telegraphed the pass to Rome Odunze. He also had poor ball placement on the throw, paving the way for an easy interception for New Orleans.\u00a0 Williams had two fumbles as well, though they were both recovered and weren\u2019t necessarily his fault.\u00a0 Consistency is the next step for the former USC star, who\u00a0has\u00a0elevated his play in Year 1 with Johnson but remains far off from maximizing his potential. He does have a better offensive line and coaching around him than a year ago to help in that pursuit, though.\u00a0 Joe Flacco has brought hope back to the Bengals after arriving in Cincinnati in the first week of October. (Photo by Michael Reaves\/Getty Images)  Bryce Young's NFL career has been a roller-coaster ride, but right now, the Panthers are enjoying their first three-game winning streak since 2021. Young, however, may miss Week 8 with a high ankle sprain. (Photo by Kathryn Riley\/Getty Images)  The end result may have been the same for the Titans this past week, but Cam Ward showed progress. The No. 1 pick completed 25 of 34 passes for 255 yards and a touchdown with two turnovers in Tennessee's loss to New England. Ward had season-highs in completion rate (73.5%), yards per attempt (7.5) and passer rating (92.2). His passing yardage was also his second-highest mark of the season. He was particularly good in the first half \u2014 11-of-16 for 148 yards and the touchdown with no giveaways and a 118.8 passer rating.\u00a0 Yes, ball security is a very real problem for Ward. For the second week in a row, he had an unforced lost fumble. Against the Patriots, he lost hold of the ball without being touched, and it was recovered by New England linebacker K\u2019Lavon Chaisson for a touchdown. The former Miami star needs to be better about protecting the football, whether it\u2019s an emphasis on holding the ball tighter or using gloves.\u00a0 But he showed improvement in many other departments. Ward\u2019s 38-yard touchdown pass to fellow rookie Chimere Dike on a 38-yard deep cross Sunday was a well-placed ball. With seven touchdown passes and 10 interceptions, Geno Smith's tenure with the Raiders has been a disaster so far. (Photo by David Eulitt\/Getty Images)  There's a reason why Spencer Rattler has been the Saints\u2019 QB1 to start the year. He has talent.\u00a0 Before Sunday, he had just one giveaway through six games despite throwing the ball a heavy amount. He entered Week 7 as the only qualified quarterback in the NFL to attempt at least 200 passes with one or fewer interceptions in 2025, per NGS.\u00a0 But clearly, he can\u2019t lift a New Orleans offense that isn\u2019t as bad as you might think, considering the team's 1-6 record. The Saints have pieces at the skill positions (Alvin Kamara, Chris Olave, Rashid Shaheed, Juwan Johnson), but they rank fourth-worst in scoring (17.9 points\/game). And Rattler is coming off a four-turnover performance.\u00a0 It begs the question: When will we see second-round rookie Tyler Shough get a shot? After all, there\u2019s a good chance New Orleans will be in the quarterback market next offseason. The Saints are in the running for the No. 1 overall pick. You\u2019d think they\u2019d want to be 100 percent clear on what they have at the quarterback position now before they make a swing at the spot in the spring.\u00a0 Ben Arthur is an NFL reporter for FOX Sports.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Humana (NYSE: HUM) is currently riding a wave of positive momentum. The stock has been on a five-day continuous winning streak, delivering cumulative gains of 13% and adding approximately $4.0 billion in value. The company\u2019s current market capitalization is around $36 billion. This recent rally has propelled HUM stock to be 17.6% above its value at the end of 2024, slightly outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date return of 14.5%. The surge can be attributed to several recent, favorable developments: Humana announced a partnership with the Providence Health System aimed at streamlining and securing data exchange. Furthermore, the company, in partnership with USAA, will continue to offer co-branded Medicare Advantage plans in 2026, notably featuring $0 copays for mental health services.  Given Humana\u2019s robust recent performance\u2014driven by these strategic announcements\u2014the key question for investors remains: After this rally, is HUM stock still a buy, or is it time to lock in gains? Deep dive with Buy or Sell HUM. HUM stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it attractive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. On the other hand, there is a huge value to the broader diversified approach we take with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management - a Boston area wealth manager - whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The following table summarizes the return for HUM stock vs. the S&P 500 index over different periods, including the current streak: What is the point? Momentum often precedes conviction. A multi-day win streak can signal growing investor confidence or spark follow-on buying. Tracking such trends can help you ride the strength, or prepare for a well-timed entry if momentum fades. However, big gains can follow sharp reversals - but how has HUM behaved after prior drops? See HUM Dip Buyer Analysis to learn more. There are currently 191 S&P constituents with 3 days or more of consecutive gains and 13 constituents with 3 days or more of consecutive losses. While HUM stock looks attractive given its winning streak, investing in a single stock without detailed, thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Apple may have to allow rivals to operate their own app stores on iPhones in the UK, after a ruling from the competition regulator.  This would be a significant change to Apple's infamous \"closed system\" where apps can only be downloaded from its own App Store. But the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has designated both Apple and Google as having \"strategic market status\" - effectively saying they have a lot of power over mobile platforms. The ruling has drawn fury from the tech giants, with Apple saying it risked harming consumers through \"weaker privacy\" and \"delayed access to new features\", while Google called the decision \"disappointing, disproportionate and unwarranted\".  The CMA said the two companies \"may be limiting innovation and competition\". But the regulator said it did not \"find or assume wrongdoing\" from the firms. \"The app economy generates 1.5% of the UK's GDP and supports around 400,000 jobs, which is why it's crucial these markets work well for business,\" said Will Hayter, the CMA's executive director for digital markets. \"Around 90-100% of UK mobile devices running on Apple or Google's mobile platforms,\" the CMA has previously said, adding this meant the firms \"hold an effective duopoly\". According to analysis from Uswitch, 48.5% of UK mobile owners use an iPhone - which runs Apple's iOS operating system (OS) - with the vast majority of the rest using Google's Android OS. It comes after a separate decision taken in October, where the CMA designated Google's search division as having strategic market status.  The CMA's investigation focused on how prominent Apple and Google's own apps are compared with rivals - as well as their browsers and operating systems. It is unknown what changes the regulator will look to request, but in July it published roadmaps outlining potential measures it could take. These include requiring it to be easier for people to easily switch between Apple and Android devices, and for both firms to rank apps \"in a fair, objective and transparent manner\" in their app stores. Apple specifically may be required to allow alternative app stores on its devices, and let people download programs directly from companies' websites. This would follow a similar ruling in the European Union (EU), which fined Apple in April, accusing it of anti-competitive behaviour. Apple warned the UK could lose access to getting new features - as has happened in the EU - which the company blames on heavy regulation. For example, some Apple Intelligence features which have been rolled out in other parts of the world are not available in the EU. \"Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate, and we work tirelessly to create the best products, services and user experience,\" the company said in a statement.  \"The UK's adoption of EU-style rules would undermine that, leaving users with weaker privacy and security, delayed access to new features, and a fragmented, less seamless experience.\" Android users can currently use third-party app stores - though critics say they are not as smooth as Google's own Play Store. The CMA's roadmap said Google may have to \"change the user experience\" of downloading apps directly from websites, as well as \"remove user frictions\" when using alternative app stores, such as listing them directly on the Google Play Store. \"We simply do not see the rationale for today's designation decision,\" Google competition lead Oliver Bethell said. Mr Bethell said \"the majority of Android users\" use alternative app stores or download apps directly from a developer's website, and claimed there is a far greater range of apps available for Android users compared to those on Apple devices. \"There are now 24,000 Android phone models from 1,300 phone manufacturers worldwide, facing intense competition from iOS in the UK,\" he said. Android is an open-source operating system, which means developers can use and build on top of it for free. Google argues this means it opens up competition. But consumer group Which? said curbs on these companies' power in other countries \"are already helping businesses to innovate and giving consumers more choice\". \"Their dominance is now causing real harm by restricting choice for consumers and competition for businesses,\" said its head of policy and advocacy Rocio Concha.

{"date":"2025-10-22","content":"Trump\u2019s bailout draws criticism as Argentinian soya bean farmers take market share from US producers. By Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact Share Save Critics of President Donald Trump have zeroed in on a hefty financial aid package for Argentina that comes as Argentinian soya bean farmers have taken market share from United States producers. \u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association president Caleb Ragland said on September 24. Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa summed up the concerns in an X post: \u201cWhy would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers\u2019 biggest market???\u201d Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers\u2019 biggest market??? We shld use leverage at every turn to help hurting farm economy Family farmers shld be top of mind in negotiations by representatives of USA \u2014 Chuck Grassley (@ChuckGrassley) September 25, 2025  On October 19, a reporter asked Trump why he decided to aid Argentina despite concerns among US soya producers. \u201cArgentina is fighting for its life,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cYoung lady, you don\u2019t know anything about it. \u2026 They have no money. They have no anything.\u201d US aid to Argentina didn\u2019t directly harm US soya producers \u2013 they have been hurt by a separate Trump policy, his trade war with China. But the timing of the aid and the soya bean export troubles pose a problem of optics for the White House. At the same time, Trump is taking heat from Democrats over the scale of the financial aid package in relation to the cost of expiring subsidies that make the cost of Affordable Care Act marketplace plans more affordable. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar\u00a0of Minnesota and\u00a0Adam Schiff\u00a0of California are among those who have made this argument. Here\u2019s a guide to what\u2019s going on. Argentina\u2019s far-right President Javier Milei\u2019s alliance with Trump is key to this story. Milei, who was inaugurated in December 2023, won the presidency on a platform of slashing government spending as well as other libertarian ideas, a political ideology that emphasises individual liberty and advocates for a limited government. Milei, whom Trump has called his \u201cfavourite president\u201d, presented a chainsaw, a symbol of his aggressive spending cuts, to then-Trump ally Elon Musk at March\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference. Amid high inflation back home, however, Milei has faced challenges. The Argentinian currency, the peso, is weak, meaning it takes more pesos to buy foreign goods. This has worsened Argentinians\u2019 economic standing and posed a political challenge to Milei. Ahead of key legislative elections in Argentina, the Trump administration offered a $20bn rescue package, known as a currency swap facility, to help stabilise the peso. This is an agreement between two central banks to exchange debt under set terms. The agreement was officially signed on October 20. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent framed the $20bn in assistance as support for an ally in need. If Miliei loses the legislative elections, he won\u2019t be able to continue his so-called \u201cchainsaw economics\u201d that have seen drastic cuts in social and welfare spending. \u201cIt\u2019s hope for the future,\u201d Bessent told reporters on October 14. \u201cI think that with the bridge the US is giving them and with the strong policies, that Argentina can be great again.\u201d Critics say this could involve buying Argentinian bonds at above-market prices, with a risk of monetary losses for the US. \u201cBuenos Aires\u2019 path back to economic stability requires more than a balanced budget,\u201d\u00a0wrote\u00a0Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe country\u2019s economy has historically suffered from a shortage of foreign exchange. Its export base is small and commodity heavy. Its external debts are relatively large, and its foreign exchange reserves are low.\u201d US Senator Ruben Gallego in an X post on October 15 said that \u201cTrump is DOUBLING his bailout for Argentina. Meanwhile your health care premiums are about to DOUBLE.\u201d \ud83d\udea8Trump is DOUBLING his bailout for Argentina. Meanwhile your health care premiums are about to DOUBLE. $40 BILLION to help Trump\u2019s elite friends. $0 to lower costs for American families. https:\/\/t.co\/Q6rLeWV6gz \u2014 Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) October 15, 2025  A doubling of the Argentina assistance hasn\u2019t happened yet, but officials are considering it. Bessent said on October 15 that he was looking for ways to increase US assistance to Argentina by another $20bn, \u201cadjacent\u201d to the initial $20bn. The additional $20bn could come from the private sector rather than taxpayers, he said. Separately, at least one subset of Americans \u2013 those who receive enhanced subsidies for health insurance purchased on Affordable Care Act marketplaces \u2013 could see their health premiums double. If Congress and Trump do not extend certain subsidies before they expire at the end of this year, enrollees will have to pay 114 percent more out of pocket on average for their marketplace coverage, according to analyses by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare think tank. China is typically the United States\u2019s largest purchaser of soya beans, importing large amounts from October through March. But US farmers have long worried about heightened competition from South America \u2014 and Trump\u2019s high-tariff trade policy \u201camplifies the issues,\u201d said Chad Hart, an Iowa State University economist who specialises in agriculture. After Trump levied tariffs on China earlier this year, China chose not to purchase US soya beans, sourcing them instead from Argentina and Brazil. \u201cThe South American soybean crop was good this year and is expected to grow next year,\u201d said Todd Hubbs, an Oklahoma State University assistant professor of crop marketing. The soybean crops from Argentina and Brazil are \u201clarge enough to meet Chinese needs in the short-term,\u201d Hart said. Milei temporarily removed export tariffs on many agricultural goods in order to increase the amount of foreign currency flowing into Argentina and offset the peso\u2019s weakness. With that added incentive, China bought approximately 7 million tonnes of soya beans almost immediately, Hubbs said. So while the US and China were already at odds over soya when Trump offered assistance to Argentina, it couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time from the perspective of US soya producers. To them, the aid to Argentina seemed to reward a rival country that was taking their business. Trump\u00a0promised US aid\u00a0to farmers hurt by his tariff policies, but that aid has been stalled by the government shutdown. Senator Brian Schatz connected the scale of the Argentina package to the cost of a key Democratic goal from the ongoing government shutdown: extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced subsidies. \u201cFor the cost of the Argentina bailout we could cover the ACA tax credits for a year,\u201d Schatz posted on October 14 on X. Counting the initial $20bn in assistance to Argentina, and not the second tranche, Schatz is in the ballpark. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019s nonpartisan number-crunching arm, projected that for fiscal year 2026, the credits in question would total $24.6bn. While the two expenditures are similar in size, it\u2019s worth noting that the funds to support Argentina couldn\u2019t be shifted to pay for healthcare credits. The US Treasury has a pool of funds, known as the Exchange Stabilization Fund, dedicated to US intervention in foreign exchange markets.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","label":0}
