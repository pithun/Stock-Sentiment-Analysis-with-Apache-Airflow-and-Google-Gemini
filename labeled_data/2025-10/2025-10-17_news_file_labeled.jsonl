{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"                 reading time 3 minutes        Earlier this month, bitcoin was on top of the world, hitting yet another new all-time high of roughly $125,000. Around the same time, applications for a large number of increasingly speculative crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which some saw as signs of an overheated market. A couple of weeks later, the bitcoin price now sits near the $105,000 mark, which is a 16% drop from the recent high. Although bitcoin is often characterized as a sort of digital gold that can operate as a hedge against inflation and general economic turmoil around the world, the reality is that it is currently being outperformed by actual, physical gold amid the escalating trade conflict between the U.S. and China and other fears. This points to the reality that, despite the massive price appreciation bitcoin has enjoyed over the past 16 years, it is still in many ways early days for the crypto market. In fact, bitcoin is currently more closely correlated to the traditional stock market than gold, according to data from The Block. There may also be an increased separation occurring between bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market, as last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crash related to liquidations on leveraged positions in various crypto assets led to a continuation of the trend reversal regarding the decline of Real Bitcoin Dominance, as measured by bitcoin data portal Bitbo, that began in September. The Trump administration has ushered in a new era for the crypto market, with a number of executive orders related to the industry signed earlier this year and the passage of the GENIUS Act, which specifically creates guidelines for stablecoins. As part of the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embrace of crypto, the SEC has been more welcoming to publicly traded ETFs that are intended to track various crypto assets. While spot-based ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum were approved under the Biden regime, approvals for similar financial products for the likes of the meme coin Dogecoin and other smaller crypto assets have already been made. And this is likely to continue throughout the rest of the year, as previously predicted by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart in comments shared with Investopedia over the summer. We're already at 2x AltAlt Season Crypto ETFs and its not even October. Do you realize how crazy things are gonna get? https:\/\/t.co\/VWMf8tT8S8 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 18, 2025  As an example of how the inherently speculative nature of crypto assets may be bleeding too much into traditional markets, a filing was made last month for a product that would track small-cap crypto assets with 2x leverage. The product uses \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlt Season\u00e2\u0080\u009d in its name, which is a nod to the particularly frothy part of the crypto market cycle when less established crypto assets start to outperform bitcoin itself. While the crypto industry is still seeking greater clarity in terms of the regulatory definitions of various types of crypto assets (i.e. when an asset is a regulated security versus a commodity), Senate Democrats and Republicans are still some way off in terms of finding consensus on those new crypto rules. Bitwise's CIO Matt Hougan says #Bitcoin's 4 year cycle is dead. pic.twitter.com\/mL4PDCCMLQ \u2014 TFTC (@TFTC21) May 1, 2025  The SEC has already made some alterations in terms of how the crypto industry will be regulated under the new administration, and both the major companies involved with crypto and many members of Congress would like the rules of the road further clarified via legislation. Plenty of analysts are sharing their opinions, but the reality of where the crypto market as a whole goes over the next few months is anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guess. Previous crypto market cycles have tended to revolve around the Bitcoin network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roughly four-year halving cycle related to its issuance policy; however, many industry analysts now believe this time is different due to structural changes in the supply and demand dynamics of the market. If this time is not different, then bitcoin could be preparing to enter a bear market in the coming months. In fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible the top of this most recent bull run has already been reached.

During my time at Nordstrom, Verizon, and Yahoo, I managed hundreds of employees and had just as many conversations about raises and promotions. Some I approved, while others I had to turn down. I realized that those decisions weren't always about performance. More often, it came down to whether someone understood the bigger picture \u2014 how the company made decisions, how budgets worked, and when to make their ask. In 2025, those dynamics matter more than ever. Right now, there are more qualified people competing for jobs in nearly every type of function and company than I've seen in years. Hiring has slowed sharply across sectors, even while companies still post roles. Economic growth is tepid, inflation and interest rates remain headwinds, and many businesses are holding the line on workforce expansion. I recently spoke with a recruiter who told me that for single midlevel strategy and marketing roles at a consumer brand and a tech company, she had several dozen resum\u00e9s from candidates with top-tier experience applying for each. Employers know this gives them leverage. This has two realities for people already with jobs. First, companies feel less urgency to stretch compensation to keep you because they know strong replacements are ready and willing. Second, if you do decide to leave, they may see it as a cost-saving opportunity to eliminate your role or put someone less expensive in it. This doesn't mean raises are off the table. It means you need to be thoughtful and self-aware about how you ask. Most organizations have pre-determined compensation ranges for each employee level. Employees who hold a certain title need to be compensated somewhere within the range, or \"pay band,\" for their title. Ask HR or your manager where you fall within the pay range for your role. Even if that person won't share specifics, you're entitled to know whether there's room for a raise, assuming you hit certain objectives and the company is in a position to provide salary increases. If you're already at the top of the range, focus on positioning yourself for the next level instead of pushing for more in the current one. I've seen employees become demoralized when their company denies a base salary increase, but they're missing out on other ways to increase their compensation. At one retailer, an employee on my team asked for a raise during a year when the budget was tight. We couldn't adjust her salary, but I was able to secure a performance bonus and a retention incentive in the form of company stock. She ended up doing better financially over a three-year period than she would've done with the raise. Ask about retention bonuses, project-based incentives, stock grants, or some kind of continuing education. Companies often have more flexibility outside base salary because they're less subject to pay bands and aren't increasing the baseline that you'll be paid each year going forward. As I've said before, this is one of the top mistakes I've seen people make in any market, and it applies even more so now. I once had a high performer ask for a raise in the middle of a quarter when the business had just missed its numbers. Her case was good, but the timing made her seem oblivious to the reality. If your boss is overwhelmed, the company is in crisis, or you've just missed a milestone, hold off. Wait until you've delivered a win, the business has breathing room, and decision-makers are in a better mindset to support you. I've had employees overload my email inbox with screenshots from salary websites, attempting to make a case that they were underpaid. These sites are full of self-reported data that's rarely specific enough to the company, industry, scope of role, and geography at hand. Managers and HR leaders don't see them as credible. Instead, use specific, verified data that's relevant to your exact situation, including anecdotes you can get from peers in your company and industry. That shows you've done your homework and positions you as a professional, not a complainer. Further, think of it as a starting point for asking HR whether they're open to conducting a compensation assessment to determine whether you're eligible for a pay adjustment instead of acting like you're entitled to one. That doesn't always mean working longer hours (although, let's be honest, sometimes it does). It means doing excellent work on projects that matter most to the company \u2014 and making sure the right people know about it. Visibility and impact are what give you leverage. However, be forewarned that the appropriate way to raise your hand for work and then get credit for it looks different in every organization. Read the cultural and political cues so that you don't come across as someone who's always seeking the spotlight for themselves instead of for your team and for the work. Even with perfect timing and a strong business case, sometimes you'll keep hearing, \"no.\" While you may want to be patient during this tight job market, if the goal posts keep moving, or you don't know what they are, it could be time to leave. You deserve to know what success looks like in your role and what it will take to get to the next level. Raises are harder to come by right now, but they're not impossible. If your company truly isn't willing or able to invest in you, take that as a sign. The best leverage you can have in your career is knowing when to stay \u2014 and whether to move on.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"                 reading time 2 minutes        America is entering an era of \u201cjobless growth,\u201d according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. That\u2019s not ideal for those of us who are job-reliant. It\u2019s especially not great for those who don\u2019t currently have a job, whether they have been on the market for a while or are fresh out of college and looking to get their start. But hey, at least the capital holders will still get all that growth without those pesky payroll costs! The memo, written by economists David Mericle and Pierfrancesco Mei and spotted by Fortune, warns that the current market of \u201cmodest job growth alongside robust GDP growth\u201d is likely the new normal going forward. Most of that \u201crobust\u201d GDP growth will come from businesses adopting artificial intelligence, according to the analysts, with \u201conly a modest contribution from labor supply growth due to population aging and lower immigration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, there are still plenty of people entering the job market, but they\u2019re having a rough go of things. Thus far, there has been limited evidence to suggest that, despite the hype, AI has actually displaced many workers. In fact, it\u2019s likely that Trump administration policies, including tariffs, have had more of a chilling effect on hiring broadly. But there are signs that the adoption of the technology is slowing hiring, especially for entry-level positions. Job postings for those roles are way down from last year, so while people aren\u2019t necessarily being pushed out of existing positions, the market has pulled up the ladder for people trying to get in on the lower rungs. That doesn\u2019t just suck, but is extremely short-sighted. The thing about senior roles is that you need people with experience to fill them. If the entire economy is just cutting off the pipeline for developing people who are eventually capable of filling those roles, there\u2019s going to be a bigger problem down the road when those who fill senior roles move on or age out. You don\u2019t get senior staff without first having junior staff, but maybe all these companies are just betting that AI will continue to improve to the point where they don\u2019t need to bother with humans at all. So things are bad now, but the economists say we really don\u2019t understand just how bad it is yet.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHistory also suggests that the full consequences of AI for the labor market might not become apparent until a recession hits,\u201d they wrote. Per Deutsche Bank researchers, the only thing currently keeping the American economy out of a recession is AI-related spending, which, according to Harvard economist Jason Furman, accounted for 92% of GDP growth in the first half of 2025. Massive amounts of money are flowing into AI investments, with the promise that there is huge potential for productivity boosts through both enterprise and consumer adoption of AI tools. That hasn\u2019t materialized even a little thus far, but the idea that it will has severely messed up the job market. One thing is for sure: AI is going to be transformative for the economy. Whether that comes in the form of productivity gains or a complete and total collapse of markets that are wildly overleveraged on AI bets that drag us into a 2008-style recession, well, we\u2019ll have to see.

A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. \"Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no,\" Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave \u2014 the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power \u2014 needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was \"the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders\" and that the present deal would be its \"best and final\" offer for the company. \"The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization,\" Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were \"misleading and misinformed.\" CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share \u2014 a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. \"This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure,\" Miller said. \"It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today.\" Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization \u2014 more than three times its value after the IPO \u2014 and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a \"planetary\" scale. \"We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth,\" Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 \u2014 enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year \u2014 demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. \"They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks,\" Luria said. \"Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist,\" Luria said. \"I'm not sure the answer is yes.\" Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. \"They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers,\" said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a \"full-throated defense of their offer\" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. \"The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave,\" Two Seas Capital wrote. \"Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific.\" In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should \"think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved\" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company.\" Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, \"the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company\" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"I don't even know why Samsung tried.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.      Beyond the Alphabet is a weekly column that focuses on the tech world both inside and out of the confines of Mountain View. Back in May, Samsung bucked its trend of only releasing three flagship phones with its announcement of the Galaxy S25 Edge. The phone is just 5.8mm thin, which is downright impressive from a technological standpoint, but it is overshadowed by the iPhone Air with its 5.64mm frame. To avoid burying the lede, super-thin phones aren't for me, and it's not because I have an almost two-year-old running around the house. There are just too many compromises that are made just for the sake of being as thin as possible, and no matter how much Samsung or Apple might want to, a company can't just alter physics. As recent reports suggest, it would appear as though I'm not alone in feeling this way about ultra-thin phones. Just over a month after its launch, reports surfaced that \"Galaxy S25 Edge sales aren't meeting expectations.\" And before that, a separate report claimed that \"consumer interest in the Galaxy S25 Edge is below what Samsung initially envisioned.\" Now, it seems Samsung's plans for the Galaxy S26 Edge may have suffered, with reports stating that the phone may not launch next year as expected. Let's see why that might be.      The most immediately apparent compromise is that the S25 Edge retails for $999 and only features a dual camera setup. Yes, it's using the same 200MP main wide-angle lens as the Galaxy S25 Ultra and now Galaxy Z Fold 7. But it also sports a downgraded 12MP ultrawide lens and drops the telephoto sensor altogether. But what if you don't really care about not having the telephoto lens? Well, the decision to make a phone as thin as possible has another glaring consequence: a smaller battery. The S25 Edge sports a 6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X 120Hz display, which is the same as the Galaxy S25 Plus.      That's a lot of pixels to power, not to mention that the power-hungry Snapdragon 8 Elite is behind the steering wheel. So while the Galaxy S25 Plus is equipped with a 4,900mAh battery, the S25 Edge comes in with a paltry 3,900mAh cell. According to Samsung, you'll be able to get about 30 hours of playback with the Plus, with the Edge only capable of lasting for up to 24 hours. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android No thank you. Battery anxiety is not something that I particularly enjoy.      Just because I compared the S25 Edge to the S25 Plus doesn't mean I'm giving Apple a pass here with the iPhone Air. Again, it's a feat of modern engineering, arguably even more than the S25 Edge, as Apple managed to squeeze the entire logic board and cameras into the \"plateau\" on the back, while also being thinner. That said, the iPhone Air is also full of compromises once you get past the \"oohs\" and \"aahs.\" Notably, Apple used a modified version of its A19 Pro chip that uses \"one fewer GPU core\" than the iPhone 17 Pro series. Plus, Apple intentionally introduced performance limits in the form of thermal throttling due to the size of the chassis. As a result, the iPhone Air actually falls short of the S25 Edge in GPU-focused benchmarks.      And as for the camera, the iPhone Air is ostensibly worse than the Edge, only featuring a single 48MP lens. Apple tries to obfuscate this by calling it a \"Fusion\" lens and banking on the 2x \"optical-quality\" images, but as Brady Snyder pointed out in his iPhone Air review, \"Two things can be true: it's not a gimmick, but it's also not a replacement for a telephoto camera.\" However, for all of its technological wonder, reports claim demand for the iPhone Air just isn't there. In the case of the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung can just chalk it up to a failed experiment for whatever reason it wants to give. With the iPhone Air, I believe Apple released this phone as a test to gauge feedback, durability, and production, as the company prepares to release its first foldable device. Basically, it was a way for Apple to make back some of the R&D money it's already spent, so don't be surprised if this is a \"one and done\" release for Apple, too.      That's not something Samsung has to really worry about, as the company already released its \"testing grounds\" device with the Z Fold Special Edition late last year. It was only released in South Korea, but it allowed Samsung to get some feedback before rolling out a very similar (if not identical) design to what we now have with the excellent Galaxy Z Fold 7. At the end of the day, this is why the Galaxy S25 Edge didn't make much sense to begin with. Samsung already offers a strong balance of devices with the S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra, and there really wasn't anything that differentiated the Edge. Well, besides offering a fourth phone that didn't last as long and wasn't as versatile, it also cost $100 more than the S25 Plus. It had too many compromises. Maybe it was just a way for Samsung to try to cut into some of Apple's market share before the iPhone Air was released. Or maybe there were other plans in store that had to be ditched for one reason or another. But as we're starting to see, the masses don't really care about ultra-thin slab phones anymore, especially if they're making too many sacrifices.       It's neat, if it's on sale Don't get me wrong, the Galaxy S25 Edge is a cool phone, but you should really only consider picking one up if it's on sale or if you have an old phone to offset the cost. Or, of course, you can find a deal offering the best of both worlds.  Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

AI has come for the focus groups. On Friday, Dialogue AI, an AI-powered market research platform, launched with an aim to speed up the way companies conduct research \u2014 from designing studies and recruiting participants, to conducting interviews. The company raised $6 million in seed funding in a round led by LightSpeed Venture Partners, with participation from Seven Stars, Uncommon Projects, the Tornante Company, and notable angels, including the CPO of Discord, former CPO of Nextdoor, and former CTO of Match Group. The company was founded by Benjamin Lo, Justin Hoang, and Hubert Chen \u2014 all of whom overlapped at Nextdoor, a social networking platform for neighborhoods. Lo was in charge of leading growth for the platform, Hoang was in charge of product management, and Chen was leading the company's search and notification teams. \"We were basically conducting a lot of customer and user research,\" Lo told Business Insider. \"We had this idea and feeling that AI had hit this tipping point where you could basically abstract all these friction points away and really scale how much research you could do.\" So, they quit earlier this year and raced to build Dialogue with the goal of making bespoke market research more accessible for companies. The platform helps companies design market research studies, source participants, and draw insights from these studies. It also features an AI interviewer that conducts simultaneous real-time interviews with thousands of participants. The aim is to cut the turnaround time of a typical market research study from weeks to just a day, Lo said. Market research is a more than $140 billion industry dominated by major companies like Kantar, Ipsos, and consulting giants like McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group. But as AI takes hold of almost every facet of the tech industry, Silicon Valley investors have been asking themselves the same question as Dialogue's founders. \"Maybe you're a designer or an engineer or a consultant, and you can basically conduct research independently with best practices. I think that's one of our visions \u2014 can we almost democratize market research,\" Hoang said. The company has about a dozen clients so far, mostly in the consumer technology space, including large enterprises like Nextdoor, Square, and Wayfair \u2014 which told Dialogue that the platform is saving it seven hours per study. It's also working with smaller startups that don't have robust research teams, like Suno, an AI music company. They plan to use the funding to hire across their engineering, design, and go-to-market departments, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider by text. The company currently has 10 employees, including a research advisor brought on from OpenAI, and plans to grow by over 100% in the next 12 to 18 months. The founders declined to share specific pricing details, but said Dialogue is structured like a typical enterprise SaaS platform, meaning it'll support customers continuously through recurring annual contracts, not just on a study-by-study basis. Hoang told Business Insider the company offers three pricing tiers: \"a pretty affordable tier\" for startups, a midrange option, and a customized enterprise tier for Fortune 500 clients. While Dialogue is focused on making it easier for companies to gather insights from studies with human participants, Lo said he also noticed a growing interest in synthetic insights. \"I think there was a set of VCs who were really interested in the idea of synthetic users \u2014 basically like running consulting-type research on AI-generated users,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":" NintendoSwitch 2  Nintendo is making a lot of Switch 2s. Like, a lot a lot. According to Bloomberg, suppliers have been asked to ramp up production enough for the company to sell up to 25 million Switch 2s by the end of the current fiscal year. Nintendo clearly has ambitious expectations for the pricey sequel to its most successful home console ever. The good news for fans is that basically anyone who wants to buy one has been able to. Sources told Bloomberg Nintendo will likely surpass analysts\u2019 sales estimates that have the Switch 2 selling 17.6 million units by the end of March 2026, and could go on to sell roughly 20 million in the device\u2019s first 10 months on the market. If that turns out to be the case, it would put sales of the Switch 2 squarely within the peak years of the original hardware, blowing the Switch 1\u2019s already strong debut out of the water. Nintendo sold roughly 15 million Switches in that console\u2019s first year, peaking at over 27 million sold in 2020. Between the global pandemic and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, that may have been an anomaly. Still, the console has also had an impressively long tail, thanks in part to the release of revised models and special editions. Basically, if the Switch 2 sales curve starts at a higher point and can draft off similar momentum with hit game releases, it could certainly have the potential to match or even outdo the (at least for now) second-best-selling console of all time. For fans though, this big production push has resulted in a comfortable supply of Switch 2 units on store shelves. Despite the pre-order mess and initial launch chaos, you\u2019ve basically been able to walk into most big box stores and pick up a Switch 2 if you wanted one over the last few months. And that\u2019s despite the ongoing trade war and uncertainty around a possible future Switch 2 price hike. For the device\u2019s first holiday season though, it should be smooth sailing.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"                 reading time 2 minutes        For years now, CNN has been haplessly trying to modernize its media franchise by launching a streaming service. Those of you aware of these efforts will recall CNN+, which launched a few years ago and, despite an ample amount of buzz and financing, humiliatingly lasted less than a month.  Well, not to be deterred, CNN is now trying it again. This week, the news network\u2019s owner, Warner Bros. Discovery, announced its next venture into streaming: CNN \u201cAll Access.\u201d From the looks of things, as reported by CNBC, \u201cAll Access\u201d doesn\u2019t look terribly dissimilar from the last attempt to make this thing happen. \u201cIt\u2019s an essential step in CNN\u2019s evolution,\u201d Reuters quotes Alex MacCallum, CNN Worldwide\u2019s executive vice president for digital products and services, as saying. It may be essential, but will it actually work? That\u2019s the question that hangs over this entire operation. It will likely only work if the network can corner a market of folks who feel that it\u2019s in their best interest to shell out a certain amount of money so that they can stream CNN news programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the jury\u2019s still out on whether such a market even exists. Speaking of money, the pricing for \u201cAll Access\u201d is comparable (but actually higher) than the fees for CNN+, which, at the time of its launch in 2022, cost $6 a month, or $60 a year. \u201cAll Access\u201d costs $6.99 a month or $69.99 annually, CNBC reports, so, inflation considered, it\u2019s not a terrible leap in price. The outlet also notes that, in an effort to gin up some initial interest, the service is also offering a limited-time annual subscription that only costs $41.99. To qualify for that deal, you have to sign up by January 5. If you\u2019ll recall, CNN+ was developed several years ago and was initially hailed as the future of news programming. Problematically, almost nobody signed up for the service. At the time, CNBC reported that, in the first few weeks of the service, only 10,000 people watched CNN+ on a daily basis. Some commentators noted that the demographic most committed to accessing media through streaming (younger viewers) was not exactly the demographic most known for watching CNN (older viewers). At the time of its unfortunate launch, it was compared to Quibi, the financially bloated streaming service launched in 2020 that sought to monetize \u201cquick bite\u201d infotainment but crashed and burned inside of a year. No one knows whether CNN+: The Sequel\u00c2\u00a0will flounder or flourish. The news network has obviously set the bar pretty low for itself. With CNN+\u2019s dismally short-lived tenure, the new service probably only needs to last two months to be considered an improvement by the company\u2019s C-suite.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Samsung has abruptly canceled development of its planned Galaxy S26 Edge smartphone after disappointing sales of the ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Edge, which rivals the iPhone Air, Korea's NewsPim claims. Samsung apparently halted work on the Galaxy S26 Edge this week, informing employees internally that the product line would be discontinued. Internal discussions in September shifted priorities toward the more conventional \"Plus\" form factor after confirming that consumer demand for ultra-slim flagships was weaker than expected. The Galaxy S25 Edge features a thin 5.5mm profile and a 3,900mAh battery, but its high price and reduced battery capacity drew criticism. Samsung's leadership reportedly decided to focus on models with broader consumer appeal rather than pursue niche thin designs that compromise durability, battery life, and other features. The decision comes less than five months after the Galaxy S25 Edge debuted in May, following an ambitious effort to establish a new class of ultra-slim flagship devices positioned between the standard Galaxy S and the Ultra model. The original plan to revive the \"Edge\" brand, once associated with Samsung's curved-display models, was intended to replace the Plus series as a sleeker, trend-driven option.  Samsung will apparently instead add a Galaxy S26 Plus model to its 2026 lineup, reverting to the company's traditional three-tier structure of base, Plus, and Ultra variants. Despite the cancellation, development of the Galaxy S26 Edge was already complete. Development of the S26 Plus is expected to begin before the end of the third quarter of 2025. The atmosphere inside the company is said to be \"chaotic\" and \"embarrassed\" following the sudden lineup revision. Samsung reportedly plans to sell through existing inventory of the Galaxy S25 Edge and cease further production once stock is depleted. If true, the news may not bode well for Apple's \u200ciPhone Air\u200c, which could be facing similar challenges in the market. Last month, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo noted that the \u200ciPhone Air\u200c was the only model of the four new iPhones that was readily available at launch, suggesting lower than expected demand.

Running out of space as a creator or gamer is never ideal; it kills your momentum and affects your productivity. An easy way to make sure that never happens is to invest in a high-capacity, high-speed memory card. Right now, Amazon is offering a solid deal on one of the best in the category. The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD memory card plus adapter is down to $75, which is 38% off its regular price. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saving $45 on a solution that fixes your storage problems for the long term, but the deal won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be around for long. We suggest acting fast to grab it for less while you can. See at Amazon 1TB capacity is more than enough to house tons of high-resolution media content, games, important documents, programs, and so much more. You get read speeds up to 180MB\/s and write speeds up to 130MB\/s when used with compatible Samsung readers, meaning you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to deal with frustrating wait times or an overall slow performance. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using it with a GoPro or drone, these translate into smooth 4K UHD video capture and quicker burst shots. Even better, it is UHS-I, U3, V30, and A2 rated, so you can also run apps directly from the card on Android devices. The included SD card plays nicely with your computer, handheld gaming console, tablet, drone, etc. Basically, if your device has a microSD or SD card slot, you\u2019re good to go. Just note that this version isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compatible with the latest Nintendo Switch 2 yet. The card is also built to last. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water, temperature, X-ray, magnet, drop, and wearout proof, so everyday wear and tear won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect the performance. It can handle a few splashes and drops without throwing a fit, which makes it great to take with you on the go. In short, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a creative, work professional, or just someone whose storage needs are growing and want a solution that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give up on you this is a smart pickup.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"                 reading time 3 minutes        If you\u2019re still warming up to the idea of folding phones with a crease in them, I have bad news; there are likely more phones with more creases on the way. According to a report from Bloomberg, Samsung is going to unveil its tri-fold phone at the end of this month on the occasion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. That report, which confirms earlier reporting by the Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency, is significant for lots of reasons. The most obvious is, well\u2026 it\u2019s a tri-fold phone. As popular as the Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip are, there\u2019s only one company with a tri-fold phone on the market right now, and it\u2019s Huawei. That\u2019s great for people interested in foldable phones who live in areas where Huawei actually conducts business, but for residents of countries\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as the United States of America\u00e2\u0080\u0094where Huawei products are restricted, the existence of that device means little. Samsung\u2019s phone, however, would mark a big expansion of tri-fold availability, and recent reporting from SamMobile suggests that its\u00c2\u00a0entrant will\u00c2\u00a0launch in a bunch of countries, including the U.S., in contrast to previous reports suggesting that the product could be exclusive to China and South Korea. If the expanded range is to be believed, that would be strong evidence that Samsung isn\u2019t just dipping a foot into tri-fold phones; it\u2019s betting big,\u00c2\u00a0and that huge bet is also evident in the timing of the unveiling. As I mentioned previously, Bloomberg reports that the announcement of Samsung\u2019s tri-fold will coincide with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which has world leaders from Donald Trump to Xi Jinping planning visits to the host city of Gyeongju. That could just be a coincidence, but as Bloomberg notes, it\u2019s also a prime chance to express to the world that not only are tri-fold phones on their way, but Samsung\u00c2\u00a0is going to sell them everywhere. In other words, it\u2019s looking more and more like Samsung is actually confident in its tri-fold phone, and it\u2019s betting that you, dear reader, might want to buy one. Now, whether you (or any world leaders) will\u00c2\u00a0actually want to buy one is another question entirely. I\u2019m skeptical about the tri-fold, and not because Samsung can\u2019t execute. The manufacturer clearly has chops in the foldable game, given how well-received the Z Fold 7 was. But there are still a number of questions. For one, there\u2019s the price. Foldables with just one hinge are already pretty damn expensive. The Galaxy Z Fold 7, however nice it may be, starts at an eye-watering $2,000. That\u2019s, last I checked, a lot of money for the vast majority of people. I can\u2019t say for sure, but if I were to make a wager, I\u2019d bet that adding a whole hinge and a lot more screen won\u2019t bring that price down. \u00a0 How much phone\u00c2\u00a0is too much phone? Will adding screen real estate substantially change the foldable experience? How much additional bulk are we talking? Do people even want\u00c2\u00a0a phone with two hinges? A tri-fold is a big bet\u00e2\u0080\u0094but one that, by parading its device out in front of the world\u2019s dignitaries, Samsung appears to think it can win. Working in the company\u2019s favor is its current lead in the foldable phone market. While it does have some big-name competition in Huawei and Google, the former, as I mentioned previously, doesn\u2019t sell phones in the U.S., and the latter, well\u2026 the Pixel 10 Pro Fold going up in flames might be an apt metaphor. That leaves Samsung in a good place ahead of this unveiling. That being said, even the biggest names in tech can take missteps (just ask Apple about its iPhone Mini). I\u2019d be a fool to bet against Samsung when it comes to folding phones, but I\u2019m not quite ready to bet in its favor either.

That dream of leasing a new Tesla might be fading for some Americans. In a move that directly impacts the wallets of potential electric vehicle drivers, the company has significantly raised its monthly lease prices, making the switch to cleaner cars a tougher choice for many. According to Business Insider, the change happened right after the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. That incentive was worth up to $7,500, and its disappearance was felt almost overnight. For a popular car like the Model Y, the 36-month lease price increased from $399 to $449 and even reached as high as $599 a month. The Model 3 saw a similar hike, with its upper-end lease price also climbing. For a lot of families, finding an extra couple of hundred dollars a month for a car payment just isn't possible. This price jump is a huge barrier for people who were on the fence about going electric, as they hoped to save money on gas while helping the environment. It also feeds into bigger worries about the EV market. One auto industry analyst, Karl Brauer, even warned of a potential \"carmageddon,\" telling Yahoo Finance that he could see the EV market share in the U.S. dropping well below 4% without the government incentive. The end of the tax credit did cause a massive rush of sales right before the deadline. At the end of September, NPR cited Matt Jones, senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar, who said that EV sales \"just exploded.\" Now that the dust has settled, carmakers are looking for new ways to keep the momentum going. Tesla, for instance, is getting creative with its referral program, now offering a hefty $1,000 discount on certain models for both the referrer and the new buyer. While market analysts are divided on what to expect next, the competition in the EV space remains fierce. Thankfully, that means there are plenty of EVs to suit different budgets and lifestyles. Would you still consider buying an EV if there weren't tax incentives for doing so?

By Rachel Feltman, Dan Vergano, Jeffery DelViscio, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura  Ignatiev\/Getty Images Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American\u2019s Science Quickly, I\u2019m Rachel Feltman. For generations a massive iron meteorite sat in the Somali desert, becoming a landmark where children played and herders sharpened their knives. Then in 2020 a group of armed men arrived to steal it. The El Ali meteorite contains three minerals never before seen naturally on Earth, making it scientifically priceless. But its journey from Somalia to the black market, with some research along the way, raises uncomfortable questions. Are scientists helping to legitimize stolen artifacts\u2014and perhaps even adding to their monetary value\u2014before they go up for sale?

Here to walk us through the story is Scientific American senior editor Dan Vergano, who investigated the meteorite\u2019s dubious trajectory for a recent feature article. Dan, thanks so much for coming on to talk through this story with us. Dan Vergano: You bet. Good to talk to you. Feltman: So can you start by just painting a picture: You know, what is this meteorite? What made it so special to the local community in Somalia before it disappeared? Vergano: Well, it was, and it wasn\u2019t. It was this thing that was just part of their lives\u2014his rock off in the distance a ways from a village where camel foragers live, you know\u2014and kids played on it, it was in songs, it was a landmark, people used it to sharpen knives, and it was just part of the world that they lived in. And the problem is, also, it\u2019s such a desperate place that we don\u2019t even have really great information. It\u2019s not like anthropologists can just troop out there and start doing a survey because there\u2019s people with guns running around there. You know, it\u2019s a famously dangerous place. And so we don\u2019t really have a full picture even yet of it, which is something the experts I talked to lament. Feltman: How did you first get wind of this story? Vergano: The old-fashioned way for a science editor: it appeared in a journal. The Meteoritical Bulletin had a piece about it; it made news a few years ago. And then this more recent piece came out in a journal over the summer from a Somali expert saying, \u201cOh my goodness, there\u2019s all this horrible stuff that\u2019s happened around the removal of this.\u201d Feltman: Yeah, so before we get into the troubling nature of what\u2019s happened to the meteorite, let\u2019s rewind a little bit. How did scientists first learn about this meteorite? When did they start studying it? Vergano: Scientists first started hearing about it late 2020, early 2021, when a mining company of some sorts started sending them notes saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve got this very interesting meteorite. It\u2019s massive, and we need somebody to actually do a scientific analysis of it.\u201d And so bits and pieces of it dribbled out in the usual way for the meteoritical community, culminating in a bulletin being published in 2022 saying, like, \u201cHere\u2019s its chemical characteristics. Here\u2019s where it\u2019s located. Here\u2019s what sort of meteorite we think it is. Here\u2019s where the sample is held via curators.\u201d And drips and drabs slowly came out. There was a series of analyses that found three new minerals in it over time\u2014over the next two years\u2014which is, it turns out, some really high-tech analysis that has to be done to look at these very fine inclusions of minerals in these iron meteorites to come to that kind of finding. And at about that time, say 2023, 2024, it was just like, \u201cWow, a really interesting iron meteorite,\u201d and also, it\u2019s massive and pretty important in terms of African meteorites: the third-largest one ever found there; ninth-, seventh-, eighth-[largest], depending on who you talk to now, meteorite in the world. So it\u2019s just an interesting scientific object. It tells us something about the collision between asteroids that bakes this sort of iron object in, in a cauldron\u2014two things in space smashing into each other and cooking their surfaces off and producing this 15-ton iron can [laughs] that gets shot into Earth and ends up in a wadi in the Horn of Africa. Feltman: And just how big are we talking? Vergano: So for iron meteorites I don\u2019t actually know; it might be one of the largest we have. The Cape York meteorite, in, uh, which hit Greenland, is bigger. But we\u2019re talking about something roughly a little bigger than six feet wide, four feet tall and heavy as hell. This is a giant clunk of iron. And its significance is that it\u2019s iron because that\u2019s only a small fraction of the meteorites that we get. Most of them are silica; they\u2019re sand and dust. And these iron ones are parts of the core of a starter planet, so it\u2019s, like, interesting\u2014or the mantle, at least; they\u2019re arguing about it. But at any rate they tell us something more about planet formation than just your run-of-the-mill meteorite. For Africa as well, it\u2019s a place that\u2019s underexplored scientifically, and so finding this is also a sign, like, \u201cHey, there\u2019s a lot more out there; we should be looking,\u201d as well. Feltman: Yeah, and could you tell us more about those three minerals that were found that don\u2019t naturally occur on Earth? Vergano: So the three minerals are basically phosphate inclusions in this iron meteorite. And that\u2019s interesting because it means that they aren\u2019t from the interior, the iron core, of the protoplanet of some sort that this thing hit, but it\u2019s a place where the mantle hit the core when the collision happened and this stuff cooked into it. And it\u2019s really weird behavior. It\u2019s the stuff you don\u2019t find on Earth: two things in a vacuum, at least one of them made outta iron, smacking into each other at really high speeds and cooking. It\u2019s not a kind of furnace you would find, like, in Pittsburgh to make steel. It\u2019s a weird space environment. And so the three elements are interesting, both in terms of what they can tell us about the environment where this happened\u2014you can figure out things like what exactly was the pressure, speed, temperature at which you can develop these sort of things, which we can\u2019t do on Earth, at least not easily. Somebody could try and figure out how to reverse their engineering, but this is the kind of thing that only sort of artifacts from space can tell you. And what does that mean about the environment in which they formed, to set up that kind of experiment that cooked these guys off? What is the nature of building a planet? Which is a real question for us because we live on a planet, and we\u2019d very much like to know how they form, and these are the sort of clues which tells us something about how Earth itself started. Feltman: Yeah, so definitely scientifically significant, but as your feature explains this analysis only came about because of a, a pretty dark turn in the meteorite\u2019s history. Could you tell us what happened there and also how it came to light? Vergano: What\u2019s really interesting about this is it sheds a kind of a dark light on science itself ... Feltman: Mm. Vergano: Like, science being used to legitimize the theft of an object, similar to archaeological objects and even the art world. What was clear in the report in June in a meteorite publication was that there had been some serious reports of bloodshed surrounding this thing. I mean, the, the\u2014you don\u2019t read about beheadings ... Feltman: Mm. Vergano: In a scientific journal very often. And there\u2014it was mentioned there, right in black and white, which, you know, kind of got my attention. And this was buried in the Somali press\u2014like, [it\u2019s] a sign of the lack of connection in the world that there are what seemed like very serious reports that this was stolen, involving gunfire and people being shot to death, and then trucked to Mogadishu and then smuggled out of the country under circumstances that government officials call \u201ccorrupt\u201d there. So it\u2019s easy to be cynical and say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s Somalia.\u201d [But] this is a scientific and cultural artifact that\u2019s being stolen from this poor country. So the fact that scientists, at best, were used to legitimate the provenance of this thing in order to sell it\u2014which the, you know, buyers want millions of dollars for it, [though] their prices change, but they want anything from $30 million to $3.2 million for it\u2014and that the scientific verification that, \u201cYea, verily, this is a genuine meteorite, the kind of thing that you, rich guy, wanna have in your living room,\u201d is troubling. It speaks to, I think, a field\u2014a scientific field that hasn\u2019t grappled with its responsibility towards the rest of the world. It\u2019s just, \u201cOh, these things are fun to study ...\u201d Feltman: Mm. Vergano: \u201cLet\u2019s get \u2019em in the lab.\u201d And, you know, \u201cOkay, so what, somebody uses the provenance to sell it to somebody who has no interest, really, in science other than it\u2019s just, like, the same thing as putting up a fancy guitar on their wall to have this fancy meteorite in their living room.\u201d It\u2019s really troubling. Although I did find some people in Somalia who said, like, \u201cThese are all exaggerations,\u201d these reports of bloodshed. And we reported that, which\u2014we can\u2019t go in. I mean ... Feltman: Yeah. Vergano: You know? Like, it\u2019s, it\u2019s very much on the, on the State Department\u2019s list of \u201cdo not go there\u201d places. So it\u2019s not like I can send a reporter there and say, \u201cHey, could you check this out?\u201d But these are reports in the news for several years of people being shot, of local militia fighting with al-Shabaab to recover this thing and to prevent them from taking it and being shot and the thing being stolen, so ... Feltman: Mm. Vergano: So that\u2019s not your typical scientific study. This isn\u2019t like, \u201cWe went to Pompeii, and we found a new mural.\u201d This is ... Feltman: Right. Vergano: This thing was [believed to have been] stolen by straight-up terrorists\u2014they\u2019re on the terrorist list from the State Department\u2014carted away and sold to shady businessmen who don\u2019t, clearly, know what they\u2019re doing ... Feltman: Yeah. Vergano: Or they never would\u2019ve done it this way. And it\u2019s bad for science, it\u2019s bad for the world, and it\u2019s bad for Somalia. Feltman: Yeah, what do we know about who was involved in the theft and smuggling of this meteorite and what their motivation was? Vergano: Money. Feltman: Mm. Vergano: So what we do know, or what seems to be credibly reported, is that some Somali businessmen-traders had set up a mining company, which was sweeping through this area, looking for resources: opals. And they found this meteorite that\u2014it\u2019s a landmark, so it\u2019s not hard to find. They took a sample; they sent it to Nairobi\u2014this is around 2019. And it said, \u201cThis is really interesting. This is a metal thing. This isn\u2019t a rock.\u201d They sent gunmen, and they seem to be connected to al-Shabaab. It\u2019s not like people wear outfits, like working at Starbucks, saying, \u201cI\u2019m with al-Shabaab.\u201d You have a gun, and you\u2019re a young gunman\u2014you\u2019re probably connected to them in some way. There are also local militias; this is a tribal clan area of the world. So it\u2019s very complicated and hard for us to parse all the different loyalties. But it seems straight up, they\u2019re connected to this terrorist group\u2014the people who were sent to recover it\u2014acting, at least, as security for the crane[s] that came and lifted it out of the ground. So what do we know? Gunman [seemingly] connected to a known terrorist group were part of the team that removed this object and took it to a small town, away from the village where it was located, and then they sold it to these five businessmen called the Kureym Mining [and Rocks] Company. And those guys trucked it to Mogadishu, where it was seized, and then ended up back in their hands somehow. And it\u2019s not clear how it happened, and we repeatedly tried to contact them, the scientists have asked them for their licenses and that sort of thing, and nobody has produced anything resembling paperwork to us and\/or wanted to go on the record at all about it. Feltman: And what do we know about where the object is now? Vergano: It\u2019s now located, as far as we know, as best we know, in a small city about 50 miles inland in China in a warehouse ... Feltman: Mm. Vergano: According to, like, cell-phone videos. It\u2019s just sitting there while the possessors dicker with people about how to sell it. There have been reports on bulletin boards from the meteorite community of people who tried to buy it, tried to make deals with them, despite the lack of, like, a really good provenance, and didn\u2019t get anywhere, that they would change their minds at the last minute. So you have five feuding owners of some kind. How it ended up in China, why China? Not clear, other than China is a center of smuggling meteorites. A number of them have showed up in the past there. The Chinese authorities have seized them at times. And so somebody had the idea that moving it\u2014among these five folks\u2014that moving it there was a good way to keep it secure, rather than keeping it in Mogadishu in a warehouse. Feltman: Well, and, you know, speaking of, you know, China\u2019s history of meteorite smuggling, could you give us some context for how common this kind of thing seems to be? Vergano: We don\u2019t know. Feltman: Mm. Vergano: I\u2019ve been told by criminologists that the meteorite market in the last five years has become pulled into the whole collecting world. The same guys who buy Tyrannosaurus ... Feltman: Mm. Vergano: And put it out by the pool, the same guy who buys, like, a Superman comic book from 1935\u2014that sort of world of too much money, Silicon Valley wealth has infected the meteorite market. Meteorites have been sold since [the] 1800s, at least ... Feltman: Sure. Vergano: Probably earlier. But, like, those were just weird collectors; they like rocks. What we\u2019ve seen within this decade is it moving into the world of Sotheby\u2019s and other sort of high-end collectible sales, just like seemingly everything else. I wish I\u2019d kept my comic books from when I was a kid. And so that money has infected this world of meteorites. Sotheby\u2019s sold a Martian meteorite this summer, and, like, that got a lot of attention. Feltman: Yeah. Vergano: And the scientific field hasn\u2019t caught up to it, [the fact that] this is going on. The same way that archaeology has had to catch up to things, the same way that paleontology has had to catch up to this auctioning of assets, the meteorite community is gonna have to grapple with this as well, I think. Feltman: Yeah. And the scientists involved in analyzing the meteorite, what did they have to say about their role in this? Vergano: They basically feel bamboozled. They feel like they were\u2014this is what they say\u2014they were acting as scientists. Somebody approaches them, says, \u201cWe\u2019re a mining company. We found this interesting thing. We need a scientist to analyze this to see what it really is, and it looks really interesting.\u201d And so you\u2019re a scientist and your goal in life is to look at interesting things, you look at meteorites, and you\u2019re like, \u201cYou bet. Send me a sample, and we\u2019ll get it taken care of.\u201d Nobody said to them, like, \u201cOh, we shot a bunch of people to get this thing.\u201d Some of the criminologists I talked to said, like, \u201cYeah, that sounds really naive.\u201d Some other meteorite experts said, like, \u201cHow could you not ask? This is a part of the world where you gotta ask questions.\u201d And so that\u2019s the tension in the story, I think, that we try and get at, is: \u201cWhat was their responsibility?\u201d They say, like, \u201cIf I\u2019d known, I wouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d But, like, it\u2019s a question, I think, for readers and for the scientific community, like: \u201cWhat is the thing that should have been done here? How should this be handled, instead of the way it\u2019s been handled?\u201d Because, you know, it\u2019s a mess. The thing is gone from the scientific world; it\u2019s gone from the cultural world. It\u2019s\u2014just seems like a bad outcome to have it sitting in limbo. Feltman: Yeah, and does it seem like this particular case is leading to any reflection in the field about those kinds of questions? Vergano: It\u2019s just starting. I think this story and the Sotheby\u2019s sale of the Martian meteorite is the beginning of the field grappling with it, just starting this summer. These are people who decide things in six-month increments at conferences and court cases and decisions that percolate up through stories like ours over years. In three years there\u2019ll be a conference at the meteorite meeting, and they\u2019ll put out new bylaws. But it\u2019s just\u2014the discussion\u2019s just starting right now. You see the same tensions here that you saw, I think, in archaeology, where you had collectors funding people, essentially. Feltman: Mm-hmm. Vergano: That was a problem 20 years ago, 15 years ago, still may be a problem in some cases. And so you have to get funding, and there\u2019s not a lot of money in this field, and these are expensive machines that do the analyses. So when the guy who\u2019s paying for your career says, \u201cHey, don\u2019t look into this too closely,\u201d you can see a field react more slowly than one where there\u2019s a clean line to taking care of ethical problems. And this is a problem with the way we do science in the world, you know? This is not an area that\u2019s, like, as funded as well as, like, chemistry, you know [laughs]? So, you know, if you lose a donor, you lose the source of these rocks, you don\u2019t do any science. So that\u2019s what they\u2019re gonna have to navigate in the next three years. So the short answer is: I only see the conversation just starting now. I don\u2019t see it as being a clear line developing to how they\u2019re gonna handle this. Feltman: Thanks so much for coming on to talk us through this. Of course, our listeners can check out the story itself for more, but we really appreciate your time. Vergano: You bet.

I've been shopping at Costco for as long as I can remember. As a child, I loved trying the samples and getting a smiley face drawn on my receipt at the exit. I even begged my parents to let me have my Sweet 16 there \u2014 an idea that was quickly vetoed, unfortunately. Now 27 and an executive member, I shop for myself and my sister, who lives with me. Neither of us enjoys cooking, and with busy careers in media and entertainment, we usually don't have the time to make elaborate meals, anyway. Instead, we rely on Costco's prepared foods and easy staples that fit into our grab-and-go lifestyle. Costco's rotisserie chicken is, in my opinion, the store's ultimate classic product. It's fresh, flavorful, and only $5. A single rotisserie chicken can last me several meals. Immediately after buying one, I'll debone it and use the meat in sandwiches, wraps, or quesadillas. This Kirkland Signature meal kit is one of my favorite easy midweek dinners. Everything is prepped and ready to go, making it the perfect \"I don't want to think about it\" meal. Although the chicken-quesadilla kit is my favorite, I'll sometimes buy Costco's premade taco kits to mix things up. At just $12 for a pack of two hearty bowls, this freezable tomato soup is my favorite comfort food. I often describe it as a hug in a bowl: It stays refrigerated and heats up quickly in just a few minutes. I love pairing it with burrata whenever I happen to have it in my fridge. Don Miguel's chicken chipotle mini tacos are a snack I eat constantly. I'll just pop them in the microwave or air fryer and enjoy them within minutes. A pack comes with 50 tacos, and although they're small, they go a long way \u2014 usually, one pack will last me a month. They're also the perfect easy snack for tailgate season, when my sister and I host football watch parties at our house. A trip to Costco is incomplete without a box (or two) of Driscoll's raspberries. My sister and I love to eat these with a little whipped cream, often while watching \"Real Housewives.\" In my house, cheese is a must. I add these ready-to-serve mozzarella slices to salads or soups when I want to feel a little gourmet. Sometimes, I'll even run to the fridge just to snack on some mozzarella in between meetings. Growing up in a Slovak Eastern Orthodox household, my sister and I have never eaten red meat on Fridays for religious reasons \u2014 so, salmon is one of our go-to Friday dinners. I'll also toss it into salads during the week. This is the most expensive item on our shopping list, but I find Kirkland Signature's salmon to taste fresher than other frozen fish I've tried. I also like that it doesn't have any additional flavoring. El Monterey is the only taquito brand I'll always buy, so I'm lucky that Costco carries it. The competition just doesn't stack up in terms of flavor, crispiness, or consistency. Its chicken-and-cheese taquitos are, in my opinion, the best late-night snack. I love eating a few after I get home from a concert. Bibigo's frozen Korean meals are some of my absolute favorites. I always stock up on this crunchy glazed chicken \u2014 it tastes like it came from a restaurant, and I love pairing this with string beans. A grocery-store trip is incomplete without a sweet treat, and I believe that Tru Fru's chocolate-covered strawberries are some of the best in the world. At Costco, I can buy a 20-ounce bag of them for under $14. I prefer to eat these over making them at home because of the double layer of milk and white chocolate. It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to what always seems to be a perfectly ripe strawberry interior. My grandma always had a stash of Kirkland Signature pistachios from Costco when I was growing up, and the nuts still taste as good as I remember. Even now, snacking on them makes me remember shelling them while watching TV with her. I won't end a shopping trip without swinging by the Costco food court for a $2 slice of pizza. One slice is so thick that it fills me up for a few hours, and I love the cheese-to-sauce ratio. Nothing puts a smile on my face quite like a warm Costco slice.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"by Calculated Risk on 10\/17\/2025 08:11:00 AM  From March 2013: Business Cycles and Markets  I've been asked several times about the recent ECRI recession call (obviously I disagreed with their incorrect recession call in 2011 - I wasn't even on recession watch then and I'm not on recession watch now - and I also think ECRI is wrong about a recession starting in mid-2012). ...  It seems to me ECRI is trying to make this an academic exercise and hoping for some significant downward revisions. Right now the data doesn't indicate a recession in 2012, but, as Menzie Chinn notes, \"all of these series will be revised, so one wouldn\u2019t want to state definitively we are not in a recession \u2013 therein lies the path to embarrassment. But the case still has to be made for recession.\"  But why do we care? ...  Why is there so much focus on the business cycle? For companies, especially cyclical companies, the reason is obvious \u2013 it helps with planning, staffing and investment.  But why are investors so focused on the business cycle? Obviously earnings decline in a recession, and stock prices fall too. The following graph shows the year-over-year (YoY) change in the S&P 500 (using average monthly prices) since 1970. Notice that the market usually declines YoY in a recession. ... So calling a recession isn\u2019t just an academic exercise, there is some opportunity to preserve capital.

WordPress continues its decline and SaaS builders gain traction \u2013 monitor the shifts in the CMS market for the most popular platforms WordPress remains the dominant force in content management systems, powering 43.3% of websites surveyed and holding a 60.7% share among sites using a CMS, according to W3Techs (October 2025). That is still a commanding lead, but it marks a sustained decline from its peak of 65.2% in 2022 and is back to the same level as 2018, prior to the pandemic boom. For executives and technical teams, this shift signals more than a market statistic. As WordPress shows its first significant slide in two decades, SaaS competitors like Shopify, Wix, and Squarespace are steadily gaining ground, offering businesses simpler, managed solutions with lower technical overhead. At the same time, the share of websites running without any CMS has dropped to 28.6%, which continues the broader industry trend toward structured platforms and hosted builders. It means that choosing the right CMS today is less about preference and more about a strategic decision, with measurable impact on site performance, security, costs, and scalability. This report breaks down the current CMS landscape, compares the top platforms, and outlines how the latest shifts influence platform strategy and technical execution. According to W3Techs, 71.4% of websites have a CMS, and Netcraft reports over 281 million domains. From this, we can assume that the current market size for content management systems has risen to over 200 million websites. Data from W3Techs, October 2025. (WooCommerce and Elementor are not listed in the table above as they\u2019re WordPress plugins and not standalone CMS platforms.)   *Graphs are separated due to the dominance of the WordPress market share. WordPress remains the most widely used CMS, a position it has held since its launch in 2003. Its usage across all websites grew by 105% from 2014 to 2022, cementing its role as the default platform for much of the web. But its long-standing growth curve is now in a downturn; we\u2019re seeing a market share decline of nearly seven percentage points in the last three years. It\u2019s a trend that could continue as easier-to-use platforms gain ground and some users report frustrations with plugin compatibility, core updates, and security management. Read more: Should You Still Use WordPress? As the second-most popular CMS today, Shopify\u2019s market share stands at 6.8% and is used by 4.8% of all websites surveyed. Its strength is no accident: Shopify consistently performs well in Core Web Vitals benchmarks, making it competitive even in technical metrics. From an SEO and business perspective, this means that Shopify offers executives a CMS option designed to support both performance and long-term growth. Wix has made one of the more noticeable gains this year, now powering 4.1% of websites surveyed. The platform\u2019s steady climb reflects broader market traction among small businesses. Case in point: A Reddit business owner notes its convenient and user-friendly features. For executives, the takeaway is clear: Wix is positioning itself beyond a lightweight website builder that consistently invests in branding and platform capabilities, making it a viable contender for mid-market adoption. Squarespace has shown steady growth over the past decade, with its CMS market share growing from 0.3% in 2014 to 3.4% today, with 2.4% of\u00a0 websites surveyed now using the platform. Its growth could be attributed to the increasing demand for low-maintenance, design-forward platforms. Read more: WordPress Vs. Squarespace \u2013 Which One Is Better? Joomla and Drupal were among the top 3 until 2021, and since then, they have seen a steady decline in market share, now accounting for only 2.0% and 1.1%, respectively. This shift likely reflects a broader trend where more user-friendly, SaaS-based platforms capture the attention of small businesses and non-technical users. At the same time, Webflow has emerged as a contender, climbing to 1.2% of the CMS market share. Its growth reflects demand for design-led platforms that allow businesses to streamline development without heavy technical dependencies, with professionals noting speed as a real differentiator. Between 2024 and October 2025, websites operating without a CMS dropped by 2.8 percentage points, continuing a trend away from custom-coded solutions. During the same period, websites using WordPress grew by just less than 1%. The decline in \u201cno CMS\u201d websites signals an ongoing trend toward more structured, manageable platforms for site creation.  Since 2024, Joomla has decreased its market share by 20%, while Drupal has declined by 31%. Together, they once held almost 15% of the CMS market share in 2014 \u2013 now that figure sits at just over 3%. They\u2019ve slipped from the No. 2 and No. 3 spots to No. 5 and No. 6, overtaken by faster-growing platforms like Wix and Squarespace in 2022. Joomla, in particular, had strong momentum early on \u2013 briefly surpassed WordPress in search interest until around 2008, according to Google Trends \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t kept pace with modern platform demands. Why did these popular content management systems decline so much? It\u2019s most likely due to the strength of third-party support for WordPress with plugins and themes, making it much more accessible. The growth of website builders, such as Wix and Squarespace, indicates that small businesses want a more straightforward managed solution, and they have started to nibble on market share from the bottom. Over the full period from October 2024 to October 2025, the market share of: If we look at the website builders, their growth is a strong indication of where the market might go in the future. SaaS web builders such as Wix and Squarespace don\u2019t require coding knowledge and offer a hosted website that makes it more accessible for a small business to get a web presence quickly. No need to arrange a hosting solution, install a website, and set up your own email. A web builder neatly does all this for you. WordPress is not known as a complicated platform to use, but it does require some coding knowledge and an understanding of how websites are built. On the other hand, a website builder is a much easier route to market, without the need to understand what is happening in the back end. Read more: Wix Changed How Websites Are Built And Why You Should Pay Attention Elementor is the most widely used WordPress page builder, installed on 18.1% of all websites with a known CMS and 12.9% of all sites surveyed (not shown below) \u2013 more than Wix and Squarespace combined \u2013 though it functions as a plugin within WordPress, not a standalone CMS. While not a CMS on its own, it\u2019s a major player in shaping how WordPress is used. However, because it\u2019s a third-party plugin and not a CMS, it isn\u2019t listed in the top 10 CMS above. If we compare the volume of traffic to the number of CMS, we can see that WordPress is in the golden section, up and to the right, clearly favored by sites with more traffic. Based on usage among higher-ranked domains, Joomla fits into a niche of fewer installs but more high-traffic sites, indicating that more professional sites are using it. Squarespace and Wix are to the left and down, highlighting that they are installed on fewer sites with less traffic. It strongly indicates that they are used more by small websites and small businesses. Elementor bridges the gap between the two and has the weight of the WordPress market share, but is used by sites with less traffic. This means the appetite is growing for drag-and-drop, plug-and-play solutions that make having a web presence accessible for anyone. This is the space to watch. WooCommerce has a market share of 12.4%, while Shopify has 6.8%. The ecommerce CMS space echoes a pattern similar to that of website builders. WooCommerce powers 8.9% of all existing websites, making it the most widely adopted ecommerce plugin by far. It doesn\u2019t appear in W3Techs\u2019 top CMS list because it is a WordPress plugin, but it\u2019s a key factor in WordPress\u2019s enduring popularity. Looking at the distribution, we can see a clear pattern emerge. In comparison to other ecommerce CMS platforms, WooCommerce is dominant. It has more market share than its competitors combined: Shopify (6.8%) + PrestaShop (0.8%) + OpenCart (0.6%) = 8.2% market share. Smaller sites might favor WooCommerce, but it has the WordPress platform\u2019s weight for market access and, therefore, more installs, much like Elementor. Shopify surged during the pandemic, with market share growing by 52.9% from 2020 to 2021 and then 26.9% from 2021 to 2022, outpacing every other platform. After a dip in 2023, it recovered in 2024 and has since leveled off, holding steady at 6.8% this year. As the market fragments, these shifts affect everything from site architecture, plugin availability, and technical SEO flexibility. WordPress continues to lead, but its gradual decline marks a turning point. SaaS competitors such as Shopify, Wix, and Squarespace are steadily gaining traction, offering streamlined platforms that appeal to most businesses. If more SMBs are switching to website builders, understanding the limitations and intricacies of these platforms for SEO could be a competitive advantage. CMS adoption determines how efficiently teams can build, secure, and optimize sites at scale. Shopify now runs on 4.8% of all websites surveyed (not just sites with a CMS). With its increasing market share, specializing in Shopify SEO could be a strategic move for an SEO professional. Wix and Squarespace are growing, too. As more small businesses adopt these platforms, getting fluent in their ecosystems could set you apart in a crowded market. The reality is that WordPress remains the largest and most competitive ecosystem, but the growth curve has shifted toward challengers. This means one thing for business leaders and SEO professionals: an opportunity to diversify expertise. Understanding the strengths and limitations of various CMS platforms can inform strategic decisions and align with evolving market demands.

Micron Technology (MU)\u2019s stock didn\u2019t just move up slightly\u2014it skyrocketed, propelled by a powerful combination of factors that bolstered market confidence dramatically. The 77% increase is rooted in more than just noteworthy revenue growth and a significant rise in profitability; it\u2019s the result of outstanding Q4 earnings, optimistic AI-driven demand, and a flurry of analyst upgrades that transformed market expectations. As the memory chip industry heats up and prices improve, Micron Technology (MU)\u2019s unique mix of strategic strength and market momentum is altering the game plan\u2014and investors are paying attention. So what\u2019s going on? The stock price surged by 77%, driven by a synergy of factors acting together. Revenue rose by 11%, representing solid top-line growth, while net margin improved by 24%, emphasizing enhanced profitability. Additionally, the P\/E multiple surged by 30%, indicating increased market confidence in the company\u2019s future prospects. These developments laid the groundwork for the key changes and strategic maneuvers that followed, which we\u2019ll explore next. Before we delve into details of events that contributed to the stock surge, here is what market wisdom suggests: Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is substantial value in a broader diversified strategy, as we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in one stock you favor or create a portfolio meant to perform across market cycles? Our data indicates that High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking unpredictability into market-beating consistency. This portfolio is part of the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a wealth management firm based in the Boston area and Trefis partner \u2013 whose asset allocation framework yielded positive outcomes during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced losses of over 40%.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Pfizer stock (NYSE: PFE) is currently in a significant slump, marking its ninth consecutive day of decline and losing a total of \u221211% of its value over that period. This sustained sell-off has wiped out approximately $18 billion in market capitalization, leaving its current value at around $138 billion. The stock remains 3.8% lower than its closing price in 2024, sharply contrasting with the 12.7% year-to-date return posted by the S&P 500. Despite recent positive news\u2014including strong Phase 3 trial results for a breast cancer treatment and a new acquisition (Metsera) in the weight management sector\u2014these developments have failed to reassure investors. The market\u2019s negative outlook is primarily driven by serious revenue challenges, specifically the looming impact of patent expiries on key blockbuster drugs like Eliquis and Ibrance. PFE offers biopharmaceutical products, which encompass medicines, vaccines, and biosimilars targeting cardiovascular, metabolic, women's health, as well as chronic immune and inflammatory conditions. Is this decline a warning sign or an opportunity for recovery? Explore further with Buy or Sell PFE. Separately, see \u2013 S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? PFE stock has declined significantly of late, and we currently find it appealing. While this may seem like a chance, there is considerable risk in depending solely on one stock. Conversely, a diverse investment strategy like the one we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers substantial value. We extend our focus beyond just equities. Would a portfolio comprising 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to equities and bonds, be likely to yield higher returns over the next 1-3 years while providing better protection if markets plummet by 20%? We have analyzed the figures. The table below outlines the returns for PFE stock compared to the S&P 500 index over several different durations, including the ongoing streak: What is the significance? Prolonged weakness can signify more than mere noise. It often indicates a shift in sentiment or deeper issues. A multi-day losing pattern might forewarn of additional declines or could represent an opportunity to buy, provided that the fundamentals remain sound. Currently, there are 50 S&P constituents with consecutive gains spanning 3 days or longer, and 36 constituents exhibit losses over the same period. The current losing streak of PFE stock does not instill much confidence in investors. Conversely, Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed its benchmark, encompassing all three indices - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Ahead of the Hindu festival of Diwali, the jewellery market in Indian capital Delhi's vibrant Lajpat Nagar neighbourhood is teeming with crowds. Shops have stayed open even on holidays, and at dusk, dozens of cars line up the streets as a string of flashy signboards beckon shoppers into the flower-adorned stores. Soaring gold prices - which have topped $1,440 (\u00a31,081) for 10g - may have slightly dented demand for jewellery in the world's second largest market for the yellow metal this year, but Indians are not willing to entirely give up on their penchant for gold yet. Diwali, along with Dhanteras -  a smaller festival that falls on Saturday this year - are believed to be auspicious occasions to buy precious metal, with hundreds of thousands of Indians flocking the markets to buy gold and silver coins, bars and jewellery, which they believe bring wealth and luck. Skyrocketing prices have created FOMO - or the fear of missing out - in the minds of buyers, who are worried prices might rise even further, Prakash Pahlajani, who runs Kumar Jewels, a family-owned business, told the BBC on a busy evening at his shop. \"As a result, I have more customers this year,\" Mr Pahlajani said. But with prices - gold is up 60% and silver 70% - shooting through the roof, jewellers are having to change tack to counter stagnant customer budgets. \"People are not saying 'I don't want to buy'. Instead, they are saying, 'I'll buy a little less,\" said Tanishq Gupta, another jeweller down the road from Mr Pahlajani's shop.  He said he's had to be innovative and design pieces that look elaborate but have a reduced quantity of gold in them. A coin made of 250mg gold, which he sells for as low as $35, is now thinner but made to look as big as the heavier ones. Coins weighing a tenth of that, at 25mg, are also on offer in the market. Pushpinder Chauhan, another retailer in the area, said higher prices had also exacerbated the growing preference for lighter jewellery this year, \"especially among younger buyers\" who want pieces for everyday wear and not just special occasions. Several jewellers the BBC spoke to pointed to another clear trend - more customers were buying gold and silver for investment rather than jewellery this year, something that is also reflected in bullion market data. While gold jewellery continues to account for the largest share of India's overall gold demand, the proportion driven by investment - primarily bars and coins - has been rising steadily, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). \"Jewellery's share declined to 64% in the second quarter of this year, from 80% in the same period in 2023, while investment demand increased from 19% to 35% over the same period,\" Kavita Chacko, the council's research head, told the BBC. A lot of that demand is also being fed by investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or digital gold, where September marked record high inflows. ETF assets under management have surged by over 70% this year. Besides retail demand, gold prices are also being significantly influenced by India's central bank, with the metal's share in its foreign exchange reserves rising from 9% to 14% in 2025, according to WGC. In fact, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been \"a major pillar of global gold demand over the past three years\", said Kaynat Chainwala who tracks commodities at Kotak Securities, a broking house. She said the RBI has been stocking up on gold in a bid to diversify its foreign exchange holdings, reduce its dependence on the dollar and provide stability during geopolitical stress. Going forward, with the festive and the wedding season under way, retail demand for gold and silver is expected to continue to hold up despite record-high prices, say experts. \"The affluent classes will continue to buy, though it is a setback for lower income families,\" said Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at the state-run Bank of Baroda. \"Demand will hold up in value terms, even though volumes will fall.\" But some families have been totally priced out of the market.  \"I am now having to think a lot while buying - about whether to even get something,\" Bhavna, who's getting married in February, told the BBC outside Mr Pahlajani's jewellery store. For the moment, she's held off her purchases and is waiting for prices to fall a bit so that she can come back to finish her wedding shopping.  Such strong cultural affinity for physical gold, particularly jewellery, means the appetite for the noble metal is unlikely to be dented in the long term, despite the short-term moderation, say experts. This is especially true for a country where high gold holdings have given solid long-term returns, making many Indians affluent at a time when growth is stumbling and jobs are hard to come by. According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held a staggering $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's GDP. \"This implies a positive wealth effect on the household balance sheet, given the uptrend in gold prices,\" Economists Upasana Chachra and Bani Gambhir wrote in a recent note, adding that Indian families are also benefitting from \"cyclical factors of lower interest payments with monetary policy easing, and the positive impact on disposable income through direct and indirect tax cuts\". That's not a bad start to the festive season, even though record prices may have taken some glitter off the precious metal.    Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GRAIL shares soared 14% on October 16, 2025, after the announcement of a strategic partnership with Samsung C&T and Samsung Electronics to introduce the company\u2019s Galleri multi-cancer early detection test in key Asian markets. Samsung entities have committed to investing $110 million in GRAIL at $70.05 per share, with Samsung C&T acquiring exclusive distribution rights in South Korea and potential further expansion into Japan and Singapore. The stock rose another 9% in extended trading, bringing the share price to about $90. The agreement allows Samsung to incorporate GRAIL\u2019s genomic diagnostic technologies into its digital health ecosystem via the Samsung Health platform, potentially offering personalized cancer screening to users throughout Asia. This creates a significant market expansion opportunity, especially considering that around 70% of cancers lack recommended screening methods. Although this is undoubtedly a positive advancement for GRAIL, the recent surge has elevated the stock to high valuations. Nevertheless, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GRAL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has convincingly outperformed its benchmark\u2014a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has reported returns surpassing 105% since its establishment. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a more stable experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. GRAIL exhibits strong revenue momentum, achieving an average annual growth rate of 22.4% over the past three years versus 5.4% for the S&P 500. Recent data indicates year-over-year revenue growth of 22.4% to $134 million over the last twelve months, with quarterly revenues reaching $36 million\u2014an 11.2% increase year-over-year compared to 6.1% for the broader market. The company\u2019s profitability indicators point to significant operational challenges: These statistics suggest that GRAIL is expending significant cash while scaling its operations\u2014a typical scenario for early-stage biotech firms working towards market penetration before securing reimbursement approval. In spite of operational losses, GRAIL exhibits strong financial stability: GRAIL is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 25.6x, significantly surpassing the S&P 500\u2019s 3.2x multiple. At current levels around $90, the stock is trading roughly 50% above the average analyst price target of $60, indicating that the market has likely factored in considerable future growth from the Samsung alliance. Additionally, investing in a single stock without thorough analysis carries risks. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outshined its all-cap stocks benchmark (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. What is the reason? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a proactive strategy to leverage favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics. The Samsung partnership signifies a genuinely strategic advantage. Access to the Asian market, distribution infrastructure, and integration with Samsung\u2019s health ecosystem offer distinct avenues for revenue growth. The $110 million investment further reinforces GRAIL\u2019s balance sheet at a pivotal moment. However, the stock's sudden surge of over 20% within a few days seems to have surpassed immediate fundamentals. The company remains significantly unprofitable, with a cash burn rate necessitating future capital raises or rapid commercialization achievements. At over 25x sales\u2014eight times the market norm\u2014the valuation leaves limited room for execution errors or regulatory setbacks. While the Samsung collaboration validates GRAIL\u2019s technology and market potential, patient investors may discover better entry points after the initial excitement fades.","label":0}

Over three and a half years into the war, Ukraine is still finding thousands of foreign-made parts in the Russian missiles and drones raining down on its cities. The findings highlight how Moscow continues to evade sanctions and export controls that were meant to choke off its weapons industry. \"In the same way that we've had three and a half years to try to increase the restrictions, the other side has had three and a half years to figure out ways around them,\" Nathanael Kurcab, a former FBI intelligence agent and an international trade and national security expert, told Business Insider. The components found in downed Russian drones and cruise and ballistic missiles range from microcomputers and sensors to switching connectors and converters. Ukraine says they're coming from the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, South Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan. Some of these nations are among Kyiv's closest partners. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said over 100,000 foreign-made parts were found among the 550 Russian drones and missiles used in a large-scale bombardment, underscoring the scale of the problem. Every Russian missile and one-way attack drone contains \"parts that are still being supplied to Russia from Western countries and various countries close to Russia,\" Zelenskyy said last week. This far into the war, he said, \"it is simply strange to hear anyone claim they don't know how to stop the flow of critical components.\" Cutting off the tap isn't that easy though. A Western-made microchip built for benign purposes could wind up in a Russian drone in a number of ways, such as through civilian sales, shady middlemen, or countries ignoring export rules. What might have started as a \"dual-use\" part for everyday tech may quietly become a key component in a weapon of war. After Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Western countries imposed sweeping sanctions and export controls on Russia in an attempt to isolate its economy and deny the country access to critical parts and technology that could be used for military purposes. But Russia has found workarounds, such as using networks of front companies and shadowy intermediaries to move banned goods through the global market. Neither Russia's defense ministry nor its embassy in the US immediately responded to requests for comment. Countries like Russia \"have built strong circumvention networks that are able to hide where these goods are going, and they're able to continue to purchase them on the market,\" explained Kurcab, a lawyer who advises clients on issues related to the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Iran, which has endured decades of sanctions, is particularly skilled at evading them, Kurcab said. Throughout the war, Moscow has worked closely with Iran, as well as North Korea, another heavily sanctioned pariah state with ample practice acquiring components it isn't permitted to possess. As long as a country is willing to pay a higher price, there are people who can move goods through the global network, shifting them around in a shell game. \"No one knows where they're going,\" Kurcab said. In some cases, parts might already be on the market before sanctions or export controls are imposed. A party complying with US sanctions might have already sold a product to an intermediary before they took effect. From there, it's very difficult to track the end destination. A 2022 joint investigation by Reuters, iStories, and the Royal United Services Institute found Russia was building Orlan surveillance drones \u2014 used to direct artillery fire \u2014 with components it should not have had access to under export restrictions. A firm owned by a dual US-Russian citizen had illegally sold circuit boards made by a California manufacturer that said it was \"very concerned\" to learn its products ended up in Russia. That was just one case in many. A spokesperson for Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs told Business Insider that \"Russian procurement networks use multiple intermediaries, shell companies, and complex logistic chains to disguise their activities.\" Western countries are taking steps to further isolate Russia, including guiding businesses on how to comply with restrictions, inspecting goods at the border, responding when Ukraine reports finding specific components, attempting to close loopholes that Russia is exploiting, and threatening criminal prosecution for those who violate the rules. However, even with tougher enforcement, Moscow continues to seek out gaps it can exploit. It's a cat-and-mouse game, a spokesperson in the Netherlands' foreign affairs ministry said. \"As we take new measures, Russia will try new routes to circumvent them. \"Fully stopping the flow of sanctioned technology is impossible due to the scale and complexity of global trade in these components, the persistent problem of circumvention via third countries, and the increased production of counterfeit versions of sanctioned components,\" they explained.  \"Nevertheless, the measures we take significantly raise the costs for Russia to continue its war of aggression.\" Ukraine's partners say they're constantly updating sanctions and enforcement protocols to close loopholes, working closely with Kyiv to block any goods found in Russian weapons. A British government spokesperson said that the UK takes this \"incredibly seriously\" and bans the export of \"every battlefield item Ukraine has brought to our attention.\" It said this response will continue to be the case. There is a growing effort to clamp down on illegal sales, Western officials told Business Insider. Many European countries are further tightening enforcement to prevent sanctioned goods from reaching Russia. Germany said firms have \"significantly increased their compliance efforts\" to spot and reject suspicious orders, while the Czech Republic said it has introduced a new \"catch-all\" mechanism allowing authorities to block sensitive items that might be rerouted to Russia through third countries. The UK, which has sanctioned over $26 billion in trade with Russia, is targeting that loophole as well. Switzerland said that its export and sanctions authorities are working with Ukraine and other nations \"to prevent the procurement of electronic components, uncover existing procurement networks, and dismantle them.\" Officials said that components that have been linked to Swiss companies are often made abroad and are counterfeit, but investigations are underway to trace how genuine parts have reached Russia so those channels can be shut down. As the Netherlands indicated, sanctions aren't completely ineffective. The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office estimated that as of February, international sanctions had deprived Russia of at least $450 billion in war funds, and the government estimates that Russia pays up to six times more for dual-use items compared to the global price, further straining an already taxed economy. At the end of the day, though, sanctions and export controls only go so far, and their effectiveness is ultimately determined by the international community. \"The sanctions and export control tools are really only as strong as the rest of the world is willing to treat them,\" Kurcab said. \"It is a soft power tool, and it has its limits.\"                  Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

Not even multi-hundred-dollar fee hikes have stifled the consumer appetite for elite credit cards. American Express executives said that early demand for its revamped Platinum card beat their expectations on Friday's third-quarter earnings call. \"New Platinum account acquisitions are running at twice the level before the refresh,\" CEO Stephen Squeri said on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Friday. So far, he said it's the \"strongest start\" the company has seen for a US Platinum refresh (this is the third in the last decade). Amex unveiled its new Platinum card in September, which has an annual fee of $895. Squeri said that retention rates for existing cardholders \"have been stable post refresh,\" adding that the $200 price hike won't go into effect for them for a few months. As the luxury credit card wars have heated up \u2014 Chase upped its Sapphire Reserve fee and Citi introduced its Strata Elite card this summer \u2014 some have grumbled over the ever-climbing fees. According to JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum, however, they're not having any trouble convincing people to pay the now $795 fee for its refreshed card. \"This has already been the best year ever for new account acquisitions for our Sapphire portfolio,\" he said on Chase's third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. For Amex, the Platinum perks \"appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers,\" Squeri said on Friday. He added that they seem to especially appreciate the wellness and entertainment bonuses. Young cardholders have become a key Amex customer in recent years. In the first quarter of last year, the company said millennials and Gen Zers made up 75% of its new platinum and gold accounts. Squeri also said in an interview last year that the company used to target millennials and Gen Zers with no-fee cards, but has since tried to woo them with fancier and more expensive ones. This quarter, millennial and Gen Z consumers across Amex cards tended to complete about 25% more transactions than older cohorts, CFO Christophe Le Caillec said on Friday's call. Amex reported $421 billion in billed business \u2014 the value of transactions on Amex products \u2014 during the third quarter.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"That's $1,000 in value, compared to buying the phone new.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Every now and again, cell carriers will launch a free phone deal in exchange for starting a new line. For example, right now Verizon is offering the Google Pixel 10 Pro for free with select plans and the purchase of a new line, and it doesn't even require a trade-in. Both the Pixel 10 Pro and the larger Pixel 10 Pro XL are some of our favorite phones on the market, with the former boasting a 6.3-inch OLED screen, Qi2 magnet implementation, and a powerful CPU that makes it a performance beast. Plus, it's well-liked for its battery life, Google Gemini AI features, and a great set of cameras that are perfect for parents, photography and videography enthusiasts, or just casual users who want crisp, clear images and videos. If you like a smaller form factor and you were already considering going with a Pixel phone, this might be a good opportunity to consider picking the 10 Pro up. Google Pixel 10 Pro (128GB): $999.99 free with select plan and new line One of Verizon's latest free phone deals is for the powerful Google Pixel 10 Pro, a relatively compact performance monster that usually retails for $1,000. The deal is available for select phone plans when buyers start a new line, and there's no trade-in required, which we love. \u2705Recommended if: you're looking for a carrier discount on a phone that doesn't compromise on overall performance; you've liked other Pixel devices in the past and were considering staying in that lane; you want a phone with great battery life, a small display, and Pixelsnap Qi2 integration. \u274cSkip this deal if: you'd prefer to upgrade to the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, which is our top pick in the best phone for parents category, and you have the budget to do so; you have sensitive eyes and need a phone with industry-leading PWM rates; you don't want to start a new Verizon line or aren't eligible for the selected plans. The Google Pixel 10 Pro is a solid smartphone, featuring a bright, vibrant 6.3-inch Super Actua OLED display that can reach 3300 nits of brightness and has a 120Hz refresh rate. It also comes with powerful cameras, including an ultrawide lens with macro focus, the highly useful 15W Pixelsnap Qi2 charging integration, and seven years of OS updates. The Pixel 10 Pro is backed by the Google Tensor G5 processor, which is largely responsible for the device's smooth performance. It also sports 16GB of RAM and 30W wired charging. This particular deal is for the base-level 128GB version of the 10 Pro, though most casual users (or those with cloud storage) can make that work. All in all, if you're already a Verizon customer or were thinking about switching, this is a great way to score a free Google Pixel phone, though you'll want to act while supplies last.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"A secondary OLED on the back, U.S. availability, and a pricepoint under $200 is pretty ludicrous.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you've never heard of the Nuu brand, don't feel bad. The Dallas, Texas-based company usually puts out unassuming phones at rock bottom prices, specializing in a market that's rather underserved here in the United States. But this time around, Nuu is shaking things up and delivering something truly... new (get it?)... for this price segment. The Nuu B40 5G is a $299 phone with dual AMOLED displays. The 120Hz 6.7-inch display up front does what you expect and looks good doing it, but it's the 1.6-inch \"Vista Display\" on the back that holds the real parlor trick of this phone. It sports a passing resemblance to the new Xiaomi 17, but at a significantly lower price and with an official Amazon listing coming later in November. For now, you can sign up for the early access promotion at Nuumobile.com and get $100 off in celebration of the launch until November 3. Yeah, that means this thing is just $199 if you buy it now. Here's what to expect.      The Nuu B40 5G's design looks like most phones that came out of the Galaxy S8 era. It's got curved glass on the front and a curved plastic back that tucks into the plastic frame. The company did a good job making the back feel more like glass than anything, and the sides feel like a sort of matte aluminum that appears more premium than it might actually be. The star of the show is the new 1.6-inch display placed inside the camera island around the back, flanking the dual 64MP camera sensors. You can activate the display by double-tapping it and swiping through the available cards to perform actions. In total, there's a \"homescreen\" of sorts that includes 10 different designs, all of which feature a digital or analog clock. Some designs also include a pedometer, the day and date, or a battery percentage indicator.      Notifications come straight through here and provide smartwatch-like glanceable information that you can easily see if you like to keep your phone face down on a table. Swiping through the stack of cards shows a compass, music player, and camera. There don't appear to be any additional options here, which is a little disappointing, but Nuu may add more in a future update. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The camera feature allows you to easily use the main rear camera as a selfie camera, giving you access to better camera hardware than the front-facing one. By the way, that secondary rear camera is a pretty useless 2MP macro camera. Nuu doesn't give a way to switch to it using the smaller Vista Display, which is fine by me. Meanwhile, the primary camera is easy to see even on the tiny display, making it a good way to capture group photos with slightly improved quality. As for Nuu's software, it's about as unassuming as you could get, featuring a very AOSP-like build of Android 15 with a select few features added on top. Everything you would expect from a \"pure\" version of Android is here, and there aren't even any preinstalled bloat apps to speak of; just the Nuu app that gives you access to Nuu's customer support team and warranty info, should you need it. Category Nuu B40 5G Primary display 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED, FHD+ (1080 x 2400), 394 PPI Secondary display 1.6-inch AMOLED OS Android 15 with Android Enterprise support Processor MediaTek Dimensity 7025 GPU PowerVR BXM-8-256 RAM 8GB Storage 256GB Battery 5000mAh Charging 33W wired Main rear camera 64MP Secondary rear camera 2MP macro Selfie camera 16MP Connectivity 5G (U.S. compatibility), Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.2, GPS, Dual physical SIM Dimensions 162.4 x 73.9 x 8.4mm The experience is impressively snappy, given the surprising price tag of the phone. Games like Minecraft run just fine, and actually look quite good thanks to the 394 PPI resolution density of the display. Geekbench 6 scores of 959 single-core and 2304 multi-core put it about on par with the Samsung Galaxy A54, which sells for around $250 these days. That 6.7-inch AMOLED display uses DC dimming above 30% brightness and 720Hz PWM dimming below that. Most of the company's other AMOLED-equipped phones use a 1920Hz PWM rate, so seeing 720Hz is disappointing, but the display is far more eye-friendly than any Samsung Galaxy phone on the market, at least.      At $299, I'm not sure there's enough truly good added functionality brought on by the rear display to merit buying it over a comparable Samsung Galaxy phone, especially with the likelihood that this phone will only get one major Android update (to Android 16). But at $199, this phone's a steal, and I'd easily recommend grabbing at least one as a good backup phone or a great first phone for your kids.       Something Nuu Get what you need for less with the NUU B40 5G, an impressively affordable phone with dual AMOLED displays, a 64MP camera, an in-display fingerprint sensor, and more.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"When Apple first released the iPhone Air last month, it was missing from a key market: China. This was because the iPhone Air is eSIM-only due to its ultra-thin design, and China has strict regulations about eSIM technology. Today, however, the iPhone Air officially went up for pre-order in China \u2014 and indications are it\u2019s a big hit. According to a report from the South China Morning Post, the iPhone Air \u201csold out within minutes of its launch in China\u201d earlier today. The report explains that \u201cminutes after\u201d pre-orders began on Friday morning, the iPhone Air was sold out \u201cat all bricks-and-mortar stores in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in cities like Tianjin.\u201d Online shipping estimates for the iPhone Air in China have also shipped to November in many configurations. Historically, iPhone sales have boomed in China when Apple introduces a dramatic new design \u2026 and that\u2019s exactly what the iPhone Air is.  Apple CEO Tim Cook has been in China for the last week, visiting with Apple shoppers, developers, employees, and more. He was even gifted a custom-made Labubu doll. Cook also met with government officials in China, where he reportedly pledged to continue investing in China. That promise, of course, comes as Apple has also worked to diversify its manufacturing outside of China due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in the United States. Apple this week also unveiled a\u00a0new environmental initiative\u00a0with Tsinghua University in China this week. According to a report from The Elec today, Japanese firm Mizuho Securities cut its iPhone Air production forecast by 1 million units before the end of the year. So far, this hasn\u2019t been corroborated by other sources.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (AVGO)\u2019s stock didn\u2019t merely rise - it soared over 100%, driven by more than just impressive figures. A nearly 10% increase in revenue and a remarkable 71% rise in net margin suggested enhanced efficiency, but the true excitement lay just beneath the surface. Investors are rallying around the company\u2019s ambitious advancements in artificial intelligence, selling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) \u2014 custom chips that big tech companies use to run AI workloads efficiently, besides supplying high-speed networking solutions. Buoyed by stronger-than-expected Q2 results and a wave of upward analyst revisions, Broadcom\u2019s latest surge reflects not just growth, but a strategic evolution \u2014 making its stock\u2019s rise a story worth watching. So what is going on here? The stock price surged an impressive 108%, fueled by a mix of significant factors. Revenue saw a modest increase of 9.9%, and the net margin experienced a notable rise of 71%, indicating enhanced profitability. In the meantime, the valuation, reflected by the P\/E multiple, grew by 11%, pointing to increasing investor confidence. Collectively, these elements illustrate the reasons behind the price movement - creating the opportunity to examine the specific events, announcements, and strategic actions that contributed to this strong performance. Before delving into the events that contributed to the stock increase, here\u2019s what market wisdom suggests: investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a more diversified approach, exemplified by the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you purchase one stock you prefer or develop a portfolio designed to thrive across market cycles? Our data reveal that the High Quality Portfolio has turned the uncertainty of stock selection into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is incorporated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner \u2013 whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced losses of more than 40%.

Explore the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to understand what shapes our current viewpoint. Risk: Nevertheless, AVGO is not exempt from significant declines. It dropped nearly 48% during the Covid pandemic, around 35% during the inflation shock in 2021, and about 27% during the 2018 market correction. Even with strong fundamentals, it's evident that the stock can experience a sharp decline when the market shifts. Good companies still feel the impact when sentiment changes drastically. Consistently picking winners is a challenging endeavor \u2013 particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has shown a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year period. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother investment journey, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In the last decade, Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) stock has returned $44 billion to its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Despite facing headwinds in 2025, the industrial conglomerate has shown resilience with the stock delivering -6.20% year-to-date returns, reflecting broader industrial sector challenges while maintaining its position as a defensive dividend play amid market uncertainty.  Honeywell's unwavering commitment to shareholders reached a new milestone in September 2025 when the board approved a 5% dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share from $1.13, bringing the annual dividend to $4.76 and marking the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases since 2010.  The aerospace and industrial technology leader continued its disciplined capital allocation approach with robust share repurchases, executing $1.646 billion in buybacks during Q2 2025 alone, while total dividend payments reached $1.48 billion in the first half of the year, demonstrating management's commitment to returning cash despite transformation initiatives.  Honeywell's operational strength was evident in its Q2 2025 performance, delivering earnings per share of $2.75 that beat estimates of $2.64 by 4.17%, with revenue guidance maintained as the company prepares for its planned separation into three independent companies focused on aerospace, automation, and energy solutions. Let's look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like HON, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark\u2014a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see \u2013 S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? As it turns out, HON stock has returned the 64th highest amount to shareholders in history. Why should you care? Because dividends and share repurchases represent direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also signal management\u2019s confidence in the company's financial health and ability to generate sustainable cash flows. And there are more stocks like that. Here is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. For full ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you notice here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a % of the current market cap appears inversely proportional to growth prospects for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are growing much faster, in a more predictable way, compared to the others, but they have returned a much lower fraction of their market cap to shareholders. That's the flip side to high capital returns. Sure, they are attractive, but you have to ask yourself the question: Am I sacrificing growth and sound fundamentals? With that in mind, let's look at some numbers for HON. (see Buy or Sell Honeywell International Stock for more details) That's a good overview, but evaluating a stock from an investment perspective involves much more. That is exactly what Trefis High Quality Portfolio does. It is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. That said, Honeywell isn\u2019t immune to big pullbacks. It fell about 64% in the Dot-Com crash and 62% during the Global Financial Crisis. The Covid sell-off cut it by around 43%, while the Inflation Shock and 2018 correction saw dips of roughly 27% and 22% respectively. Even solid companies like HON face sharp drops when markets turn. Quality matters, but steep declines can still happen. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, and outlook changes. Read HON Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GitLab (NASDAQ: GTLB), a firm that offers tools to assist teams in managing their software development lifecycle, experienced a stock increase of 10.6% yesterday following reports that Datadog is contemplating a takeover bid of $60 per share. Nonetheless, aside from this acquisition speculation, we find GTLB stock currently unappealing at its price of approximately $48, mainly due to its elevated valuation compared to its fundamentals. Our conclusion is derived from an evaluation of GTLB\u2019s current and historical operating performance and financial health. Specifically, our analysis across essential parameters\u2014including Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience\u2014suggests that the company holds a Moderate overall operating and financial condition. That said, if you are looking for an upside with less volatility than investing in an individual stock like GTLB, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark\u2014a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has realized returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided superior returns with lower risk in comparison to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In terms of what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, GTLB stock appears very costly in comparison to the broader market. GitLab\u2019s Revenues have significantly increased in the past few years. GitLab\u2019s profit margins are significantly inferior to most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. GitLab\u2019s balance sheet appears very robust. GTLB stock has performed considerably worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the effect of a market crash on GTLB stock? Our dashboard Now Is Not The Time To Buy GitLab Stock includes a thorough analysis of how the stock fared during and following past market crashes. In summary, GitLab\u2019s performance against the parameters outlined above is as follows: \u2022 Growth: Very Strong\u2022 Profitability: Very Weak\u2022 Financial Stability: Very Strong\u2022 Downturn Resilience: Very Weak\u2022 Overall: Moderate However, keeping in mind its high valuation, we believe that the stock is unattractive, which bolsters our assertion that GTLB is not a favorable stock to acquire at the current prices. Of course, it is possible we could be incorrect in our evaluation, and if there is indeed an offer from Datadog at a premium to the current prices, the stock will likely trend upwards. That said, investors should consider all the associated risks, considering that the stock does not appear appealing from a fundamental viewpoint. While it may be prudent to steer clear of GTLB stock for the time being, you might want to investigate the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver impressive returns for investors.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Every week it seems US financial markets are hit by another bout of fear.  The latest worries spread this week from the banking sector in the US, after two regional lenders warned they would be hit by losses from alleged fraud.  But before that, markets swooned over signs of rekindled US-China tensions, as the two superpowers face off over tariffs, advanced technology and access to rare earths. The bankruptcies of car parts supplier First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor acted as a trigger for nervous chatter in September.     Over the last month, US shares, which had been climbing since their tariff-induced rout in April, have flattened. But in many ways the market swings so far - down roughly 3% at the steepest - are not unusual.  Zooming out, the major indexes have still posted gains since the start of the year, with the S&P 500 up roughly 13%. That's smaller than 2024 but still solid.  \"The market has done surprisingly well so far this year ... driven by an improvement in corporate profits and the enthusiasm surrounding AI,\" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.   The resilience of the stock market is, ironically, exactly what is driving some of the jitters. Put simply, when set against other standard metrics like profits, share prices in the US are very high.  Meanwhile, concerns about a possible bubble emerging in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry have generated a steady undercurrent of talk since the start of the year - discussions that have ramped up as analysts struggle to see how the vast sums of money the biggest players are throwing at one another all fit together. The Bank of England warned recently of \"stretched valuations\" and rising risk of a \"sharp market correction\".  Those concerns were echoed in remarks from JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon and to some extent US central bank chair Jerome Powell. The International Monetary Fund was the latest to chime in this week. \"Markets appear complacent as the ground shifts,\" it said in its financial stability report, which noted risks from trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty and rising sovereign indebtedness. James Reilley, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said the market falls triggered by the regional banks were a sign of investors alert to risk and moving quickly to reduce exposure amid uncertainty about whether the losses were indicative of wider issues. But he said the brief nature of the drops showed how quickly such worries could clear. Many investors remain optimistic, with analysts at firms such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in recent weeks boosting their forecasts for where the S&P 500 might climb by the end of the year.  David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said he thought a sharp sell-off was unlikely at a time when growth in the US remains solid and the US central bank is lowering borrowing costs.  He is expecting the S&P 500 to end the year hovering around 6,900 points, about 4% higher than where it sits on Friday. While he acknowledged the troubles popping up at banks, he noted that the lenders involved have alleged fraud.  He said the overall picture, when looking at default levels, appears healthy, and he saw little risk that demand for AI would suddenly decline, puncturing valuations.  \"I'm not saying we're in a bubble. I'm not saying we're not in a bubble. The question is what's going to drive the downside,\" he said. \"Things don't usually spontaneously decline.\"  A typical bull market - when shares are rising - lasts about four and a half years, said Mr Stovall.  With inflation still sticky, and investors wary of events in Washington, like the government shutdown and Trump administration's efforts to influence the US central bank, this year's market rally has been \"unloved\", said Mr Stovall. On the other hand, he noted: \"It's just a matter of time. Corrections and bear markets have not been repealed. They might simply be delayed.\" Problems at two US regional banks have made investors nervous and triggered a sell-off in shares.  The intervention has not stopped Sora users generating and sharing fake clips of other historical figures. The streaming service says it will respect artists' rights in creating new \"responsible\" AI products. Smaller Indian towns are becoming centres for training and correcting artificial intelligence models.  The volume of tap water used by Scotland's data centres has quadrupled since 2021, figures show.

Dear Tim Cook, I understand why Apple discontinued the iPod in 2022. The way most people listen to music has changed since the iPod reshuffled the music industry in 2001. I get it, I do. And yet. I need you to consider this request. Please bring back the iPod! Even if a new iPod might not generate the same sales it did a decade ago, there is still a hardcore demographic out there, absolutely desperate for the iPod: parents. Trust me. In any parenting Facebook group \u2014 or, really, across all social media \u2014 the desire for an old-school iPod keeps coming up. \"I want something like an iPod-type thing,\" one parent pleaded on Facebook recently. \"No internet access, no messaging, nothing \u2026 just a way for him to listen to music of his choice while on the bus to school. I'm kinda coming up short with my search.\" Many parents are worried about the potential harm that can come from using social media \u2014 and phones \u2014 and are choosing to restrict their kids' and teens' access to screens or hold off on giving them a phone. But how can we give our kids access to music without giving them access to an entire phone's worth of apps, or a phone at all? (That's where you come in, Tim.) Unfortunately, most adults aren't active CD or record buyers, and we listen to music through streaming services like Spotify (and Apple Music, of course). This leaves music-loving kids in the lurch: How can they listen to their favorite tunes? We can all agree that it's character-building and healthy for a middle schooler to start developing their own musical tastes and listen to music of their own choice. And as much as we parents might wax nostalgic for the days of downloading viruses from Kazaa onto the family computer, or taping songs off the radio onto a cassette tape, we don't actually want to send our kids back into the Dark Ages. We just want a music player that doesn't also have Snapchat. Parents seem to have come up with a variety of solutions that seem to vary in success. Here's some of what I've heard parents are using: Although these are all interesting options, there doesn't seem to be one single solution for everyone. Older kids and teens might find the Yoto too babyish to bring on the bus, for example. Some of the MP3 players out there have poor Amazon reviews for crummy software or low battery life. Like this one: \"I'm trying to find an easy-to-use MP3 player for my 8-year-old. I bought a non-brand one off Amazon, and it's awful. The music can't be organized; it's just one big playlist,\" a parent wrote in a Facebook group. Basically, I want an original iPod from 2005, lol.\" There seems to be a gap in the market for a product with an elegant design, top-notch firmware, and baked-in compatibility with a large, familiar music library. A small, white, clickwheel-sized gap, perhaps. You know \u2026 like something Apple might make? The company didn't respond to my question about whether it would bring back the iPod or forward my request to Mr. Cook, so I have no choice but to ask him, right here: Tim, you have the power. Make us happy again. Give us the iPod!                       Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

Women's health startup Tia has slashed about 23% of its staff, Business Insider has learned. The company, which provides in-person and virtual care tailored to women, cut 27% of its corporate team, or 17 people; 22% of its providers, or 27 people; and 23% of its field support team, or 28 people, according to an email to employees sent Monday evening by Tia CEO Felicity Yost. Tia's layoffs show how even buzzy, well-funded startups are being forced to reckon with healthcare's economic pressures against venture capital's growth expectations. Once a rising star backed by Melinda French Gates, Tia is now under pressure to prove that its hybrid model of tech-enabled women's clinics can actually turn a profit. The demise of similar healthcare startups like former Silicon Valley darling Forward has shown how hard tech-enabled healthcare can be to scale; even Amazon owned-health clinic company One Medical has struggled with profitability. Tia confirmed the layoffs in a statement to Business Insider. Tia operates as a one-stop healthcare shop for women, providing services from gynecology and primary care to mental healthcare, with options for in-person and virtual care. The startup runs 11 clinics, according to its website, including six locations in Los Angeles, two in New York City, one in San Francisco, and two in Arizona. Yost told employees in her email that the layoffs were a response to feedback Tia received in a recent fundraise. Yost said Tia sought that funding after its business's underperformance meant Tia would not be able to reach profitability without more cash. The feedback from the fundraise \"required us to rethink our business in the current economic and policy climate, which is one that prizes cost and profit-consciousness,\" Yost said in her email. \"We must manage towards a faster timeline to be corporate-level profitable than we previously contemplated.\" \"Tia has seen strong growth, particularly in membership, which has outpaced our expectations for 2025. At the same time, we're facing ongoing structural challenges impacting the broader care delivery sector, such as cost pressures from rising labor rates and tighter reimbursement rates, which require us to be more disciplined in our operations,\" a Tia spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. In-person clinics have proven difficult to sustain financially, even for well-funded healthcare companies. Forward shut down abruptly in November 2024 after raising over $650 million to scale its tech-driven clinics and automated \"CarePods.\" Primary care chain VillageMD has begun selling its clinics after spinning off from Walgreens in the retailer's sale to Sycamore Partners in August; Walgreens had announced plans to close 160 VillageMD clinics in April 2024 to curb losses. Walmart shuttered all 51 of its health centers later in April, citing a lack of profitability. While Tia hasn't announced a round of funding since its $100 million Series B in 2021, Yost's email to employees references Tia's \"Series C growth plan.\" Tia didn't respond to a question from Business Insider about its Series C. The startup also raised an undisclosed amount of Series B extension funding from Melinda French Gates' Pivotal Ventures in 2023, which Tia said brought its total funding to $150 million. \"Across healthcare, we're seeing organizations respond to market trends that favor operational efficiency, sustainable growth, and sharper financial discipline. Tia is doing the same, and from a position of strength,\" the Tia spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that Tia has more health system partnerships and expansion announcements planned for early next year. Yost said in her email to employees that the fires in Los Angeles in early January had challenged Tia's business in the first quarter. She also cited \"slower than necessary growth that hampered our business.\" Tia introduced new projects in the second quarter, \"meant to counteract the dip in Q1 performance,\" Yost wrote. Those initiatives included a new model to allow patients to get care from Tia without becoming a member, a partnership for Tia members to access compounded GLP-1 prescriptions, and a national rollout of Tia's virtual care services. While the new no-membership-required model outperformed expectations, Yost said, underperformance across the rest of the business led Tia to seek additional funding because \"we would not achieve profitability with our existing cash runway, as planned.\" Yost said Tia did ultimately secure additional funding, but received feedback in the process that led to the layoffs. Yost and Witte started Tia in 2016, focusing on in-person clinics. The startup began rolling out virtual care services in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later shifted to a hybrid model. Tia's last reported layoff occurred in July 2022, as Business Insider reported the following November. Tia cofounder and then-CEO Carolyn Witte told BI that the layoffs were a preemptive response to the market downturn so Tia could continue to grow responsibly. Witte stepped down as Tia's CEO in April 2024 and into the role of Tia's chairwoman. Witte said a LinkedIn post about her departure from the role that Yost, formerly Tia's president, would serve as Tia's interim CEO. A Tia spokesperson told Business Insider after publication that Witte had stepped down as board chair shortly after departing the CEO position. Yost is now Tia's permanent CEO. In addition to the layoffs, Yost said in her Monday email that Tia would make significant changes to its operating expenses, including to its tools and contracts, and cut compensation for its senior leaders. Yost also said that Tia could no longer afford to hire clinical roles ahead of demand and \"must creatively rethink how we optimize our administrative and care support roles across a broader range of responsibilities.\" She said the startup aims to make these changes without compromising its high-quality patient care standards. Employees affected by the Tuesday layoffs, including patient-facing providers, were cut off from Tia's systems immediately following the email.

Figma CEO Dylan Field, at least, doesn't think AI is coming for anyone's job. \"I think it's pretty encouraging that folks understand, viscerally, that this is not coming for you,\" he said Thursday on Lenny's podcast. He pointed to a survey Figma published in September that surveyed 1,199 participants, including designers, product managers, developers, researchers, data specialists, and marketers. Almost 60% of product builders said they spend more time on high-value work as a result of AI. Almost 70% said they're \"more productive or efficient overall.\" Instead of worrying, Field said workers should focus on how they'll adapt as AI tools and models advance. The San Francisco-based tech company builds tools for designing websites, apps, and other digital products. Field co-founded Figma in 2012 with his Brown University classmate, Evan Wallace. The company went public in July in a blockbuster IPO. It now has a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion. Figma has more than 1,600 employees, and Field said the company is only adding roles. While it's exploring how AI can improve efficiency and cut costs, Field said he's more interested in conversations about how the technology can unlock new opportunities for growth. \"You can see it as a path for you to learn and grow, and explore the world and human consciousness,\" he said. It's not the first time Field has said that AI is meant to augment human work, not replace it. \"There's a need for designers to lead the charge, and AI will only get you so far,\" he said on the Rapid Response podcast earlier this month. \"But the drudgery, how do we remove that from the design process? How do we give more access to more people?\"                  Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Previously, I wrote about the SwitchBot K11+, a smaller robot vacuum that was a great option for smaller spaces. This week, I am looking at the new SwitchBot S20, and this one is built for much bigger homes. After using it for the past few months, I believe it may be the best robo vacuum on the market, with some nice workarounds for rooms in Apple\u2019s Home app.  \t\t\t\t\tAbode is the best home security system and includes compatibility with HomeKit.\t\t\t\t HomeKit Weekly is a series focused on smart home accessories, automation tips and tricks, and everything to do with Apple\u2019s smart home framework. The SwitchBot S20 is designed to handle bigger houses and more demanding cleaning jobs compared to smaller models. It combines powerful suction, advanced mopping, and full smart home integration in a single unit. I mainly use the SwitchBot S20 to vacuum our primary main levelliving areas, which are also the dirtiest spaces in the house. I set up the rooms in the SwitchBot app, and those names showed up in HomeKit. They are not true HomeKit rooms, but I suspect that is a Matter limitation. Still, I really like SwitchBot\u2019s workaround because it lets me trigger room-specific cleanups right from the Home app. I would love to see this tied directly to HomeKit rooms in the future, but the way it works today is still really useful. Most evenings after dinner, I run a cleanup cycle in the dining room and kitchen. It is quick and easy from the Home app. As I have mentioned before, I only mop our hardwood floors with a specific product, so I do not use the built-in mopping features, but the vacuum alone has been a huge time saver. Truthfully, though, since installing this unit, I have not used it as a traditional vacuum whatsoever. I am amazed at how much debris and dust it picks up on a daily basis. At some point, I have wondered if it\u2019s creating its own dust because it continues to pick up so much day to day.  \t\t\t\t\tUpgrade your home security with wireless cameras that includes HomeKit compatibility.\t\t\t\t Like the SwitchBot K11+, the Matter part of SwitchBot S20 is set up in the SwitchBot app. Once connected, you\u2019ll go to the vacuum settings and look for the Matter setup option.The app will walk you through the steps and generate a Matter code. From there, open the Home app, tap to add a new accessory, and use the \u201cMore option\u201d link. You should see the vacuum icon listed on the next screen. Tap it, paste in the Matter code, and the S20 will show up in HomeKit. Once it\u2019s added, you can assign it to a room and give it a name. At that point, you\u2019re ready to start automating cleanups and adding it to scenes just like any other HomeKit accessory. As I mentioned earlier, if you will \u201cname\u201d your rooms in the SwitchBot app that are generated from the mapping, they\u2019ll be available to work with inside of HomeKit, but again, not as HomeKit rooms. Yes, I know that sounds super confusing, but once you\u2019re going through the process, it\u2019ll make sense.  The photo above is what it looks like when you don\u2019t name your rooms in the SwitchBot app. The SwitchBot S20, right now, has become my top pick for overall value in a Matter and HomeKit-enabled robot vacuum. Getting the SwitchBot room names into the Home app is a clever workaround, and the suction power is outstanding. I\u2019ve also been impressed with the LIDAR mapping. It managed to get stuck in a couple of spots during the first few runs, but over time, it adapted and now completes a full cycle without me needing to intervene. It is powerful, smart, and reliable, which makes it an easy recommendation for anyone wanting a robot vacuum that works great with HomeKit.  You can buy it from Amazon or directly from SwitchBot.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GOOGL stock soared 36% in three months, propelled not just by steady revenue gains and a modest bump in profit margins, but by a striking surge in investor optimism that pushed its valuation multiple up 30%. See \u2013 Google\u2019s Unloved Stock Finally Gets Its Due \u2013 for more details.  Behind this leap lies more than numbers: a strong Q2 earnings beat, a leadership position in AI innovation, and expanding cloud margins have all captured market attention. Add in the tailwind from a favorable antitrust ruling and rising analyst enthusiasm, and it\u2019s clear why investors are rallying. Let\u2019s explore the moves driving this momentum. So what is happening here? The stock price increased by a robust 36%, driven by a mix of underlying factors. Revenue climbed 3.2%, showing steady business growth, while net margin inched up by 0.8%, reflecting slight improvements in profitability. However, the standout contributor was the 30% surge in the P\/E multiple, highlighting boosted investor confidence and optimism. With these numbers setting the stage, let\u2019s dive into the key events and strategic moves that have fueled this performance. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GOOGL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark\u2014a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see \u2013 S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Opinion: We currently find GOOGL stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, GOOGL isn\u2019t immune to big drops. It fell 65% in the Global Financial Crisis, lost about 44% in the inflation shock, and saw pullbacks near 31% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the milder corrections, like 2018, led to a dip of around 23%. Strong fundamentals matter, but when volatility hits, even top stocks take a hit. Picking winners consistently is not an easy task \u2013 especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Samsung has quietly pulled the One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S24 series in South Korea, marking another twist in what\u2019s supposed to be the company\u2019s smooth Android 16 transition. The update, which initially rolled out to the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra in late September, was suddenly pulled from Samsung\u2019s servers and removed from both OTA and Smart Switch channels, SamMobile reports. As a result, users in Korea can no longer download or reinstall the software. What makes this even more interesting is that this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. A few days ago, Samsung also halted the same One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S22 lineup a week after its rollout. That earlier rollback hinted that something was off with Samsung\u2019s latest software build, and now, with the S24 series facing the same pause, it\u2019s clear the issue might run deeper than expected. According to reports on X, Samsung also pulled the firmware for the Galaxy S24 FE. Attention Galaxy S24 users \u2757\ufe0fSamsung has pulled One UI 8 build from the OTA server Korea \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83d\udc40S24 series:CYI9 (OneUI8) \u27a1\ufe0f BYG8 (OneUI7) S24Fe:CYI9 (OneUI8) \u27a1\ufe0f BYG2 (OneUI7)#Samsung #OneUI8 #GalaxyS24 #GalaxyS24fe pic.twitter.com\/H2csnVBbA9October 17, 2025      It is surprising that users who have already installed the update have not reported major bugs or widespread issues. That makes this sudden halt even more surprising, as it seems Samsung\u2019s decision was preemptive rather than reactive. The company might be dealing with a subtle underlying glitch or a problem that only appears under certain regional configurations or carrier settings. Interestingly, the suspension appears to affect only the Korean market for now. The One UI 8 update remains available in other regions, at least as of this writing, and it's unclear whether the rollback could expand to other regions. Still, the delay might hint that Samsung is rechecking its regional firmware builds before pushing them further. It\u2019s also worth noting that the One UI 8 rollout for the Galaxy S22 series in Korea still hasn\u2019t resumed. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android For now, S24 owners in Korea who already installed One UI 8 can continue using it without problems, but those who haven\u2019t yet updated are stuck waiting for Samsung\u2019s next move. The company hasn\u2019t made any public statement about the reason behind the halt, but given its recent pattern, it\u2019s likely working on a fixed or patched version of the firmware.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"EV Revolution Plummeting resale values are threatening to derail the world\u2019s transition to electric transportation. The resale value of electric vehicles is collapsing worldwide, hurting private owners and fleet operators. The crisis became especially apparent when BluSmart, India\u2019s pioneering all-electric ride-hailing service, collapsed in April amid financial fraud allegations. The Delhi-based company\u2019s fleet of thousands of cars, originally worth over $12,000 each, suddenly flooded the market at about $3,000. For Tesla owners in the U.S., their 2023 Model Ys are worth 42% less than what they paid two years ago, while a Ford F-150 truck bought the same year depreciated just 20%. Older EV models depreciate even faster than newer ones.\u00a0 The crisis exposes the fundamental problem that nobody really knows what electric cars are worth in the secondhand market, as their value is largely tied to batteries with uncertain lifespans. \u201cFor gas cars, there\u2019s a 100-year process behind them based on odometer and major maintenance schedules and the expected life of combustion engine parts,\u201d said Andrew Garberson, head of growth and research at Recurrent, a Seattle-based startup that evaluates the wear and tear on used EVs to bring transparency to the secondhand market. \u201cElectric cars have fewer moving parts, and a lot of the value of the car is tied up in one component \u2014 the battery.\u201d A U.K.-based study found 3-year-old EVs lost more than half of their value compared with 39% for gas cars. Another study conducted by Boucar Diouf, an EV researcher and professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, found EVs in the U.S. can lose as much as 60% of their value over three to five years, compared with less than half for traditional vehicles. For fleet owners and operators \u2014 across sectors from ride-hailing to rentals to logistics \u2014 pledging to go green, this value disaster is threatening to derail the sustainability movement. Florida-based car rental company Hertz, which bought 100,000 Teslas in 2021, reported a $2.9 billion loss in 2024, driven largely by plummeting EV value, according to its February 2025 earnings call. The company was hemorrhaging more than $530 a car monthly by late 2024, due to high upfront costs, steep insurance premiums, and long repair and restoration lead times, according to EV news publication InsideEVs. Hertz dumped 30,000 EVs \u2014 Teslas bought for more than $40,000 ended up on its website for resale at prices under $20,000. As of October 8, it listed a Model Y for $27,000. A new Model Y cost $45,000 in the U.S. until earlier this month, when Tesla launched a more affordable version at just under $40,000. \u201cFleets feel EV residual risk the most because they model total cost of ownership to the decimal and have to remarket thousands of units,\u201d Jack Carlson, CEO of Carvai.ai, an AI-powered vehicle research and shopping platform, told Rest of World. \u201cRetail buyers worry too, but mostly about battery health and charging. Fleets worry about the exit price.\u201d Ironically, Tesla still represents the best-case scenario, holding on to resale value better given its years of experience and brand-building. Chinese newcomers like BYD, Nio, and XPeng tend to have lower resale value in comparison, Mariusz Sawula, CEO of Poland-based autoDNA, a provider of vehicle history reports, told Rest of World. \u201cPremium brands consistently retain higher resale value than mass-market brands, for both ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles and EVs. No one knows what entirely new Chinese marques will cost in the secondary market \u2014 for instance, what a 5-year-old Omoda will fetch,\u201d Sawula said, comparing the likes of Tesla to a sub-brand of Chinese carmaker Chery. The depreciation crisis also varies by region. While Japanese and U.S. consumers remain skeptical, more EV-friendly markets support strong resale prices, according to Justin Fischer, an automotive expert at vehicle-trading company CarEdge. \u201cIn markets where consumers are open to the idea of going electric, like China, Norway, and Costa Rica, resale values are supported by this higher demand,\u201d Fischer told Rest of World.\u00a0 North America\u2019s vast highways and sprawling distances create a tough environment for used EVs, Karl Brauer, who has reviewed thousands of vehicles since the mid-1990s, told Rest of World. Europe, with its denser cities and shorter commutes, offers more stability in the used EV market compared to the U.S. or Canada. Distance is just one of several limitations, which also include climate sensitivity and charging downtime. \u201cWhile an electric vehicle is ideal for shorter trips in urban areas with moderate temperatures, they aren\u2019t as effective as traditional cars for long-distance travel or when the temperature is very high or very low,\u201d Brauer said. \u201cEven electric vehicles with larger batteries and longer ranges still require more time to replenish their energy compared to gasoline and hybrid vehicles.\u201d Consumer confidence is also buoyed by favourable policies and extensive public fast-charging networks.\u00a0 \u201cGreater demand and a more secure supply side helps stabilize resale values there, compared to what we see here in North America,\u201d Johnny T. Beckett, vice president of sales at Canadian multibrand electric car dealer EVNet, told Rest of World. Uber walked away from buying 5,000 used BluSmart vehicles, while local rivals like Evara Cabs wouldn\u2019t touch them because of battery and warranty concerns. BluSmart\u2019s fire-sales in the cities of New Delhi and Bengaluru showed exactly how fast EVs can become worthless. A family car drives modest distances yearly, but Indian fleet vehicles rack up three to four times their mileage, destroying resale value faster, according to Anirudh Damani, managing director at Artha Venture Fund, which backs Uber partner Everest Fleet in India. \u201cFor individual consumers, the resale value is an inconvenience; for fleet operators, it\u2019s an existential problem,\u201d Damani told Rest of World. \u201cTheir vehicles are financial assets, not lifestyle products. Without a predictable residual value, even a profitable fleet can become unviable once replacement cycles begin.\u201d Battery-as-a-service models are emerging as a potential lifeline as they give fleet operators the predictable costs and stable values they desperately need, offering a path forward where battery risk no longer threatens entire business models, Damani said. An April 2025 McKinsey report shows one in five Europeans and just one in 10 U.S. consumers are considering going electric. Fleet operators, though, are making massive bets globally, with companies such as Uber, Bolt, and Lyft pledging full electrification \u2014 despite vehicles potentially becoming worthless before the loans are even paid off. Data is helping people have confidence in used EV batteries. As confidence rises, so will resale prices.\u201d Battery tech is also proving more resilient than expected. Research from Recurrent shows batteries deteriorate just 1%\u20132% annually, with only 1% of cars built after 2016 needing replacements versus 13% for older EVs. Most of the recent replacements are also covered by warranties. \u201cThe data is helping people have confidence in used EV batteries,\u201d Garberson said. \u201cAs confidence rises, so will resale prices.\u201d On the back of these quantifiable indicators, there\u2019s been a rise in certified pre-owned EV programs and state-of-health reports that aid informed decision-making. It\u2019s now also easier to keep up with these cars. The pace of innovation that initially scared buyers has slowed, with manufacturers prioritizing longevity over rapid changes, according to EVNet\u2019s Beckett, who is also the co-founder of the Electric Vehicle Association of Atlantic Canada. According to Beckett, 2026 \u201cwill be a year of industry and market readjustments to both lower supply and demand.\u201d","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rambus (RMBS), a company which designs and licenses high-performance chips and intellectual property (IP) for data-intensive applications, has seen demand surge, driven by its leadership in memory interface chips, especially for AI data centers which are seeing a massive ramp up.  We think the stock remains an excellent choice to ride further upside. Why is that? Because it offers strong margins, a low-debt capital structure, reasonable valuation, and strong momentum. Here are some data points.   While revenue growth is beneficial, this selection primarily focuses on capitalizing on momentum coupled with quality \u2013 which we assess through margins (indicative of pricing power \/ strong business model) and capital structure (with manageable debt levels).

Reviews ethics statement      The internet seems split about the device's new name but here's what you actually need to know.    The home screen of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max If you're confused about Amazon's new name for its Fire TV Stick 4K Plus\u00a0streaming device, you're not alone. On Sept. 30, Amazon revealed its new Alexa Echo speakers, Blink and Ring cameras, Kindle e-readers and Fire TV televisions in a live event. Then on Oct. 16, the company changed the name of the Fire TV Stick 4K to\u00a0Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, which has brought mixed reactions.\u00a0 The internet has had a heyday with this new name change, but I think it's like movie theater popcorn -- there are typically four sizes (kids, small, medium and large) for customers to choose from, depending on how much popcorn they want. We live in a world where people like to personalize and customize their experiences, so it's sort of strange when there's pushback for small, minimal changes to a product or device.\u00a0 Amazon ultimately made the name change to accommodate its latest Fire TV Stick, the Select, which was unveiled at its most recent event. A post shared by CNET (@cnet) From the entry-level Fire TV Stick HD to the new Fire Stick 4K Select,\u00a0Fire Stick 4K Plus and 4K Max, Amazon's streaming devices offer similar functionality with a few slight differences and features for those willing to pay a little more. The Fire Stick you choose will depend on your preferences and budget.\u00a0 The base-level Amazon Fire TV Stick starts at $35 and, unlike the 4K versions, only provides video in 1080p. It offers 8GB of storage and 1GB of memory. It does not work with Alexa Plus nor does it support Xbox Game Pass. The newest Amazon Fire TV Stick sells for $40 and has almost the exact same feature set as the Fire TV Stick HD, with the obvious exception of supporting 4K Ultra HD video. The 4K Select also plans to add support for Xbox Game Pass and Alexa Plus soon.\u00a0 CNET streaming expert Ty Pendlebury says, \"The Select is an entry-level 4K stick. Like Roku, which just has too many products that are similar in price and specs.\" This recently renamed Amazon Fire TV Stick retails for $50 and includes support for live picture-in-picture viewing, Wi-Fi 6, Dolby Atmos audio, Xbox Game Pass and Alexa Plus, unlike the two cheaper models. The memory on the 4K Plus is also beefed up to 2GB. The top-of-the-line Amazon Fire TV Stick sells for $60. It includes all of the features of the 4K Plus and bumps up the available storage to 16GB, while adding support for Alexa Voice Remote Enhanced and Wi-Fi 6E. If you're on the market for a streaming device and want to choose from Amazon's Fire TV Stick collection, we have you covered. Our experts have thoroughly tested these sticks to provide you with the best insight you need to make an informed decision.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Ahead of the Hindu festival of Diwali, the jewellery market in Indian capital Delhi's vibrant Lajpat Nagar neighbourhood is teeming with crowds. Shops have stayed open even on holidays, and at dusk, dozens of cars line up the streets as a string of flashy signboards beckon shoppers into the flower-adorned stores. Soaring gold prices - which have topped $1,440 (\u00a31,081) for 10g - may have slightly dented demand for jewellery in the world's second largest market for the yellow metal this year, but Indians are not willing to entirely give up on their penchant for gold yet. Diwali, along with Dhanteras -  a smaller festival that falls on Saturday this year - are believed to be auspicious occasions to buy precious metal, with hundreds of thousands of Indians flocking the markets to buy gold and silver coins, bars and jewellery, which they believe bring wealth and luck. Skyrocketing prices have created FOMO - or the fear of missing out - in the minds of buyers, who are worried prices might rise even further, Prakash Pahlajani, who runs Kumar Jewels, a family-owned business, told the BBC on a busy evening at his shop. \"As a result, I have more customers this year,\" Mr Pahlajani said. But with prices - gold is up 60% and silver 70% - shooting through the roof, jewellers are having to change tack to counter stagnant customer budgets. \"People are not saying 'I don't want to buy'. Instead, they are saying, 'I'll buy a little less,\" said Tanishq Gupta, another jeweller down the road from Mr Pahlajani's shop.  He said he's had to be innovative and design pieces that look elaborate but have a reduced quantity of gold in them. A coin made of 250mg gold, which he sells for as low as $35, is now thinner but made to look as big as the heavier ones. Coins weighing a tenth of that, at 25mg, are also on offer in the market. Pushpinder Chauhan, another retailer in the area, said higher prices had also exacerbated the growing preference for lighter jewellery this year, \"especially among younger buyers\" who want pieces for everyday wear and not just special occasions. Several jewellers the BBC spoke to pointed to another clear trend - more customers were buying gold and silver for investment rather than jewellery this year, something that is also reflected in bullion market data. While gold jewellery continues to account for the largest share of India's overall gold demand, the proportion driven by investment - primarily bars and coins - has been rising steadily, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). \"Jewellery's share declined to 64% in the second quarter of this year, from 80% in the same period in 2023, while investment demand increased from 19% to 35% over the same period,\" Kavita Chacko, the council's research head, told the BBC. A lot of that demand is also being fed by investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or digital gold, where September marked record high inflows. ETF assets under management have surged by over 70% this year. Besides retail demand, gold prices are also being significantly influenced by India's central bank, with the metal's share in its foreign exchange reserves rising from 9% to 14% in 2025, according to WGC. In fact, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been \"a major pillar of global gold demand over the past three years\", said Kaynat Chainwala who tracks commodities at Kotak Securities, a broking house. She said the RBI has been stocking up on gold in a bid to diversify its foreign exchange holdings, reduce its dependence on the dollar and provide stability during geopolitical stress. Going forward, with the festive and the wedding season under way, retail demand for gold and silver is expected to continue to hold up despite record-high prices, say experts. \"The affluent classes will continue to buy, though it is a setback for lower income families,\" said Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at the state-run Bank of Baroda. \"Demand will hold up in value terms, even though volumes will fall.\" But some families have been totally priced out of the market.  \"I am now having to think a lot while buying - about whether to even get something,\" Bhavna, who's getting married in February, told the BBC outside Mr Pahlajani's jewellery store. For the moment, she's held off her purchases and is waiting for prices to fall a bit so that she can come back to finish her wedding shopping.  Such strong cultural affinity for physical gold, particularly jewellery, means the appetite for the noble metal is unlikely to be dented in the long term, despite the short-term moderation, say experts. This is especially true for a country where high gold holdings have given solid long-term returns, making many Indians affluent at a time when growth is stumbling and jobs are hard to come by. According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held a staggering $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's GDP. \"This implies a positive wealth effect on the household balance sheet, given the uptrend in gold prices,\" Economists Upasana Chachra and Bani Gambhir wrote in a recent note, adding that Indian families are also benefitting from \"cyclical factors of lower interest payments with monetary policy easing, and the positive impact on disposable income through direct and indirect tax cuts\". That's not a bad start to the festive season, even though record prices may have taken some glitter off the precious metal.    Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByRandy Watts, Contributor. As we have discussed previously, the current U.S. stock market rally that began in April has reached record strength. It has far exceeded the average rally leg of ~14% before a greater than 5% correction. In fact, the S&P 500 is now enjoying its fifth-largest rally without a 5% or greater correction in over 55 years. Below, we will take a closer look at the prior four legs that showed larger magnitude moves than the current up leg. Three were significantly longer, while the fourth was a sharp but brief up leg. Regarding sector performance during these long rallies, the last three (1994, 1998, 2016) all favored Technology, which is logical as the sector has increased its share of U.S. market capitalization as well as its returns and profitability. Overall,  other leadership sectors have varied depending on the specific up leg. When the market has pulled back after these long up legs, Technology has tended to be an average performer. Much like performance during the up legs, the worst sectors on the pullback have varied depending on the specific down leg. In conclusion, as we have discussed in other recent pieces, the current up leg appears overdue for a pullback of 5% or greater. It is possible that the current move has more to go, as evidenced by four greater up legs since 1970. However, the odds favor a pullback. Looking at prior occurrences, such pullbacks did not end the underlying bull market. Therefore, unless there is a major change in the overall economic outlook, a pullback should be bought. We would expect to favor Technology and certain Consumer and Financial industry groups when this occurs, while also noting that sectors like Health Care and Consumer Staple have extreme spreads versus the market and could revert in the near-term.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"iPhone Air preorders opened in China on Friday after Apple received regulatory approval to commercialize the ultra-thin handset in the region. The iPhone Air sold out within hours, South China Morning Post reports, which hasn't happened elsewhere. The iPhone Air is the only model in the 2025 series not to have sold out in the U.S. and other international markets at launch. The iPhone 17 Pro Max was the first handset to go out of stock on September 12th, and supply has been constrained ever since. The iPhone 17 Pro and standard iPhone 17 sold out over the first preorder weekend in the U.S. and international markets. Several reports have pointed out this year's new iPhones are selling better than the iPhone 16 series. High demand for the standard iPhone 17\u00a0is a notable development, as stock for the cheapest model is also constrained. An analysis from Mizuho Securities (via The Elec) this week also highlighted the stronger sale, adding that Apple will produce 94 million new iPhones this year, or 6 million more than the analysts' original projection. That said, it's unclear when Apple will catch up with demand. BGR has been tracking iPhone 17 and iPhone Air stock since launch, and the handsets have been consistently out of stock. Some markets in Europe saw improved shipping estimates in recent weeks, but our latest checks show the iPhone 17 Pro Max, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 remain hard to find online in multiple markets. Delivery estimates of up to 2-3 weeks are to be expected for some models. We've performed the same stock checks every Friday. We looked at all four iPhone models, and simulated ordering unlocked models with no trade-in discounts. We tested all possible storage and color combinations across markets in North America (U.S. and Canada), Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, and Ireland), and Asia (China and Japan) to gauge consumer interest. Below, you'll find shipping estimates for the four new iPhone models for those markets, as of Friday, October 16. As before, the estimates above aren't set in stone and your mileage might vary. Apple can always update stock for its regional online stores as it receives more units. Also, it's unclear how much stock Apple has in any given region for a specific iPhone 17 model. Separately, carriers and electronics retailers might have different estimates depending on their own contracts with Apple. Finally, if you live near an Apple retail store, you can always check to see whether the iPhone 17 model you're looking for is available, and whether they can offer better delivery estimates.","label":1}

What's the latest edge in quant finance, which relies on math whizzes to drive computer-driven funds? Humans. In an ironic twist, the people behind quant funds are using some of the same language human-run stockpickers and investors have used for decades to defend their style against computer-run alternatives. \"Human creativity\" is what will get quants ahead, said Amadeo Alentorn, head of systematic equities at Jupiter Asset Management, adding that there might be \"too much hype\" for what generative AI can do for investment management right now. While advances from companies like OpenAI have allowed quants to speed up their processes and work on more complex projects, the technology is not yet to the point where firms can turn their systematic funds over completely to the machines. \"By far the most important part of generative AI is the end user,\" said Timothee Consigny, CTO of H2O Asset Management, a Paris-based macro manager. Consigny, speaking at a London conference for the industry, called Quant Strats, compared the technology to driving a car; everyone now has access to F1-fast cars thanks to generative AI, but not everyone is able to drive them effectively. In other words, on its own, AI is not going to help win the \"alpha war,\" said Matthias Uhl, head of analytics and quant solutions at UBS Asset Management. None other than Citadel founder Ken Griffin agrees with the assessment, saying at Wednesday's Robin Hood conference in New York that generative AI \"falls short\" when it comes to finding market-beating ideas, according to Bloomberg. Back-office grunts and marketing teams might be the biggest beneficiaries of the technology so far. Alentorn said the explosion of the technology has \"helped selling our funds\" because investors are more comfortable with things being run by a computer now. Uhl meanwhile said it's mostly doing \"mundane\" tasks. This aligns with what funds told the Alternative Investment Management Association last year in a survey. While firms were using AI, the primary use cases were for \"time savings on administrative tasks\" and \"content generation\" for investor relations teams. It's not to say quants dislike the technology. Stephan Kessler, who heads quantitative investment research for Morgan Stanley, said, \"it allows us to run more systematic strategies in areas we haven't done before.\" He said the firm has AI combing bond prospectuses for crucial info, a task that used to take a person days is now done in minutes. \"It allows us to code more complex things faster,\" Kessler added. But large language models are, in a way, a blank page and need to learn from funds what is important and what isn't. The software itself is not that valuable; as David Shelton, global head of FICC electronic trading and FX quantitative strategies group for Bank of America, pointed out, AI companies are \"giving away the code.\" Therefore, what you feed the model is more important than what it was trained on, said Haoxue Wang, quant at Izzy Englander's Millennium. \"A language model can't read your mind,\" Wang said.

It seems kind of early to be clearing out the shelves ahead of the big Black Friday and Cyber Week sales to come at the end of next month, but if that\u2019s what Dell is thinking by putting some of their top-shelf touchscreen laptops on sale at massively reduced prices, why say no? This time it\u2019s the Inspiron 15 3535 touchscreen business laptop that\u2019s showing up at Amazon for over $1,500 off \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u2019s just $750 for a limited time. The specs of this business laptop and the $399 accessories bundle it\u2019s paired with basically scream for a higher price, especially with the big holiday sales events still over a month away. The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 has an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, capable of speeds up to 5.0GHz. It comes loaded with 32GB of RAM, expandable to 64GB, and a generous 1TB SSD for storage. Windows 11 Professional with Microsoft Copilot come preloaded. See at Amazon The 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen is an underrated feature. With the huge advances made by tablets, a touchscreen laptop doesn\u2019t quite have the cache it once had, but it\u2019s exceptionally useful. The one on the Dell Inspiron 15 is full-HD with Dolby Atmos and anti-glare coating, so it\u2019s a solid display even before you use the touchscreen features. For our money\u2019s worth, a good touchscreen beats a trackpad any day for ultimate control and ease of use. We also love the fact that while 32GB of RAM is a real score, and definitely enough to power the Dell Inspiron 15 through multitasking, streaming, and even creative work like photo and video editing, this Dell comes with an empty slot to give you the option of doubling the RAM by adding another 32GB chip. Memory prices have been pleasantly low as of late, so this is a great bit of future-proofing for this laptop. Dell calls the Inspiron 15 a business laptop, and it\u2019s certainly more than capable if you\u2019re strictly looking for an everyday productivity superstar at a great price. But it would almost be a waste to not use it for more, since it has enough graphics power and a sharp enough screen to lend itself to creative endeavors, and with the FHD Dolby Atmos screen, a little streaming might be in order as well. The 69% off deal at Amazon that knocks the price of the Inspiron 15 and its accessory bundle down from $2,400 to just $750 shows that Dell is serious about reducing its stock of these great touchscreen laptops ahead of the holiday tech deals. There\u2019s going to be no shortage of tech shoppers willing to lend them a hand, so don\u2019t wait too long or the supply might run out.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so closely correlated, the current US financial system looks like a tinder box just waiting for a spark to land on it.  WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 OpenAI Co-Founder Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have joined the chorus of people talking about an AI bubble and expressing concern that the US economy will nosedive when it bursts. But what would a post-bubble nosedive look like?   Given the weakness in almost every other sector of the US economy, it could well mean a recession. Economic slumps come in many flavors, though, and the worst tend to follow from financial crises. Yet most experts (with a few exceptions) have not warned of the AI bubble causing a financial crisis. Instead, the conventional wisdom seems to be that if there is a recession, it will look more like the one that followed the dot-com bubble in 2000 than the one following the 2008 global financial crisis.   History does provide some support for this view. One well known paper on bubbles and financial crises concludes that \u201cthe post-WW2 era appears to have weathered numerous equity price bubbles that did not turn into financial crisis episodes.\u201d But the authors also note that equity-price bubbles can\u00a0precipitate financial crises if they are fueled by borrowed money. After all, the Great Depression was preceded by a debt-fueled \u201croaring 20s\u201d equity bubble.   This matters because, as economist Noah Smith points out, banks are funding \u201cprivate credit\u201d funds that in turn are lending money to fund the data-center construction for an anticipated AI boom. Smith wonders whether we will see defaults on those construction loans when the AI bubble bursts, and whether private credit losses could cause a crisis for the banks that ultimately extended that credit.   It is also worth pondering whether a bursting AI bubble could compromise the ability of other non-bank financial institutions to repay their loans. A recent JPMorgan analyst note on hedge-fund trading observes that concentration in the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech stocks (companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia) remains near historic highs. Yet the prices of these stocks are highly dependent on the companies\u2019 AI ambitions. If they fall short of their goals, and prices come crashing down, highly leveraged hedge funds may be forced into fire sales, unloading stocks to meet margin calls or repay bank loans. And if those fire sales don\u2019t fetch enough cash, the funds will default on their repayment obligations, potentially undermining the financial condition of the broker-dealers, primary dealers, and banks that extended them credit.    Moreover, the same dynamics will also drive down the prices of tech stocks further, potentially forcing other leveraged financial institutions to sell off their portfolios, and so on. Nor should we assume that financial institutions desperate for cash will restrict themselves to selling off tech stocks. On the contrary, they may need \u2013 or prefer \u2013 to dump other types of assets, transmitting problems to other asset markets.

SUBSCRIBE NOW   Such a scenario is not far-fetched. The Fed reports that hedge-fund leverage hit historically high levels in 2024, and in a September 2025 commentary, analyst Adam Josephson notes that \u201chedge fund borrowing\/leverage [is] at a record high of $6.2 trillion, up more than 25% vs. a year ago at the end of March.\u201d Specifically, outstanding margin loans from broker-dealers and repurchase agreements from primary dealers are at historically high levels. And bank lending (particularly lending by large banks) to non-bank financial institutions \u2013 including broker-dealers, primary dealers, and the hedge funds themselves \u2013 is also significantly elevated, with bank loans to NBFIs now accounting for \u201c$1.7 trillion in bank loans, or 13% of loans outstanding.\u201d   Meanwhile, US financial regulators continue to permit this expansion of leverage, as well as greenlighting the integration of traditional financial markets with crypto markets (which are also rife with leverage). Despite narratives about Bitcoin and other crypto assets serving as a hedge against risks in other markets, their price movements are highly correlated with equities.   Thus, we should expect to see crypto prices fall when the AI bubble bursts, and not just because of fire-sale dynamics. Both crypto and the AI bubble have been inflated by the same kinds of narratives about new technologies shattering old paradigms. If evidence of AI\u2019s limitations starts to permeate the public consciousness during a market crash, more pessimistic sentiment on tech assets could well undermine crypto hype as well.   This could then prompt a crash in Ponzi-like crypto assets such as Bitcoin, as well as runs on asset-backed stablecoins. If stablecoin issuers are forced to withdraw their cash reserves from banks, they could trigger a run on those institutions; and if they are forced to dump Treasuries from their reserves, another critically important financial market could be sucked into the maelstrom.   Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so correlated, what if the financial system is a tinder box that could explode when the first spark lands on it?   Of course, the financial system may well weather the bursting of the AI bubble, especially if the end arrives with a low hiss rather than a sudden bang. But we shouldn\u2019t count on it.

The Tile Mate offers a smarter alternative that works with both iOS and Android devices, and right now it\u2019s half the price of an AirTag at just $14, down from $24. This record-low deal on Amazon makes it the obvious choice for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem or simply wants reliable tracking without the premium price tag. See at Amazon Tile Mate tracker links up via Bluetooth and boasts a respectable 350-foot range, roughly 105 meters in open space. This lets you track down your tagged items from the far side of a large house, down the street or across a parking lot. That\u2019s well and truly enough where everyday normal life situations are concerned like locating your bag in another room or where you placed your car keys in your apartment. Just in case your tagged item ever gets out of Bluetooth signal range, the Tile network steps up to the plate. With millions of Tile members creating an anonymous finding network, if someone with the Life360 app happens to pass by where your lost item happens to be, you get its new location even though they have no idea they helped out. It\u2019s very simple in its fundamental job: Attach a Tile Mate to something you inevitably lose such as house keys, a backpack, your dog\u2019s collar or a laptop bag. On your smartphone, you access the free Life360 app and tap to get the Tile to ring. It\u2019s loud enough to hear through couch cushions or in the pocket of a coat jacket. This simple function in itself prevents untold minutes of furious searching each week. Just as convenient and all too underappreciated is the reverse finding feature: Hit the button on your Tile twice and it will ring your phone at top decibels even if you had it on mute. This has come to my rescue more times that I have had snacks at this point in which my phone goes between the seats in the car or gets stashed under papers on my desk. No app opening or unlocking required, you simply hit the physical Tile\u2019s button. Integration with Life360 adds even more value to the equation. Life360 is a location-sharing and family safety app that\u2019s used in millions of homes, and incorporation of your Tiles into this service enables you to see both your valuables and your family on the same map. This minimizes family logistics coordination to a single glance since you aren\u2019t switching between multiple apps to know where everyone and everything is. Tile Mate has a non-replaceable battery that lasts for three years\u00c2\u00a0so you have good performance for years before you have to replace it. Replacing the whole piece at this $14 cost after three years is cheaper than messing around with replaceable batteries at any rate. IP68 water resistance comes in two parts: it\u2019s able to withstand rain, spills, or even temporary submersions to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. You can attach it safely to things that could get wet, such as gym bag or camping equipment. Half the price of an AirTag and with cross-platform support, the Tile Mate at $14 represents the wisest tracking value on the market today.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. Asian equities ended the week with a thud, as markets moved to the lower right on concerns over the US\u2019 regional bank crisis going global. The US dollar strengthened overnight. Risk off ruled the day, so I wouldn\u2019t overthink last night\u2019s price action. There were several headlines that arguably weighed on sentiment, including US-China geopolitical tensions, China's 2023 ban on Micron selling server memory chips garnering attention, the IMF\u2019s 2026 China GDP target of 4.2% versus 2025\u2019s 4.8%, and BYD\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) recall. We reiterate our belief that Hong Kong and Mainland China-listed stocks were overbought and are simply working off that excess. This was indicated clearly by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The Hang Seng Tech is officially in a correction territory following today\u2019s steep decline in growth stocks in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. I am not going to belabor today\u2019s significant decline, as the advancers versus decliners chart pretty much sums it up. Volumes were light as mainland investors purchased $811 million worth of Hong Kong stocks via Southbound Stock Connect. A few upcoming events could provide catalysts for investors, such as the following: A rare bright spot was NIO, which gained +2.17% after denying fraud allegations.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"After an historic defeat for the long-dominant political left, two candidates have promised a new pro-market direction. By Brian Osgood Share Save As voters in Bolivia prepare to go to the polls for the final round of the country\u2019s presidential election, there is no left-wing candidate on the ballot for the first time in nearly two decades. Since the last election, the current governing party, the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), has suffered an implosion, with party leaders splintering off and attacking one another. Amid the fracas, MAS failed to advance a candidate to the run-off election, meaning its leadership \u2014 nearly uninterrupted since 2006 \u2014 is slated to come to an end. A centrist and a right-wing candidate are now facing off in Sunday\u2019s highly anticipated run-off. But the election is unlikely to smooth over the divides that have fractured and destabilised Bolivian politics in recent years, with a severe economic crisis spurring continuing unrest. Who are the candidates? What issues are front and centre for voters? And what challenges could the new government face in the months ahead? We answer those questions and more in this brief explainer.      The run-off vote will take place on October 19, with the winner of the election inaugurated on November 8. The final stage of the election is itself a sign of the shifting and unpredictable state of the country\u2019s politics. Rodrigo Paz, one of the two final candidates, was the surprise victor in the first round of voting despite registering less than 10 percent in early polling. He carried more than 32 percent of the votes in the August 17 general election. His rival is Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga, a former president who came in second place with nearly 27 percent of the vote. Neither met the threshold to win the presidency outright, which would have required winning 50 percent of the vote, or 40 percent with a 10-point margin over the nearest competitor. Paz is a senator and the son of the former left-wing President Jaime Zamora. Though he has aligned himself with various parties throughout his career, in this election, he is representing the centre-right Christian Democratic Party. Paz has pitched himself as a more moderate voice who will embrace pro-market policies while taking a cautious approach to austerity measures. \u201cCapitalism for All\u201d is his campaign slogan. His running mate, meanwhile, is Edman Lara, an evangelical Christian and former police officer who resigned from his position and became a popular figure on social media for his outspoken criticism of corruption. Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga is a businessman and former president. Early in his career, he worked in Texas for the multinational tech company IBM. But his interests shifted to politics, particularly in the 1990s, and he even worked under Paz\u2019s father as Bolivia\u2019s finance minister. In 1997, Quiroga ran as the running mate on the successful presidential ticket of Hugo Banzer, who led a military dictatorship in the 1970s. But when Banzer was diagnosed with cancer and resigned in 2001, Quiroga succeeded him as president, serving the remainder of his term. Quiroga\u2019s subsequent bids for the presidency have fallen short: He lost in 2005, 2014 and 2020. In this election, he is running on a stridently pro-market platform as the head of a right-wing coalition, the Libre Alliance. Quiroga\u2019s running mate is Juan Pablo Velasco, a 38-year-old tech entrepreneur. Polling currently shows Quiroga with a slight advantage, but analysts have pointed out that polling before the first round of voting failed to detect support for Paz. A poll taken between October 1 and 6 by the research firm CB Consultora found that Paz has an approval rating of 42.5 percent. Quiroga, meanwhile, leads with 56.7 percent approval. While 75 percent of respondents said they would vote in the run-off, CB Consultora said protest votes \u2014 with ballots intentionally left blank or spoiled \u2014 are expected to increase. Under the presidency of Evo Morales from 2006 to 2019, the left-wing MAS party oversaw a period of strong economic growth while simultaneously decreasing inequality, a rare feat. That translated into electoral dominance for Morales, who is considered the country\u2019s first Indigenous president. But an electoral crisis in 2019 resulted in Morales fleeing the country after seeking a contested fourth term, in circumstances that his supporters have characterised as a coup. The crisis caused a brief interruption in MAS leadership, and the post-election period saw turmoil and widespread protests, with the short-lived right-wing government overseeing a deadly crackdown. In 2020, the left returned to power when Morales\u2019s finance minister became the current president, Luis Arce. But internal divides have critically weakened MAS, leading to Morales leaving the party. Courts have barred Morales, who faces an arrest warrant for alleged statutory rape, from seeking a fourth term. But Morales has persisted in his efforts, characterising the ban on his candidacy as an assault on his rights. He has called upon his followers, many of whom are rural and Indigenous voters, to boycott the vote.      For many Bolivians, concerns about the economy and the cost of living are top of mind as they head to the polls. High inflation and fuel shortages, along with dwindling foreign currency reserves, have been a source of hardship. \u201cPeople are waiting in line for hours at a time for gasoline,\u201d said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivia-based group that promotes human rights. \u201cDiesel, which is important for the transportation of other goods, is even worse.\u201d Polling compiled by the Americas Society\/Council of the Americas (ASCOA) shows that 24 percent of Bolivians consider the economy their primary concern this election season. Another 17 percent cited price increases as a top concern, and fuel shortages were at 14 percent. Velasco, Quiroga\u2019s vice presidential running mate, has faced scrutiny over a series of racist social media posts he made in the past,\u00a0celebrating violence against the country\u2019s Indigenous population. The posts, some of which are nearly 15 years old, were initially unearthed by an Argentinian social media figure. Bolivian fact-checking agencies have since verified the posts. Velasco responded by denying that he authored the posts. He has also attacked the fact-checkers, prompting the Bolivian press association to release a statement in support of the fact-checking agencies. Both Quiroga and Paz are promising pro-market policies and a departure from the left-wing programme that has dominated Bolivian politics for the last two decades. Where the two candidates differ is over how quickly to implement those economic changes. Quiroga has said that he will cut spending on social programmes and fuel subsidies, privatise state enterprises, and seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Paz has been more hesitant when it comes to embracing calls for austerity and steep cuts to social programmes, although he has also said that he would cut fuel subsidies. He has also suggested that Bolivia could lower tariffs to help import goods that the country does not produce itself and expressed interest in greater integration into regional trade blocs, such as MERCOSUR. The administration of US President Donald Trump has expressed approval over the prospect of a right-wing government in Bolivia. Bilateral ties under MAS leadership had been strained over conflicting policies towards growing coca, a major crop in Bolivia and the raw ingredient for cocaine. On October 14, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the election outright, calling it \u201cimportant\u201d. \u201cLater this month, there\u2019ll be an election in Bolivia,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAfter 25, 30 years of anti-American, hostile governments, both of the candidates running in that election, in the run-off election, want strong and better relations with the United States. Another transformative opportunity there.\u201d Morales, a firm critic of the US \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, expelled the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in 2008 and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2013, alleging it was working to influence Bolivian politics. \u201cThere was a great deal of frustration in Washington, DC, because this was a refutation of the idea that, to govern successfully, you need cooperation and funding from the US,\u201d said Ledebur. Both Paz and Quiroga have said that they will seek closer ties with the US. Quiroga, in particular, has been a critic of left-wing governments in Latin America, including in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, with which MAS had cultivated ties. That shift comes at a moment when the Trump administration is taking on a more aggressive stance in Latin America, pushing a highly militarised approach to combating drug trafficking and using US influence to assist right-wing allies in countries such as Argentina and Brazil. After years of dominance, Bolivia\u2019s political left is preparing for a period in the political wilderness. The candidate for MAS, Eduardo del Castillo, won just 3.2 percent in the first round of voting in August. A former MAS member, Andronico Rodriguez, won approximately 8 percent of the vote. Many former MAS supporters have turned to Paz due to his populist stance and softer approach towards economic austerity, and Ledebur says that the once-powerful left will have to mend internal rifts and find a new path forward. But the forces that have powered the Bolivian left for decades, such as Indigenous and rural voting blocs, are likely to remain a formidable force, even if MAS finds itself out of power. Ledebur says that efforts to implement harsh austerity measures could spark strong backlash and protests. She predicts that conflict with the new government could help unite the left around a common cause, but that doing so will take time. \u201cThe left will definitely have to change something after its defeat in the election,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be a reconfiguration, but it could take a long time.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks fell Thursday after two regional banks announced credit-quality issues. Zions Bancorporation said it took a $50 million charge-off on two business loans Wednesday. And Western Alliance filed a lawsuit alleging borrower fraud Thursday.   The large-cap S&P 500 index fell 0.6%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the blue-chip index, retreated 0.7%. Back-to-back problems at regional banks fuel concerns that commercial credit quality is deteriorating. Since August, two subprime auto lenders have made headlines for the wrong reasons. Automotive Credit Corp paused originations and Tricolor Holdings filed for bankruptcy with the intention to liquidate. The Tricolor Holdings failure will trigger losses for larger banks with exposure to the company, including JPMorgan and Fifth Third Bancorp. Automotive parts supplier First Brands also went bankrupt in September. Jefferies Financial Group had exposure to First Brands through its investment manager Point Bonita.  Stock futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones are down ahead of the market open on Friday. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.4%, Nasdaq 100 futures are down 0.6% and Dow Jones futures dipped 0.1%.   What is FCF in investing and why is it important? FCF stands for free cash flow, which is cash left after daily business operations and capital expenditures, also known as capex.  Free cash flow is important because it can fund growth initiatives as well as shareholder dividends, share buybacks and debt reductions. A company with ample and growing FCF has flexibility to:  The two components of FCF are operating cash flow and capex. Operating cash flow is the cash a business produces from its core activities. This is a measure of efficiency and business health. A healthy business model generates more than enough cash from customers to pay suppliers and employees.  You calculate operating cash flow by adjusting net income for non-cash expenses and working capital expenses. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.   Capex are longer-term investments made to upgrade or expand the company\u2019s physical assets like property, tooling, factories and equipment. These expenditures are expected to provide benefits for multiple years.  A company that generates a lot of FCF can invest in value-creation and shareholder returns, without limiting funds available for daily operations and maintaining and enhancing capital assets.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. We anticipate that the company will report quarterly revenues of approximately $18.6 billion, buoyed by consistent defense expenditure and effective backlog management in its Aeronautics and Missiles & Fire Control divisions. Nonetheless, we forecast that earnings will experience slight margin pressure due to supply chain expenses and timing of programs. While efficiency enhancements and increased production rates in F-35 deliveries are likely offsetting inflationary challenges, profit growth continues to be gradual. Strong demand from U.S. and allied defense programs remains essential for revenue stability, but lasting earnings growth will hinge on execution discipline and contract composition in the upcoming quarters. The company possesses a current market capitalization of $118 billion. Over the past twelve months, revenue totaled $72 billion, and it was operationally profitable with $5.9 billion in operating income and a net profit of $4.2 billion. While outcomes will largely be influenced by how results compare to consensus expectations, gaining insights from historical trends could enhance your odds if you are a trader focusing on events. There are two approaches to consider: grasp the historical odds and prepare yourself before the earnings announcement, or examine the relationship between immediate and medium-term returns after earnings and adjust your position accordingly once the earnings are made public. Furthermore, if you are looking for upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative \u2013 having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception.

Here's why we believe Iridium Communications (IRDM) stock deserves your attention: It is growing, generating cash, and is available at a substantial valuation discount. Let\u2019s review the numbers. Free Cash Flow Yield is defined as free cash flow per share divided by stock price. Why is it important? If a company generates a high amount of cash per share, it can be utilized for further revenue growth or distributed to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. For a brief background, Iridium Communications delivers mobile voice, data, push-to-talk, broadband, and IoT communication services to businesses, governments, NGOs, and consumers via a wholesale distribution network. Investing in a single stock can be risky; however, there is significant value in the more diversified strategy we adopt with the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Datadog stock (NASDAQ: DDOG) declined by 7.9% over the past five trading days. This drop was primarily triggered by news on October 10 that several company insiders, including CEO Olivier Pomel and director Shardul Shah, sold large amounts of shares. This insider selling likely fueled investor concerns about the stock\u2019s short-term prospects. Furthermore, there are reports of Datadog mulling a takeover bid for GitLab at $60 per share, which is much higher than the $44, GTLB stock was trading at before the announcement.  Already own DTDG stock or planning to buy? You should rethink this based on the valuation, as the stock appears quite expensive. Take a look at the following data: Although we typically prefer to buy on dips when the fundamentals are solid \u2013 for DDOG, see Buy or Sell DDOG Stock \u2013 we are cautious about falling knives. In particular, it is essential to consider if the situation deteriorates further, and DDOG suffers another drop of 20-30% to levels around $106; will we maintain our position in the stock? What would be the worst-case scenario? This concept is what we refer to as downturn resilience. It turns out that the stock has performed worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on both (a) the magnitude of the stock\u2019s decline and (b) the speed at which it has recovered. DDOG stock has experienced a significant fall recently, and we currently deem it relatively expensive. While this may seem like an opportunity, there is a considerable risk involved in depending on just one stock. Conversely, there is immense value in a more diversified approach, which we implement with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about what the long-term performance of your portfolio would be if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Bitcoin\u2019s BTC$107,019.41 price is precariously hovering in the critical support zone amid a broadening surge in volatility indices across asset classes. The leading cryptocurrency by market value has dropped nearly 2.5% to $108,000 in 24 hours. It has entered the key support zone of $107,000 to $110,000, which, if breached, would mark a significant weakening of buying pressure and expose prices to deeper losses. BTC's annualized 30-day implied or expected volatility, gauged by Volmex's BVIV index, has climbed above 50%, retaining gains seen during last Friday's leverage flush out. The index has risen more than 21% since bitcoin began its pullback from the Oct. 6 record high of over $124,000. This rise highlights the growing Wall Street-like dynamics in the crypto market, where volatility tends to surge during price sell-offs. The upswing in BTC's volatility is marked by short and near-dated puts trading at 5% to 9% volatility premium to calls, reflecting heightened fears of a protracted sell-off, according to Deribit data. Put options offer insurance against potential weakness in the underlying asset. Traders commonly purchase puts to hedge their spot market holdings or to profit from an anticipated market sell-off. Speaking of Wall Street, its very own fear gauge, the VIX index, rose 22% to 25.43 on Thursday, the highest since May 7. The index has increased 56% since last Friday. Similarly, the CBOE gold volatility index (GVZ) jumped 20% to 32.78 on Thursday, reaching the highest level since October 2022. The yellow metal's price per ounce rose to a fresh lifetime high of $4,380 per ounce. The concurrent rise in volatility indices across equities, gold, and cryptocurrencies underscores a broad-based risk-off mood likely driven by signs of liquidity stress in the U.S. financial system.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"NASCAR  SHARE   When Amazon Prime Video launched itself into NASCAR\u2019s broadcasting lineup this season, aside from a new media deal, it was a test to see just how far the sport could extend into the streaming age.\u00a0 For one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies (market cap: $2.3 trillion ) this was about figuring out a whole new way people could connect with them, through the NASCAR races. Amazon broadcast 5 Cup Series events, including that very first Mexico City race and the iconic Coca-Cola 600. Right off the bat, it was clear that the production quality was top notch: over 70 different camera angles, mics on the pit boxes, and drone flyovers.\u00a0 Fans really like the broadcast for its energy and precision, a breath of fresh air after years of pretty spotty coverage on traditional TV. But the numbers didn\u2019t quite live up to expectations. On average, Amazon\u2019s coverage drew 2.16 million viewers, roughly 21% fewer than comparable events on FOX the year before that.\u00a0 And of those viewers, it was the older crowd that tanked the most, with the 55+ demographic plummeting by around 40%. On paper that\u2019s a drop that\u2019d give most networks a serious case of the jitters. But for Amazon, that\u2019s not how it works. When speaking to Racing America, Alex Strand, part of Amazon Prime\u2019s NASCAR broadcast team, about the company\u2019s outlook he said: \u201cIf someone watches the race one week, and then they decide, hey, we\u2019re going to go to next week\u2019s race, and we lose a viewer because they\u2019ve decided, it looks so awesome, they want to go to the next race, that\u2019s a big win for us.\u201d What he\u2019s saying is that losing a viewer because they want to attend the live event is a trade Amazon is more than happy to make. And in a lot of ways, the numbers actually back that up.\u00a0 Take the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, which sold out for the fourth year running and drew fans from all 50 US states and 12 foreign countries. Pocono Raceway also had its third straight sell out, with visitors from 13 different international markets. Amazon\u2019s way of thinking on this basically seems like it\u2019s matching how they use technology everywhere else, not just to dish out content, but to actually shape how people behave.\u00a0 As Strand puts it, \u201cif we\u2019re going to go do this sport, we need to be on site, we need to be in the mix, and we need to show off that access to people at home. And so it was near the top of our list to say, everyone\u2019s there, everyone\u2019s in person, and we want to make sure everyone at home feels like they\u2019re in the middle of it.\u201d According to Amazon, the aim was not necessarily about going for the best ratings. It was showing that NASCAR can work on streaming\u200a\u2014\u200aif fans engage in some way, whether from the couch or in the grandstands, the system is working. Thus, by that logic, losing a viewer wouldn\u2019t even be a loss. It sounds backwards, but in Amazon\u2019s view, that\u2019s the point.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin prices extended their recent losses on Friday, October 17, dropping to their lowest value in more than three months as several factors combined to fuel continued declines.  The world\u2019s most prominent digital currency reached as little as $103,516.25, according to Coinbase data from TradingView.  At this point, the cryptocurrency was down roughly 18% from the all-time high of $126,300 that it reached on October 6, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal.  The digital asset was also trading at its most depressed value since approximately June 23.  When explaining bitcoin\u2019s recent price movements, analysts highlighted a variety of bearish factors, emphasizing that the digital currency has encountered multiple challenges since reaching its zenith earlier this month.  Several market observers pointed to the impact of tariff announcements made by President Donald Trump, as well as how they have impacted the broader global asset markets.  Jacob Joseph, senior research analyst at CoinDesk Data, commented on these developments.  \u201cBitcoin and the broader digital asset market have largely trailed traditional financial assets in recent weeks, including gold and major equity indices,\u201d he stated via email.  \u201cThis underperformance coincides with increased macroeconomic uncertainty following President Trump\u2019s announcement of potential new tariffs on China, which has led to reduced risk appetite across financial markets. \u201d  Olivier Mammet, head of US OTC trading for Gemini, also commented on these duties, as well as how they have combined with heavy use of leverage to fuel downward price movement.  \u201cBTC is down about 16% from its peak around $126,000 last week. The initial drop was related to President Trump\u2019s new tariffs on China that rattled the whole market beyond crypto, but the impact was mostly felt within the crypto space that had good leverage in it,\u201d he stated.  \u201cWe saw multiple waves of forced liquidations on Friday, with $19 billion worth of positions being liquidated across venues, which explains how we went from $126,000 to $110,000 on Friday alone,\u201d Mammet continued.  Another factor that has contributed to the recent weakness in the global asset markets, and also bitcoin prices, is uncertainty surrounding the status of certain U.S. banks, according to several analysts who contributed input for this article.  Shares of several lending institutions, including Western Alliance Bancorp and Zions Bancorporation, tumbled on Thursday, October 16, after these companies announced financial challenges, according to Reuters. More specifically, Western Alliance revealed that it would take a $50 million loss as a result of two loans.  Marc P. Bernegger, cofounder of crypto fund of funds AltAlpha Digital, spoke to these developments, stating through emailed commentary that \u201cReports of losses at US regional banks like Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance due to troubled loans have spilled over into broader financial markets, echoing 2023\u2019s banking stresses and eroding confidence in assets like Bitcoin as well.\u201d  Mammet also weighed in on these developments, indicating that \u201cDespite equities trading relatively well (SP500 only down 2-3% from the peak), other negative news such as the uncertainty surrounding regional US bank\u2019s loans is continuing to weigh on the market.\u201d  Short traders have seized control of the bitcoin markets this week, according to Julio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant. Short positions have been \u201cdominating the futures market basically since October 14, and putting additional downward pressure on the price,\" he noted.  The chart below illustrates these developments:  Past that, \u201cSpot demand continues to decline,\u201d he added. The chart below shows the drop in bitcoin\u2019s apparent demand.  \u201cApparent demand is the part of the Bitcoin stock that is bought by new bitcoin holders,\u201d Moreno clarified. \u201cHere, the total stock is defined as Bitcoin that has not moved in 1 year or more,\u201d he added.  \u201cWhen the total stock declines it is because there is new demand for Bitcoin and vice versa,\u201d Moreno continued.

{"date":"2025-10-17","content":"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      Even if meat isn't the main ingredient, animal byproducts still may have snuck in to these 10 food and drinks.    Yes, even vegetable soup can have animal products hiding in it. Wine, tortillas or even vegetable soup are obviously vegetarian, right? Well, if you're on a plant-based or vegan diet, you might want to double-check. Some foods that are seemingly animal-free might not actually be. Surprising ingredients, including animal byproducts, sneak into everyday staples without much warning.\u00a0 We spoke with food and drink experts to learn about 10 common foods that aren't always vegetarian-friendly. Here's everything to know.\u00a0 Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Real Parmigiano-Reggiano isn't a vegetarian product, due to the use of rennet during production. Alarmist headlines like to specifically call out Parmigiano-Reggiano as a nonvegetarian cheese, but Parm is far from the only culprit in the cheese category that contains more than just milk.\u00a0 \"Cheese is often not vegetarian because of the use of rennet, which helps the milk coagulate and separate into curds and whey,\" explained Emily Monaco, an international cheese judge and journalist. \"Traditionally, rennet comes from the stomach of a baby animal: calf, kid or lamb. While similar, [plant-based] enzymes can be used for similar effects, many cheeses rely on animal-based rennet, especially in France,\" and throughout Europe. Check your ingredient lists, or ask your cheesemonger if you're unsure. \"Rennet\" will pretty much always indicate animal rennet, but \"vegetarian rennet,\" \"microbial rennet,\" \"thistle (cardoon) rennet\" or another coagulant such as lemon juice, acid or vinegar indicate a truly vegetarian cheese. Certain types of white sugar are produced using bone char. Yep, even something as basic as sugar might have nonvegetarian aspects to it. \"There are sugars that are processed using bone char, which is made from charred animal bones,\" said Maricel Gentile, cooking instructor, chef and owner of Maricel's Kitchen. \"Bone char whitens the sugar in the process.\"\u00a0 Fortunately, this doesn't apply to all sugar, but certain brands or specific sugar processing plants may use bone char, which should rightfully give some vegetarians pause. \"Not all white sugar is processed like this. Some use filtration methods that use carbon instead,\" said Gentile. \"Check the label, or look for organic or beet sugar, which typically don't use bone char methods.\" If you've ever seen a label on a bottle of wine that indicates the wine is vegan and wondered why that even needed to be mentioned -- surely all wine must be vegan, yes? -- well, there's a reason. \"Although it may sound strange, not all wines are vegan-friendly,\" said wine journalist Vicki Denig. \"Some producers will use animal-derived products to 'fine' -- which essentially means to clarify -- wines.\" Depending on what method a producer chooses to fine its products, many wines would still be considered vegetarian, but not always. \"During the fining process, these products basically bind and remove unwanted sediments or substances and are then filtered out,\" Denig explained. \"Such products include -- but are not limited to -- egg whites, casein, gelatin and more.\" Isinglass, another element that's sometimes used to filter wine, is actually a fish by-product. Read more:\u00a0Best Wine Clubs and Subscriptions to Gift in 2025 The surest way to know that a wine is vegan is to look for wines that are labeled accordingly. Otherwise, until there's legislation requiring winemakers to include ingredient lists on bottles, you might need to go deep into a producer's website to find out.\u00a0 Traditional tortillas are often made using lard. You don't necessarily need to be overly cautious about tortillas that you bring home from the grocery store, but when dining out for Mexican food, it's good to be aware that a staple component of many Mexican dishes isn't automatically vegetarian. \"Traditionally, Mexican tortillas, particularly flour tortillas, are made with lard, which adds a rich flavor and a desirable texture,\" explained Wes Avila, chef of MXO in Los Angeles. Lard is rendered animal fat, and its use can vary by region. \"In contrast, most grocery store brands of tortillas, especially the mass-produced varieties, often use vegetable oils or no fat at all, to cater to a wider audience,\" said Avila, \"including those who prefer vegetarian or vegan options. Always check the ingredient list if you're looking for a specific type of tortilla.\" Watch out for lard or bits of pork in this Mexican staple side dish. Lots of preparations involving beans use noticeable bits of pork, but another element from Mexican cuisine that may seem vegetarian but isn't, is refried beans. \"With traditional Mexican recipes, refried beans will often be prepared using lard,\" said Mexican-American chef and cookbook author Kristyn Merkley. Check labels when shopping for packaged refried beans, and don't make assumptions when dining out -- be sure to ask. You might find that chefs adapt their refried beans to suit vegetarian clientele. \"A shortening like Crisco also works,\" said Merkley, and you can easily adapt a refried beans recipe that calls for lard. \"Home cooks can use vegetable oil instead to make it vegetarian, or use plant-based milk or cheese,\" she said, for a fully vegan version. The reason pie crust is so good has a lot to do with lard. Lard also happens to be a traditional ingredient in something you might find on the dessert menu. \"Pie crust often uses lard,\" said Gentile. \"It makes a beautiful flakey texture.\" Meat pies are one thing, but yes, lard is frequently preferred by pastry chefs even for sweet pies. Despite being meat-based, lard has a neutral flavor, so you wouldn't be likely to tell the difference between a pie crust that used lard and one that used a different kind of fat. Lard isn't universal, however, either in restaurants and bakeries, or in prepared grocery store crusts. \"Some use butter, and others use shortening,\" Gentile explained. \"If you are not making the crust yourself, check the label or ask your baker.\" Caesar dressing often has pureed anchovy in it. There's a particular element to Caesar dressing that gives it its rich flavor. If you've never witnessed Caesar dressing being made, then you might be tempted to believe it's just cheese (which again, might not be entirely vegetarian either) that gives Caesar its distinctiveness. With no offense to cheese, the depth of Caesar dressing goes way beyond what cheese alone can achieve. \"Caesar dressing catches a lot of vegetarians off guard because it's made with anchovies, which aren't always obvious in the ingredient list,\" said Dennis Littley, chef and recipe expert at Ask Chef Dennis. \"Many people assume it's just a creamy dressing made with parmesan, garlic and lemon, but traditional recipes rely on anchovies for that deep, savory umami flavor.'' Another common condiment that may be in your fridge right now is also a hidden source of anchovies. (Or not so hidden, so long as you're reading the label closely.) \"A lot of people don't realize that Worcestershire sauce usually contains anchovies because it just adds a rich, savory depth to food rather than a fishy taste,\" said Rena Awada, owner and head chef at Healthy Fitness Meals. \"Since you don't really taste the fishiness, it's easy to overlook,\" she said, \"until you check the ingredients and realize it's not vegetarian after all.\" What's more, Worcestershire sauce is a common ingredient in other products -- salad dressings, steak sauce, barbecue sauce or marinades -- whose bold flavors may not make it obvious that they may also contain unexpected seafood. Jell-O and similar products get their jiggle from gelatin. You may already know that gelatin itself is an animal by-product, but if not, \"gelatin is made from the collagen found in the cartilage, bones and skin of animals,\" said Gentile. \"Cows and pigs are the most common source. When these parts are simmered down, the collagen breaks down into gelatin.\" Avoiding gelatin means much more than just avoiding Jell-O, though, if you're a strict vegetarian. \"Things like marshmallows, gummy candies, and fruit snacks probably are what we all think of when we think of gelatin, but even yogurt, ice cream, sour cream and cream cheese can contain gelatin to stabilize it,\" explained Gentile. \"'Diet,' 'light,' or 'low-fat' foods will also often use additives like gelatin to make up for the lack of natural fat binders,\" she said. Even the coating of some vitamin capsules can be made of gelatin. You'd be surprised by how many vegetable soups use chicken stock as a base. Soup can often be a source of hidden animal products, as many use an animal-based stock such as beef or chicken, which offers a deep flavor. Double-check soups like cream of broccoli, mushroom, carrot, and so on. They can all have a meaty base.\u00a0 Even straightforward vegetable soup, which would seem to have a tomato base, can have animal stock as a foundation. Many brands that produce vegetable soup are vegetarian or vegan, but soup should always be a label-check situation.","label":0}

Last year the market drew more than 4,088 participants, with 42% coming from outside Japan.\u00a0  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tHow Tokyo International Film Festival Is Seeding International Exchange & Next Generation Of Asian Filmmakers\t\t \t\t\t                \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Tron: Ares' Hits Bump In The Road With $60.5M Global Opening; 'Demon Slayer - Infinity Castle' Moves To No. 5 WW In 2025 - International Box Office\t\t \t\t\t        \t\u201cAccording to post event surveys, around 80% of participants said they found new business partners at TIFFCOM, demonstrating its growing value as a networking platform,\u201d says TIFFCOM CEO Yasushi Shiina.     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \t\u201cThis year we\u2019re going to continue our focus on international co-production and global collaboration, while placing stronger emphasis on connecting Japanese IP with overseas partners. We also want to build closer ties with Southeast Asia. Our aim is to support the development of networks that extend, not only across East Asia, but throughout the entire Asian region.\u201d  \tJapanese IP is currently much in demand following a smoking hot year in which animated feature Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Infinity Castle earned $239M (JPY36BN) in Japan and more than $649M worldwide. Released over the summer, the highly-anticipated anime sequel became the biggest Japanese film of all time globally and the highest-grossing international film in the U.S., beating Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).  \tBut while the global appeal of Japanese anime and manga is nothing new, this has also been a year in which Japanese live-action features started to make waves. Shiina points out that Lee Sang-il\u2019s Kokuho, which is Japan\u2019s Oscars submission, stunned the industry by grossing $107m at the Japanese box office earlier this year, the kind of business usually only achieved by hot anime titles.\u00a0  \t           \t\u201cAt the Cannes Film Festival, ten Japanese films were officially selected, further underscoring Japan\u2019s growing presence in international cinema,\u201d Shiina observes. \u201cAlso in television, there has been a steady increase in international format sales and major broadcasters have begun establishing studios dedicated to developing projects for the global market.\u201d  \tThe strength of Japanese IP will be explored through TIFFCOM\u2019s busy seminar line-up, which includes sessions with Sony Pictures International Productions chief Shebnem Askin, and Tetsu Fujimura, CEO of consulting firm Filosophia and executive producer of Netflix\u2019s live-action series One Piece, adapted from a popular manga.\u00a0  \tFujimura will talk about why Japanese IP is currently attracting so much global attention and its future potential, while Askin will share insights on Sony\u2019s international remakes business, which includes a Thai adaptation of 50 First Dates and a Mexican remake of Japanese property Shall We Dance?\u00a0  \tMeanwhile, TIFFCOM attendees will also be able to get their hands on some Japanese IP directly through the rebranded Tokyo IP Market: Adaptation & Remake. Previously known as the Tokyo Story Market, the three-year-old initiative brings together publishers holding rights to Japanese manga, novels and games. This year, its scope has been expanded to also include production companies holding remake rights.\u00a0  \tIn addition to the IP focus, TIFFCOM\u2019s seminar line-up includes sections dedicated to international co-production, animation, Asian films and series and Japanese TV.\u00a0  \tTIFFCOM managing director Kaori Ikeda explains that the market will be exploring co-productions between Japan and both Southeast Asia and Italy this year. \u201cWe see many promising projects emerging from Southeast Asian filmmakers and sense a growing expectation for co-production with Japan,\u201d Ikeda says.\u00a0  \tThat potential will be explored through a seminar with speakers including Thai filmmakers Pen-ek Ratanaruang and Soros Sukhum, Indonesian producers Shanty Harmayn and Christian Imanuell and Italian producer Stefano Centini, who co-produced Ratanaruang\u2019s Morte Cucina. Yoonhee Choi, CEO of Korea\u2019s Barunson E&A (Parasite), and Japanese producer Shinya Kawai will also discuss the potential for regional co-production.\u00a0  \tJapan signed an official co-production agreement with Italy last year and a session hosted by Japan\u2019s Yomiuri TV will focus on animated series Pino & Shinoby, which it recently co-produced with Italian animation outfit Studio Bozzetto.\u00a0\u00a0  \t\u201cSeveral productions are now underway under the Japan-Italy co-production agreement, with one project close to completion,\u201d Ikeda says.  \t\u201cUntil recently, Italy had rarely been a partner in Japan\u2019s international co-productions, so seeing such an immediate response clearly demonstrates the significance of the agreement. The opening of this new door to co-productions with Europe not only expands funding opportunities for filmmakers but also enhances creative diversity.\u201d\u00a0  \tItaly is also a focus of this year\u2019s Tokyo Gap Financing Market (TGFM), which will present three Italian projects selected\u00a0through Cinecitta and the Directorate General for Cinema of Italy\u2019s Ministry of Culture.\u00a0  \tIn total, TGFM will present 23 projects, including several from Southeast Asia, such as Four Seasons In Java from Indonesia\u2019s Kamila Andini; 1982 from Vietnam\u2019s Diep Nguyen Hoang; and two projects from the Philippines \u2013 Filipinana directed by Rafael Manuel and Hum, directed by Don Josephus Raphael Eblahan and produced by Alemberg Ang.  \t           \tLast year\u2019s TGFM projects included Pen-ek\u2019s Morte Cucina, which is playing in this year\u2019s TIFF competition, and Mariko Tetsuya\u2019s Dear Stranger, a co-production between Japan, France, U.S. and UK, which played in Busan and will screen at TIFF in the Nippon Cinema Now section.\u00a0  \tMeanwhile, TIFFCOM\u2019s seminar line-up will also include sessions on animation with speakers including Shrek The Third and Monster Hunt director Raman Hui and Samuel Choy, general manger of Hong Kong\u2019s Bliss Concepts, which produced the popular McDull franchise.\u00a0  \tIn addition, Japanese broadcasters including TBS, Nippon TV, NHK, Asahi Television and Wowow will discuss their international expansion strategies, while other sessions will focus on Turkish remakes, Thailand\u2019s BL and GL series, and China\u2019s increasingly popular drama series production.\u00a0  \tThe Motion Picture Association is hosting a seminar to discuss Japan\u2019s film policy with Elvis producer Schuyler Weiss, Shogun producer Eriko Miyagawa, Living Films\u2019 Apinat \u2018Ob\u2019 Siricharoenjit and Film Solutions\u2019 Junko Kusunoki.\u00a0  \tTIFFCOM is taking place October 29 to 31 at the Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Trade Center in Hamamatsucho district, which is just a few train stops away from Tokyo International Film Festival\u2019s main venues in Hibiya-Ginza.

Consider the following information: While we prefer to purchase dips if the fundamentals align \u2013 for PYPL, see Buy or Sell PYPL Stock \u2013 we remain cautious of falling knives. Specifically, it\u2019s important to consider if conditions worsen and PYPL declines another 20-30% to the $46 range, will we be able to maintain our position in the stock? What is the worst-case scenario? We refer to this as downturn resilience. It turns out the stock experienced an impact slightly worse than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We evaluate this based on (a) the extent of the stock's decline and, (b) the speed of its recovery.  PYPL stock has recently dropped significantly, and we currently find it appealing. While this may appear to be a chance to buy, there is considerable risk in depending on a single stock. Conversely, there is substantial value in the more diversified strategy we adopt with Trefis High Quality Portfolio.

Recently, he took to X to encourage such BNB treasury firms to utilize the service of third-party custodians for their holdings.     His statement comes as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) become a hot topic in the crypto industry. All DAT companies should use 3rd party crypto custodians with account setup audited by investors. This is a prerequisite for any @yzilabs investments in any #BNB DATs. https:\/\/t.co\/POsFWZqoJG \u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 BNB (@cz_binance) October 17, 2025  In the last few months, several traditional institutions have tilted towards maintaining a crypto-based treasury. However, the hype and adoption came with increased risks, and this has caused many enthusiasts to begin to raise questions about transparency and safety. CZ\u2019s call for safeguards and accountability across DAT comes from these concerns. The conversation began with concerns that QMMM, a crypto treasury firm, might have vanished with investors\u2019 funds. \u7b2c\u4e00\u5bb6\u8dd1\u8def\u7684\u5fae\u7b56\u7565\u516c\u53f8\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u3002 \u66fe\u8ba1\u5212\u62df\u65a5 1 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb BTC\u3001ETH\u3001SOL \u50a8\u5907\u7684\u7f8e\u80a1\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8 QMMM\uff0c\u5728\u5b98\u5ba3\u540e\u80a1\u4ef7\u66fe\u4e00\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6da8 9.6 \u500d\uff0c\u540e\u88ab SEC \u6307\u63a7\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u64cd\u7eb5\u80a1\u4ef7\u3002 \u6839\u636e\u8d22\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\uff0cQMMM \u6240\u5728\u7684\u9999\u6e2f\u6d77\u666f\u5927\u53a6\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f7b\u5e95\u4eba\u53bb\u697c\u7a7a\uff0c\u7591\u4f3c\u5173\u95ed\u548c\u8dd1\u8def\u3002 pic.twitter.com\/F0JRHKqVIS \u2014 AB Kuai.Dong (@_FORAB) October 17, 2025  According to AB Kuai Dong on X, the U.S.-listed firm had announced plans to invest $100 million in Bitcoin       BTC $106 414    24h volatility: 1.6%   Market cap: $2.12 T    Vol. 24h: $94.72 B    \t, Ethereum       ETH $3 826    24h volatility: 2.0%   Market cap: $462.74 B    Vol. 24h: $52.83 B    \t, and Solana       SOL $182.2    24h volatility: 1.7%   Market cap: $99.58 B    Vol. 24h: $10.24 B    \t, and its stock price shot up to 9.6 times after the news. Not too long after, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claimed that QMMM manipulated its stock using social media. As it stands, its Hong Kong office is now reportedly empty. Fears have risen, likely due to the absence of a separate custodian. CZ advises all DAT firms to use a trusted third-party crypto custodian. He also encouraged them to have their accounts audited by investors. While he sounded this advice to companies, CZ explicitly stated that this will now be a mandatory step for any BNB DAT project looking to secure investment from YZi Labs. This further highlights his commitment to promoting transparency in the cryptocurrency sector. One of the companies that recently attempted to establish its BNB treasury is China Renaissance Holdings. This Beijing-based investment bank is working on raising around $600 million for a new BNB treasury company. Some sources claimed that YZi Labs and China Renaissance will contribute $200 million to the deal, with the bank committing around $100 million of that amount. Also, Applied DNA Sciences secured up to $58 million for a BNB treasury strategy through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering.
