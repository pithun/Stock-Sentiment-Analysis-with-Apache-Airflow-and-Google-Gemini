{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"A cryptocurrency promoted in January by US first lady Melania Trump was part of a sophisticated fraud that \u201cleveraged celebrity association and \u2018borrowed fame\u2019 to sell legitimacy to unsuspecting investors,\u201d a new legal filing has alleged. In April, crypto investors brought a federal class action lawsuit against Benjamin Chow, cofounder of crypto exchange Meteora, and Hayden Davis, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Kelsier Labs, among other defendants, accusing them of a multimillion-dollar fraud involving a single memecoin, $M3M3. Later, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, expanding the allegations to include racketeering activity. They claimed the pair had colluded to rig the market for $LIBRA, a coin promoted by Javier Milei, president of Argentina, which collapsed in value shortly after launch. On Tuesday, the plaintiffs sought the court\u2019s permission to file yet another amended complaint, based on alleged information provided by an anonymous whistleblower. With Chow acting as the \u201ccommander,\u201d the pair launched, pumped, and dumped at least 15 crypto coins, the proposed second amended complaint alleges, including $MELANIA. The scheme allegedly inflicted millions of dollars in losses on unwitting investors. Trump, who is not a named defendant in the lawsuit, was used as \u201cwindow dressing for a crime engineered by Meteora and Kelsier,\u201d the proposed second amended complaint alleges. The filing further states that the plaintiffs do not allege that Trump or Milei \u201coperated the scheme.\u201d \u201cThis case could clarify basic expectations for token launches and disclosures in the US. We understand many across the crypto industry and regulatory community are following closely,\u201d says Max Burwick, senior managing partner at Burwick Law, the law firm representing the plaintiffs. The White House, Chow, and Davis did not respond immediately to requests for comment. By the time Chow and Davis launched $MELANIA in January, they had refined a \u201crepeatable six-step \u2018playbook\u2019 for pump-and-dump fraud,\u201d the investors claim. According to the proposed second amended complaint, Meteora controls the technical infrastructure, while Kelsier supplies the necessary capital and orchestrates the promotional campaign, leaning heavily on credibility borrowed from public figures or brands. Together, the filing alleges, they effectively control a network of \u201csniper\u201d crypto wallets that snatch up large quantities of the coins at artificially discounted prices, then dump them on the market as regular investors pile in. \u201cGoing to try to tell all my buddies early,\u201d Davis told an acquaintance prior to the $MELANIA launch, in a private exchange that features in redacted form as an exhibit in the lawsuit. \u201cI\u2019m about to launch the biggest token ever lol.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear whether Davis was allegedly referring to $MELANIA or $LIBRA.) Before launch, Davis prepared a carefully coordinated marketing campaign for $MELANIA, recruiting a network of paid crypto influencers to synchronously flood social media platforms with promotional messaging, the proposed second amended complaint alleges. The filing claims the influencers pitched the coin as \u201cfair launch\u201d and \u201ccommunity-led.\u201d In the hours after public trading began, as hype set in and investors rushed to purchase $MELANIA, the price of the coin increased twelve-fold. The coin had a paper value of $1.6 billion at its height. It has since lost 95 percent of its peak value. \u201cInvestors reasonably interpreted the use of Melania Trump\u2019s name and likeness as evidence of legitimacy and due diligence\u2014trusting that no one of her stature would knowingly associate with a fraudulent venture,\u201d the proposed second amended complaint claims. But prior to launch, wallets controlled by Meteora and Kelsier had allegedly accumulated almost a third of the entire $MELANIA supply. \u201cInsiders had already cornered the market before a single public buyer could act,\u201d the proposed filing claims. As the $MELANIA price climbed, the insider wallets began to sell, earning millions of dollars within hours of launch, according to the proposed second amended complaint. The large sales caused the price to collapse, inflicting steep losses on the regular people who had bought in. Though the complaint does not allege any wrongdoing on the part of Trump, her family has been criticized heavily for its many and various forays into the crypto industry, which critics have cast as a glaring conflict of interest. The Financial Times recently estimated that the Trump family had earned more than $1 billion from its crypto pursuits in the period since Donald Trump was reelected as US president. \u201cThe misuse of Melania Trump\u2019s name magnified the harm,\u201d the proposed second amended complaint alleges. \u201cIt corrupted public trust and injected an element of political and cultural credibility into what was, in reality, a standard pump-and-dump.\u201d In your inbox: Will Knight's AI Lab explores advances in AI Why power bills are surging Big Story: Peter Thiel\u2019s Antichrist obsession Anthropic\u2019s plan to keep its AI from building a nuclear weapon Livestream: Are hybrids all hype?

Netflix's quarter \u2014 and stock price \u2014 was dragged down by a hefty $619 million tax-related expense that took Wall Street by surprise. Netflix otherwise had another standout quarter, notching record revenue fueled by robust viewership for Korean-themed megahits like \"Kpop Demon Hunters\" and \"Squid Game,\" as well as its live boxing event, \"Canelo vs. Crawford.\" Netflix's revenue rose 17.2% to a record $11.5 billion in the third quarter, largely in line with expectations from analysts and the company's guidance. The company said its ad tier, a key growth area for the streamer, had its \"best ad sales quarter ever\" and doubled commitments from US advertisers. The stock sank 6% in after-hours trading following the release after its earnings per share significantly missed expectations. The streaming titan's operating income was up 7.7% year-over-year to $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, which was well under analyst estimates of $6.94 and Netflix's guidance of $6.87. Netflix said that the miss on operating income and margins came after an \"ongoing dispute\" with Brazilian tax authorities that cost it $619 million. Netflix finance chief Spencer Neumann said on the earnings call that the company accounted for expenses it incurred from 2022 through last quarter, after determining that it would likely be subject to a 10% transactions tax in Brazil following a ruling from the country's high court in August in a case involving another firm. \"Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q3'25 operating margin forecast,\" Netflix said in its shareholder letter. While Netflix's bottom-line miss wasn't in its third-quarter forecast, the company had disclosed in its second-quarter 10-Q filing that it was \"involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding nonincome tax assessments.\" Netflix had said that although a loss was \"not probable,\" it warned \"the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.\" \"We don't expect this matter to have a material impact on future results,\" Netflix wrote in its third-quarter release after disclosing the expense. Netflix has faced questions of whether it could be a suitor for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has said it's planning to split itself next year. Paramount CEO David Ellison is reportedly planning to bid on all of WBD, which said on Tuesday that it's open to the sale of the entire company or parts of it, and has received interest from multiple interested parties. That includes Netflix and Comcast, CNBC and Bloomberg reported. Asked about M&A, Netflix executives didn't directly address those reports, nor did they hint at a deal in the works. \"It's true that historically, we've been more builders than buyers. And we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the earnings call. He added that \"nothing is a 'must-have'\" for the company to hit its goals. However, Sarandos didn't rule out future transactions via \"selective M&A,\" either. When evaluating potential M&A, Netflix looks at factors including whether the investment is \"a big opportunity,\" Sarandos added. \"We can be \u2014 and we will be \u2014 choosy,\" Sarandos added. When asked about AI, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the company's view of the technology hasn't changed much, and that it's planning to use AI tools to improve its product, content, and advertising. As for whether generative AI apps like OpenAI's Sora 2 are a threat, Sarandos said they're more likely to take viewership away from apps focused on user-generated content, which include TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Sarandos suggested that Netflix's professionally produced content is less at risk. \"It takes a great artist to make something great,\" Sarandos said. Netflix's robust revenue growth suggests that its never-ending mission to improve engagement is working. Despite stiff competition from YouTube, content creators, and AI-powered video apps like Sora, Netflix had its best-ever quarter of viewership on US-based smart TVs, according to Nielsen data dating back to May 2021. Nielsen found that Netflix averaged an 8.6% viewership share from July through September \u2014 far higher than any other paid streaming service. However, Netflix is still well behind YouTube in engagement. The Google-owned streamer averaged an enviable 13% viewership share on smart TVs in the third quarter, per Nielsen. Netflix is trying to close the gap with likely its biggest rival by adding video podcasts and luring YouTubers like Ms. Rachel. Some Wall Street analysts believe the streaming powerhouse should go even further by investing in short-form video.

You don\u2019t need to be training for the New York Marathon to benefit from a GPS running watch that understands your fitness level. Most people just want to run a few miles without guessing their pace, track progress over time and maybe figure out why some runs feel easier than others. The Garmin Forerunner 55 handles all of that without the overwhelming feature bloat of flagship models, and Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $169, down from its usual $199 price. See at Amazon The core appeal lies in how this watch removes the mental load from running: You lace up, press start and the GPS tracks your route while the optical heart rate sensor monitors your effort level. After the run, you get clear feedback on distance covered, average pace per mile, heart rate zones throughout the workout, and total elevation gain if you tackled any hills. This data accumulates over weeks and months and reveals patterns that help you understand what\u2019s actually improving versus what just feels different on any given day. Smartwatch battery life usually means charging every night or every other day, and turn your fitness tracker into another device competing for outlet space. The Forerunner 55 runs for two full weeks in normal smartwatch mode, displaying time, notifications and daily stats without needing a charge. Switch to GPS mode for tracking runs and you get 20 hours of continuous recording which is enough for multiple marathons back-to-back if you were so inclined. PacePro is worthy of coverage because it answers a common race-morning headache for runners. It can be set with a desired finish time for a certain distance, after which it works out precisely what your pace through every part of a course must be. If it\u2019s a hilly course, it even makes automatic adjustments for you, urging you to ease off on ascents and accelerate on downhills in order to reach your total time target. Each day\u2019s recommendations come on to the watch screen in the morning from Garmin\u2019s algorithms based on your last few sessions of training, your current level of fitness, and your recovery condition. It\u2019s not boilerplate \u201crun 3 miles today\u201d recommendations. The system may suggest interval sessions if you\u2019ve been running continuously through the week, for example, or recommend a gentle recovery jog if yesterday\u2019s tempo run was especially strenuous. Each recommendation includes bespoke aims for duration, pace, and heart rate ranges, which is basically like your own coach that is tailored to how your body is reacting to training. The activity library goes well beyond running: There is cycling, track running, virtual treadmill run, pool swim, Pilates, HIIT, breathwork with specific tracking modes that retain suitable metrics for that specific type of activity. Pool swim mode automatically tracks strokes and number of laps while HIIT tracks work as well as intervals of rest. The watch can therefore be worn through the whole calendar year even as running becomes secondary through seasons or when cross-training is dictated due to injuries. Wellness features run continuously in the background and tracks stress levels through heart rate variability, monitoring respiration rate throughout the day, and calculates your fitness age based on activity patterns and VO2 max estimates. The Body Battery metric deserves special mention because it quantifies energy levels on a 0-100 scale, helping you understand when you\u2019re actually recovered enough for hard training versus when you should take it easy. The Connect IQ Store opens up customization so that you can switch up the watch face, add data fields that expose exactly the measurements you are concerned with when running, and third-party apps that increase functionality. You can add a weather app, load training plans from specific coaches, or load in data pages that are optimized for triathlon training in case your interests are elsewhere than running. At $169, that\u2019s cheaper than most fashion smartwatches with a fraction of the fitness tracking ability. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Wiring outdoor security cameras means drilling through walls, fishing cables through attics, hiring electricians and accepting permanent placement decisions you\u2019ll regret six months later when you realize the angle is wrong. The Eufy security SoloCam S220 solves all of that with a completely wireless design powered by a built-in solar panel that keeps itself charged indefinitely. Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $59 after applying both the automatic 35% discount and an additional on-page coupon, down from its usual $99 price. For homeowners tired of package thieves, this represents the easiest path to outdoor surveillance that actually works. See at Amazon The solar charging eliminates the largest headache with wireless cameras: battery anxiety. Older battery-powered wireless cameras must be recharged every few weeks or even months, requiring you to pull out ladders and break up coverage precisely when coverage is needed most. The unit power is fueled with only three hours of sunlight per day to keep it fully charged indefinitely. The built-in solar panel is flush-mounted on top of the camera enclosure so that no separate panel is needed to be mounted and no wires are needed to be run between modules. Even during short winter days when sunlight is scarce, the capacity of the battery reserves is enough to sustain recording through several weeks\u2019 worth of cloudiness without maintenance. Video resolution is a direct factor in whether content is functional or simply for ornamentation\u2019s sake. The 2K resolution used here equates to 2304 x 1296 pixels, much clearer than 1080p standard-resolution cameras which top out at 1920 x 1080. The increased resolution means you can indeed read license plates from 20 feet distant or make out facial features well enough for police purposes. The f\/1.6 aperture owes more to image quality than most spec sheets describe. Aperture determines how much light reaches the sensor, with lower numbers meaning more light reaches it. An f\/1.6 specification is outstanding for security webcams, which are usually around f\/2.0 or larger. This larger aperture paired with infrared LEDs provides valuable night vision that reveals detail in almost complete darkness. The AI detection system differentiates this from ordinary motion-activated cameras that buzz your phone every time a leaf moves by. The onboard processor interprets patterns of movement to differentiate humans from animals, cars, and natural movement such as swaying branches. You are only alerted when real people come into view, minimizing notification fatigue significantly. The camera is connected to Eufy\u2019s HomeBase 3 hub for advanced facial tracking that can distinguish between your family members, regular package deliverers, and unfamiliar guests, although the camera operates fully without the hub on standard human detection. Installation requires approximately 15 minutes overall. The miniature housing is approximately 3 inches in diameter, small enough to be installed inconspically under eaves or on fence posts without appearing to be overt surveillance gear. Since it\u2019s wire-free, you drill a single mounting hole, place the supplied anchor, and twist on the camera itself. The magnetic base lets you make angle adjustments without tools so that you can tweak your view after reviewing initial coverage. Both discounts applied at $59 means you are paying well under many indoor cams but receive weatherproof build rated for outdoor use, solar charging which means no maintenance needed, and AI detection that works.

LEGO released its 2025 Advent calendars just a few weeks ago, and they\u2019re already vanishing from Amazon\u2019s shelves at an alarming rate. The Lego City calendar is completely sold out, Minecraft has disappeared\u00c2\u00a0and most other themes have either limited stock or inflated prices. Surprisingly, the Lego Friends Advent Calendar remains available and has dropped to an all-time low of $20, down from its original $34 price. For parents trying to stretch holiday budgets while keeping the magic alive through December, this is one of those deals that won\u2019t last long once word gets out. See at Amazon Advent calendars solve a specific parenting challenge every December: Kids need something to channel their excitement during those long weeks leading up to Christmas, and a daily surprise keeps them engaged without the sugar overload of chocolate-filled alternatives. This\u00c2\u00a0set delivers 237 pieces spread across 24 doors, giving children aged six and up a new building project each morning. LEGO recently rebranded the Friends theme with greater emphasis on varied storytelling and everyday situations that children are more likely to connect with. This 2025 calendar shows that transition with a holiday sleepover theme that seems more down to earth than releases from earlier years. The package contains five mini-dolls: Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo\u00c2\u00a0who come with sleeping mats that complete a whole indoor campout setup. The choice of characters reflects varied personality types and interests so that children may enter the narrative on several different levels. The animal companions add another layer of play value: Two dogs, a guinea pig, a gecko, and a cat come with their own accessories like food stations, water dispensers, scratching posts and pet beds. Each animal\u2019s accessories are scaled to match the mini-doll world so kids can actually integrate them into ongoing play scenarios beyond December. The day-by-day builds range from tiny accessories in early December to larger interactive pieces as we build up to Christmas. Early dates may open with wrapped gift boxes or a table lamp, while later dates open up the fireplace with flame elements, a working sled with space for a minidoll, and a life-sized LEGO reindeer figure. The karaoke machine features a microphone piece that is compatible with a minidoll\u2019s hand, and the hot chocolate stand includes mugs proportionate to the figures. The scene-building potential extends well past December 25th. The sofa seats two minidolls comfortably, the Christmas tree comes with decorative elements that can be rearranged, and the hobbyhorse has a spring mechanism built into its base. These aren\u2019t single-use holiday decorations. They become permanent additions to any existing LEGO Friends collection, compatible with playsets like the Heartlake City buildings and vehicles sold separately. At $20, this calendar is cheaper than several single LEGO Friends expansion packs while offering more variety. The retail price of $34 already offered good value compared to purchasing single blind bags or accessory packs over the course of the year.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spotted Hagrid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hut, Hogwarts Castle, and Aragog in the Forbidden Forest dropping in prices previously. But today, things are taking an even more magical turn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 straight into the dungeons. Amazon is being generous with a 35% discount on the Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class Building set, offering it for just $26. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice $14 discount on a set that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fit beautifully into your current Harry Potter Lego setup, and even make a memorable gift for a fan in your family or friends. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no word on how long the discount will last, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to grab it sooner rather than later. See at Amazon This set lets you recreate Professor Severus Snape\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lessons in his dungeon classroom. It comes with 397 pieces, and includes a blackboard, potion bottles, ingredient jars, shelves, and all the other elements you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to bring the setup to life. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also get four minifigures; a very angry Severus Snape (not even surprised), Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, and Seamus Finnigan. We would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve loved to see a confused Ron or Malfoy up to some mischief, but this lineup works just fine too. The set also includes two randomly selected collectible Hogwarts portraits. These are part of a larger collection of 14, and can be a valuable addition to your collection if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got one. As with all Lego sets, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a step-by-step instruction book that walks you through the entire build. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty easy to follow, even for kids who are building for the first time, but if you need more help, we recommend installing the Lego Builder app. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get 3D instructions, so you can view every step from all angles to get a better idea. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuild Together\u00e2\u0080\u009d mode, which is great for when multiple people are working on the same set. Plus, you can keep track of your progress, and see all your Lego projects in one place. All in all, this set offers a great chance to relive a classic Harry Potter moment, and bring your favorite characters home. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made for ages 8 and up, but you can also treat yourself to it (no judgements), or gift it to a Wizarding World fan in your life.

If the dollars are not adding up, don\u2019t worry: Later this year, many SUVs are set to take significant dips in their sticker price. GOBankingRates did a round of up of four SUVs that will have massive price drops in late 2025. Ruth Calkins, general manager and auto expert at Findbyplate, described how the Jaguar F-Pace will likely have big price drops in the last quarter of 2025 due to reasons like dealerships offering discounts to clear inventory to ensure enough room for new models as the model year comes to a close. \u201cThe intense competition in the luxury SUV market also increases the chances of this SUV experiencing a big price drop,\u201d noted Calkins. \u201cPlus, with Jaguar\u2019s intentions to transition to an all-electric lineup, to gather the support of consumers, the brand would likely offer discounts on their gasoline-powered models, which would result in massive price drops for the F-Pace around the last quarter of 2025.\u201d Discover More: 5 Luxury SUVs That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Fall 2025 According to Dale Gillespie, an auto expert and the COO of DirectKia, the Mercedes-Benz GLA is losing market appeal because buyer interest is shifting toward electric vehicles. \u201cPrices are being slashed by up to 10% of retail price and leading to tens of thousands in rebates. With a better model set to be released next year, dealers are incentivized to lose the older stock,\u201d Gillespie explained. Gillespie highlighted how the base Premium trim, which carries a market value of about $60,500 could see up to $5,000 removed from its price in the last part of 2025. In Calkins professional estimations, the Range Rover Sports is another SUV that will likely see a big price drop during the next quarter. \u201cIncreased market competition and plan to clear inventory are likely not going to be the only reasons for this big price drop, other factors that will influence this price drop in the last quarter of 2025 will include, potential upcoming facilities and updates in the latest model, and global economic factors like economic fluctuation,\u201d explained Calkins. Gillespie described how the BMW iX electric SUV, initially priced at around $80,000 earlier this year, has seen notable depreciation due to the stiff competition among electric vehicles. \u201cIn fact, there has been as much as a $51,000 loss of value over a five-year period,\u201d commented Gillespie. \u201cWith no other choice, dealers are responding with aggressive incentives, making it an opportune time to score some solid discounts.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: Photos are for representational purposes only.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"The original Stream Deck was a purpose-built device to make it easier to manage a live video stream on the fly. Since its release, many other similar products have hit the market. Among them is the Ulanzi D200 U-Studio, which is proving popular with hackers for good reason. [Rodrigo Laneth] has been digging into the D200, and found out it\u2019s running Linux 5.10.160 on a quad-core Rockchip RK3308HS chip. Notably, he determined the kernel appears to be from Android, but that Ulanzi removed the Android userspace and \u201cslapped Buildroot on top,\u201d in his own words. Interesting, if not that unusual. What\u00a0is key, however, is that the device has a fully open adb root shell, as noted by [lucasteske], which inspired [Rodrigo]\u2019s investigation. This pretty much allows full access to the device, so you can make it do whatever weird thing your heart desires. As you might expect, people are already making the D200 do fun stuff. [lucasteske] got it running DOOM in short order. Meanwhile, [Rodrigo] has it playing out Bad Apple!! at 30 FPS, with code and a deeper explanation available on GitHub. It\u2019s rare these days that manufacturers leave root open on any commercial device. You normally need to pull a few tricks to get that kind of access.   A post shared by Lucas Teske (@racerxdl)  At the driver-level I wonder whether it treats each button as a separate LCD screen, or one large one? I.E. does doom just \u201cwork\u201d spread across all the button screens or did they have to coalesce the output? It makes me realize I could DIY a cheap stream deck by taking a 7\u2033 touchscreen and putting it inside a 3d printed case with cut-outs for the \u201cbuttons\u201d. Spoiler, but there are several like that around. I\u2019d not be at all surprised if this was the same. https:\/\/bitfocus.io\/companion You can and I have, just minus the 3d printed enclosure as there\u2019s really no need for it.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"                 reading time 2 minutes        Google has suffered from plenty of bugs over the years but the vast majority of them have been of the digital variety. Now, however, one of the company\u2019s New York offices is apparently suffering from an infestation of real bugs\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know, insects, creepy crawlers, God\u2019s punishment for the wicked, etc. Specifically, the tech giant\u2019s building appears to have recently been overrun by every New Yorker\u2019s greatest fear: bed bugs. That news comes from Wired, which managed to get ahold of an internal email testifying to the dreaded bugs\u2019 presence within the company\u2019s walls at its Manhattan campus. The email, which was sent Sunday, was shared with Gizmodo by a Google representative when we asked for comment. Google has already paid a team to take care of the plague, it seems. The email says: Our REWS team was recently informed of a possible bed bug issue at our Chelsea campus. Today, exterminators inspected the NYC-9TH, Chelsea Market, 8510, and Pier 57 buildings with a sniffer dog\u00c2\u00a0and found credible evidence of their presence.\u00c2\u00a0Initial treatment has been completed on the affected floors of the Chelsea campus and our Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) team will directly notify individuals in impacted areas. Worse still, it appears that a menagerie of stuffed animals at the office may have been the ground zero for the outbreak: Sources tell WIRED that Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offices in New York are home to a number of large stuffed animals that are rumored to be implicated in the outbreak. WIRED was not able to verify this information prior to publication. Google declined to comment. A Google representative told Gizmodo that workers were allowed to return to the impacted office on Monday, although the company is apparently carrying out inspections at its other offices throughout the city. Bed bugs have been a persistent problem for the Big Apple, and everybody knows what a destabilizing impact an infestation can have. It\u2019s probably a bit of a shock to the Google crowd who, according to Google\u2019s past news coverage and that Owen Wilson movie, are supposed to be some of the happiest workers on the planet. While bed bugs are not known to carry diseases, they\u2019re still incredibly gross. They feed on blood, and, as a result, they often leave blood stains on the sheets of the bed in which they live. Luckily,\u00c2\u00a0the threat of the bugs seems to have gone down in recent years. A recent report from pest control company Orkin shows New York has declined in the list of places most at-risk for such infestations.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"                 reading time 2 minutes        Warner Bros. Discovery is the latest media conglomerate to go up for sale. The company, which owns HBO, the Warner Bros. movie studio, and several cable channels, announced on Tuesday that it is reviewing a variety of offers to sell the company. It said it would consider these bids as it moves forward with previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studio business from its struggling cable channels. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u2019s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Zaslav, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, in a press release. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All options appear to be on the table, including a sale of the entire company or separate deals for its streaming\/studio division and its cable channel business. The move could totally reshape Hollywood and continue the trend of media consolidation into a frighteningly small number of hands. Just this year, Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, MTV, and Paramount Studios, completed its merger with Skydance Media. And it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that long ago, 2019, when Disney acquired its longtime rival, 20th Century Fox. It was also only in 2022 when then-WarnerMedia merged with Discovery to become Warner Bros. Discovery. That deal was pitched as a way for the two to become more competitive against conglomerates like Disney and Comcast, as well as streaming pioneer Netflix. But it seems like things haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone as initially planned. This June, the company announced it was splitting itself into two, with its streaming service and studios becoming Warner Bros. and the majority of its cable channels forming Discovery Global. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s streaming service has also undergone several rebrands, most recently settling on the HBO Max name. The company also announced today that it is raising prices for the service. The Wall Street Journal reported today that Warner Bros. Discovery rejected a second offer from Paramount this week. If the two companies were ever to reach a deal, it would put a lot of power in the hands of Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. As head of Paramount, Ellison currently controls CBS News, where he recently appointed The Free Press\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief. Under a deal with WBD, Ellison could also potentially gain control over the cable news network CNN. Comcast is reportedly interested as well, despite recently starting the process of spinning off its own cable channel business, according to The New York Times. For now, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear that Netflix is seriously considering a bid. Netflix Co-CEO Greg Peters recently shut down rumors that the streaming giant is seeking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Peters said earlier this month at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles, Deadline reported. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an amazing track record over time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Explore more on these topics      Share this story             Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"by Calculated Risk on 10\/21\/2025 11:31:00 AM  Catching up ...The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported the housing market index (HMI) was at 37, up from 32 last month.  Any number below 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as poor than good.  From the NAHB: Amid Market Challenges, Builder Expectations Rise in October Even as builders continue to grapple with market and macroeconomic uncertainty, sentiment levels posted a solid gain in October as future sales expectations surpassed the 50-point breakeven mark for the first time since last January.  Builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes was 37 in October, up five points from September and the highest reading since April, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)\/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.  \u201cWhile recent declines for mortgage rates are an encouraging sign for affordability conditions, the market remains challenging,\u201d said NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, a home builder and developer from Lexington, N.C. \u201cThe housing market has some areas with firm demand, including smaller builders shifting to remodeling and ongoing solid conditions for the luxury market. However, most home buyers are still on the sidelines, waiting for mortgage rates to move lower.\u201d  \u201cThe HMI gain in October is a positive signal for 2026 as our forecast is for single-family housing starts to gain ground next year,\u201d said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. \u201cThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell from just above 6.5% at the start of September to 6.3% in early October. Combined with anticipated further easing by the Fed, builders expect a slightly improving sales environment, albeit one in which persistent supply-side cost factors remain a challenge.\u201d  With the government shutdown continuing and an expectation of no Census housing construction data for September being published this week, Dietz noted the following: \u201cBased on modeling of historical data, the October increase for the HMI suggests an approximate 3% increase for the September single-family permit data on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis. Our model suggests a 2% to 4% range for the increase based on the statistical relationship.\u201d  In a sign of ongoing challenges for the housing market, the latest HMI survey also revealed that 38% of builders reported cutting prices in October. This share has alternated between 37% and 39% since June. Meanwhile, the average price reduction rose to 6% in October after averaging 5% for several months previously. The last time builders reduced prices by 6% was a year ago in October 2024. The use of sales incentives was 65% in October, unchanged from September.   ... All the HMI subindices rose in October. The component measuring current sales conditions increased four points to 38, the index gauging future sales jumped nine points to 54 and the gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers posted a four-point gain to 25.  Looking at the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast rose two points to 46, the Midwest was unchanged at 42, the South increased two points to 31 and the West gained two points to 28. emphasis added Click on graph for larger image.

Reviews ethics statement      Watching the NBA this season will be very different from previous years. Here's what you need to know.    The new NBA season is here and with it comes a new-look broadcast schedule. The 2025-26 season is the first under the NBA's new media-rights deal that marks an end of the NBA on TNT and the return of games on NBC. It also pushes the NBA into the streaming era with games appearing on Peacock and Prime Video each week of the season as well as\u00a0ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service. The good news for hoop heads is there are more national broadcasts to watch this year. The bad news? You'll need to subscribe to three streaming services to watch all of the games. Here's what you need to know about the new NBA media landscape and the best ways to watch games this season. Jalen Brunson and the New York Knicks will be part of a national broadcast, a league-high 34 times this season.\u00a0 This season is the first in the new 11-year deal between the NBA and its three media partners: Disney (ABC\/ESPN), NBCUniversal (NBC\/Peacock) and Amazon (Prime Video). There will be 247 national broadcasts across this trio this season, which far outpaces last season's 172 national games. Of course, last year you just needed a single live TV streaming service like Sling or YouTube TV that had ABC, ESPN and TNT for the national broadcasts each week of the season. Now, with exclusive Peacock games and the Prime Video slate, that one-streamer convenience is as outdated as the midrange jumpshot. Here's the breakdown of the national broadcasts: There will be a national NBA broadcast four nights a week all season long: Starting midseason after the NFL and college football seasons are over, the schedule will expand to every night of the week and weekend afternoons with these additions: One last item for NBA fans: the best studio show in sports, Inside the NBA, will make the jump from TNT to ESPN this season. The 21-time Emmy-award-winning show will still be filmed in its Atlanta studio and will still feature Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal and Kenny Smith. What has changed is the show's schedule. Instead of weekly broadcasts, Inside the NBA will take place more haphazardly around marquee regular-season matchups and Christmas Day games as well as during the playoffs for the conference finals and NBA finals. Led by league MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Oklahoma City Thunder are favorites to repeat as NBA champions entering the 2025-26 season. While you can watch many games on ABC, ESPN and NBC during the season with a cable TV or live TV streaming service, you'll miss out on the streaming-only games featured on Peacock and Prime Video.\u00a0 For full coverage, NBA fans will need to subscribe to a trio of streaming services: Peacock, Prime Video and ESPN for a combined total of $50 a month. (If you are already an Amazon Prime subscriber for the free, two-day shipping and view it as a sunk cost, then ESPN and Peacock would cost you $41 a month.) NBA games are back on NBC for the first time since 2002. NBC and Peacock will broadcast 100 regular-season games, including exclusive Peacock games on Monday nights, and the All-Star Game.\u00a0Doubleheaders will be shown on NBC and Peacock on Tuesday nights, with the earlier game shown on NBC in the Eastern and Central time zones and the later game shown on NBC in the Mountain and Pacific time zones. Starting on Feb. 1, NBC and Peacock will show NBA games on Sunday nights. You can stream every NBA broadcast on NBC with Peacock's $11-per-month Premium plan.\u00a0Read our Peacock review. There's nothing new about having NBA games on ABC and ESPN, but this season you can watch these games without cable TV or a live TV streaming service thanks to ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service. For NBA fans, an ESPN Unlimited subscription will let you watch 80 regular-season games -- that includes games shown on ESPN and ABC. It will show Wednesday night doubleheaders throughout the season before adding Friday night doubleheaders and Saturday night and Sunday afternoon games starting midseason. The ESPN Unlimited plan costs $30 a month (or $300 a year) and lets you stream all of ESPN's linear networks: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, ESPN Deportes, SEC Network and ACC Network. You also get access to programming on ESPN on ABC, ESPN Plus, ESPN3, SECN Plus and ACCNX.\u00a0Read our ESPN Unlimited review. (There's also a $13-a-month ESPN Select plan, which is basically a rebranding of ESPN Plus. With it, you'll have access to thousands of live games -- think small college conferences, whose games you can't watch anywhere else -- but not the NBA.) Prime Video will stream 66 regular-season games this season, mostly Friday night doubleheaders that will include the group rounds of the NBA Cup in-season tournament. It will also show knockout rounds and championship game of the NBA Cup as well as a Black Friday game and two global games in Europe (Jan. 15 in Berlin and Jan. 18 in London).\u00a0Also in January after the NFL and college football seasons are over, Prime Video's NBA schedule will expand to include games on Thursday nights and Saturday afternoons. Prime Video is included with an Amazon Prime subscription for $15 a month or $139 a year. You can also subscribe only to\u00a0Prime Video\u00a0for $9 a month.\u00a0Read our Prime Video review. If you are, say, a Celtics fan in Boston, a Knicks fan in New York or a Lakers fan in Los Angeles and care more about following your local team than watching national broadcasts, then you'll need to subscribe to a TV service that carries your team's regional sports network. Most RSNs are either part of the FanDuel Sports Network or NBC Sports Network. The two live TV streaming services with the most RSNs are DirecTV and Fubo.\u00a0 You can also subscribe to a FanDuel Sports Network RSN through Prime Video and an NBC Sports RSN via Peacock. Also, a handful of teams -- the Dallas Mavericks, Lakers, New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns, Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz -- offer an in-market streaming option\u00a0through NBA League Pass.\u00a0 Meanwhile,\u00a0NBA League Pass remains the pick for serious fans who want to be able watch every out-of-market game every night of the season. The basic plan with commercials costs $110 for the season. The premium plan costs $160 for the season and replaces commercials with the in-arena feed, adds the ability to download games and highlights for offline viewing and lets you watch on up to three devices at once.","label":0}

If we had been given the choice (which we weren't in the Puget Sound region) I'd have voted to defund SWAT and the purchase of military war toys entirely, and raise funding for local community policing and have officers who actually walk a beat again.  Oh, and get rid of the frelling Israeli contract trainers teaching cops to respond to any resistance with overwhelming violence.

YMMV You do know that prison was closed because it was incredibly expensive to operate. No? Ignorance is bliss I guess. It was not. Basically the self-professed right wing \"party of law and order\" decided to slash the budget for the police and justice system. Also don't forget that the MET are also useless dickbags who would rather mass arrest grannies holding signs because it's easy than arrest criminals that actually matter. No, they aren't obliged to, other police forces have chosen not to. Every experience from the MET has been neutral, mediocre or just plain bad. I've actually seen Simpsons level shit play out before my eyes in real time. But the main fault lies with the right wing Tory party.   so this should be fixed ricky ticky, no?  The Tories slashed spending, and eviscerated investment at a time of record low interest rates, shat on the economy with Brexit, then did it again with Truss then made a bunch of unfunded legislation as their last \"fuck you\" act in parliament before losing the election. It's going to take decades to fix a mess that was decades in the making. It might not really be fixable. Not all Tory messes are.

Frankly I have a difficult time believing even half the price of a brand new phone for a used phone regardless of provenance, unless the stolen phones lack Chinese government spyware or unless the Chinese government heavily restricts the purchase of phones to the point that getting a new device is next to impossible. China probably has the eSIM configuration tool. Heck, half of our shopping mall phone kiosks have it too. Cop math. Like when they would claim a single weed plant was $100,000 in street value. Because your stolen phone isn't the manufacturer's problem. It just needs you to buy a new phone. I have yet to see an \"Apple feature\" on my wife's iToy which wasn't more of an obstruction than a useful tool, much less one that we would consider \"essential\".  Hell, I just wish the frelling thing would keep the \"Don't synch with iCloud\" setting that we have to reset every six weeks or so, every time she starts getting spammed with \"iCloud out of storage, buy more\" we know that we have to redo the setting and delete everything from the stupid cloud account yet again. I can see several potential explanations: 1) Chinese people can factory-reset iphones through accomplices who have access to original Apple tools and software from the Apple factory in China;2) The network is hermetic and there is no connection between the Apple user accounts used in China and elsewhere;3) Apple does not want to interfere with an accepted practice in China implicitly approved by the CCP. (They saw what happened to NVidia.)  The phones sell for up to $5,000 in China because Chinese network providers do not subscribe to the international blacklist for stolen devices.Kind of ironic in a country that makes the darn things.

Epiminds, a marketing tech startup, is betting that AI can help marketers get more done. Founded by Elias Malm (ex-Google) and Mo Elkhidir (ex-Spotify) in 2025, the Swedish startup recently raised a $6.6 million seed investment led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from European funds EWOR and Entourage. \"What we are building is an operating system for marketing,\" Malm told Business Insider in an interview. \"An independent third-party player that can do what's best for companies, best for agencies.\" Epiminds' core technology is an AI-powered bot called \"Lucy\" that deploys over 20 autonomous \"agents\" to help with tasks like analyzing ad performance data, planning marketing campaigns, and then publishing those paid ads. Marketers can email Lucy directly and request services, such as data reports. They can also dig deeper into those reports by asking Lucy additional questions. Then, if Lucy has recommendations, marketers can allow Lucy to draft a new campaign and publish to platforms like Google Ads or Meta Ads, Elkhidir said. Epiminds' founders don't see AI necessarily replacing the work of human marketers. Instead, Lucy is positioned as a \"senior colleague,\" Malm said. \"We think that agentic AI can make agencies work with more clients, more companies, and make it easily accessible,\" Malm said. \"We don't want to replace anyone. We want to empower people to be able to do more and maybe spend time on the things that they should spend time on, like close with clients, strategy, creativity.\" The startup says it is working with about 20 performance marketing agencies across the Nordic region, the Netherlands, and the US. Marketers can customize Epiminds' agentic agents to an agency's strategy and needs. The startup uses several off-the-shelf LLM models from Google's Gemini to OpenAI. Malm said it also has a \"proprietary framework\" for processing large amounts of data and its multi-agentic tools that are \"adapted for marketing.\" \"The only thing that we're missing in our system now that we don't support yet, but we're going to do very soon, is the creative image generation itself,\" Elkhidir said. Epiminds is still testing out pricing and charges agencies per user. The company declined to share the cost of access. The company plans to use its recent funding to hire staff \u2014 currently it's just Malm and Elkhidir \u2014 and expand into more markets. While automating elements of the marketing workflow isn't novel, Epiminds is one of many new AI tools (and startups) aiming to further automate the process.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rocket Lab stock (NASDAQ: RKLB) has seen a rapid appreciation, jumping 41% over the past month to a current trading price of $67. This surge is likely fueled by several positive developments: improved analyst ratings, higher price targets, and new or expanded launch contracts with Japanese clients. A significant factor is the growing consensus among analysts who now see Rocket Lab as a serious, publicly traded competitor to SpaceX. Despite these strong operational tailwinds and the company\u2019s solid long-term prospects, our machine-driven multi-factor assessment suggests reducing exposure to RKLB stock may be prudent. Our primary concern stems from the stock\u2019s Very High valuation. While Rocket Lab boasts a Strong overall operating performance and financial condition, the recent rapid run-up appears to have factored in most of the near-term positive news. Consequently, the stock is currently deemed Relatively Expensive. Below is our assessment: RKLB stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. Consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark\u2014a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors but before that, for quick background: With $35 Bil in market cap, Rocket Lab provides launch services and space systems solutions, designing and manufacturing small orbital launch vehicles and satellite platforms for commercial, aerospace, and government customers. This table highlights how RKLB is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Valuation Ratios This table highlights how RKLB is growing vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Revenue Comparison This table highlights how RKLB profitability vs the broader market. For more details, see: RKLB Operating Income Comparison RKLB saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and, (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, outlook changes. Read RKLB Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

Coca-Cola's foray into coffee is losing its buzz. Now, the drink giant is rethinking its approach, its CEO said. Seven years ago, Coke paid about $5.1 billion for Costa Coffee, a UK-based chain of coffee shops. While Coca-Cola didn't have a lot of experience operating caf\u00e9s, the deal gave the company a foothold in the coffee industry, which it viewed as a key growth area. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said on the company's earnings call on Tuesday that \"the investment hypothesis didn't work out as we expected.\" He said the company hoped to see \"much more growth\" outside the retail stores that make up its core business. Coca-Cola makes most of its money selling drink concentrates and other ingredients to partner companies that manufacture and sell the beverages that customers buy in restaurants and stores. Still, Quincey said coffee is a \"super attractive category\" that's large and profitable for Coca-Cola. It has invested in Costa's UK stores and expanded the use of automated coffee machines that use the Costa name, he said. The business \"just didn't create a multiplier so far that we are looking for,\" Quincey said. Coca-Cola is \"reflecting\" on what its coffee business should look like going forward, he said. In August, Reuters reported that Coca-Cola was working with an investment bank to explore a sale of Costa. Quincey did not address a potential sale of Costa on Tuesday's call. Coke's stock was up about 4% on Tuesday after the company reported that net sales grew 5% to $12.46 billion in the third quarter. Besides Costa, Coca-Cola has also experimented with a version of its eponymous drink mixed with coffee.

The Samsung Galaxy A9 series was launched in multiple markets last year, offering a more affordable lineup of tablets for those who don't want to spend more than a few hundred dollars. The A9 Plus includes a larger 11-inch display than the base-level A9, and this particular deal is for the upgraded 256GB storage configuration of the device. Add in the inclusion of both a front- and rear-facing camera, USB-C charging, and a decent battery life, and you're looking at a pretty decent tablet\u2014especially at a price point of just $250. Many users also like that it includes a headphone jack, something that is anything but universal in today's tablet market, as well as decent performance that punches a bit above its weight at this sticker price. Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus (256GB): $319.99 $249.99 at Best Buy Best Buy's latest run of deals includes $70 off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus, bringing it to under $300 at just $250.

Samsung launched the A9 series as an affordable pair of tablet options with downgraded LCD displays. While buyers shouldn't expect it to be one of the best Samsung tablets, it'll get the job done for most casual users, and the A9 Plus is a good pick if you want an affordable device with a slightly larger screen than most. The A9 Plus features an 11-inch LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate, and while it's nowhere near industry-leading performance, it's not bad compared to rivals around this price point. Performance is backed by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC processor and 8GB of RAM, offering performance that's good enough for most. It also comes with a headphone jack, a microSD port for expandable storage up to 1TB, a 5MP front-facing camera, and an 8MP rear-facing camera. While you shouldn't expect to get all the bells and whistles with this budget tablet, it's a great pick if you're in need of something affordable that's still going to get the job done.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByIan Sayson, Forbes Staff. Maynilad Water Services\u2014a unit of Indonesian billionaire Anthoni Salim\u2014backed Metro Pacific Investments\u2014will raise up to 28.5 billion pesos ($490 million) from its maiden share sale after setting the IPO price at 15 pesos a share. The IPO would be the biggest in the Philippines since instant noodle giant Monde Nissin raised  $1 billion from its maiden share sale in 2021.   Maynilad Water is selling as many as 1.9 billion shares, including 249,047,600 primary common shares for over allotment and 24.9 million common shares that will be sold to Salim\u2019s First Pacific,  a major shareholder of Philippine conglomerate Metro Pacific. The company\u2014which provides water utility services to 17 cities and municipalities in western Metro Manila and parts of Cavite province, south of the capital\u2014said in its prospectus filed earlier this month that it was aiming for a maximum IPO price of 20 pesos apiece. Despite attracting cornerstone investors such as the International Finance Corp. and the Asian Development Bank, which committed to buy shares worth $245 million at 15 pesos each, the stock is likely to struggle in the short to medium term as a government corruption scandal involving supposed flood control projects that weren\u2019t delivered by contractors who allegedly gave kickbacks to politicians has soured market sentiment, according to some analysts. The benchmark Philippine stock index has fallen almost 7% this year, making it one of the worst performing stock markets in Southeast Asia. \u201cThe [corruption scandal] soured the appetite of many retail investors even though Maynilad is an attractive stock,\u201d said Jonathan Ravelas, managing director at Manila-based consultancy firm eMBMS.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to attract investors when you have a systemic issue of corruption in government.\u201d At 15 pesos a share, Maynilad is valued at 7.2 times estimated 2025 price to earnings, a premium over the 6.9 times multiple Manila Water\u2014controlled by casino-to-ports billionaire Enrique Razon Jr.\u2014is trading at, according to Benjamin Garcia, head of research at AP Securities. \u201cThe offer is prudently priced and offers sufficient modest upside,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cMaynilad is a viable defensive and dividend play primarily due to its high earnings visibility and generous dividend policy.\u201d Maynilad Water will start trading on the Philippine Stock Exchange on November 7. Maynilad, which plans to use proceeds from the offering for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, booked 7.5 billion pesos in first-half net income, up 19% from the same period in 2024. The utility said in its prospectus that available cashflow for dividend payouts may  \u201cincrease significantly\u201d from 2028 onwards due to lower capital expenditure requirements. The company plans to distribute about 50% of its net income as annual dividend, according to its prospectus. Aside from the sale of primary shares, Maynilad Water Holding\u2014which counts Metro Pacific, tycoon Isidro Consunji\u2019s DMCI Holdings and Japan\u2019s Marubeni Corp. among its shareholders\u2014plans to sell 354.7 million shares at the IPO price, raising an additional 7.1 billion pesos in a secondary offering.  Metro Pacific\u2014which is helmed by CEO Manuel Pangilinan\u2014also has interests in hospitals, tollroads, agriculture, as well as electricity generation and distribution. Besides Metro Pacific, Salim\u2019s First Pacific also has stakes in Philippine telecom giant PLDT and Philex Mining Corp. With a net worth of $12.8 billion, Salim and his family are among the richest in Indonesia.

As ticketing websites face increased scrutiny over high prices, Ticketmaster is getting tough on resellers. The company said it would limit users and ticket brokers to only one account, using verification methods like Social Security numbers and AI screening. In a September lawsuit, the FTC accused Ticketmaster of colluding with resellers to inflate prices, though parent company Live Nation called the allegation \u201ccategorically false.\u201d Criticism of the industry has grown as popular concerts like Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour saw astronomical resale prices. The Justice Department sued to break up Live Nation last year. A gallon of regular gas will cost less than $3 on average for the first time since last December, data from GasBuddy reveals. The decline is largely due to OPEC\u2019s decision to increase oil production, and prices could fall even further, GasBuddy predicts, as demand typically drops in the fall.

With legal battles underway between HR software startups Rippling and Deel, their rivalry is playing out in the private market, too.

Rivian has had a rocky time since it began selling electric vehicles in 2021. It missed initial volume goals, leading to back-to-back years of weak sales. Then there have been post-COVID parts shortages, inflation, and steel and aluminum tariffs. And now, it\u2019s facing a federal administration that\u2019s no fan of EVs. But CEO RJ Scaringe says he\u2019s more optimistic than ever ahead of the company\u2019s next major product launch: the R2 small electric SUV that will go head-to-head with Tesla\u2019s top-selling Model Y. Rivian is starting up production of the R2, which will be tens of thousands of dollars cheaper and smaller than Rivian\u2019s current R1S SUV and R1T pickup, with U.S. sales to begin in early 2026. It\u2019s priced from $45,000, which is below the current average selling price for all new U.S. vehicles. Rivian will have the capacity to build more than 160,000 R2s annually at its Normal, Illinois factory that currently makes its R1 models and EDV commercial vans that Amazon and other companies use. Rivian\u2019s big bet on R2 comes at a tricky time for the U.S. EV market. Last quarter, carbuyers rushed to get the federal discount before it went away, leading to a surge in sales of battery-powered models, which could eat into future demand. Big automakers such as General Motors are tweaking their EV plans for now; Nissan and Honda are discontinuing some electric models; and Ford CEO Jim Farley said U.S. demand for battery-powered autos could drop by half with the end of federal incentives. WHY IT MATTERS \u201cRivian needs a hit after two years of declining sales of its pricey R1 pickup and SUV models, and the more affordable R2 looks like its best shot,\u201d says Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. \u201cIn fact, it needs to do well to justify investors\u2019 faith in the company, according to auto analyst Ed Kim: \u2018I would say the company\u2019s survival depends on the success of R2 as its volume model.\u2019\u201d MORE Tesla\u2019s Sales Surge Is A Sugar High Powered By Less Musk And Trump\u2019s EV Tax Credit Cut Americans are increasingly anxious about the state of the economy, including housing affordability, saving for retirement and finding a good job, a new poll shows.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Amazon.com (AMZN) has faced challenges previously. Its stock has dropped by more than 30% within a period of less than 2 months on three separate occasions in various years, erasing billions in market capitalization and eliminating substantial gains in a single correction. If past performance serves as an indicator, Amazon.com (AMZN) stock is not shielded from unexpected, sharp declines. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is substantial value in the broader diversified approach we utilize with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio.

When it's time to retire, a lot of older adults migrate south for warmer climates, cheaper housing, and lower taxes. While southern cities like Naples and Fort Lauderdale often dominate as destinations for retirees, the Midwest has emerged as a favorable landing spot \u2014 at least, according to WalletHub. WalletHub looked at 182 cities and ranked the best places for retirees based on four key measures: activities, affordability, healthcare, and quality of life. Each of those four categories was weighted equally, however, other relevant metrics were used inside each category and weighted differently. For example, adjusted cost of living was weighted higher than annual cost of in-home services within the affordability category. \"Rounding out the top 10 are cities that balance affordability, access to quality care, and vibrant lifestyles,\" WalletHub writer and analyst Chip Lupo told Business Insider. \"These locales all tend to offer a mix of mild weather, strong local economies, and plenty of ways for retirees to stay active and connected.\" Unsurprisingly, Florida accounted for nearly half of the top 10 for best cities, while California took up more than half of the spots for the worst cities to retire in. \"On the flip side, the bottom 10 cities face challenges that make retirement less appealing. San Bernardino, California; Stockton, California; and Rancho Cucamonga, California, rank among the lowest because of their high costs of living and weaker healthcare access,\" Lupo said. Southern cities had a healthy showing in the top 10, but the Midwest also had a diverse selection of cities toward the top. \"Minneapolis, which ranks third, stands out for its strong healthcare system, active senior community, and welcoming job market for older adults,\" Lupo said.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), the top electronics retailer in the U.S., has seen about 20% of its value evaporate in the last year, while the S&P 500 grew by 13%. What accounts for this disparity? It is attributed to a mix of margin pressures, decreasing consumer demand, and broader issues in the retail landscape. The company has notably indicated that tariffs on imports from China and Mexico are squeezing margins and may necessitate increased prices for consumers. Sales growth is inconsistent: comparable store sales dropped 0.7% in Q1 FY26, (January fiscal year), with gains in gaming and mobile balanced out by declines in appliances and home theater. Although Q2 experienced a slight 1.6% growth in comparable sales, gross profit margins decreased due to a greater proportion of lower-margin products. The facts are evident: Best Buy is maneuvering through a tough environment, where discretionary spending is curtailed, margins are slim, and even small price hikes can lead customers to seek online options. This situation emphasizes to investors that the current stock price may hide significant downside risks. However, if you seek potential upward movement with less volatility than holding a single stock like BBY, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has greatly outperformed its benchmark\u2014a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has delivered returns exceeding 105% since its launch. What is behind this success? Collectively, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have provided higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, avoiding major fluctuations, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Furthermore, take a look at \u2013 Buy, Sell, or Hold Chipotle Stock? Best Buy stock appears inexpensive at first glance\u2014its price-to-sales ratio of 0.4 and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 12.1 are significantly below the S&P 500 averages of 3.2 and 20.6. However, this discount is there for a reason. Growth is faltering. Best Buy\u2019s revenues have decreased by 2.2% over the last twelve months, and the company's three-year average growth rate stands at \u20135.4%, while the S&P 500 has a growth rate of 5.3%. Profitability remains weak as well: operating margin is at 4.1%, and net margin is only 1.9%, considerably below market averages. In simple terms, this is not a growth story\u2014it\u2019s a low-growth, low-margin retailer attempting to adjust to structural changes in how consumers purchase technology. Let us examine what history reveals when markets turn against Best Buy. Throughout the 2022 inflation crisis, BBY fell by 54.5% from its 2021 peak of $138 to $62.85, while the S&P 500 only dropped 25%. Additionally, unlike the broader market, Best Buy has not fully recovered\u2014hitting a peak of $103 in September 2024 and currently trading around $80. Even during the 2008 financial crisis, BBY experienced a 67% decline compared to the S&P\u2019s 57% loss. The trend is apparent: when consumer spending dwindles, Best Buy suffers more severely and takes longer to recover. If history serves as a reference, Best Buy could endure an additional 30\u201340% decline if macroeconomic or company-specific challenges escalate. Historically, the stock has often plunged more severely than the broader market during downturns, at times losing over half its value. Although BBY may seem undervalued currently, weak growth, diminishing margins, and sensitivity to consumer spending render it exposed. Should tariffs continue or discretionary spending tighten further, a decline back to the mid-$50s range is entirely feasible, especially if investors shift away from consumer electronics. This evaluation is not driven by pessimism\u2014it presents a perspective. Best Buy still stands as a well-known brand with solid cash reserves and moderate debt, but it is far from being a resilient growth stock. When market sentiment transitions from optimism to caution, retailers like Best Buy tend to experience disproportionate declines. Ultimately, the real question is not if Best Buy will survive\u2014it\u2019s whether your portfolio can endure the potential downturn if the retail cycle turns against it once more. If this level of risk unsettles you, you may want to explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to provide solid returns for investors. What drives this success? The rebalanced distribution of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a versatile strategy to exploit favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rose Monday as Apple (AAPL) and the broader tech sector made gains. Apple surged to a new high after Counterpoint Research concluded that iPhone 17 sales were outperforming early iPhone 16 sales.      The large-cap S&P 500 index gained 1.1%, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.4% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1%.  According to the Counterpoint report, iPhone 17 sales in China and the U.S. are 14% higher in their first 10 days of availability versus the iPhone 16 when it launched. The base model iPhone 17 has sold well in China, while U.S. consumers are taking advantage of carrier subsidies on the iPhone 17 Pro Max.  Apple\u2019s next earnings report is scheduled for Thursday, October 30, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. ET. Stock futures are flat of the market open on Tuesday.  What is a credit crisis? A credit crisis is a severe breakdown of the money flow between borrowers and lenders, threatening lenders\u2019 ability to lend or meet their own financial obligations. The most recent major credit crisis in the U.S. was the 2008 financial crisis.  Credit crises can be damaging and difficult to resolve because they spread quickly. The global economy is increasingly interconnected, and severe problems tend to have a cascading effect.  This was particularly apparent in 2008. A hot real estate market prompted mortgage lenders industry-wide to make aggressive subprime loans. They packaged the loans into securities that were sold to institutional investors. When housing prices began to fall, the problems mushroomed.  A major credit crisis can lead to:  The economic and financial market effects can linger for years. Case in point: before the 2008 financial crisis, the S&P 500 had peaked in July of 2007 at about $1,576. The large-cap index didn\u2019t exceed that level until April of 2013, nearly six years later.  Credit crisis scares in 2025 and 2023 put investors on edge. Automotive industry cockroaches. Last week, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dinan warned \u201cwhen you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\u201d The comment referred to losses JPM sustained related to the bankruptcy of subprime auto lender Tricolor.  Several weeks after Tricolor filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, auto-parts supplier First Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. First Brands is now under federal investigation for accounting issues, with the company\u2019s aggressive borrowing habits in focus. Dinan was involved in the Bear Stearns rescue of 2008, so his opinion on pervasive credit risk is relevant. Investors responded by selling off regional bank stock shares, for fear of other exposures to shaky loans. 2023 bank crisis. In March, 2024, three U.S. banks collapsed: crypto bank Silvergate, startup lender Silicon Valley Bank and New York\u2019s Signature Bank.  Silvergate liquidated first after crypto exchange FTX went bankrupt and the bank\u2019s deposits declined.  Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed after incurring losses on the sale of securities which had declined in value due to rising interest rates. Bank customers pulled their funds from the bank after learning of the cash crunch, which worsened the problem. The bank tried to raise funds and sell itself, but regulators shut it down.  Days later, regulators also shut down Signature Bank. SVB\u2019s collapse may have prompted customers to pull their money from the bank. A later report cited \u201cpoor management\u201d and inadequate risk management as factors.  Because a major credit crisis can expand into full-blown recession and market meltdown, it\u2019s tough to limit your exposure. You can prepare your finances for an extended market decline, however.  Try these strategies. ","label":1}

Stock futures are treading water this morning after major indexes jumped to start the week as shares of Apple and other tech firms paced gains. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, each of which gained more than 1% yesterday, were fractionally higher in recent trading. Gold futures were down down 2% at $4,275 an ounce, as the precious metal pulled back from record highs amid the stock market rally. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $108,500, down from a high yesterday of around $111,700. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can affect borrowing costs for an array consumer loans, continued to trade near six-month lows at around 3.98%.   The U.S. government shutdown entered its 21st day on Tuesday amid hopes that the budget dispute could be resolved this week.\u00a0 White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday that the shutdown was \u201clikely to end sometime this week.\u201d Hassett said that White House was prepared to take stronger action to force an end to the shutdown if no deal is reached this week. Meanwhile, the government work stoppage continues to affect the release of several economic reports from statistical agencies, with data on weekly jobless claims, retail sales and housing starts delayed due to the shutdown. Market watchers are expected to get inflation data on Friday.   Shares of Apple (AAPL) were modestly lower in premarket trading after closing at a record high Monday following a report showing strong sales of the iPhone 17. Apple shares gained nearly 4% yesterday, hitting a new high for the first time in 2025 and lifting the company\u2019s market capitalization to nearly $4 trillion.

Thought Elon Musk's $1 trillion Tesla pay package would have an easy ride? Think again. A second influential proxy-advisory firm is urging Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion compensation deal, warning that it would hand the billionaire CEO an \"unprecedented\" payout while shrinking other investors' stakes. Glass Lewis & Co. told clients in a paper published last Friday that the award \"warrants significant shareholder concern.\" It joined Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) in opposing the deal ahead of Tesla's November 6 annual meeting. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Glass Lewis's 90-page report, reviewed by Business Insider, calls the package \"excessively dilutive,\" estimating that, if fully exercised, it could cut existing shareholders' ownership by about 11.3%. The firm valued the deal at $141.6 billion \u2014 far above Tesla's own $87.8 billion estimate \u2014 and said Musk could reap \"billions in compensation and a materially increased ownership stake\" even if he hits just one of the 12 performance tranches. \"The potential upfront and future dilutive impacts to shareholders, as well as extraordinary pay levels without commensurately exceptional performance through the achievement of even just a few tranches, warrant significant concern,\" Glass Lewis wrote in its analysis. The package would grant Musk up to 423 million shares, or about 12% of Tesla's adjusted share count, if he meets a set of market-cap and 12 operational milestones \u2014 including pushing Tesla's valuation to $8.5 trillion by 2035. The report also raised red flags about Tesla's board independence and oversight of Musk's pay. Glass Lewis said Musk's compensation is being reviewed by a board that has long faced questions about its closeness to the CEO, citing directors with personal or professional ties to him that date back years. The firm said that dynamic was central to a Delaware court ruling earlier this year that struck down Musk's 2018 pay package, finding that those relationships compromised the approval process. Those concerns remain relevant now, Glass Lewis added. Glass Lewis also questioned controls on ensuring Musk's focus remains on Tesla, given his slate of other ventures, including SpaceX, xAI, X, and Neuralink. \"The size of the award could result in the scenario where Mr. E. Musk receives billions in compensation and a materially increased ownership stake,\" the firm said, \"even if only a single tranche is earned.\" The report further argued that the early milestones \"do not appear as herculean as the size of the proposed tranches would suggest,\" implying Musk could unlock massive value without delivering the kind of outlier performance the package purports to demand. Tesla sent a fiery X post on Monday, blasting ISS and Glass Lewis as \"misguided.\" The post said both firms have \"recommended against Tesla's proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.\" \"It's a good thing our shareholders ignored those recommendations,\" Tesla wrote, \"otherwise they may have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.\" The company accused the advisors of using \"one-size-fits-all checklists\" that \"undermine shareholders' interests,\" and added their recommendations \"attempt to override the mandate our shareholders delivered to Elon and ignore the staggering financial results delivered under Elon's leadership.\" Tesla escalated its criticism in a follow-up post on Tuesday, saying ISS and Glass Lewis' models were \"incapable of accounting for the sort of extraordinary growth Tesla has experienced.\" The company argued that both firms' benchmark-based models \"cannot distinguish between innovation and risk, or between ambition and mismanagement.\" It also said ISS and Glass Lewis were \"disconnected from financial reality\" and \"incapable of tailoring their advice to investors who are focused on the achievement of extraordinary financial value.\" It urged shareholders to \"take back your vote from proxy advisors\" and \"vote in the interests of Tesla shareholders,\" arguing that \"governance should serve \u2014 and not be disconnected from \u2014 financial return.\" Cathie Wood, the founder of ARK Invest and a longtime Tesla supporter, predicted the plan would still pass \"decisively\" despite opposition from proxy firms and index funds.

The post-pandemic job market was supposed to reward hard work and higher education. Instead, it's become a high-stakes game of digital roulette, according to one high-ranking City executive. Quentin Nason, a former Deutsche Bank managing director and now vice chair of the London Foundation for Banking and Finance, said in a LinkedIn post that the graduate recruitment system is \"broken for both sides.\" He said he sees it firsthand through City Pay it Forward, an organization that helps high school and university students in the UK break into finance. \"Many tell me they've applied for 150 or more roles and still have nothing to show for it,\" Nason wrote in a LinkedIn post that's struck a nerve among City of London professionals and students alike. The process, he says, has turned into a \"meat grinder.\" Recruiters, swamped with tens of thousands of applications, are relying on AI-powered screening tools to filter candidates long before a human gets involved. Applicants, meanwhile, are using the same technology to generate flawless cover letters and CVs in seconds, he added. \"It takes a click to apply to everything with zero friction costs,\" Nason wrote. \"The result is 5,000 candidates for five jobs being the norm.\" The outcome, he warns, is a self-reinforcing loop of automation and rejection \u2014 a system that saves time for companies but leaves qualified graduates stuck in digital limbo. Beyond the clogged pipelines and failed algorithms lies a more human cost. \"This generation is not built to withstand that level of rejection,\" Nason said. \"They did what society told them to do, worked hard, went to university, took on \u00a350,000 [$67,000] of debt, and now find themselves locked out.\" He said that student loans compound daily from the first day of term, likening them to \"PIK notes in disguise\" \u2014 a form of debt that grows relentlessly until repaid. For many, he said, the only realistic way to pay them off is to land a high-paying job in the City of London. But as AI begins to eliminate entry-level white-collar roles, even that path is narrowing. Nason drew a stark parallel with Nepal, where frustration among young people over joblessness and corruption boiled over into violent protest earlier this year. \"Gen Z burned down Parliament and toppled the government,\" he wrote. \"It may seem distant, but it could be a preview of what comes next \u2014 the first Gen Z revolt, not born of ideology but of exhaustion with a system that no longer works for them.\" While the UK is unlikely to see unrest on that scale, he believes something has to give. The social contract that promised prosperity in exchange for education and debt, he argues, is fracturing \u2014 and AI may be accelerating the break. While Nason sees a system teetering on collapse, Silicon Valley's leading voices insist this generation has never had more potential. Some tech leaders \u2014 including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Handshake CEO Garrett Lord, and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman \u2014 have all argued that Gen Z's fluency with AI will make them the biggest winners of the next decade. But others, like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, see storm clouds ahead. Amodei warned that AI could wipe out up to half of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, while Powell recently acknowledged that the technology is already affecting the job market for new graduates, though he said, \"it's hard to say how big it is.\" The optimism of some tech founders contrasts sharply with what's happening inside major employers. In September, PwC UK chief Marco Amitrano said the firm is cutting graduate recruitment from 1,500 to 1,300 hires, citing sluggish growth and the early effects of AI on roles. Deloitte UK has also reduced its intake, while PwC US plans to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. As Nason put it: \"Something has to give, and soon.\"                   Your daily guide to what's moving markets \u2014 straight to your inbox.

Classic Special Edition Arcade1Up machines are $334 and include 13 preloaded arcade games. By      Steven Petite    and      Darryn Bonthuys    on October 21, 2025 at 2:45PM PDT  Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Arcade Cabinets   Ms. Pac-Man, Mortal Kombat, and Pac-Man Machines for $334.    Most Arcade1Up releases these days are $500-$600 Deluxe Cabinets, but the leader in the home arcade machine market recently returned to its roots with the Classic Special Edition series. Each Classic SE retails for $334 and has 13 preloaded games. There are currently three models to choose from: Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and Mortal Kombat II. All three have online leaderboards, and Mortal Kombat has an online multiplayer mode. The arcade sticks, buttons, dual speakers, and overall build quality aligns with Arcade1Up's pricier options. When we first highlighted the lineup in September, Walmart was the only retailer carrying these cabinets, but now you can buy them on Amazon, too. There are a few reasons why these are cheaper than the average machine from Arcade1Up. The Deluxe cabinets are just over 5-feet tall--ideal standing height for adults--whereas the Special Editions are just under 4-feet tall. The good news is you can get a universal Arcade1Up Riser for $59 that raises the height to 5 feet. If you don't get the Riser, you will likely want an adjustable barstool--unless the cabinet is for kids, in which case the original height will likely be a better fit. These machines have 15.6-inch displays and regular marquees, whereas Deluxe Editions include larger, 17-inch screens and light-up marquees. Instead of a faux coin door, there's a front panel with game logos.  Check out all three Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition machines below. Get ready for some Mortal Kombat! This cabinet is a treat for fans of Mortal Kombat's classic era, as it has 13 games installed on it. You can see if you still remember how to do fatalities in games like the original Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 2, Mortal Kombat 3, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. For the design, the cabinet is Mortal Kombat 2-themed and it includes several symbols from the fighting franchise across its surface. This is also a two-player cabinet, so you can do some head-to-head competition from it with its dual joystick and arcade buttons layout. Included games:   The Ms.Pac-Man arcade cabinet includes 13 games in total, with five of them being Pac-themed games. You can also hop into classic Dig-Dug, Mappy, and Galaga. The cabinet also features an eye-catching design with its bright blue finish and decals that make it look like it was pulled straight from an '80s arcade. Included games:   The Pac-Man arcade cabinet is similar in design to Ms. Pac-Man, and it offers mostly the same selection of 13 games to play on it. The only real difference with the line-up is that Tower of Druaga has been swapped out for King & Balloon. The cabinet features a vibrant yellow finish and retro-inspired Pac-Man images on it. Included games:   The official Arcade1Up Riser adds an extra 14.25 inches to the Special Edition cabinets. It also adds some heft to the overall build, which is a nice perk. Out of the box, the Special Editions weight 36-38 pounds each, and the Riser weighs 17 pounds. Even with the Riser attached, these cabinets are still 10-15 pounds lighter than their Deluxe counterparts, but they still feel solid and secure.    Arcade1Up Cabinets and Countercades   See which home arcade machines are in stock at Amazon.    The Classic Special Editions are the cheapest standing cabinets in Arcade1Up's catalog, but they aren't the cheapest machines overall. Amazon has a pair of Arcade1Up countertop arcade machines in stock right now. The Class of '81 Countercade is themed around Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga. It has a 7-inch, vertically oriented LCD screen, full-size controls, and can be powered via Micro-USB or four AA batteries (not included). In addition to Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga, Class of '81 includes Dig Dug. The Pac-Man Countercade is available for only $150. It has the same technical specifications as Class of '81 and includes three preloaded games: Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, and Pac-Mania.     If you're interested in checking out Arcade1Up's Deluxe Arcade Machines, Amazon has 10 models in stock, including Pac-Man, Mortal Kombat II, and the Class of '81 cabinet with more games than you'd get with the countercade version. Golden Tee 3D comes with six iterations of the classic golf game as well as Shuffleshot and World Class Bowling. Sports fans can also get NBA Jam, which includes the original, the Tournament Edition, and NBA Hangtime. If you're interested in Arcade1Up's countercades, we'd recommend checking out the Evercade Alpha Taito Bartop Arcade. Set to launch November 12, this miniature cabinet has an 8-inch display and 10 preloaded games, but you can play hundreds of other titles on it by purchasing Evercade cartridge collections. This is the third Evercade Alpha following the launch of Mega Man and Street Fighter editions--both of which have been sold out all year in the US. Check out our Evercade Alpha review for more details on the hardware. We also created an Amazon hub filled with in-stock Evercade game collections. The Evercade Alpha Taito Bartop Arcade is available to preorder now for $260 at Amazon. All of the cartridge collections work on the Evercade EXP-R handheld and Evercade VS-R home console, both of which were recently restocked at Amazon for $130 each.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock merits your attention. Why? Because it offers monopoly-like high margins at a discounted price. Here are some details. While revenue growth is beneficial, this is not solely a growth viewpoint. Pricing power and high margins yield consistent, predictable profits and cash flows, decreasing risk and facilitating reinvestment of capital. The market typically rewards this. To provide some context, Adobe delivers diversified software solutions globally, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, serving enterprise clients within the Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing & Advertising sectors. *LTM: Last Twelve Months But do these figures provide the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to determine whether Adobe still possesses an advantage that remains robust. Investing in a single stock can be risky, yet there is considerable merit in a more diversified approach. If you're aiming for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) \u2013 HQ has exceeded its benchmark, which is a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indices, achieving returns greater than 105% since inception. Effective risk management is essential; consider what the long-term performance of your portfolio might be if you combined 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto with HQ\u2019s performance metrics. Here is our criterion for selection: We evaluate stocks valued at over $10 Billion in market cap, filtering out those with high CFO (cash flow from operations) margins or operating margins. We also only consider stocks that have significantly decreased in valuation over the past year. Below are statistics for stocks with this selection methodology applied since 12\/31\/2016. That being said, Adobe has experienced some significant declines in challenging periods. It fell approximately 72.5% during the Dot-Com bubble and 67% during the Global Financial Crisis. In the 2022 inflation shock, the drop was around 60%. Even during less severe downturns, such as in 2018 and the Covid pandemic, it still saw roughly a 25% decrease in value. Therefore, despite everything working in its favor, Adobe is not immune when market conditions worsen. However, the risk is not confined to major market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the markets are performing well \u2013 consider events like earnings reports, business updates, or changes in outlook. Read ADBE Dip Buyer Analyses to review how the stock has bounced back from notable dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three indices \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks generate superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; it\u2019s a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) stock should be on your watchlist. Here is why - it is currently trading in the support zone ($49.87 - $55.12), levels from which it has bounced meaningfully before.  In the last 10 years, The Trade Desk stock received buying interest at this level 7 times and subsequently went on to generate 80.7% in average peak returns. But is the price action enough alone? It certainly helps if the fundamentals check out. For TTD, read Buy or Sell TTD Stock to see how convincing this buy opportunity might be. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark\u2014a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Here are some quick data points for The Trade Desk that should help the decision: For quick background, The Trade Desk provides a cloud-based platform enabling buyers to create, manage, and optimize data-driven digital advertising campaigns globally. Notably, TTD crashed over 36% in August 2025 due to a combination of weak third-quarter guidance, the sudden departure of the Chief Financial Officer, and growing investor concerns over increased competition from larger tech companies like Amazon and Netflix. That said, TTD isn\u2019t immune to steep sell-offs. It plunged about 36% during the 2018 correction, took a hit of over 54% in the Covid crash, and fell more than 64% amid the inflation shock. Even outside major crashes, the dips can be sharp. It\u2019s a reminder \u2014 no matter the positives, steep pullbacks happen when markets turn sour. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are in good shape - think events like earnings, business updates, and outlook changes. Read TTD Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that?

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"For photographers looking to use a mobile device for high-end results, the camera app that comes installed on many Android phones rarely gives enough control over the camera hardware to achieve those results. In order to help less experienced mobile camera users with quick, share-ready results, these apps rely heavily on post-processing and generalized algorithms instead of user input. Even newer flagships such as the Google Pixel 10 and Samsung Galaxy S25 don't necessarily give experienced photographers the camera controls they need in order to capture the world to their specific visual liking. But many Android phones have camera hardware perfectly capable of doing more, which makes it simply a matter of finding the right software to unlock a phone's photographic potential. The Google Play Store is full of Android photography apps \u2014 both free and paid \u2014 that can help you fully tap into what your phone's camera can do. We've narrowed them down to the essentials, and among them you'll find options that offer full exposure controls and the ability to shoot RAW images, as well as some that offer editing features to help you achieve the look you're going for. The comprehensive manual controls found in ProShot are a big part of how the app brings DSLR-style photography to Android. With ProShot, you can manually adjust ISO settings, shutter speeds, white balance, focus, and even exposure compensation. ProShot supports RAW and JPEG photography, and like DSLR and mirrorless cameras, allows you to take pictures in both RAW and JPEG formats at the same time. Shooting RAW allows for more flexibility when editing photos, which can come in handy whether you have professional ambitions or hope to take Instagram-worthy pictures of the moon. And if Instagram and other social platforms are your primary photography outlets, ProShot's aspect ratio options give you some flexibility. It has settings for 4:3, 16:9, and 1:1 photography, but it also allows you to set up your own custom aspect ratios. The app's Dual Dial interface mirrors the feel of professional cameras, so anyone coming from DSLRs or mirrorless cameras should feel more at home using their phone camera with ProShot. ProShot costs $8 as a one-time purchase and does not require any sort of subscription. You also don't have to worry about in-app purchases, as that $8 price gets you access to the complete suite of features. You can also download the ProShot Evaluator app for free, which allows you to test exactly which features your specific Android device supports. Android users who haven't yet come across Open Camera have been missing out on a highly capable yet entirely free third-party camera option. Open Camera has a lot of features available that are similar to ProShot, but it offers them at absolutely no cost. While you will find some ads within the app, Open Camera does not have in-app purchases or subscription fees. Getting full access is simply a matter of downloading and opening up the app. Those features include the ability to shoot in RAW and JPEG modes, as well as HDR shooting with auto-alignment. A panorama mode is available for landscape photography, and GPS location tagging will ensure you never lose track of where each photo was taken. For photographers who may just be getting started with professional camera controls, Auto modes can be turned on for help while you learn. There's a lot of versatility within the Open Camera app, which makes it a great Android photography companion for photographers at all skill levels. Features like exposure bracketing and dynamic range optimization are there for the pros. For everyday photographers, the ability to trigger the camera shutter remotely by making a noise is helpful for self-portraits and family photos. Adobe Lightroom is best known as a photo editing app, but it includes a built-in camera with professional shooting controls. It comes with manual adjustment controls for ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and focus distance, offering the kind of precision most default Android camera apps lack. The kind of dynamic range you need in order to take full advantage of Lightroom's editing features is also available by taking RAW pictures using Adobe's DNG format within the app. These editing features are what make Lightroom Mobile an essential Android app for photographers. Its core editing tools include exposure adjustments through dedicated sliders for highlights, shadows, saturation, contrast, and even more. In fact, Lightroom offers precise controls for just about every aspect of photo editing, and if you're willing to pay for a monthly subscription, Adobe even chips in a lot of AI help for the photo editing process. Adobe Lightroom Mobile is available as a free download, though it will cost a minimum of $12 per month for full access. That $12 per month price is for the Lightroom-only photography plan, but the app is also available as part of Adobe's Photography Plan for $20 per month. This package includes desktop and web versions of Lightroom, as well as Photoshop for Android and the Photoshop desktop and web apps. Snapseed doesn't have built-in camera functionality, but it's a powerful piece of photo editing software that has a simple, intuitive interface. It's capable of importing and editing both JPEG and RAW files, so it's a particularly useful tool to pair with camera-only photography options like the previously mentioned ProShot and Open Camera apps. This is also a photo editing app worth installing if you have a large library of previously unedited photos. Snapseed imports photos one at a time for editing, and it comes with a large selection of film-like filters that can give photos taken with your Android phone's default camera app a more unique look. Snapseed utilizes a layer-based, non-destructive editing workflow that allows for modification of individual layers at any point in the process. Google is the company behind Snapseed, and it has chosen to make the app entirely free to use. There are no ads within the app, and no watermarks when you're ready to export your final edit. It isn't an all-in-one photography app like Lightroom Mobile, but at zero cost, its professional-level editing tools are incredibly accessible and complement a dedicated camera app well.","label":0}

Historically, Nvidia has staged multiple powerful rallies - from riding the cryptocurrency boom to capitalizing on the Covid-era gaming and remote work surge. The stock\u2019s latest ascent, fueled by the generative AI revolution that began in 2022 has been the biggest and most transformative wave in the company\u2019s history. In fact, the stock increased by more than 50% within a two-month period on 11 occasions, particularly notable in 2016 and 2024, and rose over 30% during similar times 15 times, including crucial years such as 2017 and 2024. If past patterns persist, forthcoming catalysts could propel NVIDIA shares sharply upward once more, providing considerable profits to investors. Factors That May Elevate The Stock  Investing in single stocks can be risky, but there is immense value in a broader, diversified strategy such as the one we implement with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We extend our focus beyond just stocks. A portfolio consisting of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% cryptocurrency, in addition to stocks and bonds, may yield higher returns over the next 1 to 3 years and offer better protection if markets decline by 20%.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\u2019s stock rose by 35%, driven by heightened investor enthusiasm, even as revenues experienced a minor decline and profit margins contracted. The increase can be attributed to a couple of factors.    Over the last quarter, Tesla\u2019s delivery performance was better than expected, as customers rushed to capture expiring tax credits. Elon Musk\u2019s renewed focus on Tesla after his brief government stint \u2014backed by a massive new performance-based compensation plan\u2014 has also boosted investor sentiment. At the same time, optimism around Tesla\u2019s role in \u201cphysical AI\u201d - leveraging its strengths in autonomous driving, robotics, and large-scale manufacturing - is reigniting the stock\u2019s bull case.  So how do we numerically break down the move? The stock price increased by 35%, propelled by a 40% rise in its P\/E ratio, in spite of a 3.1% decrease in revenue and a 0.5% decline in net margin. Let\u2019s look into the reasons behind these changes. Before diving into the events that resulted in the stock surge, here\u2019s what market insights suggest: Individual stocks can be risky, but a diversified strategy offers substantial benefits, as seen with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a wealth manager based in the Boston area \u2013 whose asset allocation strategies have produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P plummeted over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into their asset allocation framework to deliver better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in less volatility, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Reasons Behind Tesla Stock Movement Our Current Assessment On TSLA Stock Opinion: We currently view TSLA stock as unappealing. Why? Take a look at the complete narrative. Read Buy or Sell TSLA Stock to understand what shapes our present stance. Risk: Nonetheless, Tesla is not exempt from significant declines. It plummeted around 54% during the 2018 correction, saw a 61% drop throughout the Covid pandemic, and faced the greatest hit during the inflation shock with a 74% decline. Even in crises that seemed less severe overall, Tesla\u2019s retracements were still pronounced. Strong growth or hype has its limits\u2014when markets fluctuate, the swings can be extreme. Identifying winners consistently is not a straightforward task \u2013 especially given the volatility linked to individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have offered improved returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in reduced volatility, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Rigetti Computing stock (NASDAQ: RGTI) has experienced a significant downturn, falling 23% in less than a month \u2014 from $56 on October 15, 2025, to its current price of $43. This decline is part of a broader pullback across the quantum computing sector, which is correcting following an intense, speculative rally. The stock\u2019s dramatic price swings are primarily driven by investor enthusiasm for the still-nascent quantum industry. Given this context, the stock could face further declines. Our analysis holds a Very Unattractive opinion on RGTI, and when considering the recent correction alongside this long-standing view, we see a possibility of continued downside. Specifically, a price of $30 is not unrealistic, particularly as the stock has traded near this level in the recent past. So, should you wait before buying this dip? Perhaps. There is no perfect way to time the dips. Nevertheless, here is another perspective on RGTI stock to help you make the decision. The stock has returned (median) 268% in one year, and 379% as peak return following sharp dips (>30% in 30 days) historically. For quick background, RGTI provides quantum computers and superconducting processors, integrated into public, private, and hybrid clouds via a Quantum Cloud Services platform. For details on stock fundamentals and assessment, read: Buy or Sell Rigetti Computing Stock to see the full picture. RGTI stock has fallen meaningfully recently, and we currently find it very unattractive. This may feel like a caution, and there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. However, there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management - a Boston area wealth manager - whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. RGTI had 9 events since 1\/1\/2010, where the dip threshold of -30% within 30 days was triggered Revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet strength need to be evaluated to reduce the risk of a dip being the sign of a deteriorating business situation. However, for a quantum computing stock like Rigetti, traditional financial metrics have limited immediate relevance. This is because the quantum computing industry is still in a nascent stage, focused on fundamental development and years away from widespread commercial application. The company\u2019s business model relies on securing limited revenue from research partnerships, specialized hardware sales, and government contracts (e.g., its cloud-based QCaaS model), while simultaneously burning significant cash to fund its rapid, capital-intensive research and development. Therefore, the company's valuation is primarily based on future technological milestones and the successful scaling of its technology, not near-term profitability. Dip buying, while attractive, needs to be evaluated carefully from multiple angles. Such multi-factor analysis is exactly how we construct Trefis portfolio strategies. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":0}

The federal government is shut down, but that's not stopping tourists from visiting America's national parks. I visited two national parks over the weekend, more than two weeks after the shutdown began: Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park, which are adjacent to each other and located in central California, about a 4.5 hour drive from Los Angeles in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Since the shutdown began on October 1, there's been a lot of confusion about what that means for the national parks and what visitors can expect to find when they go. The National Park Service has said parks will remain as accessible as possible during the shutdown, though the situation varies from park to park and most are running on limited crews to handle basic services, like bathroom maintenance and trash disposal. Both parks were open, had plenty of visitors, and were as gorgeous as they always are, but it wasn't business as usual. With fewer services available, planning ahead before the trip was more important than ever, and I took extra care to prepare before I went. Sequoia and Kings Canyon are technically two different parks, though in many ways they function as one \u2014 a single $35-per-vehicle entrance fee gets you into both. That is, when entrance fees are being collected. When I approached the entrance gates on Friday afternoon, there was no one on duty. In place of an attendant passing out maps and collecting fees \u2014 80% of which go toward maintaining and improving park facilities and services \u2014 there was a sign about the shutdown. \"During this lapse in appropriations, national parks will remain as accessible as possible,\" the sign said. \"We are doing our best to take care of your parks at this time, but some amenities and services may not be available.\" That was the first sign things were not normal. When I tried to stop by the Kings Canyon Visitor Center, it was closed, as were the other visitor centers that are typically open this time of year. The same sign about the lapse of appropriations was posted outside the entrance. Visitor centers are often a first stop for park-goers. Rangers are usually available to hand out maps and other informational materials, answer questions about weather and trail conditions, and recommend hikes that are appropriate for the group's fitness levels. I saw some tourists peering through the visitor center windows and scanning the large map that was hung up in the window. When another person from the group approached and asked if they were able to find a map they could take with them, one replied, \"They're in visual distance, but denied!\" The closed visitor center also meant that tourists hoping to get their \"National Park Passport\" stamped were out of luck. While many buildings run by the NPS were closed, bathrooms at many locations were still open and being maintained. Buildings run by concessionaires, or private companies that work in partnership with the parks, were also open. At Grant Grove, across from the Kings Canyon Visitor Center, a market, gift shop, and restaurant were open and serving tourists. Same with the market, restaurant, showers, and laundromat at the Lodgepole area of Sequoia. Many, if not most, of the popular trails were also open, including for the parks' most famous trees, General Sherman and General Grant, and the Moro Rock Trail. Some campgrounds were also open. The bathrooms at Sentinel Campground, where I stayed, were maintained with plenty of toilet paper and as clean as can typically be expected. The potable water at the campground also appeared to still be available. In fact, if a tourist had planned their trip in advance and did not try to stop by a visitor center, they might not have realized anything was out of the ordinary. I did see plenty of people breaking park rules \u2014 walking off trail or bringing their dogs on trails where pets weren't allowed \u2014 but I'm not sure visitors were misbehaving any more than they usually do at national parks. I had visited Sequoia and Kings Canyon before but knew the visitor centers would be closed, so I planned ahead even more than I usually would. There's almost no cell service in the parks, so before I left I downloaded an entire map of the area on Google Maps, as well as the official NPS map of the parks. I researched which sites we wanted to visit and downloaded trails on the AllTrails hiking app. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that online resources for the national parks were still very useful during the shutdown. The real-time weather forecast for various areas of the parks are still being updated on the park service website, so I was able to plan accordingly and feel pretty confident about the conditions we would find in the park. I was feeling some uncertainty over which campgrounds might be open, so I used Recreation.gov, the federal government website for outdoor reservations that is still running during the shutdown, to book a site in advance. I was able to grab a spot just one day before my trip. It's difficult to be certain about what you might find when visiting a national park during a government shutdown. It's safest to be self-reliant by taking extra care to plan and bring anything you might need with you. I packed extra toilet paper and brought my own water. It's also more important than ever to follow park rules and minimize your impact on the natural environment. Park advocates like the National Park Conservation Association urge the government to close national parks during shutdowns out of concern for the park itself and visitor safety. During the federal government shutdown in 2019, some parks were vandalized and their landscapes damaged. Issues with human waste and trash got so bad at Sequoia and Kings Canyon that the parks were forced to close, according to NPCA. \"Some parks are open. Some parks are closed. More than 60% of national park staff are on furlough,\" Kyle Groetzinger, an NPCA spokesperson, told me earlier this month. \"The shutdown is leaving national parks without the experts needed to protect fragile ecosystems, interpret American history, and serve the public.\" Overall, as an experienced national park visitor and camper, I felt comfortable visiting during the shutdown. As for first-time visitors, it might be better to wait until the shutdown ends and the parks are operating at full force. At the very least, I recommend doing a lot of research in advance and learning about Leave No Trace principles to protect yourself as well as the parks.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. IBM (NYSE: IBM) is set to publish its earnings report on Wednesday, October 22, 2025. In the past five years, IBM has exhibited a trend of positive one-day returns in 58% of cases following its earnings announcements. The median positive return in these instances was an impressive 4.7%, with the highest one-day positive return reaching 13.0%. For traders who act based on events, while the actual results compared to expectations and consensus will be vital, recognizing these historical trends could offer an advantage. Traders typically have two main strategies for approaching IBM's earnings: Current consensus predictions for IBM's upcoming earnings stand at $2.45 per share on revenue of $16.1 billion. This reflects an increase from the same quarter last year, which reported earnings of $2.30 per share on revenue of $14.97 billion. From a fundamental perspective, IBM currently has a market capitalization of $262 billion. Over the past twelve months, the company reported revenues of $64 billion, $11 billion in operating profits, and a net income of $5.8 billion. If you are seeking growth with less volatility than that of holding a single stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark\u2014a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes\u2014and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother investment journey, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. See the earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data on observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the relevant statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk strategy (although not helpful if the correlation is low) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying a pair with the highest correlation, and executing the corresponding trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves \"long\" for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D indicates the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. Investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors.

Advertisement Beth Woods is a health economist at the Centre for Health Economics, University of York, UK.  Search author on: PubMed \u00a0Google Scholar  Each year, more than nine million people in the United States do not take their medicines as prescribed owing to cost concerns. People there pay up to four times as much for new medicines as do individuals in other high-income countries. US President Donald Trump announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on 30 September, aimed at improving the affordability of drugs for people in the country. This is the first concrete step under Trump\u2019s \u2018most-favoured nation\u2019 policy, which intends to align US medicine prices to those in other wealthy countries. But it is unlikely to deliver the promised reductions in drug costs, and the knock-on effects could adversely affect public health globally. As part of the deal, some of Pfizer\u2019s drugs will be offered in the United States through a direct-to-consumer website, referred to as TrumpRx, that is expected to launch in 2026 \u2014 cutting out intermediaries and securing lower prices. Yet this probably won\u2019t benefit the 92% of people with health insurance, who would be better off receiving medicines through their plans. And those who can\u2019t afford insurance probably won\u2019t be able to pay for expensive drugs either. For example, even with the agreed discount, Pfizer\u2019s anti-inflammatory drug tofacitinib (sold under the brand name Xeljanz) will cost about US$3,600 a month. Claims that the deal will lower prices paid by Medicaid \u2014 a government programme providing health insurance to people with limited incomes and resources \u2014 have also been met with scepticism, because there is no evidence that it will improve on existing discounts. And from a financial perspective, the deal is not expected to affect pharmaceutical companies substantially. Pfizer\u2019s stock price rose by nearly 15% in the five trading days after the announcement. Trump\u2019s wider aim is to stop the \u2018global freeloading\u2019 of other high-income countries that, he says, benefit from low prices while accessing innovative drugs, the development of which has been funded mainly by US consumers. He argues that lowering prices in the United States and raising them elsewhere would be fairer and preserve industry revenues to support investments in research and development (R&D). But other wealthy nations shouldn\u2019t be expected to make up for any shortfall in US industry revenues. Directly linking what the US population pays to prices in other high-income countries, as proposed by Trump\u2019s policy, might not be effective. Given the importance of the US market to the drug industry, strategies exist to avoid prices in other nations influencing those in the United States \u2014 private non-transparent agreements between pharmaceutical companies and health systems, for example. Firms could also decide not to sell their products in some countries to protect US revenues. It is too early to gauge how effective the Trump administration\u2019s mix of diplomatic pressure and tariff threats will be in persuading other governments to accept higher drug prices. But if the United States is even partially successful, the increased medical bill for other wealthy nations could severely compromise their ability to fund broader health priorities, not just new drugs. And the idea that such higher prices would be fair is misplaced. In England, for example, the population is already paying too much for medicines despite relatively stringent price regulations. Instead, to reduce drug costs, the United States must develop its own mechanism for price regulation. It could, for example, use approaches that directly tie drug prices to rigorous value assessments, such as those undertaken by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent non-profit organization in Boston, Massachusetts. This would require the Trump administration to engage with the complexity of the US market, in which high costs reflect a complex web of intermediaries and legal barriers to price negotiation.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini Space Station (NASDAQ: GEMI) have experienced a tumultuous beginning following their highly awaited debut last month. The company set its IPO price at $28 per share, raising several hundred million dollars in the process. Although trading commenced at $37 on the first day, the stock has subsequently dropped to around $20 per share, significantly below its IPO price, influenced partly by the recent crypto selloff and concerns regarding the company\u2019s lack of profitability, as well as a slower than anticipated rate cut cycle by the Federal Reserve. However, with the stock down nearly 25% from its IPO price and its market capitalization at approximately $2.3 billion, is this stock currently a good buy? If you\u2019re looking for potential upside with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Gemini has established itself as one of the more institutional-grade entities in the crypto industry, providing a diverse array of products beyond its primary exchange. Co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are recognized for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg concerning Facebook\u2019s beginnings, the company offers a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, a crypto rewards credit card, and an NFT studio. Crucially, Gemini provides digital asset custody services, aimed at institutional investors that need secure and compliant infrastructure to manage cryptocurrency at scale. According to its IPO filings, Gemini manages over $21 billion in assets and serves approximately 10,000 institutions globally. This positioning - centered on regulation, compliance, and infrastructure - lends the exchange a reputation that is quite different from less regulated competitors. However, Gemini\u2019s business model is still largely dependent on a common lever for crypto exchanges: transaction fees on volume-based trades. While the company has effectively diversified into associated services, generating custody fees, credit card interchange fees, and treasury yields from its stablecoin, trading continues to constitute the majority of its revenue. This dependence creates a direct correlation between Gemini\u2019s financial performance and the unpredictable fluctuations of crypto trading activity. A part of Gemini\u2019s diversification effort is its crypto-linked credit card, which transforms everyday spending into crypto rewards. Beyond creating new revenue streams from interchange fees, the card acts as a customer acquisition tool, as a considerable number of cardholders reportedly go on to use the exchange, thereby nurturing Gemini\u2019s core trading business while enhancing customer engagement. At its current market cap, Gemini has a price-to-sales ratio of about 16x projected revenue. This is considered relatively high, especially as its growth trajectory appears to be decelerating. In 2024, revenues increased by roughly 40% to $136 million, but the momentum has significantly slowed, with consensus estimates forecasting growth of only around 22% for this year. In fact, revenues in the first half of 2025 actually fell compared to the same period last year. Profitability also remains a significant issue. Gemini reported substantial losses in 2024, and those losses have continued to escalate. In the first half of 2025 alone, net losses reached $282 million, bringing the total in the trailing 12 months to about $400 million \u2014 a sharp increase from $159 million in 2024. Nevertheless, there are grounds for optimism. Comparatively more established crypto competitor Coinbase, which is anticipated to grow its revenue by around 13% this year, is trading at about 12x projected revenue - not far below Gemini\u2019s ratio. Additionally, Gemini has been receiving increased analyst attention in recent weeks, with most major banks adopting positive or neutral perspectives on the stock. This could also enhance investor visibility and possibly help stabilize the stock price. Considering these risks, investors might explore diversification strategies like the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns to investors. The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a dynamic way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

Silicon Valley's obsession with software has created a blind spot, and it might be where the next AI revolution begins, said Reid Hoffman. The LinkedIn cofounder said on an episode of the a16z podcast published Monday that the tech industry's \"everything should be done in software\" mindset has become a limitation. That belief, which fueled decades of Silicon Valley success, now risks keeping innovators from seeing new opportunities, Hoffman said. \"What are the areas where the AI revolution will be magical?\" Hoffman asked. \"That's probably where I've been putting the majority of my co-founding time, invention time.\" Hoffman said the next generation of iconic AI companies will likely emerge from fields that most investors consider too complex, slow, or regulated to touch \u2014 and one of those areas is biology. \"I've been thinking about the intersection of the worlds of atoms and the worlds of bits,\" Hoffman said. \"What are things that elevate human life?\" Hoffman said he isn't betting on AI being able to design drugs independently. Instead, he said AI tools could guide scientists toward the most promising experiments. \"Simply doing prediction and getting that prediction right \u2014 and by the way, it doesn't have to be right 100% of the time,\" he said. \"It has to be right like 1% of the time, because you can validate the other 99%\" \"It's not a needle in a haystack. It's like a needle in a solar system. But you could possibly do that,\" he added. Hoffman did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Hoffman's comments come as AI in healthcare builds momentum. Ark Invest's CEO Cathie Wood said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September that the real AI revolution is happening in hospitals and labs. Combining AI with advances in gene sequencing and CRISPR technology \u2014 a technology scientists use to modify DNA selectively \u2014 could spark a medical transformation, said the investor known for bold bets on disruptive tech. \"This is the sleeper. It's the most inefficiently priced part of the market,\" Wood said. Tech's biggest players are already racing to stake their claims in the sector. Microsoft has been integrating AI into its cloud solutions to automate hospital operations. Earlier this year, Microsoft said its medical AI system diagnosed cases more accurately than human doctors by a wide margin in a study. Nvidia is also pushing deeper into the sector. Its VP of healthcare, Kimberly Powell, told Business Insider in April that medical imaging was one of Nvidia's entry points into healthcare. The company has notched several medical imaging partnerships powered by its AI platforms, most recently with GE Healthcare in March.

Gold is trading more like a trending stock on Reddit than a haven for investors, and may have topped out after its record surge, billionaire investor Bill Gross told Business Insider. The yellow metal fell as much as 6.3% on Tuesday, suffering its worst drop in 12 years. The drop coincided with an even steeper 8.7% decline in spot silver prices. The moves suggest investors are taking profits after gold and silver's record-setting gains this year, and perhaps acting on Gross's latest warning. After cautioning investors in a Friday post on X to \"wait awhile\" if they wanted to buy gold, the Wall Street billionaire known as the \"Bond King\" told Business Insider in an email that gold was \"exhibiting characteristics of meme and momentum stocks.\" Gross, who cofounded PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly three decades, meant that gold has soared in price partly because of hype and speculation, making it more volatile and vulnerable to a sudden, sharp decline. Gross told Business Insider that gold was still \"sensitive to short-term interest rates,\" referring to the metal's tendency to rise in price when borrowing costs drop. That's because falling rates make gold more appealing to investors relative to cash and bonds as their yields decline. Lower rates can also accelerate inflation, making gold a more attractive hedge against rising prices, and signal economic trouble, feeding demand for gold as a safe investment. Gold has also soared this year because central banks have been buying historically large amounts of it due to \"policy uncertainty,\" Gross said. Trade wars, military conflicts, and political discord have fueled doubts about the outlook for markets and the global economy. Gross told Business Insider that gold would likely \"hold up better than stocks\" in the weeks ahead, adding that a disappointing earnings season could rein in the bull market. But he said there might be a price pullback after two strong months of trading, creating \"perhaps a better time to buy.\" The veteran investor said \"momentum, policy, and perhaps interest rates will be dominant factors\" in gold's price trajectory. He added that Treasury yields are pricing in a drop in the Fed Funds rate to around 3% so a \"very bearish economy\/earnings report would be needed to drive it further absent momentum influences.\" Gross has previously called out social media hype and FOMO-fueled speculation in markets. In 2022, he described meme stocks AMC and GameStop as \"lottery tickets,\" saying they could rise but were highly volatile and their valuations weren't supported by fundamentals. He said that each buying frenzy ends with a \"musical chair, me-first exit\" from the stock du jour. The bond billionaire said last summer that Tesla was behaving like a meme stock, given its \" straight-up price action\" despite \"sagging fundamentals.\" Gross has sold options on GameStop, AMC, Trump Media, and other meme stocks, betting they'll expire worthless and he could keep the premiums without paying anything.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CME (NASDAQ:CME), the largest derivatives marketplace in the world, is preparing to announce its Q3 2025 earnings on Wednesday, October 22. The firm manages essential exchanges including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, where investors and institutions engage in trading futures and options to protect against fluctuations in interest rates, commodities, and equity indexes. Revenue is projected to be around $1.53 billion, reflecting a 3% decrease year-over-year, according to consensus estimates, while earnings are anticipated to be approximately $2.63 per share. Demand for CME\u2019s benchmark futures and options has increased as companies rely on the firm\u2019s exchanges to mitigate their business risks across various asset classes. The exchange recorded its second-highest average daily volume (ADV) ever in Q3 2025, reaching 25.3 million contracts, with trading in cryptocurrency contracts also hitting a record quarterly ADV of 340,000 contracts. The company boasts a current market capitalization of $96 billion. Over the past twelve months, it generated $6.4 billion in revenue, and it maintained operational profitability with $4.2 billion in operating profits and a net income of $3.8 billion. While much will depend on how the results compare to consensus and expectations, analyzing historical trends could potentially favor those who are event-driven traders. There are two approaches to this: either grasp the historical probabilities and position ahead of the earnings announcement, or analyze the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns after earnings, positioning yourself accordingly once the results are released. Nevertheless, if you're looking for growth with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative \u2013 having surpassed the S&P 500 and producing returns greater than 105% since its beginning.

A relatively lower-risk strategy (although not effective if the correlation is minimal) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that shows the highest correlation, and execute the correct trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D demonstrate the strongest correlation, a trader might position themselves \u201clong\u201d for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is scheduled to release its earnings on Wednesday, October 22, 2025. We anticipate that the company will report quarterly revenues of approximately $3.1 billion, bolstered by stronger aluminum prices and increased shipment volumes. Nevertheless, margins are expected to experience slight pressure due to high energy costs and input inflation, somewhat mitigated by cost-control measures. While better pricing and productivity improvements should enhance profitability, persistent volatility in alumina and bauxite markets could restrict near-term margin growth. The recovery in demand from aerospace, automotive, and packaging sectors continues to support volume expansion, but significant earnings growth will depend on maintained price strength and enhancements in operational efficiency over the next few quarters. The company has a current market capitalization of $9.4 billion. Revenue over the past year was $13 billion, and it operated profitably with $1.6 billion in operating profits and a net income of $1.0 billion. Much will rely on how the results compare to consensus expectations, but grasping historical trends may just improve the odds in your favor if you are a trader focused on events.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. With Oracle stock decreasing 10% in a week, it\u2019s prudent to reassess it in relation to its competitors. The recent sell-off comes amid concerns about the margins for the company\u2019s cloud computing business, as well as rising capital costs. Regularly evaluating alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Below is how Oracle (ORCL) stock compares with its peers in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margin. For some quick background, Oracle offers cloud software as a service, industry-specific cloud solutions, application licenses, license support, an enterprise database, a development language, and middleware services. Recently, ORCL stock has seen a significant decline, and we currently consider it relatively overvalued. While this may seem like a buying opportunity, relying solely on one stock involves considerable risk. Conversely, a diversified approach offers substantial value, as demonstrated with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you invest in a single stock you favor, or develop a portfolio crafted to succeed across various cycles? Our data indicates that the High Quality Portfolio has transformed stock-picking uncertainty into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is included in the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a wealth manager located in the Boston area and a partner of Trefis \u2013 whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P fell by more than 40%.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to announce its earnings on Thursday, October 30, 2025. It is anticipated that earnings will be approximately $1.76 per share, with revenues potentially increasing by around 7% to $101.72 billion. This growth is likely to be partly fueled by the recent iPhone 17 lineup, which was launched about 12 days prior to the end of the quarter. Apple seems to be undergoing a more robust upgrade cycle than anticipated, as the base iPhone 17 model offers greater value than previous versions, coupled with new Pro variants priced at a premium compared to last year. Reports suggest that these models are witnessing higher demand compared to previous years, as indicated by extended delivery times for customers. The company\u2019s Services segment is also projected to perform well, boosted by increasing subscription sales and a growing base of active devices. The company's current market capitalization stands at $3.7 trillion. Over the past twelve months, revenue totaled $409 billion, and the company recorded $130 billion in operating profits, leading to a net income of $99 billion. While much will hinge on how the results compare to analysts' consensus and expectations, familiarizing yourself with historical trends might increase your chances as an event-driven trader. There are two strategies to consider: either understand the historical probabilities and position yourself prior to the earnings release, or examine the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns following earnings and adjust your position accordingly after the earnings are disclosed. That said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative \u2013 it has outperformed the S&P 500 and produced returns exceeding 105% since its launch. See earnings reaction history of all stocks A few insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Further information regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings is compiled in the table below. A comparatively lower-risk strategy (though not effective if the correlation is weak) involves assessing the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identifying a pair with the highest correlation, and executing the relevant trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can take a \"long\" position for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Presented below is some correlation data based on both 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a mix of all three, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), yielding strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you prefer upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock like Apple, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved >105% returns since its inception.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"                 reading time 4 minutes        With the electric vehicle tax credit gone, the American EV industry is facing an existential moment. Auto giant GM, a leader in both gas-powered and electric vehicle industries, is at its own crossroads too. The company announced in its third-quarter earnings call that it will be scaling back some of its EV production even further. GM is now stopping production of its Chevrolet BrightDrop electric vans at the CAMI assembly plant in Ontario, Canada, and will start to assess the site for future opportunities. The company had halted production at the plant in April and laid off about 1,200 workers, but had initially said the move was temporary, with production expected to resume in October. \u201cThis is not a decision we made lightly because of the impact on our employees. However, the commercial electric van market has been developing much lower than expected, and changes to the regulatory framework and fleet incentives have made the business even more challenging,\u201d GM CEO Mary Barra said in the earnings call on Tuesday. The decision is part of a broader company strategy shift back from EVs to traditional gas-powered vehicles in preparation for weakening demand. American electric vehicles cost a lot. Even the cheapest options cost $10,000-20,000 more than their Chinese counterparts. As a result, the electric vehicle tax credit was a huge boon for EV demand in the U.S. as it lifted the burden on consumers. It also incentivized automakers to make newer, better electric vehicles. GM was one of these traditional automakers that made electric vehicles a core part of their strategy. The company made a significant commitment to completely electrify its fleet by 2035, with executives frequently calling electric vehicles the company\u2019s \u201cnorth star.\u201d With the credit now gone, the industry braces itself for a huge drop in demand. GM executives think demand will suffer for the remainder of the year and into 2026 before it levels off and finds its natural state. \u201cUnder the changing regulatory environment, we expect EV demand growth to slow pretty significantly from what it was going to be, and so we need to make sure that we right-size the capacity footprint to be able to not have to absorb a lot of those fixed costs,\u201d CFO Paul Jacobson said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s unfortunate, I think it is a quick adjustment to the reality around us that we\u2019re facing.\u201d The company recently shared that it will be taking a $1.6 billion hit this quarter, stemming from a drop in the value of EV plants and equipment and supplier contract cancellation costs. Instead of EVs, GM is refocusing some of its attention back to gasoline-powered internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with \u201cincremental investments,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThose are going to be around longer and probably more in demand than they otherwise would have been under the prior regulatory environment,\u201d he said. Late last year, GM decided to sell its $2.6 billion stake in an EV battery cell plant in Michigan to LG Energy Solutions. Earlier this year, the company shared plans to transition its Orion assembly plant from building EVs to gas-powered vehicles. But even with all the odds against them, electric vehicles persist. With 67,000 deliveries, GM was number two in the U.S. EV market this past quarter, Jacobson pointed out, posing real competition to market leader Tesla. As demand finds its natural state, and competitors who were in the EV game just because of the tax incentives retreat, GM executives believe their strong positioning will help their EV operations succeed. \u201cLet\u2019s remember, there was EV adoption before the $7,500 tax credit, and there will be EV adoption afterwards,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cI think those customers are looking for the quality and the range of vehicles that we can provide with our platforms, and I think that will bode well for us.\u201d GM executives think the performance of its more popular EV models, like the Chevrolet Equinox, will only improve in a smaller EV market. So, the company will continue to build its top-selling EVs and will instead refocus its efforts on bringing the price tag down. \u201cThe last couple of years have been about expanding the portfolio of EVs. For the next few years, it\u2019s going to be about lowering the cost and making structural improvements to the battery cells and to the architecture going forward,\u201d Jacobson said. That prediction might be an industry-wide trend. Tesla unveiled two affordable EV models earlier this month. But the new designs were just stripped-down versions of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, and the cars are still more expensive than their premium versions were with the EV tax credit. Profitability is the next frontier of the American EV industry. With increasingly cheaper competition churning out abroad and without the help of the EV tax credit, the American industry needs to crack the code on cheaper yet still well-performing electric vehicles to be able to continue its growth. While the industry is still far from achieving that, product strategy seems to be moving in that direction.

The car maker expects slower EV adoption and billions in losses under Trump-era policies.                     Scammers are pretending to be Elon Musk.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Applied Digital is a rapidly expanding AI data center operator, securing large contracts and building new capacity to meet soaring demand.Broadcom is a strong contender in AI infrastructure, providing innovative, cost-effective custom AI chips that outperform competitors.Eli Lilly dominates the booming diabetes- and obesity-drug markets with blockbuster products and has a robust pipeline of new treatments. It's tough to say for sure which growth stocks will be winners without a crystal ball. But investors may wish to consider investing in AI data center operator Applied Digital, AI semiconductor provider Broadcom and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. These three companies have solid prospects for gains in addition to some better-known companies, such as Nvidia and Palantir.  Applied Digital, Broadcom and Lilly have the potential to rise in the short and long term. If they beat earnings targets and raise guidance, their share prices will keep rising. If they tap their strong competitive positions to win more market share, they'll see lasting success. These stocks were selected based on their rapid growth, good chance of exceeding expectations, and strong products and management. If a company is growing rapidly now and has a track record of beating expectations, its stock is likely to rise. However, to sustain those increases over time, a company must innovate. If the company has great products and excellent management, better-than-expected growth is more likely to last. The three best growth stocks are ranked below in descending order of their stock price change in 2025 as of Oct. 21. More generally, the three stocks are ranked from the highest to lowest return and risk. Read on to learn why. Although it is not profitable, Applied Digital has grown rapidly. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenue increased 84% to $64.2 million, exceeding analyst expectations by $14.2 million, CNBC reported.  Applied Digital is benefiting from soaring demand for AI data centers. An estimated $350 billion will be spent in 2025 by large cloud services providers called hyperscalers. CoreWeave \u2013 a leading AI cloud services provider \u2013 recently leased 150 megawatts of Applied Digital\u2019s Polaris Forge 1 campus, bringing Applied Digital's total anticipated contracted lease revenue to about $11 billion over 15 years, CNBC also reported..  Strong demand for Applied Digital\u2019s services looks likely to continue at least through 2026. That's one reason, the company is building a 200 megawatt Polaris Forge 2 campus and is in \u201cadvanced discussions with hyperscalers,\u201d according to CRN, with management projecting leased capacity for both Applied Digital campuses as high as 600 MW. Broadcom is benefiting from demand for AI infrastructure. In the company\u2019s third quarter of fiscal year 2025, AI semiconductor revenue grew 53% to $5.2 billion. The company is also gaining from a shift in AI chip architecture through Broadcom\u2019s 65% revenue share of application-specific integrated circuits for hyperscalers, according to Ainvest.  Broadcom provides hyperscalers with AI chips that deliver faster performance at lower prices than Nvidia\u2019s products. The chip provider\u2019s clients include Google, Meta, ByteDance and reportedly OpenAI, \u201crepresenting a strategic alternative to purchasing Nvidia's GPUs,\" CNBC said.  More specifically, Broadcom\u2019s custom AI accelerators deliver three to five times better performance-per-watt than Nvidia GPUs at a roughly $20,000 to $15,000 lower per unit cost, Datagravity estimated. Such innovation has enabled Broadcom to exceed Wall Street expectations for eight consecutive quarters, typically resulting in 10% to 20% stock increases on earnings-announcement days, Ainvest reported. Broadcom\u2019s stock price could rise in November. A September announcement of a $10 billion order for the Titan AI inference chip from a fourth hyperscale customer\u2014 believed to be OpenAI \u2014demonstrates Broadcom is winning new hyperscale customers. Though this program is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026,  pre-production revenue and additional design wins could emerge in fourth-quarter 2025 results,  Tom's Hardware predicted.  Eli Lilly is an American pharmaceutical company combining strong profitability and rapid growth with its market-leading diabetes and obesity treatments. Lilly\u2019s latest financial results,  in the second quarter of 2025 showed that revenue rose 38% to $15.56\u202fbillion, with net income increasing  91% to nearly $6.7 billion, according to a company release. Lilly dominates the market for diabetes and weight loss drugs. More specifically, Lilly controls about 57% of the U.S. market for incretins \u2013 enjoying a competitive advantage over rival Novo Nordisk, Reuters reported.  Lilly has experienced rapid growth in demand for two drugs: Mounjaro, which helps manage blood-sugar levels in adults with diabetes, and Zepbound, for treating obesity and weight-related conditions. In Q2, sales of these products grew 68% to $5.2 billion for Mounjaro and 172% to nearly $3.4 billion for Zepbound. The company communicated its optimism about future growth, raising its full-year 2025 guidance above Wall Street expectations. It's projecting $60 billion to $62\u202fbillion in revenue and EPS between $21.75 and $23.00 amid strong demand.  A new obesity treatment called retatrutide, which is expected to report positive trial results late in 2025, provides another reason for optimism, Pharmaceutical-Journal noted. Moreover, An Alzheimer\u2019s therapy called donanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, was approved in 2025 and could help Lilly exceed investor\u2019s revenue expectations. Investors looking for stocks with upside potential may consider betting on shares of Applied Digital, Broadcom and Eli Lilly. While Applied Digital is losing money and investing to build capacity, its rapid revenue growth and feverish demand from hyperscalers makes it a compelling short-term investment.  Broadcom is a much larger, profitable beneficiary of AI chip demand while Lilly\u2019s commanding lead in the booming markets for treatment of diabetes and obesity is propelling rapid growth, which could be even faster if the company shares positive results from new drug trials.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"AI-generated images are rapidly replacing traditional photography in portraying extreme poverty, while stock photo websites are increasingly flooded with visuals created using Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other image generators. In an article for The Lancet, researcher Arsenii Alenichev calls the phenomenon \u201cpoverty porn 2.0.\u201d \u201cIt is quite clear that various organizations are starting to consider synthetic images instead of real photography, because it\u2019s cheap and you don\u2019t need to bother with consent and everything,\u201d says Alenichev. A search for \u201cpoverty\u201d on Adobe Stock and Freepik \u2014 two popular stock photo websites \u2014 turns up scores of AI-generated images  CEO of Freepik Joaqu\u00edn Abela tells the Guardian that consumers are driving demand for AI images, claiming it is not the platform\u2019s responsibility.  \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to dry the ocean. We make an effort, but in reality, if customers worldwide want images a certain way, there is absolutely nothing that anyone can do,\u201d Abela says.  Even big players like the United Nations have turned to AI: a video depicting \u201cre-enactments\u201d of sexual violence in conflict was taken down after the Guardian contacted them. However, a video (below) from Plan International remains online that features AI imagery.  For years, the debate around \u201cpoverty porn\u201d and photography has raged, with arguments being made that subjects are reduced to mere props; think of the staged photograph by Edwin Ong Wee Kee. \u201cIt saddens me that the fight for more ethical representation of people experiencing poverty now extends to the unreal,\u201d Kate Kardol, an NGO communications consultant, tells the Guardian. Alenichev, who works at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, says that the AI images \u201creplicate the visual grammar of poverty\u201d and he\u2019s collected hundreds of AI images used by aid agencies that are not only unreal but also perpetuate stereotypes.  Adobe Stock, which didn\u2019t comment on the Guardian\u2019s story, earlier this year denied reports that the website\u2019s portfolio was nearly 50 percent AI-generated images. Photographer Robert Kneschke\u2019s research found that 300 million AI images were uploaded in just three years \u2014 it took 20 years for photographers to upload that many real photos to Adobe Stock. While Adobe disputes those numbers, what is clear is just how easy it is to make AI images that look like real photos.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is scheduled to announce its Q3 2025 earnings on Thursday, October 23, 2025. Consensus estimates project earnings to be around $0.35 per share, a decrease from $0.49 per share in the same period last year, while revenues are expected to slightly increase to approximately $43.42 billion. Ford\u2019s sales in the United States have been robust, with the automaker reporting the sale of 545,522 vehicles in Q3, marking an 8.2% increase year over year. This growth was fueled by heightened demand for electric vehicles as consumers looked to capitalize on federal tax incentives that expired in September. Additionally, Ford's trucks have performed well, with the F-Series selling 207,732 units, representing a 4.7% year-over-year increase. However, sales in international markets are anticipated to be less strong over the quarter. The company has a current market capitalization of $46 billion. Over the past twelve months, revenue totaled $185 billion, and it was operationally profitable, reporting $2.9 billion in operating profits and a net income of $3.2 billion. Although much will rely on how the results compare with consensus expectations, being aware of historical trends might improve your odds if you are an event-driven trader. There are two approaches to achieve this: either comprehend the historical likelihoods and position yourself before the earnings announcement, or examine the relationship between immediate and medium-term returns following earnings and adjust your position accordingly after the earnings are disclosed.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Tesla is scheduled to release earnings after Wednesday\u2019s close. The stock hit a record high of $488.54\/share in December 2024 and is currently trading near $447. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $0.52\/share on $26.27 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $0.61\/share. The Whisper number is the Street\u2019s unofficial view on earnings.  Earlier this year, Elon Musk left the D.O.G.E. to focus on Tesla and his other companies. Investors want to see what the numbers look like now that it has been a few quarters since he is back focused full-time on his businesses. The company has seen up and down earnings over the last few years.  In 2020, the company earned $0.75\/share. In 2021, earnings jumped to $2.26. Then, earnings grew again to $4.07 in 2022. Then, earnings fell to $3.12 in 2023. In 2024, earnings fell to $2.28. In 2025, earnings are expected to fall to $1.75. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow to $2.46\/share. The stock sports a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 225 which is roughly 9 times higher than the benchmark S&P 500.  Technically, the stock has had a big run over the last few weeks and is building a bullish base. The stock is currently -8.4% below its 52-week high and is trading above its 50 and 200 DMA lines. The bulls want to see the stock gap up after reporting earnings and the bears want to see it gap down. Tesla is considered a true market leader and is one of the strongest winners in the history of the U.S. stock market. Tesla went public on June 29, 2010, with an initial public offering price of $17 per share, raising over $226 million. Since its IPO, Tesla's stock has experienced significant fluctuations and significant growth. It is currently in one of its long down periods but the stock has managed to breakout of these long trading ranges and race higher.  After the IPO, Tesla's stock price remained relatively flat for the first few years. The company was primarily focused on surviving financially and preparing to launch its first built-from-scratch electric vehicle, the Model S sedan, which debuted in 2012.  From 2013 onwards, Tesla's stock began to rise as the company expanded its product line and increased production capacity. Key milestones during this period included the introduction of the Model X, Model Y, and the Model 3, which helped Tesla dominate the EV market globally.  Tesla\u2019s stock saw a dramatic increase in value since the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by strong sales growth, increased production, and investor enthusiasm for electric vehicles.In March 2020, the stock was trading near $34 and it is currently trading near $333!Even though it is a down from its 2024 high, stepping back, that is a massive move.  Tesla, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally.  The company operates in two segments, Automotive, and Energy Generation and Storage. The Automotive segment offers electric vehicles, as well as sells automotive regulatory credits; and non-warranty after-sales vehicle, used vehicles, body shop and parts, supercharging, retail merchandise, and vehicle insurance services.  This segment also provides sedans and sport utility vehicles through direct and used vehicle sales, a network of Tesla Superchargers, and in-app upgrades; purchase financing and leasing services; services for electric vehicles through its company-owned service locations and Tesla mobile service technicians; and vehicle limited warranties and extended service plans.  The Energy Generation and Storage segment engages in the design, manufacture, installation, sale, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, and related services to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and utilities through its website, stores, and galleries, as well as through a network of channel partners; and provision of service and repairs to its energy product customers, including under warranty, as well as various financing options to its solar customers.  The company was formerly known as Tesla Motors, Inc. and changed its name to Tesla, Inc. in February 2017. Tesla, Inc. was incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. For the first time in its history, Japan has elected a woman to its highest political office. On October 21, 2025, Sanae Takaichi became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister a moment that has captivated both global headlines and financial markets. Her rise is more than symbolic. It comes at a moment when Japan\u2019s economy, equity markets, and corporate culture are already undergoing a profound shift toward modernization and efficiency. The question for investors is simple: does this mark the start of Japan\u2019s next great bull run? Takaichi\u2019s election represents a historic breakthrough in a country where gender parity in leadership has long lagged behind its economic sophistication. Yet investors shouldn\u2019t mistake her gender milestone for a sharp ideological shift. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has built her career as a pragmatic conservative focused on fiscal stimulus, industrial policy, and national security rather than sweeping social reform. Her early cabinet appointments signal continuity with the Abe economic doctrine, often called Abenomics: a combination of monetary easing, fiscal expansion, and structural reforms aimed at combating deflation and reviving growth. But she has added her own emphasis channeling government investment into semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and defense technologies, while maintaining Japan\u2019s delicate balance between fiscal prudence and proactive stimulus. Investors have responded swiftly. The Nikkei 225 touched new highs following her election, powered by consumer and technology shares. Markets are betting that renewed fiscal expansion, coupled with Japan\u2019s ongoing corporate governance revolution, could lift profitability and returns to levels unseen in decades. Indeed, Japan\u2019s market dynamics are among the most intriguing globally right now. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has been pressing listed firms to improve return on equity (ROE), unwind cross-shareholdings, and deploy cash more productively. This wave of reform aimed squarely at better capital efficiency is already transforming boardrooms and investor expectations. The result is a market where balance sheets are stronger, dividends are rising, and valuations remain attractive relative to Western peers.  For investors who have long viewed Japan as a \u201cvalue trap,\u201d these structural changes are starting to rewrite the narrative. Japan\u2019s macroeconomic environment remains challenging with an aging population, tight labor markets, and persistent inflationary pressures. Yet those very headwinds are forcing reform. Takaichi has floated the idea of issuing new bonds to fund strategic investment, echoing post-war reconstruction-era ambitions to rebuild national competitiveness through targeted industrial support. Her focus aligns with a global shift toward economic nationalism and strategic autonomy. Sectors such as advanced manufacturing, AI, cybersecurity, green infrastructure, and defense technology stand to benefit most from this policy direction. At the same time, consumer-facing industries could gain from targeted spending that boosts domestic demand and tourism ahead of major events like the Osaka Expo in 2025. If history offers any guide, investors might take comfort from similar leadership transitions abroad. When Margaret Thatcher became the United Kingdom\u2019s first female prime minister in 1979, the FTSE All-Share Index delivered a roughly 4.3% gain in her first year in office. Likewise, when Angela Merkel assumed Germany\u2019s chancellorship in 2005, the DAX Index began a sustained period of expansion, climbing nearly 7% in her first twelve months and more than 60% over her first term. Leadership matters not only in politics but in the psychology of markets. Symbolic change often coincides with a shift in investor sentiment and reform momentum. Japan now finds itself at a similar inflection point, with structural tailwinds and global attention converging. Of course, not every headline leads to a bull market. Several cautionary factors remain. Takaichi\u2019s governing coalition is a partnership between the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) and together they hold a slimmer majority than past governments, raising questions about political durability. Fiscal expansion will test Japan\u2019s already-elevated debt-to-GDP ratio. And while she has pledged to advance women\u2019s empowerment, her cabinet remains overwhelmingly male, underscoring the slow pace of social change. Geopolitically, her hawkish stance toward China and support for a more assertive defense posture could have mixed implications for regional investors. A stronger yen or shifts in energy prices could also complicate export dynamics. For those considering exposure, several themes stand out: Japan\u2019s first female prime minister is not just a political milestone, it may be the catalyst for a broader market re-rating. Corporate governance reforms are unlocking trapped value, the yen remains undervalued by most measures, and policymakers are signaling a renewed commitment to growth. Yet execution will determine whether this optimism endures. Investors would be wise to balance enthusiasm with selectivity by emphasizing companies that are both aligned with Takaichi\u2019s growth agenda and responsive to shareholder discipline. The symbolism of Japan\u2019s first female leader will dominate headlines. But the substance of fiscal policy, governance reform, and market discipline could define the decade. History suggests that when nations embrace reform under fresh leadership, markets tend to respond favorably. Japan may be poised to prove that true once again.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Las Vegas Sands stock (NYSE: LVS), a casino and resort company engaged in operations in Macau and Singapore, is scheduled to announce its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, October 22, 2025. Analysts anticipate that the company will report adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share on $3.05 billion in revenue. This would represent a 41% increase in earnings and a 14% rise in sales compared to the previous year's figures of $0.44 per share and $2.68 billion, respectively. Investors will closely monitor the company\u2019s performance in light of ongoing challenges, including macroeconomic pressures and tariff issues. Historical data indicates that the stock has risen 65% of the time on the day following earnings reports, with a median gain of 4.3% and maximum one-day positive returns reaching 11%.

We anticipate the company will report quarterly revenues of approximately $5.2 billion, benefiting from increased gold and copper prices along with stable production levels at important sites. Nonetheless, margins could experience slight pressure due to rising labor and energy costs, as well as persistent inflation in mining supplies.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Netflix Inc. Inc. scheduled to report earnings after Tuesday\u2019s close. The stock hit a record high of $1,341\/share in June 2025 and, as of this writing, it is currently trading near $1,240. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $6.89\/share on $11.52 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $6.96\/share. The Whisper number is the Street\u2019s unofficial view on earnings. The company has managed to grow its earnings over the last few years. In 2018, the company earned $2.68, and in 2024 the company earned $19.83, which is a very large increase! Additionally, the company is expected to earn $26.39 in 2025 and in 2026, earnings are expected to grow to $32.39. The company sports a price to earnings ratio of 53, which is 2.1x the S&P 500.  Technically, the stock is acting well as it continues tracing out a multi-month base to consolidate the big run it had since April. The stock is less than 8% below its record high which means it will not take a lot for it to breakout of this base and race higher. Netflix is also a high ranked setup on BreakoutsAndSetups.com - which is encouraging to see. If Netflix gaps up and breaks out after reporting earnings, it will move and become a breakout. Once it does that, it can easily start another leg higher. Conversely, if it gaps down and falls after earnings, then it will likely need more time before it can hit fresh record highs. Bottom line, the bulls want to see the stock gap up and rally after reporting earnings and the bears want to see it gap down and fall.    The stock has has established itself as a true market leader, demonstrating exceptional performance and influence across the tech, entertainment, and broader market. Netflix is one of the strongest stocks in the market and has earned the right to be called a True Market Leader.  Netflix, Inc. provides entertainment services. It offers TV series, documentaries, feature films, and games across various genres and languages. The company also provides members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes, and mobile devices. It has operations in approximately 190 countries. The company was incorporated in 1997 and is headquartered in Los Gatos, California. Netflix, Inc. is a trailblazing American media company that has revolutionized the way people watch movies and television. The company was founded in 1997 in Scotts Valley, California, by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. The inspiration for Netflix reportedly came after Hastings was charged a hefty late fee for a rented movie, which led the co-founders to imagine a more convenient, customer-friendly approach to home entertainment. At the time, the video rental industry was dominated by brick-and-mortar stores like Blockbuster, which relied on late fees and limited selection. Netflix\u2019s founders saw an opportunity to leverage the internet and the emerging DVD format to create a better experience. Netflix launched its website in 1998, offering an online DVD rental service. Customers could browse a catalog of titles, order DVDs online, and have them delivered to their homes by mail. The company\u2019s innovative approach eliminated late fees and allowed users to keep DVDs as long as they wanted, returning them in prepaid envelopes when finished. This model quickly gained popularity, especially after Netflix introduced a subscription service that allowed for unlimited rentals for a flat monthly fee. The convenience, selection, and customer-centric policies helped Netflix stand out in a crowded market and build a loyal subscriber base. As the company grew, Netflix invested heavily in technology, particularly in developing sophisticated recommendation algorithms that suggested titles based on user preferences. This personalized touch helped keep subscribers engaged and increased customer satisfaction. By the mid-2000s, Netflix had established itself as a major player in the home entertainment market, even as competitors like Blockbuster struggled to adapt to the changing landscape. The most significant turning point in Netflix\u2019s history came in 2007, when it introduced streaming video. This new service allowed subscribers to instantly watch movies and television shows on their computers, bypassing the need for physical DVDs altogether. Streaming marked the beginning of a new era, as Netflix shifted its focus from mail-order rentals to on-demand digital content. The company rapidly expanded its streaming library and began making deals with studios to license popular movies and TV shows. Recognizing the importance of exclusive content, Netflix made another bold move by producing its own original programming. The release of \"House of Cards\" in 2013 signaled the company\u2019s arrival as a major force in Hollywood. Since then, Netflix has invested billions of dollars in original series, films, and documentaries, earning critical acclaim and numerous awards. Its global reach and commitment to diverse storytelling have made it a household name around the world. Today, Netflix is synonymous with streaming entertainment. It serves millions of subscribers in nearly every country and continues to shape the future of media with its innovative technology, vast content library, and ambitious original productions. The company\u2019s journey from a small DVD-by-mail service to a global entertainment powerhouse is a testament to its vision, adaptability, and relentless pursuit of customer satisfaction. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape.     Disclosure: The stock has been featured on FindLeadingStocks.com","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Packaging company Crown Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CCK) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenues, and raised fiscal 2025 guidance above consensus. Analysts rate CCK a \u201cBuy\u201d and its relative valuation suggests more room for upside. CCK stock is trading up from its previous close, but can it sustain the gains? Crown makes aluminum cans and aerosol containers. Beverage cans represented 67% of its sales in 2024. Crown sees a $40-45 billion total addressable market for beverage cans, driven by launches of new beverages and products (in cans), amid increasing off-premise consumption. Upgraded beverage manufacturing footprint and a 47% increase in global capacity has  helped Crown outpace market growth in the last 5 years and supported substantial increase in segment income and ROI.  Crown generated a record $814 million in adjusted free cash flow for 2024 and expects to top that with about $1 billion in 2025. The company has steadily reduced debt, bringing its adjusted net leverage ratio down from 4.7x in 2020 to 2.7x in 2024, and reaching its long-term target of 2.5x  at September end. For the third quarter, Crown earned $2.24 per share, excluding items, better than the consensus of $1.99. Revenue of $3.2 billion topped the $3.14 billion expected by analysts, while up 4.2% year-on-year. Driving the results was a 12% volume growth in European Beverage, leading to a gain of 27% in European segment income. As Europe shifts from glass bottles to aluminum cans, Crown appears well positioned to benefit.  CCK stock is trading higher after management again raised adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2025  to $7.70\u2013$7.80 from $7.10\u2013$7.50. The original adj. EPS guidance for 2025 was $6.70 to $7.10. Except for a one-quarter miss, Crown has now beaten analysts\u2019 earnings estimates for two years.  Crown markets aluminum\u2019s recyclability to reinforce its eco-friendly image and appeal to upscale customers, like luxury cosmetics brands and craft brewers. However,  improved alternatives could erode Crown\u2019s advantage over time.  Also, Crown\u2019s performance is closely tied to Aluminum prices. So, Crown tries to protect itself from price volatilities via a \u201cpass-through\u201d clause in its customer contracts, which allows it to pass on higher costs to customers if Aluminum prices rise. Conversely, such a clause can strain customer relationships if prices stay high.  As for tariffs, Crown roughly sees a $25 million impact from tariffs, which is less than $10 million in direct exposure, and $15 million related to softer demand amid broader uncertainties.  Investors rushing to buy after the guidance boost should recall what happened last time. When Crown raised its fiscal 2025 EPS outlook in July, the stock went as high as $108.74 the next day before flattening and trending lower. After closing Monday at $94.41, CCK is trading 3% higher currently.  Providing perspective on growth expectations, CEO Timothy J. Donahue noted during the earnings call: Providing perspective on growth expectations, CEO Timothy J. Donahue noted during the earnings call: Valuation: Crown trades at 12.5x forward earnings, about 25% below the sector median of 16.7x and its own five-year average of 13.9x. A re-rating to its historical average implies roughly 11% upside. At best, the stock could retest its 52-week high around $109, representing a 15% gain. But beyond that, the potential for near-term upside appears limited.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock has been on a strong upward trajectory, logging its sixth consecutive day of gains. Over this six-day period, the stock has delivered a cumulative return of 8%, adding approximately $242 billion to the company's value and bringing its current market capitalization to about $3.1 trillion. This impressive performance has been driven by a wave of positive news related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), including significant AI infrastructure investments, the integration of new AI products, and key advancements in AI research. Year-to-date, GOOGL stock is now 36.0% above its value at the end of 2024, substantially outperforming the S&P 500, which has returned 14.5% over the same period. Given the strength of this rally, the question for investors remains: Is GOOGL, which offers diverse products and services (including ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, cloud solutions, health technology, and internet services), still a buy, or is it time to lock in recent gains? Deep dive with Buy or Sell GOOGL. GOOGL stock has jumped meaningfully recently, and we currently find it relatively expensive. While this may feel like an opportunity, there is a significant risk in relying on a single stock. On the other hand, there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. The following table summarizes the return for GOOGL stock vs. the S&P 500 index over different periods, including the current streak:  What is the point? Momentum often precedes conviction. A multi-day win streak can signal growing investor confidence or spark follow-on buying. Tracking such trends can help you ride the strength, or prepare for a well-timed entry if momentum fades. There are currently 69 S&P constituents with 3 days or more of consecutive gains and 16 constituents with 3 days or more of consecutive losses. While GOOGL stock looks attractive given its winning streak, investing in a single stock without a detailed, thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.","label":1}

Already have an account?Sign in This weekly guide sorts the very best from the rest when it comes to the saturated world of sneaker releases, with information on release dates and where to buy. Please note: Some sneakers may sell out at speed. Raffles, friends and family releases, and player exclusives \u2014 all of that before a mere mention of the many fire general sneaker releases out there. The world of sneaker drops can be a tricky place to navigate, but we\u2019re here to help. Behold, the best of the best of what's arriving on shop floors this week.  This week\u2019s selection sees new chapters arrive for long-established collaborations \u2014 ASICS x INVINCIBLE and sacai x UGGs \u2014 as well as a variety of hardy hiking boots (which don't technically class as sneakers, but are too good to ignore).  The cream of the sneaker crop awaits you. What are you waiting for?  Release Date: October 25 Editor's Notes: The Nike G.T. Future is Nike's most futuristic basketball shoe, both visually and in terms of its technology. The sculptural silhouette, which looks like something from another planet, hides Nike's most advanced underfoot technology. Release Date: October 23 Editor's Notes: Celebrating a decade of collaborations, INVINCIBLE revives its deconstructed ASICS GEL-NIMBUS 10.1. Made from a mix of suede and plastic polymers, the industrial grey color scheme with hits of blue and red, references the digital age and glitch aesthetics.  Release Date: October 23 Editor's Notes:  \"For me, it's not about \u2018perfect' things, but real, honest, authentic things,\"  Universal Works' founder David Keyte told Highsnobiety ahead of the release of his first Paraboot collaboration.  That love for the imperfect led to this shoe (titled \"La Beaut\u00e9 Dans L\u2019Imperfection\"), which celebrates the distinct marks left by Paraboot's traditional shoemaking process. Handmade from calf leather that\u2019s smooth on one side and hairy on the other, the shoe's removable lace tab adds a final refined touch to this understated masterpiece. Release Date: Available Now Editor's Notes: One major reason why you see Salomon sneakers on the rails in practically every fashionable boutique these days is its mastery of colorways. We recently even interviewed the Salomon team to get to the bottom of all the beautiful palettes found on its shoes.  Here, the XT-Whisper's dusty purple hue with navy overlays is yet another banger.  Release Date: October 24 Editor's Notes:  How do you make one of the coziest winter shoes even warmer? Turn it into a hiking boot. That seems to be the thinking behind the second collaboration between UGG and Japanese luxury label sacai. The hiking-inspired silhouette even features an extra fuzzy coat of sheepskin peeking through the laces for extra coziness. Release Date: October 22 Editor's Notes: Here's a fact to make you feel old: It's been 30 years since the first PlayStation was released. And to celebrate three decades of game consoles, Sony has teamed up with Reebok.  The collaboration delivers a nostalgic, geeky twist to the classic Workout Plus sneaker. Its palette of white and grey mirrors the tones of the original PS1, while subtle co-branding and a removable lace attachment nod to the console\u2019s bulging memory cards. Release Date: October 25 Editor's Notes:  This wheat-toned rework of Clarks\u2019 classic Desert Boot comes via Japanese mega-retailer Beams. The upper, made from a blend of weatherproof GORE-TEX and suede, results in a shoe that manages to feel both smooth and rugged at once.  Want to keep browsing?

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio this Barry Ritholtz: This Week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Henry Ward, is CEO and co-founder of Carta. They\u2019re the company that keeps track of cap tables, compensation, valuation, liquidity for over 50,000 private companies. They work with 8,500 investment firms and over two and a half million equity holders to track all of this crucial information. It\u2019s kind kind of hard to imagine that they were doing this manually with stock certificates before Carta came along and digitized everything and put it all on the cloud. Fascinating company. Fascinating guy. I thought this was really a great conversation. With no further ado, the CEO and co-founder of Carta Henry Ward, welcome to Bloomberg. Henry Ward:\u00a0Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: Well, thanks so much for doing this. It\u2019s been a crazy week with the UN and everything, so I\u2019m glad you, you guys fought your way over. But I wanna start talking a little bit about your education and background. A bachelor\u2019s in mathematics and computer science from University of Michigan, go Blue and MSC in market finance from EDHEC. I am less familiar with Ed Heck than I am with Ish. What was the original career plan? Henry Ward:\u00a0You know, I went to University of Michigan originally to be a math major. Technically, my, my degree on my transcripts has a bachelor\u2019s of general studies. \u2019cause at that time to get a math degree, you were in the literature of Science and Arts College and you had to take two years of a foreign language. And I failed Japanese three times, tried Spanish, failed that twice. And my counselor was, and at the time I was supposed to go in the Marines and they said, look, I said to my counselor, you, I just need to graduate. And they said, well, look, if you switch to a general studies degree, you can, you can graduate. \u2019cause you have enough credits. It\u2019s kind of a generalist degree. \u2019cause you took a bunch of math, computer science and linguistics and you can graduate next year. And, and I said, let\u2019s do that. So it was me and 13 football players that graduated with a general studies degree that year. But, but the, my passion had always been math. I thought I\u2019d be a mathematician. My roommate was a computer scientist. He got me into computers and, and then I went into software engineering. Barry Ritholtz: So two questions. First, did you end up in the Marines? Henry Ward: I joined the Marines out of high school as an enlisted man. I, I went to Paris Island and then I later went into what\u2019s called Platoon Leaders course, which is like the Marine Corps version of rotc. I did that. But when I finally graduated, and sometimes I, I regret this, you know, you kind of look back at old decisions and at the time, four years, four more years and the Marines seemed like an eternity. Right now it seems like nothing book of an eye Barry Ritholtz: Would be, it would be gone, right? Henry Ward: \u00a0Yeah. I ended up deciding to pay back my, my GI bill because this was 2000. I graduated in 1999. My signing bonus paid off my entire college debt at the time, and I decided to go that route. So I, I never Barry Ritholtz: Where was the signing bonus? Where\u2019d you go? Henry Ward: I went to a company called Trilogy out Austin, Texas. And it was an incredibly formative experience for me. I it was a very smart company. They, they were gonna be the Google of the South for a variety of reasons. It didn\u2019t quite work out for them. They, the CEO is still there though, running Trilogy and it\u2019s a great private privately held company. But yeah, that\u2019s what took me into, into Texas. Barry Ritholtz: So I hear you saying you didn\u2019t do well with languages with Japanese, with Spanish, but am I reading this correctly? Did you get your masters, your MSC in France? Henry Ward: Yeah, I did because the, the business schools in France are mostly taught in English. Huh. And English is hard enough for me. So I had to, I had to stick with, with an English business school. The plan was never to go to business school. I, I wanted to ride my bicycle in southern France. It was a big tour to France. Watch here. I loved riding my bike. My fiance now, ex ex-wife was like, well, hey, if we\u2019re gonna go, I convinced her to come with me. We\u2019re gonna be productive. Let\u2019s go to business school while you train for the Iron Man and do all those things. And, Barry Ritholtz: And you did all of that? Henry Ward: Yeah. So we, we, but it was a French business school, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of work. There was a lot of riding, a lot of, a lot of eating bread. It was, it was a great couple years. Barry Ritholtz: That\u2019s a kind of fascinating mix of technical, financial, financial training, Marines and overseas study. How did that experience shape the way you think about building companies? Henry Ward: You know, I, I realized pretty quickly, I, I, I\u2019m not good at the military. My father was an army officer for a long time, and he used to tell me, you know, and the difference between military life and civilian life is in military life, you\u2019re, you\u2019re judged on the, the worst thing you do in civilian life, or certainly in startups. You\u2019re judged on the best thing you do. And, and I\u2019m very much, I do one or two things really well versus I do many things, you know, not wrong. And so I quickly realized the military was not not the right place for me. Investment banking was not the right place for me. I, I went to an investment bank after grad school, and then I discovered entrepreneurship sort of accidentally. And I, I realized this is what I was meant to do. Successful or unsuccessful. This is what I was meant to do. Barry Ritholtz: So let\u2019s talk about the predecessor firm to Carta second site, a portfolio optimization platform. You launched that not long after grad school. How did that experience influence how you approached the next venture? How did it affect what your plans were for scaling Carta? Henry Ward: The idea for second site was, it was like a wealth front or a betterment, one of these robo-advisors. But you know, Andy and Josh did a, a much better job than I I did, my company failed. And what I, what kind of rose outta the ashes of that was, and I got through the tr of depression after closing. It was, I couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else as a completely failed founder. I just wanted to do it again. And Carta came out of that experience. And it, it was one of these interesting things where the conventional wisdom for founders is you fall in love with a problem and entrepreneurship is a vehicle with which to that solve that problem. I was different. I fell in love with entrepreneurship. I fell in love with building a startup, and I just needed a problem. The problem was a vehicle with which to be a, a founder. And that really shapes how Carta is today. We\u2019re a heat seeking missile going after any problem we can find to solve to keep the business moving forward. And, and I, I talk a lot to early stage founders about this, is which one are you, are you in love with the being a founder? Are you in love with the problem? And both come with strengths and weaknesses. If you\u2019re in love with being the, in the problem, you know, you\u2019re passionate about the problem, you\u2019ll grind through the, the bad stages of being a founder to solve this problem. The, the downside is if the problem isn\u2019t actually that valuable, you kind of get stuck entrenched in this problem, right? And many founders burn and crash in that. The other side for me is, you know, because I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll work on any problem to, to move the company forward. There\u2019s often not a coherent strategy. It\u2019s like, I\u2019ll grab a problem over here, I\u2019ll grab a problem over there. And, and you can see it in the kind of diversity for, for a $500 million business, we have a, a large number of SKUs and business lines. And it\u2019s because we shoot at a lot of different targets. Barry Ritholtz: So let\u2019s talk about the initial target. How did you come up with the idea, hey, these cap tables, all the data around comp and valuation and VC investing. No one is really tracking this in a consistent, intelligent way. Like, what was that aha moment? Henry Ward:\u00a0I was working with Manu Kumar over at Canine Ventures on the, my previous company. And when we shut that down and, and we were talking about what am I gonna do next? He pointed out this cap table problem and, and was like, Hey, this is a real problem. I think you should solve it. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That\u2019s fascinating. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll invest in it. And, and he, he gave me this, this problem set to go after. And I, I spent a few months working on it and learning about it. What was really interesting was the first version of it was not cap table. So that\u2019s what everybody knows us for. The first version actually was PayPal for equity. It was, instead of, back then you used to mail a paper stock certificate, just like we used to do with the railroads, right? And it cost $50 in FedEx fees and a hundred bucks for the paralegal to print it. Barry Ritholtz: And somebody had to file it in a cabinet. And we were like, we said, Hey, why are we email or, you know, FedExing paper stock certificates, let\u2019s just email it. And, and that was the initial idea. And we realized companies didn\u2019t care that much. We thought the competition was FedEx. They didn\u2019t care that much about it, but they said, well, hey, if you\u2019re, you\u2019re emailing all this stuff, can you just put all of it into a table and show it to me? And we\u2019re like, yeah, we can do that. That sounds pretty good. And that was the thing that had product market fit, was just showing them everything we issued. And then once you had the cap table of the company, my, my heat seeking missile instincts were like, well, what else could we do? And then we launched four nine A and stock option expense accounting and employee management and cart total compensation and QSBS. And suddenly you could do so many things around this core system of record called the Cap Table. Huh. Barry Ritholtz: So fascinating. What was it like scaling that? What sort of technology issues did you run into? How much of the data you were finding? Was it all hand assembled or was there any mass amount of data that made it easy to navigate? What, what were the next few steps ? Henry Ward: I often tell earlier stage founders, you know, being a, you know, we\u2019re about 2000 employees now. The problems I deal with are no different than the early stage. They\u2019re just bigger, faster, harder. But they\u2019re the same, same set of problems. I I do the same thing every day than an early stage founder does. And it\u2019s really simple. It\u2019s talk to customers, figure out their problems, solve the product, build the product to solve their problems and make them happy. And that\u2019s just it. It is just rinse and repeat. Everything else is just, you know, overhead to building a, a a, building a company. And so these days, you know, I\u2019m in New York for, for a few days, half my meetings are our customer meetings. Barry Ritholtz: So this isn\u2019t just obviously public companies. This is public and private companies. How do they differ? My assumption is it\u2019s easier to track and access public companies data. What do you do on the private side? Henry Ward: Public company data and, you know, Bloomberg\u2019s a a great, you know, example of this is, is so ubiquitous and it\u2019s how do we manage this incredible set of data across massive ecosystems and networks in the public markets. Private markets is very different. It\u2019s, it\u2019s private there, there\u2019s no central place to access all this data. We have a lot of the data on what\u2019s happening in the private markets, particularly around venture capital and private equity. But because it\u2019s private, we can\u2019t share it. And that is the very unique interesting thing about what we do is we track all the much of the same data that like a Bloomberg would track, but we can\u2019t share it with anybody. And that\u2019s the, that\u2019s, many people have asked me, Hey, how come you haven\u2019t done blockchain? You know, blockchain seems like an obvious thing for a cap table to be put on. And the reason is our, our customers pay us to fix things when they\u2019re broken. And don\u2019t tell anybody about, tell, don\u2019t tell anybody about it. And blockchain is immutable and public. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s the big difference between private and public. Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. What was the hardest problem in assembling a private market set of data and cap tables across the whole technology ecosystem? Henry Ward: The big issue we had early was what I\u2019ll call the dematerialization of, of private stock. So the, the model that we think we look at is when Nixon pulled us off the gold standard, he dematerialized cash. You know, now the Federal Reserve could just create cash because cash was now put into the cloud. They could create money, they could do what, they could move money around without actually moving physical inventory. They dematerialized cash and gold and put it in the cloud. And this was in the seventies. We think of us as doing the same thing. Was everything in private markets until Carta was, was cash, it was paper equity, it was contracts, it was PDFs, it was documents. And we dematerialize that. We put it all in the cloud. So now everything could be moved around seamlessly. Getting the ecosystem of venture capital to believe in the dematerialization of private, private equity and private capital was the hardest part. \u2019cause it sounds crazy today, but in 2012 and 13, lawyers were like, no, but you, you have to have a, a green stock certificate with an embroider around it. Like that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing literally for 200 years. I would like, who are you to change this? Barry Ritholtz: I would\u2019ve thought if anybody would be amenable to let\u2019s go from physical paper to digital, it would be Silicon Valley venture capitalists. They were pushing back or their lawyers were pushing back. Henry Ward: The Lawyers are pushing back. But, but even the venture capitalists, \u2019cause the, the venture capitalists are, they\u2019re very interesting because they are stewards of what the future will be and prognosticators of it, but they\u2019re not users of it. And it\u2019s one of these things I I say a lot about AI is everybody thinks AI will change everybody\u2019s job except their own. And, and venture is the same. Like, oh, you know, all the companies should be using technology, but we don\u2019t because we\u2019re just pros. Barry Ritholtz: we\u2019re the professionals. We don\u2019t need it. Exactly. We\u2019re smarter than everybody else. Exactly. What was the aha moment where that ecosystem that was kind of pushing back said, oh, this is really useful and helpful. Yes, let\u2019s dematerialize, let\u2019s go digital. Henry Ward: It was the grassroots, the the way we got it going was the grassroots efforts of startups saying, Hey, they, they didn\u2019t understand that they were buying into a dematerialization model, but what they understood was, Hey, I can track my cap table cheaper, faster, better on Carta than anything else. And so they just came, came to us. That was the wedge, the net, the kind of the golden phrase is, you know, come, come for the tool, stay for the network. So the tool, the wedge was just better cap table management for one 10th of the cost. And then the network is, once everybody started converging on the cap tables, it became the new standard. So now it\u2019s a weird world, just like, it\u2019s a weird, weird, weird world to say that, you know, know we had paper stocks there to give it and that was the right way to do it. It is now a weird world to say, oh well why wouldn\u2019t we put it in the database on the cloud? Barry Ritholtz: And that becomes a self-reinforcing flywheel. You get a critical mass and then you could go out in, in all sorts of directions from from there. Henry Ward: \u00a0That\u2019s right. And nobody knows that better than, than Bloomberg and Mr. Bloomberg. \u2019cause that\u2019s exactly what Bloomberg did. Barry Ritholtz: That\u2019s exactly right. Started with the data\u2026 Coming up, we continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carta, talking about how a simple cap table management became an essential part of the startup world ~~~ Barry Ritholtz:\u00a0 My extra special guest today is Henry Ward. He is the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage cap tables and so much more when it comes to both public and private corporate data. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about this. You start with a simple capital table management kind of unglamorous, but sounds important, essential. Hey, I need to know how many shareholders I have, who owns what, what VCs, what, what employees own, how much stock, like I would\u2019ve thought that was around for 30, 40 years. How has nobody been doing that for, you know, you could practically go back to, you know, the launch of Intel 40 years ago. How has this not been a thing? Henry Ward: The one of the most common questions I got when I was raising money in the early days for this idea was, hey, this sounds kind of obvious. Why has nobody done this before? Right. And I, I, my answer was somewhat cheeky. And I, I always would say, how, how would I know I\u2019m doing it? And you know, I\u2019m the last person in the world that would know the answer to this. You should ask the SE 6.9 billion other people in the world that haven\u2019t done it. Who chose not to, right. Who chose not to. And I\u2019m, I\u2019m a least qualified person. I, I think it\u2019s just one of these inner innovator dilemma problems that the people that should have solved this should have been the investment banks. That should have been the ne the stock VCs. Stock exchanges vc, sure. Maybe even the VCs. Yeah. Somebody, somebody should have solved it, but you know, who\u2019s going to do paper stock certificates? Like it just, it\u2019s so somebody Barry Ritholtz: Had a clerk had to have a clerk or a junior researcher putting this together somewhere and had to realize there was some value to both the firm and various outside startups for, it\u2019s kind of shocking Henry Ward: For sure. But, but the, your, your point so well made, Barry is the kind of person that would be filing paper stock certificates would never come up with the idea of replacing them. And so you, you need this, this is the magic of a, a founder, a visionary founder is, is you need that connection of they, they know enough about technology to, to know what technology can do, but they don\u2019t know enough about the current process that they think it\u2019s unchangeable. And that\u2019s the, you, you know, there\u2019s certain level of intelligence and a certain level of stupidity that you need to get that, that chemical quotient. Right. Barry Ritholtz:\u00a0 So how did you convince investors that, hey, this is worthwhile, this should exist. It doesn\u2019t, please invest in this. It\u2019s worth building. Henry Ward: Most investors said, Hey, the, the even I believe you can build a cap table product and make some money and sell it, but it, the, the market size is too small. How many cap tables can you actually sell? And the, the pitch was, well, hey, this is, this is a two-part story. Part one is win the cap tables. Part two is if you win the cap tables, then we can go build at the time what we called the NASDAQ for private markets. The, the stock exchange to trade the, these, these shares. And our thesis then was the reason why there were many stock market companies before us, but none of them had actually owned the settlement. They hadn\u2019t owned the cap table itself. And so they had to connect, match, and settle these things offline. And by owning the cap table, we could digitize the entire settlement process for these companies. But we, you had to do the hard work of winning the cap table business first. We were wrong. It turned out the cap table business was way bigger than we and investors thought. Today it\u2019s a $350 million business. Wow. But the, the stock market that everybody thought was gonna be, you know, a billion dollar business is zero for us. 00:19:37 [Speaker Changed] That, that\u2019s unbelievable. Yeah. The, you know, VCs love to toss around tam, total addressable market. Again, kind of shocking that people right in the middle of this surrounded by tens of thousands of companies in California and Silicon Valley completely underestimated the total addressable market. Yeah. That, that\u2019s just shocking to me. Let\u2019s talk about the, the income stream you set up in the beginning. This was a fee per stock certificate business. You guys changed this to a subscription model. Tell us about the factors that drove those changes and how it affected the steadiness of your income stream. 00:20:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we, we thought we were competing against FedEx. And so instead of paying $60 to FedEx to FedEx a stock certific, you\u2019ll pay us $20 to email it. It worked. People would pay for it. What was really hard about it though is it\u2019s a transactional business. It\u2019s very hard to, to manage the transactional business. And it was very volatile. And we also quickly realized that we wanted to move to a subscription based business. \u2019cause we needed to bundle other things that were, were more subscription based, like 4 0 9 a valuations and expense accounting and other services we were doing. But we were, we were two years in and, you know, at the time I think we had maybe 2000 customers that were all paying us 20 bucks. And we realized this was like a, a crucible moment for us. If we didn\u2019t change the business model, we wouldn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t survive. 00:21:06 And we emailed all of our customers from me. I emailed all 2000 customers and I said, Hey, I made a mistake. I I priced this wrong for you and I I need to change from the $20 per certificate to, you know, X dollars per year. And, and everybody had a, a price that they, we custom already set up for them. So we didn\u2019t even ask \u2019em, we just said, we\u2019re moving you starting next month to the subscription model. And it was a very scary, scary thing to do. \u2019cause you don\u2019t know what your customers are gonna do. Right? You, you literally changed the agreement in the mid-flight. And I, I explained in this long email, I said, I, I made a mistake. If I keep charging you this way, I\u2019m gonna go outta business and I need to move you over to this. And I\u2019m very sorry I made this mistake. I hope I understand if you decide to leave us, but I hope, I hope you won\u2019t. And it was remarkable. We lost almost no customers. Wow. And I, I have some of these saved and framed where customers came back and said, you know, we\u2019re so glad you did this \u2019cause we were wondering if you were gonna run out of business. Like we thought, you know, this pricing was wrong. It didn\u2019t make any sense making, 00:22:19 [Speaker Changed] So the subscription model allows them to just keep doing repeat business and no one has to track, oh, we did these six companies and it\u2019s however much it is. No, here\u2019s our monthly fee and we can do as many companies as we have to work 00:22:33 [Speaker Changed] With. They, they have a monthly ex annual fee for most of them. They pay annually, they, they renew and based on the size of the cap table at that renewal, they, they just get a renewal notice. And, and it\u2019s interesting, you know, eight years ago we were 10 x cheaper than the lawyers. Now we\u2019re still eight x cheaper than the lawyers. But now it\u2019s, it\u2019s just a different, different world. People are used to software now. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s that, that, you know, 10 years ago is a, is a weird thing for these companies to pay a subscription fee for legal software. And today it\u2019s super, super common. Do 00:23:06 [Speaker Changed] You really think about this as legal software? It, I mean it obviously has ramifications in law, but it really seems more like it\u2019s a combination of hey, it, it\u2019s business, it\u2019s investing, it\u2019s accounting. How, how do you contextualize what space you\u2019re actually in 00:23:26 [Speaker Changed] It? It\u2019s a great question. I I think we started as legal software and people thought of us as legal software. I think over the first five years we transitioned the concept of cap table from a legal solution to a financial solution. So we sort of categorize ourselves in the FinTech world. I think today, when you look at cap tables, our fund administration and fund accounting business, our LP business and all the, the, the software that we sell as a platform into private, private equity, private credit venture capital. I, I think of us now as a, as a software infrastructure business, you know, we, we, we sell, we\u2019re we\u2019re more similar to a NetSuite or even a Google suite than we are to a legal tech company or a 00:24:12 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense and save on legal fees. So, so back, let\u2019s call it about eight years ago you were called e shares, which kind of intuitively makes a lot of sense. What was behind the rebranding? Why did you go from eShares to Carta in 2017? 00:24:31 [Speaker Changed] The, we liked eShares because it, it was an electronic share, you know, instead of paper. And it made a ton of sense. In 2017, we kind of realized we wanted to do way more than electronic shares. So we knew we needed a new name. We were also pushed on it because we didn\u2019t own eshares.com. We owned eShares inc.com and there was a domain squatter on eshares.com. 00:24:55 [Speaker Changed] What did they want for it? 00:24:57 [Speaker Changed] They wanted, initially I think it was a million bucks when we had, we had $2 million raised total. And then as soon as we raised more money, it became $10 million. Oh really? And so it was just every single time we were trying to get more and we just couldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t do business. And so we decided we needed to change the name and we came up with Carta and we were able to buy it for I think 75,000 bucks. And it was great. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Wow. That\u2019s fantastic. Did, did eShares ever get sold? 00:25:25 [Speaker Changed] I don\u2019t think so. It is a great question. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still, I haven\u2019t been there in a long time. It 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Just goes to show you, you know, you have to leave a little bit on money on the table if you try and squeeze every last penny end up with nothing. Exactly. So you guys, I mentioned in the original introduction, Carta serves 50,000 companies, 8,500 firms, millions and millions of equity holders. Starting out with that first $2 million raise, it appears that you\u2019ve scaled from a, a little niche solution to a giant platform for private companies. What was the biggest growth pains in in that scaling that up? 00:26:04 [Speaker Changed] It\u2019s all of them. We scaling a company, I, I think I, I love Jensen at Nvidia and I got to see \u2019em speak and you know, someone was asked him about would he do it again? And, and you know, he\u2019s one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our generation. And he goes, if I knew what it would take, I wouldn\u2019t have done it again. Really. And yeah, and you know, it\u2019s, I think Mark Andreessen calls it, it\u2019s, it\u2019s eating glass until you, you enjoy the taste of your own blood. So it, it\u2019s, you know, ev every day I, there\u2019s sort of this funny thing where people are like, well what was it like to scale? And I\u2019m like, I\u2019m still doing it. Like, like we\u2019re, you know, and, and it\u2019s, you know, getting in at, you know, 10 o\u2019clock last night from a 4:00 AM start. It\u2019s, you know, talking to customers, it\u2019s hiring, firing, you know, uncomfortable conversations, you know, board mechanics. It\u2019s, it\u2019s all the same. It\u2019s just more harder, faster. 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] Is andreessen\u2019s quote eating glass till you like the taste of your own blood? Is that accurate? Or is it a little hyperbolic? 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] You know, I think, so I talk a lot to founders about this, where the, the founders that want to be founders for the money, we all know that the expected value of being an entrepreneur is, is below pursuing a career far, far below the better business bureau 00:27:22 [Speaker Changed] Actually well sold such a large percentage fail Exactly at the gate. So that\u2019s exactly, we all the survivorship bias of, we see the ones that have succeeded. That\u2019s just the top of the iceberg. You don\u2019t see everything below the waterline. A 00:27:33 [Speaker Changed] Hundred percent. And then when you see the ones that succeeded, sort of by definition the ones that succeeded, made it look easy, right? Because it\u2019s like we\u2019re on podcasts doing, doing all of these things. They 00:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Found the right niche, they pivoted appropriately. They built what was needed and the market rewarded 00:27:49 [Speaker Changed] That. That\u2019s exactly right. How hard could it be? That\u2019s exactly right. And and when I look at my history, I know how lucky I got. Like there\u2019s so many forks in the road that, boy, if I had flipped heads instead of tails, I would not be here. And I had, I had to flip, you know, I had to flip tails 32 times in a row to get to, to where I am. 00:28:08 [Speaker Changed] I\u2019m gonna, let me interrupt you a second \u2019cause I just have to share this. So I\u2019ve done oh 550, 600 of these and I have heard that exact thing over and over again. And the first couple of times I heard it, especially from billionaires, I\u2019m like, yeah, yeah, false humility. But then when I start hearing it from more people, from guys like you who are in the trenches chewing on glass, it\u2019s like, and my own experience as an entrepreneur, you really smart and hard work is just table stakes. You really have to get lucky. And people don\u2019t understand how the role of serendipity in, in how things work out. 00:28:46 [Speaker Changed] One, one of my favorite other quotes is Bo bo Durham, the comedians said, you know, don\u2019t take advice from successful people. \u2019cause it\u2019s, it\u2019s like listening to Taylor Swift say, follow your dreams. You know, or, or the lottery winner goes, you know what you should do, sell everything you own and buy lottery tickets. That\u2019s right. And 00:29:04 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s an XKCD. They told me I would never win, but I kept at it. That\u2019s right. And here I am today. Exactly. No, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a hundred percent true. Listen, there\u2019s so much more signal in the failures than there are in the successes. \u2019cause success. Maybe it was skill, maybe it was luck. We don\u2019t know. 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I, what I try to coach like in my angel investments is it, I call it, you know, the love of the game. And so, you know, you see founders that I wanna be successful, I wanna be a successful founder. I wanna make the money. You know, and, and what I always tell \u2019em is like, hey, the, the problem with money doing this for the money is most of your journey, if not all, you\u2019re poor, right? You\u2019re seed stage, early stage, you\u2019re just poor. And so if you\u2019re doing it for the money, you, you kind of quickly lose motivation. \u2019cause you\u2019re poor for years, right? And then let\u2019s say you\u2019re one of the lucky for you to get successful. Well, well now you\u2019re rich. And so if you do it for the money now, now you just, you have no reason to do it anymore. \u2019cause you\u2019ve got the money and the, the, the people that that, that are successful over time in this business, do it for the love of the game. Like I, you know, I do it because I love chewing glass. 00:30:09 [Speaker Changed] My, you know, my wife and I were having a conversation the other day about when we were poor and I mean really poor. And the really challenging thing is when you\u2019re in the thick of it, you don\u2019t know that it\u2019s gonna work out. You have no idea, Hey, am I gonna get that lucky break? Is the right client, partner, customer gonna come along and and give me that critical mass to go to the next level? So not only are you poor, but the outcome is wholly unknown. And so if you don\u2019t love it, then what are you, what are you doing? 00:30:42 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s right. You\u2019re poor and you\u2019re, it\u2019s an you\u2019re living in constant uncertainty. 00:30:46 [Speaker Changed] Uncertainty. Absolutely. 00:30:47 [Speaker Changed] And I think what people forget is, you know, I, I\u2019m not poor anymore, but I still live in uncertainty and, you know, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen. You know, I\u2019m trying to build a bigger business, you know, and, and the water watermark keeps going up. And so like, if, if in three years the watermark isn\u2019t higher, I I will feel like I failed the last three years. And I, I think that\u2019s the, you know, that\u2019s the essence of being entrepreneur is the watermark keeps going up and you keep going up. 00:31:11 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating. I want to dive into the world of, of private companies and alts, but before we do that, I just had to ask you a data question. My, my assumption is accessing reliable and clean data has to be the lifeblood of what you\u2019re doing. How challenging is that? How many different inputs do you guys have to track at Carta? 00:31:37 [Speaker Changed] I have a perspective on, on software and data businesses that might be a bit provocative, which is, I\u2019ll make this statement that software businesses cannot be data businesses. And the reason is, if a software business has customer data, they get that customer data by selling software and and service to this customer. And if they monetize that data on the other side, if their left hand is, we will keep, keep your data confidential and as part of our software service to you. But then with the right hand they\u2019re selling that data, it cannibalizes their software business. \u2019cause the customers won\u2019t trust them now \u2019cause they\u2019re now giving \u2019em their data. Which is why Carta does not have a data product. We have tons of data. We do not have a monetizable data product. Huh, interesting. We only sell workflow or business operation software. The, the, it\u2019s hard to think of a business that sells actual software and also sells data. I I can\u2019t think of any, even Bloomberg started really as a data data business. The, the non-existent, non-existence of something is not proof that it cannot exist. But my my best example of why my theory that software businesses and data businesses cannot coexist in one company is Salesforce. If anybody would launch a data product, 00:32:55 [Speaker Changed] So funny. That\u2019s who exactly it would be 00:32:56 [Speaker Changed] Salesforce was thinking of. And in 30 years they have not. And I don\u2019t think they ever will. And I think the day Salesforce launches a successful data business, I I will be eating my words and I will be wrong, but I don\u2019t think software businesses can become data businesses. I 00:33:11 [Speaker Changed] I would imagine that, so we use, in my shop, we use Salesforce as our CRM very customizable. And they have specific industries that they, they market towards and and customize. But the moment it feels like your data is being reused, every single one of their competitors would say, we keep your data safe. We don\u2019t monetize the data. Give \u2019em up on them. Come to us where we respect privacy. I mean, I think the moment anybody tries that their competition is all over that. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] And, and you would agree because suddenly you\u2019re now on every list of every vendor trying to sell software to bury and they know everything about you. \u2019cause Salesforce gave them your data. 00:33:52 [Speaker Changed] Not only that, but it\u2019s not quite hipaa. But the SEC has privacy requirements. Things you\u2019re not allowed to share when you, you\u2019re supposed to know your client. You have all this data. And if one of your vendors is reusing that, repurposing that data for their own ends, like, wait, not only are you violating our privacy agreement, you\u2019re putting me underwater with the SEC, they may come yell at me. I I don\u2019t need that. Totally. I\u2019m I\u2019m gonna go to your competition. Kind of interesting. So, so let\u2019s, let\u2019s pivot towards the private markets. \u2019cause it\u2019s so interesting. You\u2019ve testified before Congress that\u2019s startups and growth companies backed by private capital. That\u2019s where most of the new job growth comes in the United States. Explain. 00:34:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, public markets is, is actually a shrinking industry. You know, there\u2019s fewer public companies today than there were 10 years ago by, by quite a big margin. But the number of private companies is growing astronomically and be, that\u2019s largely fueled by there\u2019s a lot more private capital than there used to be to fund these businesses. And there\u2019s less reasons to, to, to go public now. So I think, I think that will continue to be true. I think it\u2019s structurally true. When I go to the, to the hill and, and talk to our legislators, the, the common response is, well, we just have to push more companies to go public. I, I think it\u2019s like what the, their, their belief is the public markets is a great product for everyday Americans to access growth equity. And I think they\u2019re right. It, it is a good product for it. The problem is it\u2019s not the, it\u2019s a shrinking product and most of the growth is being hap is happening in the private markets. And there are attempts to get these companies to go public so that there can be retail access to them is isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s a little bit like, you know, the river\u2019s coming and you\u2019ve got like one tiny little dam trying to hold the water back. Let, 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] Let me share a data point that I bet a lot of listeners are not familiar with the US is something like four to 5% of the global population where something like 24, 20 5% of the global economy, global market cap we\u2019re over half. I mean, we are wildly disproportionate in our public markets. How much bigger does Congress wanna make that? I mean, what you\u2019re describing makes a lot of sense. The public markets are enormous. Let\u2019s let the private markets grow and see where they go. 00:36:16 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And that\u2019s certainly the, the, the message that that, that we\u2019re pushing, we still have to solve the problem of, of retail access because as the number of public companies is, is shrinking. That\u2019s less, less and less options for your everyday American to invest their money in their retirement. I don\u2019t think the answer is to try to push more companies to go public. I think the answer is to create safe access for everyday Americans into private capital. And that\u2019s what we spend a lot of time lobbying for in Congress. 00:36:45 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating coming up. We continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carter, talking about the rise of private company investing. I\u2019m Barry Riol, you\u2019re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:37:16 I am Barry Reho. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Henry Ward. He\u2019s the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage the cap tables for tens of thousands of private companies, thousands of investment firms and millions of equity holders. They do a number of other things in terms of tracking, compensation, valuation, liquidity, all these really fascinating issues. So there are a number of companies that bring liquidity to private companies. Sometimes it\u2019s it\u2019s private equity or, or some form of a private fund. Other times it\u2019s individuals who wanna participate in companies before they go public. What are your thoughts on the future of secondary liquidity, both for the investors and employees of startups and for the rest of the investing public that wants to participate in these privates? 00:38:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I am, I think I\u2019m one of the maybe top five people in the world that have worked on private market liquidity. I, I spent the, the last 10 years working on the, on the problem. And I, I\u2019m of the view now that that at least venture startup liquidity will, will never happen. And, and at least a, a secondary exchange in the, in the sense that we think of public market exchanges, the private markets are so different from public, it\u2019s really kind of the upside down world. You know, in, in public markets, the the price is set by the last buyer, not the first in private markets. It\u2019s set by the first and not the last. And public markets, it\u2019s easier to sell one share than a hundred million dollars worth of shares in private markets. Easier to sell a hundred million dollar block than it is to sell one one share. You know, in public markets the distribution outcomes is mostly Gaussian normally distributed in private markets. It\u2019s it\u2019s power law. So all the math that exists to, in modern portfolio finance theory in public markets doesn\u2019t work in private. So it, it is just, it\u2019s a very different market infrastructure. I I think all the attempts they try to create liquidity in the, in the venture world are, are, will be failed attempts. But I hope I\u2019m wrong, I hope I\u2019m just old. I 00:39:27 [Speaker Changed] Mean, equity Zen seems to have figured this out a while ago. They seem to have put together a way to do secondaries for creating some liquidity for, for insiders or employees at companies. But it\u2019s not like they\u2019re a trillion dollar platform. It\u2019s, it\u2019s a little bit of a niche specific focused. And there are other companies like that. I just happen to be thinking of them recently. But really what you\u2019re saying is there\u2019s a gulf between trillions and trillions of dollars in public equity and private stock and, and never the twain shall meet. So 00:40:05 [Speaker Changed] In, in public markets liquidity begets liquidity. And so it centralizes on two exchanges in the US and most regions it centralizes on one in, in private markets. What\u2019s happened is there\u2019s equities and there\u2019s many others. There\u2019s many, many small niche businesses doing secondaries. It does happen, but liquidity does not. But beget liquidity, the, as soon as one of these companies starts to scale, all the competitors come around and they devolve back down to a niche business. And and that\u2019s just the, the, the market structure is that any company that actually starts to scale in their private markets, it actually the it degenerates there. The, we\u2019ve seen so many examples of com of private market liquidity providers, you know, come in hot, get really a quick start and then, and then once they hit scale it falls down. And so you see so many of these small businesses that will always stay small businesses. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an opportunity for someone to consolidate the market. 00:41:03 [Speaker Changed] There\u2019s been so much focus on privates and alternatives. D does this intensity of interest, does this surprise you at all or you\u2019ve been up to your chin in this for, for a decade and what took everybody so long? 00:41:17 [Speaker Changed] We, we\u2019ve been in this up to up to up to my chin as you say, for for a decade plus. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s not surprising. What I think is really, we\u2019re in a moment of time in the speed that it\u2019s happening, especially with the current administration. We\u2019re liberalizing a lot of the rules for private market access. You know, there\u2019s a lot of work being done around can retail investors access private equity firms? Private credit firms. I think that will continue to happen and I think that\u2019s a big tailwind for, for Carta. And I think the, the, the US economy and and GDP because so much of this capital is being now deployed in, in useful ways. I think that will continue to be true in the next administration. Hopefully they will continue that legislative policy. I think it will, it will be weird in 20 or 30 years, it will be weird that we locked out 99% of Americans out of private capital. 00:42:14 [Speaker Changed] So when I look at who\u2019s being aggressive in terms of moving from, how do we get more people onto the alternatives and private side, it\u2019s everyone from Blackstone to BlackRock, Carlisle, Apollo, Goldman Sachs go down the list. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re working with some or most of these companies. 00:42:33 [Speaker Changed] We we know them all and we\u2019re we\u2019re huge fans. I I was lucky enough to spend an hour with Rob Goldstein, the, the COO over at BlackRock and, and he was telling me kind of the vision of, of BlackRock and their, their perspective on private markets and you know, he, he made this very salient point, which was, you know, when they talk to their customers, they, they might look at a customer and they, they spend, you know, $25 million a year on public market infrastructure and technology for their public market asset allocation software. And they might spend, you know, 300, you know, $350,000 on their private market stuff. A fraction, a fraction, right? With BlackRock. But they might spend a million dollars total. So 350 k is with BlackRock and 700 K is with a bunch of other vendors. And his team is like, oh, we should go after that 700 k and we\u2019ll win the whole, you know, million dollars that they send in alts. And he goes, no, no, no, no. What we need to do is figure out how to get that million dollars a year they spend in alts to be $25 million a year. Right. And then we\u2019ll capture half of that. And, and that was the, the mental mind shift that I think BlackRock is so smart at, which is we\u2019re trying to grow the market, not not our percentage of the market. Right. 00:43:50 [Speaker Changed] That makes, that makes a whole lot of sense. So they\u2019re looking at an adjacent market to their public market dominance. They\u2019re the biggest investment firm in the world at around $12 trillion. How do you decide what adjacent markets are attractive? And you might wanna enter them if you started with cap tables, you\u2019re doing all sorts of other data analytics. How do you figure out what\u2019s adjacent? 00:44:15 [Speaker Changed] We, we have a really strict framework on it because we spend a lot of our time thinking about where we can expand. And we have really two, two criteria. So one is do we have a a right to win? So what gives us competitive edge that we can do that nobody else can do? And second is, can we, can we win that market quickly? Because we\u2019re very much a software business. Like if, if you can win a market, but it takes a long time. We\u2019re a growth growth company, so it\u2019s gotta be fast. So you have to have a very aggressive customer acquisition model that, that creates a flywheel. That the more customers you get, the more customers you get. And so if those two things are true, we\u2019ll we\u2019ll go after it. And it it, it leads you to really funny things where you wouldn\u2019t actually attack adjacent markets that are obvious adja that have obvious adjacencies. So the example I love is cap tables and four nine A cap tables was a legal service when we entered it done by lawyers. Four nine a valuations was a valuation service done by valuation providers. Nobody thought of them as similar. What we realized is by having the cap table, we could do valuations faster, cheaper, smarter. And so we just started doing valuations. Well, 00:45:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, the tomba number of shareholders, you know what the last transaction or funding was. It sounds pretty basic math, right? 00:45:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. It\u2019s just math on the cap table. But they\u2019re a completely different industry. So if you think about from a market perspective, they\u2019re different. But you think about it from where we have competitive edge, they\u2019re the same and the same with fund accounting, fund administration, fund accounting software. Very different industry than cap table management. But we\u2019re able to connect the cap tables to the funds and that gave us unique competitive advantage that nobody else could do. And so now we\u2019re in the fund admin business and that\u2019s, that\u2019s our our second biggest business line. 00:45:54 [Speaker Changed] You, you guys also do compensation analytics. How did you find your way into that space? 00:45:58 [Speaker Changed] We realized we\u2019re the only ones that could do benchmarking for both salary and equity for startups. Oh, of course. Nobody else can do it. And so Right. 00:46:06 [Speaker Changed] Without the equity, the salary may not be that significant. 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] That\u2019s right. But to, to have start at a priority and go, we\u2019re gonna do cap tables and that\u2019s gonna lead us into compensation didn\u2019t make a ton of sense. And that\u2019s the, we have a a a a flywheel of this is how we entered these industries. 00:46:21 [Speaker Changed] You are the perfect person to ask this question. I\u2019m gonna go off script. So I spoke at an event in June in Silicon Valley. It was a kind of funky hotel that was turned into this really interesting space right on the edge of trying to remember exactly where it was about 45 minutes outside of San Francisco. But anyway, it was an employee benefits conference with all sorts of people. And I was there to talk about my book at the time. And I heard over and over again from all these people who, the 401k people, they\u2019re employee compensation consultants, they\u2019re health benefit consultants, all these people who were telling me that there\u2019s this sort of misalignment amongst Silicon Valley employees who were more interested in the dollars than they are in the equity. Which just completely sounds upside down to me. Am I just looking at a weird corner of the world or is that a thing that, hey, you can\u2019t pay your rent with equity. I have to at least make x What do you see out there in terms of how startup employees are thinking about equity versus cash payments for comp? Yeah, 00:47:40 [Speaker Changed] We, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about this and I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll I\u2019ll frame it. As you know, wealth management financial advice is a well established industry in the public world and the, I\u2019ll call it the liquid world, right? You pay, you know, 1% or half a percent of a UM to your financial advisor and they, they help you manage your assets. There is no equivalent in the private world. Like if I\u2019m a employee and I make, you know, $150,000 a year in cash, but I\u2019m sitting on a million or $2 million of equity, illiquid equity, how, how do I think about that? How, how do I work on it? And there is no industry for that. The financial advisors don\u2019t know how to work with that in part \u2019cause they don\u2019t understand the, the private market, you know, illiquid asset piece. But also they don\u2019t have, they don\u2019t have any way to monetize $2 million worth of private stock. 00:48:29 You can\u2019t, you know, you can\u2019t charge one basis point or a percent of a UM on it. And so, so we\u2019ve wrestled with this question of if an industry were to be created, not wealth managed but but wealth management for illiquid people for high net worth, but illiquid asset holders, what would that industry look like? And so we\u2019ve been thinking a lot about that problem. And, and we, we recently launched a partnership with Morgan Stanley where we\u2019re last year we posed this problem to them and we said, Hey, we think it\u2019s worth solving wealth management for illiquid holders. How would we do that? And they\u2019re, you know, the largest wealth management firm in the country. They do this extremely well. And now we\u2019re creating a motion to basically help these employees who are like, I would just want the cash \u2019cause I don\u2019t know what to do with this equity. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t understand it. I I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s gonna be liquid. And can you create a financial advisory industry to help those people? 00:49:26 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That, that\u2019s really fascinating. I was genuinely shocked. Maybe because I\u2019m, I\u2019m more risk seeking than risk averse and the thought of equity is so, you know, attractive to me. But I guess when you\u2019re in the thick of it and you\u2019re grinding a hundred hour weeks, hey, I\u2019m working my butt off and I still have to worry about paying my rent. I I don\u2019t wanna go that way. That was the only explanation I could come up with. But it was, it was really quite fascinating. I only have you for a limited amount of time. Why don\u2019t we jump to some of our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests starting with, and you\u2019re a good person to ask this. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:50:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had just one. I I think I pulled together a lot of people that have that helped me with little different things. And so, you know, everything from my boxing coach in high school and college that, that, you know, boxing\u2019s an interesting sport \u2019cause it\u2019s one of the very few sports that if you\u2019re tired and you\u2019re in pain and you have to let off the gas a little bit, it hurts more, not less. And 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] You gotta dig 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] Deep. That\u2019s right. And you know, there\u2019s, it\u2019s literally in the corner and you know, from, from perseverance from him, from the marines, from, you know, mark Andreessen who helped me figure out, you know, NetSuite, what we call ERP for private capital at a breakfast to, you know, John Waldron, who I had to got to have a lunch with him, who\u2019s the president at, at Goldman, who explained to me why bankers make more money than I do. And it\u2019s \u2019cause of the regulatory defensibility. And so you just pick up these nuggets from these very smart people and, and you, you hold \u2019em as a treasure trove. 00:51:11 [Speaker Changed] Let\u2019s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? Are you reading anything currently? 00:51:15 [Speaker Changed] We just read Amp It Up as a, as a leadership team. So we, last month we, we took 60 of our top leaders at Carta and, and on an offsite. And every time we do an offsite at Carta, we pick a book to read and everybody has to read it. And we do a discussion group. And it was very timely for us. We\u2019re, we\u2019re in very much an acceleration mo motion and so, so everybody at, at Carta right now is, is reading Amp It up and, and talking about it. 00:51:41 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. What about streaming? What are you listening to in terms of podcasts or watching on Netflix or Amazon? I kind of get the sense you\u2019re not a big couch potato kind of guy. 00:51:51 [Speaker Changed] I\u2019m not, I I don\u2019t really watch TV except I have an 11-year-old boy and I recently got him into Arrested Development, which is a classic, classic. I absolutely mean it\u2019s some of the best comedy ever done. And, and we\u2019re watching it together and we\u2019re loving it. And now he, he hits me with the lines and you know, dad, I, I\u2019ve made a huge mistake and we\u2019re having a great time with it 00:52:14 [Speaker Changed] Narrator. It wasn\u2019t, yeah, right. That\u2019s, I mean, that\u2019s where that comes from. People use it all the time, but it all goes right back to, I, I like his podcast, smartless is always kind of fun. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in fill in the blank entrepreneurship, startups, private companies? 00:52:41 [Speaker Changed] You know, I, I just did a talk at Waterloo yesterday to a bunch of soon to be grads there and, and I, I said, you know, they were computer science grads and, and I said, you know, there\u2019s, you know, they know of this algorithm called the Hill climbing algorithm, which is basically, if you\u2019re trying to find a global maximum versus a local maximum. What I mean by that, the analogy I use is, let\u2019s say you\u2019re an a French, you know, you\u2019re climbing in the French Alps as a mountain climber and you\u2019re trying to find the tallest mountain in the French Alps, but there\u2019s cloud cover. You can\u2019t see, you can\u2019t see the tops of these. How would you find the, the highest mountain? And you would, you would do it by picking a mountain, climbing to the top, recording how high you are, and then randomly jumping to another mountain and climbing and recording that. 00:53:22 And there\u2019s all this math around, you know, how many random jumps to mountains do. You have to have to have a 90% probability of finding the global, the global maximum. And I, I say it\u2019s a great analogy for a metaphor for, for early careers, which is most of us unfortunately are taught. You go through kindergarten to high school to college, you pick a career at 19 or a specialty, you then become a, a finance analyst, an associate, then you become a senior associate, then you become a man and you just, you kind of walk this track and you, you never ask the question, am I on a local opt hill or a global optimal hill? And I encourage people early to, to jump mountains to figure out which, which mountain they want to be on. And I think one of the reasons many people my age are very unhappy in their careers is they look back and they realize, oh, I got to the top of the mountain, but it was the wrong mountain. And I encourage young people to, to mountain jump. 00:54:17 [Speaker Changed] I, I, I love that metaphor. Mountain jump is a great, great line. What do you know about the world of entrepreneurship, startups, et cetera today might have been useful 20 or so years ago when you were first starting out? 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] Idea matters. It matters a lot. \u2019cause I\u2019ve had a lot of great ideas that did not work and I worked hard, hard at it. I also think there\u2019s this counterintuitive, I guess, thesis that\u2019s happening right now, which is the more entrepreneurs there are, the harder entrepreneurship gets. But people think the opposite, right? Oh, so many\u2019s do, so many people are doing it. I can do too. The number Michael 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] MOBAs not calls that the paradox of skill, the more skillful players there are in sports, the more luck matters because everybody\u2019s playing at such a high level. 00:55:08 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. And I think it\u2019s one of these funny things where like, not many people, you know, dream or move to Atlanta to be a hundred meter, you know, sprinter. \u2019cause I, you know, I think I can be the greatest a hundred meter sprinter in the world. And it\u2019s because there\u2019s not a lot of luck. I mean, there\u2019s luck around, you don\u2019t get injured and all of those things, but like, we pretty quickly can tell who\u2019s good and who\u2019s not good. That\u2019s 00:55:32 [Speaker Changed] Your skill outcome. 00:55:33 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and the, it\u2019s a little bit like acting like so much of it is luck that because so much of it is luck. People think anybody can do it and it, it\u2019s actually worse. You actually have to be a super skilled, you know, a hundred meter sprinter and you have to be lucky to do one of these startups. And I think a lot of people are like, oh, you know, a lot of it\u2019s luck. So if it\u2019s luck, anybody can do it. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, you gotta have both. It makes it actually harder, not easier. 00:55:59 [Speaker Changed] I love the expression, table stakes. Smart, hardworking, that\u2019s just to enter the arena. Then you gotta luck. Get lucky on top of it. That\u2019s right. Un unbelievable. Henry, this has been absolutely fascinating. We have been speaking with Henry Ward.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"Good for Intel and the USA.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When the U.S. government procured a 10% stake in Intel back in late August, it was a major win for Intel as it represented an investment from America, the importance of which cannot be overstated. At the time, Intel's capitalization was a mere $107 billion; now, it is a whopping $181 billion. That deal brought billions of dollars both to the company and to the U.S. government. \"I think we are up $40 billion since I made that big deal for myself,\" said President Donald Trump in an interview with Fox News. \"They came in to see me, and I say, 'You know what? I think United States should own 10% of your company.' And they gave me 10%. It has been good to them too. Their stock has gone up so much that they end up making a fortune, but we make $30 or 40 billion dollars on that deal. And the same thing with that Mountain Pass. But in that case, it's because we want to get the rare earth refined.\" When SoftBank and the U.S. government obtained their stakes in Intel in late August, the company\u2019s stock was trading below book value, which means that the company\u2019s assets were worth more than its market capitalization. While the company had been posting losses for several consecutive quarters and was still not out of the woods, its low market capitalization was generally a reflection of its damaged reputation. The company has managed to capitalize on 5G, cloud, and HPC megatrends but largely failed to capitalize on the AI goldrush. Nonetheless, Intel still supplies more data center and telco-oriented CPUs than its rivals. The company has yet to become a significant player in the foundry market, and it does not look like Intel Foundry has many major clients beyond AWS, Microsoft, and U.S. defense work. However, Intel has managed to develop five production nodes in four years and is about to start mass production on its 18A process technology and shift a substantial portion of its production from TSMC to its own fabs. Last but not least, Intel has been losing market share to AMD but remains the world\u2019s biggest supplier of CPUs for both client and data center applications, which is a big deal. Not a lot has changed since the US government's investment in August: the company is still losing money and market share, all while not gaining a firmer position in the foundry market, which proves the point that Intel\u2019s diminishing valuation was caused by its reputation and business performance rather than its market position and prospects. Since then, in addition to selling its stake to the U.S. government and SoftBank, Intel has inked a strategic deal with Nvidia under which it will supply data center-grade CPUs for Nvidia\u2019s AI platforms, integrate Nvidia GPUs designed for Intel\u2019s client system-in-packages, and receive a 5% stake from Nvidia. The deal is a huge financial win for the troubled CPU maker and also a significant vote of confidence in the company and its products, as it essentially proves that Nvidia acknowledges the prowess of Intel CPUs in particular and the x86 instruction set architecture in general. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Still, helping Intel survive its current turmoil makes a lot of sense for the U.S. government, as it is largely a matter of national security and industrial sovereignty. Intel is the only American company capable of manufacturing leading-edge logic chips, which are critical for AI, defense, and national security systems. Backing Intel secures onshore chip production, reduces dependence on TSMC and Samsung in Asia, and advances the longer-term goal of rebuilding the domestic semiconductor supply chain. It also protects a strategic national asset from foreign influence and strengthens America\u2019s position in the global race against China.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByJon Markman, Contributor. We all believe we\u2019re independent thinkers, yet the data tells a sobering story: the average investor has spent the last two decades paddling against a powerful financial tide. While the S&P 500 delivered a long-term average return of 10% annually, individual investors have been stuck at 5%. Why? Because we constantly trade our long-term map for the Tyranny of the Immediate. Focusing on next week\u2019s noise instead of the next 18 months is a guaranteed way to underperform. Stanley Druckenmiller, who generated a legendary 30% annual return for three decades, didn\u2019t have a crystal ball. He simply had a longer runway. He was mapping the terrain for the year ahead, not staring at the hood ornament. His success is proof that being long is a far more reliable strategy over time. The Financial Fallacy This brings us to the most expensive lie in finance: the belief in symmetry. The idea that market drops and rises are equal is a fallacy. The market is structurally engineered to rise: bull markets last 3.8 times longer than bear markets, and stocks rise about 70% of the time. When you short or bet on a massive downturn, you aren\u2019t being clever; you are betting against financial gravity itself. Also, please stop believing the system is rigged against you. Recognize that it is built for upward mobility. From engineered corporate earnings (where 75% of S&P 500 companies consistently beat expectations) to a Federal Reserve and politicians incentivized to promote confidence, powerful forces are aligned to keep assets buoyant. This is your persistent tailwind. Why would you fight it? The Only Way to Win Sure, there will be times when stocks will decline. Be ready. The true test of an investor is having the discipline to buy when the market is on sale, when fear is loudest, and when every talking head is whispering, \u201cIt is different this time.\u201d If you flee to cash during a dip, you are statistically guaranteed to miss the recovery: 90% of stock gains occur on just 10% of trading days. Missing those few crucial days causes the long-term underperformance shown by the Dalbar data. The key to victory is simple: Trust the upward trend. Do not fight the financial tide. If you find yourself betting against the market moving higher, you\u2019ve fallen for the most expensive lie. Embrace the weakness. Buy the opportunity.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AppLovin (APP) stock has dropped by 21.2% in under a month, from $718.54 on 9\/30\/2025 to $565.94 now. Is this a dip worth buying? Purchasing during dips can be a practical strategy for quality stocks that have shown a pattern of recovering from downturns. It appears that APP stock meets essential quality criteria. However, the concerning news is that the stock has experienced a median return of -44% over one year, and a 76% peak return after significant dips (>30% in 30 days) historically. To provide some context, APP offers a software platform that assists mobile app developers in enhancing app marketing and monetization through AppDiscovery, which aligns advertiser demand with publisher supply via auctions. For information on stock fundamentals and evaluations: Read Buy or Sell AppLovin Stock to gain a complete understanding. Recently, APP stock has seen significant declines, and we currently view it as appealing yet volatile. While this situation might appear to be an opportunity, relying on a single stock carries substantial risk. Conversely, there is significant merit in a broad diversified investment strategy. If you\u2019re looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio (HQ) \u2013 HQ has surpassed its benchmark, which is a blend of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index, achieving returns of over 105% since it began.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByCortney Harding, Contributor. Earlier today and with great fanfare, ChatGPT announced the launch of Atlas, an AI-enabled browser. It comes on the heels of an agreement with WalMart to let shoppers purchase goods directly in ChatGPT, and a few months after the launch of Perplexity\u2019s browser, Comet. In the last few years, we\u2019ve seen announcement after announcement of new tools and integrations, along with the release of AI-enabled devices, most recently Meta\u2019s Display glasses.    All of this is great and thrilling \u2013 until it\u2019s not. Because despite excitement about these products, they quickly hit major roadblocks. And most frustratingly, the limitations that will likely hamstring these products are something ChatGPT, Perplexity, and others have almost no control over. They\u2019ve set themselves on a collision course with bad legacy systems and technology, not to mention outdated mindsets \u2013 and in the end, that could kill a lot of innovation before it gets off the ground.    When we think about infrastructure and AI, most people think about data centers and water consumption issues \u2013 but while those issues are pressing, they are future looking, and eventually solvable. But the legacy issues around data cleanliness, connectivity, and overall technology adoption, not to mention walled garden systems, are far more complicated.    Take connectivity. We got a sneak peek of the problems that might arise when Meta\u2019s Display demo at their Connect event kept going sideways. Meta put the blame on wifi issues, which is fair, but the fact that these glasses lose basically all functionality if the connection is unstable is a major issue. And even worse, out in the real world, most people won\u2019t be on wifi \u2013 they\u2019ll be on 5G or LTE networks, and massive parts of the USA still lack even that basic connectivity. Driving on a major thoroughfare less than two hours north of New York City this weekend, my phone most often resembled an expensive brick \u2013 and that\u2019s not an uncommon experience in many parts of the country.    So at this point, all of these amazing, ground-breaking, life-changing tools and devices will have to come with an asterisk. They\u2019ll revolutionize information and communication \u2013 just not on the subway between stops, or in a rural area, or in a dead zone.    But even if you have a blazing fast connection, you\u2019ll still have to deal with bad legacy systems and dirty data. When I try any new AI product, I want to know what real life problems it can solve for me. They might not be terribly complex or interesting, but they reflect the way many people will use the technology.    I started by asking Atlas a question about prescription availability. I take a medication that is sometimes out of stock at my local pharmacy, so I want to know which other pharmacies near me would have it for the next time I get my prescription filled. Alas, because of bad legacy systems, there is no centralized database, so you basically get an error message. It\u2019s not ChatGPT\u2019s fault, per se, but it negates at least one very real use case.    I then moved on to booking a restaurant. I asked Atlas for some recommendations based on what I would like for dinner for two later this week in New York, and it shot back some good options. I got excited about one spot I\u2019ve been dying to try and asked it to get me a table \u2013 alas, it just went to Resy and I watched my mouse click around to come up with a goose egg. It was simply a bad integration \u2013 since it knew the date, it should have eliminated that restaurant as an option altogether. And even when I tried another spot that had open tables, it didn\u2019t save me any time. I could have just clicked through Resy myself to find a table.    And that\u2019s for the restaurants that have online booking. Just for fun, I decided to throw a curveball and ask it to get me a table at a restaurant in France that doesn\u2019t even have email, let alone online booking. Not surprisingly, it replied that it was unable to do it, although it did give me a script for calling and asking for a table, assuming I was born yesterday.    This is a silly example, for sure, but it could create real issues for small businesses, especially those who eschew technology. Walmart\u2019s integration is likely the first of many among larger businesses, but can small businesses compete? If restaurants don\u2019t use online systems or have available tables, they eventually won\u2019t show up in results, and some might not survive the transition.    These browsers are of course early, and integration will likely become more seamless and easy. But these backend issues, as unsexy as they might be, could stand in the way of a lot of success \u2013 and when the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d tech stocks are basically powering the market, that has outsize implications for everyone. The focus needs to be on getting people connected and updating legacy systems and onboarding laggards, or Comet and its peers will come crashing down to earth. ","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. Asian equities had a strong day on easing US-China trade tensions as President Trump outlined his areas of focus and announced a 2026 China visit. Did you read yesterday\u2019s note on institutional investors underweight to China? Active fund managers are also underweight China, according to data from Copley Fund Research. That makes the pain trade higher! (Yes, knocking on wood). The renminbi (CNY) appreciated to 7.11 per USD from nearly 7.14 just a week ago. Hong Kong had a strong day as well, though volume was light. The Hang Seng Index closed above the 26,000 level, while the Hang Seng Tech Index finished above 6,000, both led by growth stocks, especially internet names like Alibaba, which jumped +1.98% after Bloomberg reported a new AI initiative targeting ByteDance. Hardware technology stocks benefited from strong iPhone sales, supporting the Apple and Foxconn supply chains, as well as the Huawei ecosystem. Insurance names got a pop, too; China Life rose +6.04% to a ten-year high after its positive Q3 net income release. Battery giant CATL gained +3.03% after reporting a preliminary Q3 net income increase of +41%, lifting electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem stocks. Bilibili rallied +8.88% thanks to a broker upgrade after a new online game launch. On the flip side, Pop Mart, the maker of the super-popular worldwide Labubu dolls (think Cabbage Patch), fell -8.08% ahead of its Q3 results, although management expects revenues to climb by 245\u2013250% year-over-year. Precious metals were hit by profit-taking again, with Zijin Gold International down -4.29%. Mainland China had an even stronger showing than Hong Kong, as advancers beat decliners, once again led by growth stocks despite slightly light volume. Investors expect the 15th Five-Year Plan draft to place a strong emphasis on science and technology. The Fourth Plenum is underway, where the document is being drafted. As in Hong Kong, the Apple ecosystem did well, led by Foxconn\u2019s +9.57% gain. Shenzhen and the STAR Board outperformed the more value-driven Shanghai market. Mainland insurance stocks were strong, and precious metals ticked higher. Morgan Stanley\u2019s China strategists garnered attention in Mainland media with bullish comments on Mainland China and Hong Kong equities. Overall, a fairly quiet session.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"The breakout finance products of the past decade converge around a single design: a highly engineered lottery. Small, low probability bets with asymmetric upside. Narrative appeal so you can craft a story around your bet. Based on luck, but gives you an illusion of skill. Rapid feedback loops so you win or, more likely, lose money within hours. In this post, I cover parlays, zero day options, and perpetuals: seemingly obscure products that have exploded in adoption to reach mainstream people. Thanks for reading Dopamine Markets! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Sports betting adoption didn\u2019t take off until FanDuel designed a lottery inside it. The most important invention in modern betting is the same game parlay: a single bet that combines multiple independent bets within the same game. Parlays transformed the user experience for casual sports fans. Now, fans can achieve lottery-style outcomes within a few hours of a sports game by betting something as small as five dollars to win a thousand dollars. They can craft a story behind the bet, giving them the perception of skill. When Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said that Russel Westbrook was not a super star, a sports fan could build a parlay around his revenge: Westbrook will answer the insult by scoring over thirty five points, have at least ten assists, and take his team to victory. Sports is reality TV for men; parlays keep them glued to their screens because now they have a stake in the outcome. $150 billion was wagered on sports in 2024. Parlays contribute to two-thirds of sportsbook revenue and to the significant increase in hold, which is sportsbooks\u2019 profit margin on all bets. Sportsbook hold has doubled from 6% when parlays were just introduced to over 12% today. Parlays allow players to place a small bet for life-changing upside. But each leg of the parlay must be won for the player to win the bet, which drastically shrinks the odds. You would have a far higher probability of winning money if you placed all bets individually rather than placing a single parlay bet, but then the user has to click through and submit individual bets and won\u2019t receive lottery-like upside. A parlay bet triggers a bigger rush. Zero day options are short-term options contracts that expire within the same day. They were first introduced by the CBOE in 2005 but limited trading to once a week on Fridays. It was only in 2022 that trading expanded to all five trading days, which unleashed a massive boom in short dated options trading. Zero day options rose from 5% of total options volume in 2016 to 61% by May 2025. Retail share of zero day options volume is a staggering 54%. Zero day options have low premiums and provide a lottery-like payoff since small moves in the underlying asset produce outsized P&L. You can also tie your bet to specific catalysts or events, which are easy to digest on social media. Speculation on whether \u201cTrump will announce a new round of tariffs on China\u201d or \u201cPowell will cut rates\u201d can help people craft a story on why their lottery ticket is a sound investment. Post COVID, there was a massive boom in retail participation in the stock market: 30 million new brokerage accounts were opened in 2020 and 2021. This is more than double the total number of new brokerage accounts opened the decade prior. Retail consumers love zero day options, and brokerages like Robinhood love them more. Options were 26% of Robinhood\u2019s revenue in 2024 with an implied gross margin of over 90%. My friend River Monk texted me an idea to make options even more addicting: I had an absolutely disgusting thought today: Robinhood should offer parlays. Sell customers a call option on multiple assets. For example a call option to buy Apple at $250, NVDA at $190, GameStop at $25 and Bitcoin at $120k, but only if ALL of them are in the money. Robinhood could buy offsetting calls on each individual asset, then sell the parlay \u201cbundle\u201d to retail. Risk-free profit for Robinhood, and their customers would love it. Perpetuals, or perps, are futures contracts with no expiry dates. They were originally designed by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller in the early 1990s to enable traders to hedge against long term economic risks like housing prices or economic growth. Little did he know how degenerately they would be used a few decades later. Technically, perps do not offer a lottery-like convex payoff, i.e. a small fixed cost for a chance at a huge windfall. Perps have linear payoffs: if the price of the asset rises 10% and you\u2019re long with 10x leverage, your P&L is +100%; if it falls 10%, you\u2019re liquidated (\u2013100%). However, perps offer leverage up to 125x depending on the exchange. When you combine leverage with highly volatile underlying assets like crypto tokens, the distribution of outcomes ends up being lottery-shaped: most positions end in small losses or liquidations, a few end in abnormal gains. Perps had minimal adoption until 2016, when the crypto exchange BitMEX introduced perps. Crypto made perps viable because it enabled 24\/7 trading, so funding payments could run continuously. It required no physical delivery and it operated in a regulatory grey zone, side stepping CFTC constraints. But the most important reason for the growth was that crypto markets are highly volatile with high retail demand for leveraged exposure. About half of all crypto trading volume today is perps. Perps are available on major exchanges for retail to trade including BitMEX, Binance, OKX, Bybit, Coinbase, and Kraken. They are also available on decentralized exchanges like Hyperliquid, the most successful decentralized perps exchange. Hyperliquid processes $6 trillion in monthly volume and generates over a billion dollars in annualized revenue, arguably the highest revenue per employee in startup history. Phantom wallet introduced perps trading in June and is already doing $10 billion in monthly volume. South Korea is streaming live perps trading like it\u2019s an esports competition. Robinhood launched their crypto perps product for European customers. Perps are going mainstream, and they are soon going to be accessible to every retail customer to trade crypto assets with 20-100x leverage. Or as Gwart more eloquently put it: We will see many more companies build a lottery-like experience into their product. Prediction markets, for example, may introduce perpetuals to trade bets with leverage or parlays that combine multiple predictions into a single bet. For a small amount of money but potentially massive upside, a user can bet that Mamdani will win the NYC mayoral election, the US will have a recesion, and the Fed cuts will cut rates by 25 bps. An even crazier idea for credit card points: invest a user\u2019s credit card points into zero day options and randomly distribute a lottery-style winning of an enormous amount of points to a select few users.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"Despite all the enthusiasm for AI, which has undoubtedly demonstrated impressive capabilities, the signal from bond markets suggests that investors are unconvinced that the technology will generate sustained or widespread growth, let alone a more extreme positive or negative outcome. What accounts for this disconnect?  CAMBRIDGE \u2013 Speculation about AI\u2019s implications for society has reached a fever pitch. While OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman speaks of a future of radical abundance, others, including another OpenAI co-founder, Ilya Sutskever, warn of existential risks. Meanwhile, economists continue to debate whether AI will usher in\u00a0unprecedented\u00a0prosperity\u00a0or\u00a0widespread\u00a0unemployment.   What are we to make of such wildly\u00a0divergent\u00a0predictions? While we cannot know which future will materialize, we can examine what those with \u201cskin in the game\u201d believe will happen. Financial markets aggregate the views of a multitude of sophisticated investors who are risking money on their convictions. If they genuinely thought AI might transform the economy, this should be reflected in asset prices.   In some respects, the market has certainly delivered a clear signal. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization has soared past $4 trillion as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and other tech giants invest hundreds of billions annually in AI infrastructure. AI firms\u2019 sky-high valuations suggest that investors expect enormous profits.   But who will ultimately benefit, and through what mechanism? Do markets believe that AI will broadly boost productivity, raising living standards across society, or will it generate large, concentrated profits without widespread growth? Economic theory suggests that bond markets may hold the answers to these questions. If investors genuinely expect much higher future incomes from AI-driven productivity growth, they should save less today, driving up interest rates on long-term bonds.    Think of it this way: If you are confident that you will be wealthy in 30 years, you will be less inclined to save aggressively now, and you will demand higher compensation from long-term borrowers for giving up consumption today. Similarly, if AI raises the perceived probability of extreme scenarios \u2013 whether the end of humanity or a post-scarcity economy where all material needs are met \u2013 that should also push up long-term rates, because the value of future consumption relative to present consumption declines. Either way, the implication is that bonds should offer a higher return to convince investors to forgo current consumption.   In recent research, we tested these predictions by examining US Treasury yields around major AI model releases in 2023 and 2024. Each time OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, or DeepSeek released a new flagship model, markets received concrete information about AI\u2019s capabilities and the pace of progress. The results were striking: Rather than rising around the time of AI announcements, long-term bond yields (10-, 20-, and 30-year maturities) fell, typically by more than ten basis points.  For a limited time, you can gain greater access to Project Syndicate \u2013 including every new PS commentary, our entire suite of subscriber-exclusive content, the full PS archive, and more \u2013 starting at just $49.99 for your first year.  SUBSCRIBE NOW   If investors were becoming more optimistic about AI-driven growth, this is not what theory would predict. The declines persisted for weeks after the announcements, and similar patterns appeared in corporate bonds and inflation-protected government-issued securities (implying that inflation is not a key reason for the decline in long-maturity Treasury yields). Moreover, these yield changes were quite large compared to changes around other news releases, such as those following Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meetings.   These data are a puzzle. Falling long-term yields suggest that investors are revising expectations downward \u2013 either by lowering anticipated consumption growth rates, reducing the perceived probability of extreme events, or both. Yet that seems to contradict both the enthusiasm visible in tech valuations and the impressive capabilities recent models have demonstrated.   Although we can interpret these yield changes through standard economic models, any quantitative translation requires assumptions about investor risk preferences. Under conventional assumptions, our results suggest that the average model release led markets to reduce expected annual consumption growth by somewhere between 0.04 and 0.2 percentage points (depending on how risk-averse we assume investors are), or to lower the perceived annual probability of extreme transformation by 0.2 percentage points.    Importantly, we find little evidence that rising uncertainty about future consumption growth drives these patterns. Instead, the changes appear driven by investors\u2019 growth expectations, rather than their uncertainty.   Could disappointing AI progress explain these results? This seems unlikely. Using data from Metaculus, a platform where participants predict AI milestones, we found that forecasters generally updated toward faster progress around these releases, suggesting they were positively, rather than negatively, surprised by the degree of technical progress revealed by most updates.   This leaves us searching for explanations. Perhaps investors worry that AI will produce disruption and displacement without generating substantial growth. Alternatively, they might think AI\u2019s benefits will flow primarily to tech companies and their shareholders while costs (job losses, downward wage pressure, and increased inequality) spread widely across the population, leading to lower aggregate consumption even as certain sectors prosper enormously.   Another possibility is that we are observing reactions to something else correlated with AI announcements. While we cannot rule that out entirely, any alternative explanation must produce large, persistent downward movements concentrated in long-maturity bond yields, coinciding specifically with these release dates \u2013 itself a pattern requiring explanation.   We think our findings cut through the speculation in a useful way. Financial markets do appear to take AI\u2019s economic potential seriously \u2013 given the economically large and statistically significant reactions beyond tech-sector enthusiasm. But the signal from bond markets suggests investors are unconvinced that AI will generate sustained or widespread growth, or more extreme outcomes, even as equity markets highlight the profit potential for specific firms.\u00a0    In other words, markets appear to think the path from impressive AI capabilities to widespread prosperity is less straightforward than optimistic narratives suggest. Understanding whether investors\u2019 caution reflects concerns about disruption, distribution, or other factors is crucial for designing appropriate policy responses. Speculation about what AI will mean for the economy will continue and perhaps intensify. As market participants place their bets, the resulting picture is more complex, and more concerning, than current headlines suggest.

{"date":"2025-10-21","content":"Last year, Apple won a 2021 lawsuit in China that accused it of charging excessive commissions on the App Store. Now, one lawyer behind that case is challenging Apple\u2019s App Store practices once again. Here are the details. In 2021, one Chinese customer filed a lawsuit claiming that Apple\u2019s 30% App Store commission caused higher prices compared to Android. The Shanghai Intellectual Property Court, however, saw it differently. In its decision, the court said that Apple\u2019s fees weren\u2019t \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than the fees practiced on competing app stores, and that, as reported at the time by The South China Morning Post, \u201cthere [was] no evidence suggesting that the fees directly led to higher prices for consumers\u201d. At the time, the law firm representing the client said they planned to file an appeal, and the case remains pending. Now, under a very different regulatory landscape, one of the lawyers from the original lawsuit has filed a new complaint. As reported by Reuters, the new lawsuit was filed on behalf of 55 Chinese iPhone and iPad users, and it argues that \u201cApple maintains a monopoly over iOS app distribution in China while permitting alternative payment methods and app stores in other markets following regulatory pressure from the European Union and United States\u201d. Filed with China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, the complaint accuses the company of: As regular 9to5Mac readers know, these accusations echo arguments that have proven effective in markets where Apple has faced tighter regulatory scrutiny, or was outright compelled to make changes.
