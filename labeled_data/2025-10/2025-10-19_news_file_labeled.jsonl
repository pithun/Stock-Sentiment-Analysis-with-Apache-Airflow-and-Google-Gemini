Formula 1 fans know the thrill of collecting memorabilia, but official F1 merchandise usually comes with hefty price tags. LEGO sets tied to racing deliver that collecting satisfaction while giving you something to actually build and display. With the Austin Grand Prix happening today, LEGO is capitalizing on the F1 buzz by dropping this 6-pack of collectible F1 race cars to an all-time low of $20 on Amazon, down from $29. That works out to just over $3 per car which is ridiculous pricing for official LEGO F1 builds. See at Amazon The collection includes 6 randomly chosen mini F1 cars from a total of 12 different models, and every box is an opening surprise. The roster includes real 2024 F1 teams such as Red Bull\u2019s RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, and Haas, along with an F1 car and F1 Academy car. Every model comes with the unique livery and color of its team, right down to the exact team logo and sponsor decals that immediately identify them with anyone who\u2019s a sports fan. The surprise is that you don\u2019t know what six you\u2019re receiving until you open the box\u00c2\u00a0which introduces the aspect of collecting that kids and adults alike find actually fun. Every vehicle has a team-specific helmet inside the cockpit, mimicking the actual drivers\u2019 equipment. The wheels even spin, so they are not just for show. Children are able to roll them over surfaces and set up their own racing, re-creating passes and duels they\u2019ve watched on television. The spinning wheels are just a little detail, but it makes these go from flat-out collectibles to toys that invite make-believe play and storytelling. With 174 pieces in total across all six cars, the build complexity is exactly between the ages of 6 and older. Each individual car is probably 10 to 15 minutes to build, so they\u2019re all good fast builds without consuming hours of build time. Each car costs about 29 pieces, sufficient to make comprehensible F1 forms with the characteristic halo cockpit cover, front and back wings, and aerodynamic body style that are trademarks of contemporary Formula 1 design. The small size makes them perfectly aligned to be displayed on bookshelves, desktops, or shelves without taking up much space. Display the six of them to present a miniature grid setup, or combine them with other Lego F1 sets if you are collecting a massive collection. The size is perfectly aligned for dioramas or race environments if you prefer to customize your own display. As the total of 12 cars is available in the full set, there is a clear accomplishment goal completionists are striving for, and double-trading with friends provides a social collecting aspect. For die-hard F1 enthusiasts who don\u2019t want to expend vast sums of money on diecast models or clothing, this set provides official branding and proper team representation for pennies compared to the cost. As LEGO, it\u2019s something with wide appeal across the board to everyone from young children just getting into F1 to older adult fanatics who are collectors of racing memorabilia. At $20 for a half-dozen cars, it\u2019s the most affordable means of getting official F1 team merchandise since Austin\u2019s GP puts people in racing mode.

Apple has a reputation for keeping prices locked at full retail, especially on their latest releases. The company never discounts anything directly which makes finding deals on new Apple hardware feel like spotting a unicorn. That\u2019s why the current situation with the 2024 Mac Mini is worth your attention: Amazon just dropped the latest 256GB M4 model to $499, down from $599, and this is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen on Apple\u2019s newest compact desktop. For this level of performance in such a compact package, there\u2019s really no point looking at Windows alternatives right now. See at Amazon The M4 chip in this Mac Mini features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU which means serious computation from an object that\u2019s hardly larger than a coaster. Apple\u2019s chip design means these cores operate differently than standard Intel or AMD processors. The CPU is divided between performance and efficiency cores and uses heavy tasks such as video or 3D rendering on the performance cores and background tasks on efficiency cores without draining power and heat. The total 16GB of RAM comes into play here as Apple\u2019s architecture divides RAM between the GPU and the CPU instead of having independent ones like in the ancient machines. The system dynamically allocates memory depending on what you\u2019re doing in this integrated manner so 16GB is more than enough compared to the same in the case of Windows. You can trim 4K video, have several creative programs open at once, or seriously multitask without the system bogging down. The 256GB SSD offers speedy storage that\u2019s light years ahead of the hard drives still found in value PCs. This Mac Mini coexists nicely with Apple\u2019s ecosystem in ways Windows mini PCs don\u2019t: The Continuity features allow you to begin writing on your iPad or iPhone and resume where you stopped on the Mac Mini. AirDrop shares files from one device to another in an instant and hassle-free process. You can use your iPhone as a webcam for FaceTime, reply to messages directly from your desktop or even use your Apple Watch to control your Mac by unlocking it. Wired Gigabit Ethernet is the standard with you getting to enjoy wired network speeds that blow WiFi for massive file transfers or streaming video. WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless connectivity is also available on the Mac Mini. Port alternatives are also ample with various Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports providing up to 40Gbps data transmission speeds, up to 6K resolution support for external displays, and speedy charging of devices. Two USB-A ports are included for legacy peripherals, and the headphone port is capable of driving high-impedance headphones to provide high-quality audio without an attached DAC. Its small size allows it to vanish on a desk or be screwed behind a monitor with a VESA adapter. It is only 7.7 inches by 7.7 inches and 2 inches in height, occupying less space than most external hard drives. The fanless design makes it silent to operate which is ideal for recording studios, bedrooms, or offices where fan noise becomes irritating. Priced at $499, this Mac Mini offers performance that would run much higher in a run-of-the-mill desktop or mini PC of this size. If you\u2019ve been waiting for Apple to budge on pricing, this is as good as it gets. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

Reviews ethics statement      Find out why items like marshmallows and some cheeses don't always meet vegetarian standards.    If you're a vegetarian, you need to check the labels on these 10 foods more closely. Think that vegetable soup,\u00a0wine, or even a pack of tortillas is automatically safe for your\u00a0plant-based\u00a0or\u00a0vegan diet? You might want to take a closer look at the label. It turns out a shocking number of everyday foods that seem completely animal-free are secretly hiding animal byproducts. These sneaky ingredients can be in everything from your snacks to your drinks, and you'd probably never even know it. We spoke with food and drink experts to get the real story on 10 common foods that aren't always as vegetarian-friendly as you think. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Real Parmigiano-Reggiano isn't a vegetarian product, due to the use of rennet during production. Alarmist headlines like to specifically call out Parmigiano-Reggiano as a nonvegetarian cheese, but Parm is far from the only culprit in the cheese category that contains more than just milk.\u00a0 \"Cheese is often not vegetarian because of the use of rennet, which helps the milk coagulate and separate into curds and whey,\" explained Emily Monaco, an international cheese judge and journalist. \"Traditionally, rennet comes from the stomach of a baby animal: calf, kid or lamb. While similar, [plant-based] enzymes can be used for similar effects, many cheeses rely on animal-based rennet, especially in France,\" and throughout Europe. Check your ingredient lists, or ask your cheesemonger if you're unsure. \"Rennet\" will pretty much always indicate animal rennet, but \"vegetarian rennet,\" \"microbial rennet,\" \"thistle (cardoon) rennet\" or another coagulant such as lemon juice, acid or vinegar indicate a truly vegetarian cheese. Certain types of white sugar are produced using bone char. Yep, even something as basic as sugar might have nonvegetarian aspects to it. \"There are sugars that are processed using bone char, which is made from charred animal bones,\" said Maricel Gentile, cooking instructor, chef and owner of Maricel's Kitchen. \"Bone char whitens the sugar in the process.\"\u00a0 Fortunately, this doesn't apply to all sugar, but certain brands or specific sugar processing plants may use bone char, which should rightfully give some vegetarians pause. \"Not all white sugar is processed like this. Some use filtration methods that use carbon instead,\" said Gentile. \"Check the label, or look for organic or beet sugar, which typically don't use bone char methods.\" If you've ever seen a label on a bottle of wine that indicates the wine is vegan and wondered why that even needed to be mentioned -- surely all wine must be vegan, yes? -- well, there's a reason. \"Although it may sound strange, not all wines are vegan-friendly,\" said wine journalist Vicki Denig. \"Some producers will use animal-derived products to 'fine' -- which essentially means to clarify -- wines.\" Depending on what method a producer chooses to fine its products, many wines would still be considered vegetarian, but not always. \"During the fining process, these products basically bind and remove unwanted sediments or substances and are then filtered out,\" Denig explained. \"Such products include -- but are not limited to -- egg whites, casein, gelatin and more.\" Isinglass, another element that's sometimes used to filter wine, is actually a fish by-product. Read more:\u00a0Best Wine Clubs and Subscriptions to Gift in 2025 The surest way to know that a wine is vegan is to look for wines that are labeled accordingly. Otherwise, until there's legislation requiring winemakers to include ingredient lists on bottles, you might need to go deep into a producer's website to find out.\u00a0 Traditional tortillas are often made using lard. You don't necessarily need to be overly cautious about tortillas that you bring home from the grocery store, but when dining out for Mexican food, it's good to be aware that a staple component of many Mexican dishes isn't automatically vegetarian. \"Traditionally, Mexican tortillas, particularly flour tortillas, are made with lard, which adds a rich flavor and a desirable texture,\" explained Wes Avila, chef of MXO in Los Angeles. Lard is rendered animal fat, and its use can vary by region. \"In contrast, most grocery store brands of tortillas, especially the mass-produced varieties, often use vegetable oils or no fat at all, to cater to a wider audience,\" said Avila, \"including those who prefer vegetarian or vegan options. Always check the ingredient list if you're looking for a specific type of tortilla.\" Watch out for lard or bits of pork in this Mexican staple side dish. Lots of preparations involving beans use noticeable bits of pork, but another element from Mexican cuisine that may seem vegetarian but isn't, is refried beans. \"With traditional Mexican recipes, refried beans will often be prepared using lard,\" said Mexican-American chef and cookbook author Kristyn Merkley. Check labels when shopping for packaged refried beans, and don't make assumptions when dining out -- be sure to ask. You might find that chefs adapt their refried beans to suit vegetarian clientele. \"A shortening like Crisco also works,\" said Merkley, and you can easily adapt a refried beans recipe that calls for lard. \"Home cooks can use vegetable oil instead to make it vegetarian, or use plant-based milk or cheese,\" she said, for a fully vegan version. The reason pie crust is so good has a lot to do with lard. Lard also happens to be a traditional ingredient in something you might find on the dessert menu. \"Pie crust often uses lard,\" said Gentile. \"It makes a beautiful flakey texture.\" Meat pies are one thing, but yes, lard is frequently preferred by pastry chefs even for sweet pies. Despite being meat-based, lard has a neutral flavor, so you wouldn't be likely to tell the difference between a pie crust that used lard and one that used a different kind of fat. Lard isn't universal, however, either in restaurants and bakeries, or in prepared grocery store crusts. \"Some use butter, and others use shortening,\" Gentile explained. \"If you are not making the crust yourself, check the label or ask your baker.\" Caesar dressing often has pureed anchovy in it. There's a particular element to Caesar dressing that gives it its rich flavor. If you've never witnessed Caesar dressing being made, then you might be tempted to believe it's just cheese (which again, might not be entirely vegetarian either) that gives Caesar its distinctiveness. With no offense to cheese, the depth of Caesar dressing goes way beyond what cheese alone can achieve. \"Caesar dressing catches a lot of vegetarians off guard because it's made with anchovies, which aren't always obvious in the ingredient list,\" said Dennis Littley, chef and recipe expert at Ask Chef Dennis. \"Many people assume it's just a creamy dressing made with parmesan, garlic and lemon, but traditional recipes rely on anchovies for that deep, savory umami flavor.'' Another common condiment that may be in your fridge right now is also a hidden source of anchovies. (Or not so hidden, so long as you're reading the label closely.) \"A lot of people don't realize that Worcestershire sauce usually contains anchovies because it just adds a rich, savory depth to food rather than a fishy taste,\" said Rena Awada, owner and head chef at Healthy Fitness Meals. \"Since you don't really taste the fishiness, it's easy to overlook,\" she said, \"until you check the ingredients and realize it's not vegetarian after all.\" What's more, Worcestershire sauce is a common ingredient in other products -- salad dressings, steak sauce, barbecue sauce or marinades -- whose bold flavors may not make it obvious that they may also contain unexpected seafood. Jell-O and similar products get their jiggle from gelatin. You may already know that gelatin itself is an animal by-product, but if not, \"gelatin is made from the collagen found in the cartilage, bones and skin of animals,\" said Gentile. \"Cows and pigs are the most common source. When these parts are simmered down, the collagen breaks down into gelatin.\" Avoiding gelatin means much more than just avoiding Jell-O, though, if you're a strict vegetarian. \"Things like marshmallows, gummy candies, and fruit snacks probably are what we all think of when we think of gelatin, but even yogurt, ice cream, sour cream and cream cheese can contain gelatin to stabilize it,\" explained Gentile. \"'Diet,' 'light,' or 'low-fat' foods will also often use additives like gelatin to make up for the lack of natural fat binders,\" she said. Even the coating of some vitamin capsules can be made of gelatin. You'd be surprised by how many vegetable soups use chicken stock as a base. Soup can often be a source of hidden animal products, as many use an animal-based stock such as beef or chicken, which offers a deep flavor. Double-check soups like cream of broccoli, mushroom, carrot, and so on. They can all have a meaty base.\u00a0 Even straightforward vegetable soup, which would seem to have a tomato base, can have animal stock as a foundation. Many brands that produce vegetable soup are vegetarian or vegan, but soup should always be a label-check situation.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":" Look, I\u2019ve seen enough \u201ceco-friendly\u201d product launches to fill a landfill, which is precisely the irony we\u2019re dealing with here. But Lifelong Deo 2.0 caught my attention because it\u2019s tackling the deodorant problem from an angle that actually makes sense: stop making the damn thing disposable. Adam Webb\u2019s second-generation refillable deodorant system launches on Kickstarter October 16th, and unlike the parade of greenwashed garbage we usually see, this one\u2019s built around some genuinely clever design decisions and a business model that doesn\u2019t treat sustainability as a marketing afterthought. The original Lifelong Deo was anodized aluminum, expensive, and pulled in \u20ac354,000 on Kickstarter in 2023, making it the most successful deodorant campaign on the platform. Version 2.0 pivots hard toward accessibility. The new applicator is made from 100% ocean-bound recycled plastic, comes with a lifetime guarantee, and costs significantly less than its predecessor. More importantly, it\u2019s designed around a refill system that actually eliminates single-use plastic instead of just reducing it. The refill pouches are compostable, paper-based, and you mix the powder formula with water at home. No plastic bottles showing up at your door every month pretending to be sustainable because they\u2019re \u2018technically recyclable\u2019. Designer: Adam Webb Click Here to Buy Now: $28.2 $46.9 (40% off). Hurry, only 91\/300.  Here\u2019s where the math gets interesting \u2013 each applicator sold removes 1kg of ocean plastic through their partnership with Seven Clean Seas. Their first campaign cleared 3,960kg, and they\u2019re targeting 15,000kg with this launch. That\u2019s not save-the-world territory, but it\u2019s verifiable impact tied directly to sales, which beats the hell out of vague carbon offset promises. The applicator itself comes in 8 colors, the roller balls come in 8 colors, giving you 64 possible combinations. That customization angle is smart because it transforms a utilitarian bathroom product into something people might actually want to keep visible, which matters when your entire business model depends on people not throwing the thing away.  The formula side is where they\u2019re threading a needle. You get four scent options: Silver Bergamot (citrus), Spiced Oakwood (woody\/spicy), Orange Blossom (floral), and an unscented Zero option. All the deodorant formulas are 100% natural, plant-based, no parabens, no phthalates, dermatologically tested. But here\u2019s the thing that\u2019ll piss off the natural-everything crowd: they\u2019re also offering a 4% aluminum antiperspirant option. Webb\u2019s argument is that mainstream antiperspirants use up to 20% aluminum, so 4% gives you the sweat protection people actually want while being gentler and safer for long-term use. It\u2019s pragmatic, and it acknowledges that not everyone wants to smell like a kombucha brewery by noon.  The design language is unapologetically bright and playful, which feels like a deliberate rebuke of the minimalist-white-bathroom aesthetic that dominates sustainable personal care. The interchangeable colored balls make the product look more like a fidget toy than a deodorant, and that\u2019s probably the point. If you want people to fundamentally change their consumption habits, making the alternative genuinely more enjoyable than the disposable version matters more than lecturing them about ocean plastics. The applicator is chunky, tactile, built to last, and designed to sit on your counter rather than hide in a drawer. Plus, the incredibly lightweight design lends itself perfectly to travel, making the deo a perfect \u2018chuck-in-bag\u2019 accessory for your travel kits.   Webb\u2019s roadmap includes expansion into gyms, hotels, spas, and major retail by 2026, plus body wash, hand soap, and toothpaste down the line. The model scales if it works, and the Kickstarter fulfillment track record (four months, all backers fulfilled) suggests they can actually execute. Whether this becomes the standard for personal care or just another niche product for people who already buy reusable everything remains to be seen, but the design thinking here is solid enough that it deserves attention beyond the usual sustainability circuit.

A woman who's been driving for Uber for more than a decade explains how she's looking for new work as her pay drops. Tomorrow's the big launch of First Trade, our new markets newsletter led by Joe Ciolli. Subscribe here! On the agenda today: But first: There's a new gig in town. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The gig economy is facing a reckoning. Two stories this past week caught my eye. Uber unveiled a new way for its drivers to earn money. No, not by giving rides, but by helping train the ride-sharing company's AI models instead. On the same day, Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to test driverless grocery and meal deliveries. Both moves point toward the same future: one where the very workers who built the gig economy may soon find themselves training the technology that replaces them. Uber's new program allows drivers to earn cash by completing microtasks, such as taking photos and uploading audio clips, that aim to improve the company's AI systems. For drivers, it's a way to diversify income. For Uber, it's a way to accelerate its automated future. There's an irony here. By helping Uber strengthen its AI, drivers could be accelerating the very driverless world they fear. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has said human drivers won't vanish overnight. Still, he has warned that the eventual decline of driving jobs poses a significant societal challenge to the gig economy. Uber already offers autonomous rides in Waymo vehicles in Atlanta and Austin, and plans to expand. Meanwhile, Waymo is rolling out its pilot partnership with DoorDash, starting in Phoenix. DashMart stores are expected to be the first retailer on the platform. BI reported that customers may be asked to pay a delivery charge \u2014 just like they would for typical DoorDash orders \u2014 but there will be no need to tip the driver because, well, there's no driver. All of this is ripe fodder for a virtual event Business Insider is hosting on Wednesday, where we'll explore how AI and automation are reshaping the self-driving revolution. I'll be speaking with automotive innovators, AI experts, and urban mobility leaders. The best part about the event \u2014 it's free! Hope to see you there.

Divorce rates for heterosexual couples go up when a woman is more professionally successful than the man, and they go down when the opposite is true. It shows how women's economic progress is clashing with old expectations about marriage, an executive coach said. But it doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. As of this month, the Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports, according to an internal list obtained by BI. The list offers a glimpse into the group of leaders at the top of the world's most valuable company. Last year, Huang said he had 55 direct reports. He's known for having many people report into him, and has said it helps with information flow. Here's who's reporting to Huang. Amazon Web Services is feeling a shift in one of its biggest clientele segments, according to internal documents obtained by BI. Startups, which typically allocate a significant portion of their budgets to AWS, are instead spending it on AI tools. \"Founders tell us they seek to adopt AWS at a later stage,\" the company warned in one of the documents.

Become a member and be part of the work that matters. Already contributed? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost The country \u2015 and the global financial market \u2015 is reeling from a week of whiplash tariff policy changes from the White House. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced on social media that he\u2019s issuing a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to most nations, while raising U.S. tariff charges on China to 125%.  The move comes after Trump initially announced his \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs on April 2, sending the stock market into a downward spiral and leaving many a MAGA supporter shaken. A poll by Reuters and Ipsos found that nearly 25% of Republicans opposed Trump\u2019s tariffs, which the president said were meant to restore U.S. manufacturing to its glory days.  \u201cThis is not what we voted for,\u201d said hedge fund billionaire and vocal Trump supporter Bill Ackman on X over the weekend, echoing the sentiments of many rattled Trump supporters. While tariffs have long been cornerstone of Trump\u2019s economic policy, the market instability triggered by the president\u2019s action could lead some to jump off the Trump train. That may be especially true for fiscal conservatives who held their noses while voting for Trump in the election, in the hopes that he\u2019d be as stable in his approach to the economy as he was during his first term. (Then again, after the market surged in the wake of the tariff reversal, some supporters \u2015 Ackman included \u2015 painted Trump out to be an economic mastermind.) Other supporters jumped off the Trump train long ago. Recently, we spoke to some of them, asking them how he gained their support to begin with, and what he did to lose it. Here\u2019s what they had to say. (Responses have been lightly edited for clarity.) \u201cI am a registered Republican who actively campaigned for and voted for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024. I have always supported him because of his MAGA ideals. He seemed to be honest and made good on his promises to the American people during his first term. I thought he would get us out of some of the bad circumstances we as a nation have fallen into under other presidents.  Two days after I celebrated him taking office in 2025, he cut my position within the federal government. I am a 21-year federal employee who took a position last year in the Office of Equity Assurance at the VA (Veterans Affairs). In that capacity, we were working to assist underserved veteran populations within the U.S. and its territories: rural and tribal veterans, women veterans, minorities, senior veterans, homeless vets. We were working to figure out what disparities these groups face because of where they live, and trying to offer them a more equal chance at obtaining VA benefits. Sadly, we were deemed to be DEI, and Trump signed an executive order following his inauguration which eliminated all DEI offices within the federal government. His EO technically ended our positions, but because of our tenure, veterans status, longevity, and performance status within VA, our senior leadership was planning to reassign each of us to other areas of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) \u2015 but Elon Musk and DOGE cancelled those reassignment plans and terminated us via Reduction in Force (RIF). I\u2019ve been pretty bitter ever since. I will be moving towards becoming an Independent from now on.\u201d \u2015 Denise, a 58-year-old from Northern Virginia  \u201cWhen I supported him, I was still under 18. Back then, it was mostly because supporting him was socially popular in my area, with my family, my friends, and my community. I wasn\u2019t educated on politics and kind of bought into the narrative that he was a successful businessman who would do great things for America. I did identify as a Republican at the time, but I don\u2019t anymore; now, I consider myself a Social Democrat. The final straw for me was January 6. Up until that point, I wasn\u2019t totally convinced his policies were bad \u2015 on paper, some things still sounded like they could work. But the extreme division in the country, which was especially clear on that day, made it obvious to me that he would never be able to implement any policy effectively. A leader who divides the country that deeply just isn\u2019t capable of creating positive, lasting change on a national level.\u201d \u2015 Dean Withers, a 20-year-old from Colorado  \u201cI\u2019ve voted GOP since 1984, my first time voting. I stopped in 2020. The last straw? Trump\u2019s misogyny. His racism. National security advisers and generals and chiefs of staff told us, \u2018Don\u2019t vote for this guy, don\u2019t support this guy\u2019 \u2014 one of whom, Mark Milley, a Marine and a man\u2019s man, has said Trump is the most dangerous person he\u2019s ever met. Mad Dog Mattis said pretty much the same thing. Rex Tillerson, Mark Esper ... this goes on and on.  Then there\u2019s his grifting. What kind of president sells bibles, gold shoes and a $100,000 watch (that will likely never be on the market or delivered), but you can buy it through Bitcoin? That means you\u2019re making a $100,000 donation to Trump that can\u2019t be traced. That is the ultimate grift. His daughter and son-in-law received billions from the Saudis. His convictions, his indictments, January 6 \u2014 he encouraged a rabid insurrection and then, in real time, refused to do anything to stop it, and told us he would pardon those who did it. What kind of world is this?  My wife teaches middle school math and she says that Donald Trump could not get a job at her school, not as a teacher, or a substitute or the person serving food in the cafeteria line. And yet, almost half of our country still supports him. They\u2019re willing to have a lower standard for the president than they would have for their own elementary or middle school staff. He\u2019s a horrible influence. Why did I turn away from Trump? Why would anybody stick with him?\u201d \u2015 Danny, a 62-year-old from Texas \u201cThe only year I voted for him was 2016. I supported him as his opposition was atrocious in comparison. He didn\u2019t have a political record to look back on, so as far as that was concerned he was squeaky clean. I also liked the idea of getting someone in office who was not a politician. I am not a Republican or a Democrat. Trump\u2019s order to the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms to ban bump stocks in light of the Las Vegas shooting was what convinced me not to vote for him again. I can not in good conscious cast a vote for someone who infringes on the constitution. (Editor\u2019s note: In 2024, the Supreme Court struck down Trump\u2019s federal ban on bump stocks.)  My advice to anyone that is feeling disillusioned, it is absolutely OK to change your mind. In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s healthy to change your mind.\u201d \u2015 Cameron, a 27-year-old from Michigan  \u201cI supported him in 2016 and 2020 because I was a cynical, disenchanted voter who felt that our established political order needed to be obliterated and started anew; Trump, I thought, was the ideal candidate. Before Trump, I was neither a Republican nor Democrat, and often voted third-party.  It was in the summer of 2021 when I began to question my allegiance to Trump, the MAGA movement and my governor, Ron DeSantis. Trump\u2019s mismanagement of COVID, 2020 election lies, and acceptance of avoidable deaths, suffering and violence were lines of demarcation I could not cross. The final straw, and what started my leaving-MAGA odyssey, was the Republican response to the Uvalde school massacre. Four months later, I published a mea culpa, renouncing my MAGA activism and punditry. It was difficult to leave MAGA because you\u2019re leaving behind a community and second family. Though it\u2019s painful to realize that so much of what I had believed\u2014 and that I politically advocated for \u2014 was incorrect. What I\u2019d tell others is, we voted for Trump for what we thought were the right reasons, but it is never too late to change one\u2019s mind; doing so is not a weakness \u2013 it\u2019s a show of evolution, growth and maturation.\u201d \u2015 Rich Logis, a 48-year-old from South Florida, and the creator of the website Leaving MAGA  \u201cI voted for Trump in 2016 as a Republican, though today I consider myself independent. No, that\u2019s not code for \u2018closeted Republican.\u2019 Back then, he appealed to me because he came off as bold, funny and unfiltered. He projected a kind of strength that conservatives had long wanted but rarely saw: someone who punched back, who didn\u2019t let the media or opponents box him in. And if you were frustrated like I was \u2015 bitter, even \u2015 about being misrepresented or accused of bad faith by liberal peers, it felt cathartic. Trump embodied the resentment many of us felt, whether we admitted it or not. Around 2018, I deleted Facebook and took a break from politics altogether. I started reading books like \u2018Grace Revolution\u2019 by Joseph Prince \u2015 which emphasizes grace over condemnation and offered a path toward self-acceptance and transformation. I learned that we are not simply the sum of our political affiliations, just as we are not the sum of our worst selves.  But as I changed, I also noticed something unsettling: the rhetoric I once cheered on \u2014 from Trump, from conservative media \u2014 mirrored the harsh, graceless voices in my own head. The self-righteous grandstanding of your typical FOX or OAN host clashed with my newfound humility. I realized that it wasn\u2019t just the polarized environment that made me feel bad \u2014 the worst offenders of dehumanization were coming from \u2018my side.\u2019 Instead of working through their flaws in public, Trump and MAGA used their self-righteous anger and power as a shield to deflect accountability and project strength where there was often insecurity. I started to see right through it. MAGA ideology, I realized, was less about protecting people or making America great again and more about controlling the narrative \u2015 driven by shame, fear, and dominance. It was Pharisaical, and it stood in stark contrast to Christ, who sat with outcasts and lifted them up rather than crushing them under law. It clashed with the humility and grace expected of people we universally acclaim as good.\u201d \u2015 Matthew, Texas, 33 \u201cI\u2019m a former journalist. My views are pretty mixed: I have strong views that reflect both Republican and Democratic leanings, yet there is no major party for that. I am married to a Republican and he and I have many discussions about the world, the state of our nation and who leads it. I think this election I chose Trump because I did not feel Kamala was ready. I think it was a job she would have had to grow into, and how long would it take?  I\u2019m so sorry I did not vote for Harris. My vote went ultimately to what feels like a South African chainsaw artist who has no regards to sensitive populations like little kids on federal lunch programs and young adults trying to get educations.\u201d \u2015 Susan from Illinois  \u201cI voted for Trump in the 2016 election. At the time I was a Republican and diehard Trump supporter who was very active online and interpersonally promoting his ideas and platform. I supported Trump all along during his first term up until the pandemic. That\u2019s when he lost me, and it was a relatively simple thing. I was initially fairly disappointed by how his administration handled the pandemic lockdowns compared to places like Canada and Europe, which were doing a much better job of handling COVID, something I took seriously. The singular event which cracked my perception of Trump was when he was discussing COVID-19 and said he wanted to bring light inside the body to kill the virus. That idea was so utterly stupid, so profoundly ignorant, so laughably bad that it immediately shook my perception of him, and cast doubt on everything else, too.\u201d \u2015 Mark from the Midwest \u201cIn 2020, at the age of 18, I cast my vote for Donald Trump. As a freshman in college, I had not yet fully engaged with politics. At that time, I did not support his candidacy and hoped for a president who would advocate for universal healthcare. However, many of my friends \u2015 particularly those who shared my Christian faith \u2015 encouraged me to support the Republican candidate and vote in alignment with my parents\u2019 political views.

Not long after, I chose to pursue a degree in social work, where I earned my bachelor\u2019s by working with marginalized communities, including single mothers, survivors of sexual assault, at-risk youth, and individuals with disabilities. This experience led me to deeply regret supporting a candidate who failed to recognize the intrinsic value and dignity of these individuals, and whose policies often seemed to disregard their fundamental right to equality and respect. Reflecting on my faith, I was reminded of the biblical teachings in the Book of James, which emphasize the importance of caring for the most vulnerable in society, including orphans and widows. Since then, I have earned a master\u2019s degree in Clinical Social Work, become a foster mother, provided therapy to incarcerated individuals, volunteered with homeless populations, and advocated for universal healthcare. Over time, I became increasingly disillusioned with Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies, particularly his lack of regard for basic human rights \u2014 such as access to food, water, shelter, and healthcare \u2014 as well as his mockery of individuals with disabilities. In 2024, I cast my vote for Kamala Harris. Although she did not win, I have no regrets about my vote. I remain hopeful that one day, America will truly live up to its ideals of liberty and justice for all.\u201d \u2015 Emma  By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"It is the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa disappeared in 1911. And it poses serious questions about levels of security covering French artworks, at a time when they are increasingly being targeted by criminal gangs. According to France's new interior minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, the gang that broke into the Apollo Gallery on Sunday morning was clearly professional. They knew what they wanted, had evidently \"cased the joint\" in advance, had a brazenly simple but effective modus operandi, and needed no more than seven minutes to take their booty and get away. In a truck equipped with an elevating platform of the type used by removal companies, they parked on the street outside, raised themselves up to the first floor, then used a disc-cutter to enter through a window. Inside the richly decorated gallery they made for two display-cases which contain what remains of the French crown jewels. Most of France's royal regalia was lost or sold after the 1789 Revolution, but some items were saved or bought back. Most of what was in the cases, though, dates from the 19th Century and the two imperial families of Napoleon and his nephew Napoleon III. According to the authorities, eight items were taken including diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches. They had belonged to Napoleon's wife the empress Marie-Louise; to his sister-in-law Queen Hortense of Holland; to Queen Marie-Amelie, wife of France's last King Louis-Philippe, who ruled from 1830 to 1848; and to the empress Eug\u00e9nie, wife of Napoleon III, who ruled from 1852 to 1870. A crown of the empress Eug\u00e9nie was also taken, but was recovered damaged near the museum after the thieves seemingly dropped it. In a statement the culture ministry said that the alarms had sounded correctly. Five museum staff who were in the gallery or nearby followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors. It said the gang had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member. The heist took place in a gallery just a short walk from some of the world's most famous paintings \u2013 such as the Mona Lisa. But the criminal groups that order heists like this do not target world-famous paintings that cannot ever be displayed or sold. They prefer items that can be converted into cash \u2013 and jewels top the list. However huge their historical and cultural value, crowns and diadems can easily be broken apart and sold in bits. Even large and famous diamonds can be cut. The final sales price might not be what the original artefact was worth, but it will still be considerable. Two recent museum thefts in France had already alerted the authorities to the growing audacity of art gangs, and a security plan drawn up by the culture ministry is gradually being put into effect across France.   \"We are well aware that French museums are vulnerable,\" said Nu\u00f1ez. In September thieves took raw gold \u2013 in its mineral state \u2013 from the Natural History Museum in Paris. The gold was worth about \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3520,000) and will have been easily disposed of on the black market. In the same month thieves took porcelain worth \u20ac6m from a museum in Limoges \u2013 a city once famous for its chinaware. The haul could well have been commissioned by a foreign buyer. The Louvre contains thousands of artworks that are famous around the world, and an equal number of more obscure items that are nonetheless culturally significant. But in its 230-year history there have been relatively few thefts \u2013 largely thanks to the tight security in place. The most recent disappearance was of a landscape by the 19th Century artist Camille Corot. Le Chemin de S\u00e8vres (The Road to S\u00e8vres) was simply removed from a wall in 1998 when no-one was looking, and has not been seen since. But by far the most famous theft was the one that took place in 1911, when Leonardo da Vinci's La Joconde \u2013 better known now as the Mona Lisa \u2013 was taken. The culprit back then hid in a closet overnight, then was able to remove the painting from its frame, wrap it up in his smock, tuck it under his arm and walk out. It turned out he was an Italian nationalist who wanted the artwork brought back home. It was found in Italy in 1914 and returned to the Louvre. Unless they have a quick success in catching the thieves, today's investigators are unlikely to be so lucky.   The first aim of the gang will be to disperse the jewels and sell them on. It will not be hard. The world-famous museum in Paris was closed on Sunday after a masked gang raided one of its galleries. The University of Northampton is showing work by George Herbert Buckingham Holland and Jean O'Neill. More than 850 people sign a petition opposing the closure of the campus art store.

The scene suggests a bright and sunny day, with the pickleball clearly in motion.                                                           Stefania Pelfini la Waziya\/Moment RF\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  Pickleball has quickly become huge in the United States, with nearly 20 million people playing the sport. But that popularity comes with a price. With more people on the court, pickleball-related eye injuries, including lacerations around the eye, corneal abrasions and inflamed irises, have increased. A study published this week in JAMA Ophthalmology estimates that the incidence of these injuries has risen dramatically, going up by an estimated 405 cases each year from 2021 to 2024. Researchers looked at data from a representative population of patients in emergency departments across the U.S. to understand which pickleball players are especially vulnerable to eye injuries and how they occurred. From there, they estimated what those trends looked like on a national scale. Given the \"alarming\" increase in eye injury cases, the study authors called for developing standardized guidelines for eye protection, which has been found to reduce up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries. Other sports such as squash have mandated such guidelines. The study found that 70% of cases were in adults 50 years or older. Dr. Natasha Desai, the co-director for the Center for Women's Sports Medicine at NYU Langone, was surprised to see this finding because a large share of sports-related injuries occur in young players. Desai, who wasn't involved in this study, doesn't think the sport is necessarily getting more dangerous. \"More people are playing, so there's going to be more injuries at a higher volume,\" she says. And there are a lot of ways you can get injured in pickleball, notes Dr. Corey Lacher, an ophthalmologist resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and the paper's lead author, including getting hit by the ball, a paddle or by falling. \"A lot of people think that just because it's a wiffle ball that you're not going to get hurt,\" he says. But, it's still risky because \"everything is very fast-paced in pickleball and you're playing on a very small court.\" However, getting players to wear eye protection is easier said than done, as Desai points out. It's another piece of equipment players have to purchase and bring with them. And with so many options on the market, choosing a pair can be daunting. Players would benefit from standardized eye protection guidelines for pickleball, says Lacher. \"There's $10 pickleball eye protection and there's $160. How do you know which one to buy?\" If you're shopping for eyewear, Lacher and Desai recommend products made of shatter-resistant polycarbonate and those that meet the American Society for Testing and Materials's F3164 standard. Dr. Daniel Henick, an ophthalmology resident at Yale School of Medicine and an avid pickleball player, has been researching which groups of players are wearing eye protection and why the rest aren't. He says one of the most common reasons players don't use protective eyewear is that they aren't aware of the risks. Henick says that having standardized guidelines, posting them outside of courts for players to see, making eye-protection more user-friendly, and encouraging professional pickleball athletes to set an example for the influx of new players could help reduce injuries. The paper points out its limitations are having a small sample size and relying on a database that only includes emergency departments that opt in to the data collection. But Lacher sees the main takeaway from the study as bringing awareness to these injuries. Henick agrees, noting these injuries can sometimes be life-changing: \"We're talking about hundreds, if not thousands, of injuries every year that could be prevented with what could be a relatively simple intervention.\" USA Pickleball did not reply to a request for comment on the study's call for eye-protection guidelines.

What do a vape company, a European soccer investment firm, market permabull Tom Lee, and Sam Altman's Worldcoin all have in common? Everyone wants to know if AI is a bubble, but there might be no clearer sign of market froth than this year's craze over crypto treasury strategies, and all of the things listed above are associated with the recent explosion of the trend.  A quick recap:  The trend has roots stretching back to 2017, when a company seemingly unrelated to crypto slapped the word \"blockchain\" on its name and promptly saw its stock soar 500%. Some observers this year, including crypto bull Mike Novogratz, were warning as early as August that the trend had peaked, but the flurry of new treasuries continued. For the most part, these firms are looking to replicate the success of Strategy, Michael Saylor's business software company that went all in on bitcoin in 2020 to stellar results for its share price.  There are now 172 publicly traded companies that have adopted bitcoin holding strategies, and 48 have cropped up in the last quarter alone, Cointelegraph reported this week.  Many companies were trading at penny stock levels before venturing into crypto. Many also had little or no previous business in digital assets. For investors, that should be a red flag, Chris Brodersen, managing director of Eisner Advisory Group, told Business Insider. \"I think there are companies that are looking at crypto as a means of saving their skins,\" Brodersen said. He said that he sees parallels to the dot-com boom, when tiny stocks would surge as they announced new business on the internet, only to quickly fall again and burn investors eager to get exposure to the shiny new technology. In Brodersen's view, investors need to carefully assess a company's actual business plans and strategy, as well as the digital assets it plans to hold. Andrew Duca, founder of crypto tax platform Awaken Tax, thinks the bubble in the space has already formed. \"Most digital asset treasuries aren't actually running on-chain businesses \u2014 they're just buying tokens and calling it 'strategy,'\" he said. \"That's how bubbles start: companies chasing trends without thinking through why they're doing it.\" Fears about a bubble in crypto treasuries have been intensifying lately, as top tokens such as bitcoin and ethereum continue to trend downward, taking down shares of crypto holding companies with them. Duca isn't surprised by this. \"Companies are forced to sell, which accelerates the decline,\" he stated. \"Confidence drops fast when people realize how many of these treasuries were basically token bets with no real strategy behind them.\" Duca voiced similar concerns to Brodersen, noting the possibility that over-leveraged treasuries could trigger margin calls and liquidity crunches by marking down collateral. So, what happens if the bubble bursts? \"If a bubble bursts, it will likely expose companies that adopted crypto treasury strategies purely as a lifeline rather than from genuine strategic interest in digital assets,\" Chris Kline, COO and cofounder of BitcoinIRA, predicted. Kline added that, from his perspective, investors who will bear most of the impact are those who bought into the treasury craze without understanding the underlying financial health of the businesses.

When my partner and I just finished a massive laundry room remodel that stretched our budget a bit, the worst happened. The contractor was putting the finishing touches on the floorboard. He pulled up a piece of wood and found black mold near the fridge from a leak, and kept finding more and more, down through the floorboards to the basement. We didn't know that our home remodel \"part two\" had just commenced, costing us thousands. This scenario and others are just part of daily life in a family of 7: a pediatric dermatology bill, emergency baseball gear, and bodywork repair when a teen threw a rock at my van. When life happens, we pull out our go-to strategy, which we've gamified for our kids \u2014 the no-spend week challenge. When our budget gets tight, the whole family takes a step back from spending for a certain amount of time. It can last a week or just a few days. Sometimes, we refer to it as \"holding the line\" \u2014 the line being the credit card balance. It works best with a clear goal and an end in sight, such as a few days from the end of a credit card cycle, when we are happy with how much we've spent. Of course, we spend what we really need to \u2014 like food \u2014 but no extras. Who knows how much longer our five little kids will still think this is fun, but for now, it's a lifesaving strategy when a fridge leak or a medical bill threatens our financial peace. My favorite afternoon splurge is a stop at the best coffee store in town, which is not a chain and thus has some higher prices to stay afloat. This is the first weekly splurge to go, or at least to move to next week. Amazon is always a source of serious spending in our house \u2014 from detergents to underwear, toilet paper, and paper towels to staplers. Many things in our home that fall into the pretty essential category have come from Amazon. Yet, anytime I go on the app, it seems to quickly add up to $75. But during no-spend days or weeks, I try to avoid Prime completely and just include true essentials with our weekly grocery order instead. Nobody really needed that new Apple watch band or extra pair of leggings anyway. If you look in my fridge right now, there are three cauliflower heads. That's not because we love cauliflower that much; it's because I often order the same things on repeat for our weekly grocery bill, whether we really need them or not. But during no-spend weeks, I pare down the groceries to things we truly need. I also take better stock of the pantry and cabinet to see what we truly need. The side effect of this is that we are finally able to get to the bottom of the pasta box in the pantry or use up the least favorite kind of chips the kids haven't eaten. I also find myself getting more creative during no-spend days. We wrapped a birthday present with a funny Christmas gift bag because, well, who cares. We made smoothies with fruit that's going bad instead of buying some. There's something immensely gratifying about using up things you already have. The kids even jumped in, trying to think of creative ways to do things for free those weeks. They recently loved running up the huge hill by the park and watching the sunset. All of it was free. I make sure my family is never deprived during no-spend periods. If someone needs an emergency pair of shoes, I'll find myself saying, \"Sure, let's talk about it next week after I get paid a bit more.\" And then, we do, and they are one step closer to adults who can handle delayed gratification. In limiting our spending, we are all working together to make our lives more comfortable in the long run. It isn't always easy, but we always make it out the other side. No-spend days and weeks unexpectedly show us what's really important and what we really do need \u2014 connection and intention.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth For the first time since 2018, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released on a Friday, and this time, under highly unusual circumstances. The September inflation report, due this Friday, comes amid an ongoing government shutdown that has frozen most other federal data releases. This has left the Federal Reserve with limited insight ahead of its critical October 29 policy meeting. No other major reports, including jobs and retail sales data, will be published until the shutdown ends. However, something will occur differently, with the CPI data coming only five days before the Fed\u2019s October 29 meeting. \u201cSomething unusual is happening this week\u2026 Not only is it 5 days before the October 29th Fed meeting,\u201d wrote Adam Kobeissi. The US CPI report is typically released once a month, usually on or around the 10th to 13th of the following month. For example, the August CPI data was released on September 11. Meanwhile, the July CPI came in on August 12. By convention, CPI data is released on a Tuesday or Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This makes Friday releases extremely rare; the last time was January 2018. As for timing relative to Federal Reserve meetings, CPI usually comes out 1\u20132 weeks before the Fed\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. This gives policymakers enough time to analyze the data alongside other indicators before deciding on interest rates. Against these backdrops, the timing has fueled speculation of a bullish inflation print. This could potentially set the stage for another rate cut. The Fed\u2019s next move is now almost entirely on this single inflation reading. With markets pricing in a near-certain 0.25% rate cut, investors are closely watching whether softer CPI data could push policymakers toward a more aggressive 0.5% reduction. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s about a 99% probability of a 0.25% cut\u2026If it comes in lower than expected, the chances of a 0.5% rate cut could increase,\u201d one user remarked. According to analysts surveyed by MarketWatch, the September CPI report is expected to show consumer prices continuing to rise. However, it could be at a slower pace than in August. Such a signal would mean inflationary pressures may be easing. Yet the broader picture remains uncertain. The ongoing government shutdown has disrupted data collection and added a layer of political and fiscal tension that could shape the Fed\u2019s risk calculus. Without updated readings from the labor and retail sectors, policymakers may rely on partial or outdated data when assessing whether inflation is slowing enough to justify continued easing. Friday\u2019s release potentially is the only clear data point before the Fed\u2019s decision next week. Meanwhile, Fed officials have signaled growing concern over a weakening labor market, supporting the rate cuts. However, a hotter-than-expected CPI print could complicate the outlook, forcing the central bank to weigh inflation risks against the possibility of stalling growth.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"With so many small-capacity motorcycles coming out of India at the moment, standouts can be difficult to spot. But every once in a while, a moto comes along that's interesting enough to break through the noise. The TVS Apache RTX could just be that moto. TVS is a well-known bikemaker that operates in 80+ countries, largely operating in sub sub-300cc category of motorcycles. Its strategic partnership with the likes of BMW and the recent acquisition of British bikemaker Norton Motorcycles have done much to garner global interest, and it feels like the time is just about right for a new product to break through. The company launched the Apache RTX in India this week, and I have to say, it looks solid. In case you\u2019re wondering, RTX stands for Rally, Tourer, and Xtreme \u2013 all characteristics of what is essentially an adventure tourer as opposed to an all-out adventure bike. This makes sense when you see that it gets a 19-17-inch wheel setup. Powering the moto is a liquid-cooled 299.1cc single-cylinder, four-stroke motor that produces roughly 36 horsepower at 9,000 rpm and 21 lb.ft (28.5 Nm) of peak torque at 7,000 rpm. The motor comes mated to a 6-speed transmission and an assist and slipper clutch with a bi-directional quickshifter to make shifts as easy as they can get. By the looks of it, the RTX definitely seems bigger than other motorcycles of this class. There\u2019s definitely a hint of Triumph Tiger and Honda Transalp in there for the eagle-eyed. A steel-trellis frame and a die-cast aluminum swingarm make up the skeleton of the moto. It has a big stance, which gives it big road presence too, thanks to the semi-fairing that finishes off with integrated dual LED headlamps. A tall windshield seems functional while the footpegs and handlebars are neutrally positioned for optimum on and off-road comfort. The bike features a split seat setup, a rear luggage rack, and crash bars for engine protection. You don\u2019t see a lot of bikes with gold forks in the class. Yet here we have a suspension system made up of 41-mm upside-down, fully-adjustable telescopic forks and a rear mono-shock with a floating piston. Travel at the front and back is the same \u2013 7 inches (180 mm). You get star-shaped alloy wheels that are wrapped in special compound Eurogrip tires. Braking is supported by a 320-mm disc with a fixed caliper and a 240-mm disc with a floating caliper at the front and back, respectively. Dual-channel ABS is standard and switchable. TVS has equipped the RTX with the RT-LSC suite of electronics. You get four ride modes: Tour, Rally, Urban, and Rain. The electronic suite also includes Rally ABS, Traction Control, and Cruise Control. All of this can be accessed via the 5-inch TFT instrument cluster, which is Bluetooth-enabled. It sports features like Map Mirroring with Google Maps, Digital Doc transfer, TPMS, and an option to control your GoPro. TVS\u2019 SmartXonnect app further adds up to 38+ connected features, including last parked location. But here\u2019s what impressed me the most: the MSRP. With a starting price of INR 199,000 (around US$2,300 per direct conversion) for the base variant, you\u2019re effectively looking at one of the cheapest adventure tourers in the world. Pricing goes steps up to INR 229,000 (US$3,400) for the top-spec BTO (Built To Order) variant. You get a choice of five colorways: Viper Green (my personal favorite), Tarn Bronze, Metallic Blue, Lightning Black, and Pearl White. The order books have already opened in India, with deliveries expected to start soon. For a ~300 cc single-cylinder bike, the RTX packs in a lot: ride modes, quick-shifter, slipper clutch, premium suspension, TFT display, and so on. Not only that, it will also make adventure touring more accessible for newer riders, especially when you consider its price point.  It undercuts most of its competitors in India, including the likes of KTM 250 Adventure, which is at least INR 14,000 (US$1,230) more expensive, and that\u2019s when you compare it against the top-spec BTO RTX trim. For a market that's as price-sensitive as India, it could bode well for TVS. But the big question is, where do I see it launching outside of India? South Asian markets where TVS already sells are an obvious choice. Outside of Asia, there are some hush-hush rumors about the bike potentially making it to the likes of South Africa and Mexico, too. A launch in Europe seems extremely unlikely, while the USA would be completely off the table, considering TVS doesn\u2019t currently sell anything there. We're still awaiting the official nod though.

Right now, people are shouting about an AI bubble \u2013 so should we be braced for a crash? Based on the typical indicators of a looming \u201ccorrection\u201d, there are certainly reasons to be fearful, said Jon Yeomans in The Times. The most obvious is the very high valuations of AI firms and the speed with which they\u2019ve been reached. Take Nvidia, the chipmaker \u201cat the vanguard of AI\u201d. Up 40% this year, it\u2019s now valued at $4.7 trillion \u2013 the GDP of Germany. Then there is the alarming concentration of risk. The ten biggest US stocks, eight of which are tech, account for about 20% of the global equity market. A third indicator is over-investment: $5 trillion is forecast to be spent on data centres and other AI infrastructure by 2030. A fourth is circular financing: to take one example, Nvidia appears to be funding OpenAI to buy its chips. Escape your echo chamber.

We\u2019re reaching a stage where prices are being sustained only by expectations of rising valuations and easy financing, said The Guardian. Startups with no products are raising billions as \u201ccapital chases fads\u201d, not earnings. Bubble sceptics stress that valuations are not nearly as high as at the peak of the dotcom bubble. But you can\u2019t not worry, when those sounding the alarm include the likes of Jeff Bezos. Bezos isn\u2019t entirely gloomy, said Andrew Orlowski in The Daily Telegraph. He says it\u2019s a \u201cgood bubble\u201d: there will be losers when it bursts, but it is facilitating the building of the infrastructure needed to enable AI to change the world in the future. And it is true that new tech often stutters before being widely adopted. But there is no law that says this has to be the trajectory. And for all the hype about AI\u2019s superpowers, some wonder if America\u2019s AI sector will ever command the returns it needs to sustain its huge costs \u2013 which include expensive chips with short lifespans. Firms report that 95% of AI projects have not justified their investment; and despite the scary stories about AI gobbling up jobs, there is little evidence that it is doing so. So if the crash comes, how bad will it be? Well, this bubble is said to be 17 times larger than the dotcom one. \u201cNo wonder the boosters don\u2019t want the hype to end.\u201d A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day \u2013 and the best features from TheWeek.com  The Week's daily crossword puzzle     The Week's daily codeword puzzle     The Week's daily medium sudoku puzzle     Feature Americans are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence for mental health support.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByClem Chambers, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has crashed \u2013 not the sort of typical bitcoin meltdown, but an old-school, equity-style crash of around 25%. That kind of move is almost not big enough for bitcoiners to consider it significant, but for \u201cgrown up assets,\u201d that would be big news. The fall back from highs will not be easy to explain to many, especially those expecting bitcoin to hit a million \u2013 and by Christmas, no less. For them, the only way is up. I was once a crypto enthusiast expecting BTC to moon. It did. There are, however, limits \u2013 especially if you\u2019re looking for real value increases, not just numerical gains. I agreed with the old wild predictions when bitcoin was in four figures, but not the new ones based on logarithmic appreciation. To me, bitcoin is now just another asset embedded in the flying circus of financial markets. It is bound to liquidity, arbitrage, and hedging just like shares, commodities, and other currencies. It\u2019s in the system and is no longer an outsider destined to destroy \u201ctradfi\u201d and change the world of money. It is now part of tradfi. That\u2019s an unpopular opinion \u2013 one many saw as ridiculous when bitcoin was recently at all-time highs \u2013 but not so incredible when it crashes thousand of dollars in a few moments. So here is a chart of where we are: The chart doesn\u2019t look too bearish, but we\u2019ve seen two nose-dives in a week, triggered by tariff tantrums and tradfi issues sparked by subprime car loans. This tradfi-driven fraudulent default, built on a pile of trash bonds, might create contagion in small American banks \u2013 an echo of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s implosion \u2013 and the markets don\u2019t like that at all. Probably a blip\u2026 maybe not. TBA. In the old bitcoin world, this kind of narrative in tradfi wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Bitcoin\u2019s valuewasn\u2019t tied to U.S. small-bank solvency or market conniptions. Yet here we are. So, if crypto is absorbed into tradfi, how will this normalisation affect its price or trigger negative repricing? If bitcoin is assimilated into the old system, why is it special anymore? Assimilation feels bearish to me. So here we are right now: Bitcoin looks fragile. If it drops below $100,000 a coin, the chance that a crypto winter crash is underway will suddenly be much higher. However, there is something deeper going on. Bitcoin is driven by liquidity in the market. Let\u2019s call it what it is \u2013 cash sloshing around in banks, looking for a place to make money. The excess cash ends up in the reverse repo at the Fed. So here\u2019s the chart of that: But wait\u2026 The spicy money buying the frothy assets is temporarily out of stock. The good news? If necessary, there\u2019s more \u2013 just a few mouse clicks away.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Ishan Bakshi Dear Express Reader India, China, and the US are all pursuing their own versions of industrial policy. While the forms may differ, the core ideas are broadly comparable. Old shibboleths are being cast aside as the ruling elite, even in the bastions of free market capitalism, looks to prioritise self-sufficiency and resilience, not efficiency. The invisible hand of the market seems to be giving way to the very visible hand of the state. In the US, the traditional Left vs Right divide in matters of economic policy seems to be narrowing in some aspects. The economic ideology of the Republican Party, which used to revolve around free markets and minimal government intervention, has shifted considerably under Donald Trump. By taking a stake in Intel, the US government has, in a manner of speaking, taken over the means of production, as economist Tyler Cowen has pointed out. While this is not the first time in recent memory that the US government has done so \u2013 during the financial crisis of 2008, it had taken stakes in companies like Citigroup, AIG and General Motors \u2013 the circumstances then were different. Joe Biden\u2019s presidency saw a wholehearted embrace of industrial policy. The CHIPS Act provided support to the tune of $53 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research and development. Similarly, the Inflation Reduction Act channelled funding into clean energy. Trump, however, has gone way beyond. His interventions are not just limited to promoting national champions or building manufacturing capacity in critical sectors. He has, for instance, asked Apple to manufacture in the US, not India; has sought a share in the revenue from Nvidia\u2019s chip sales to China; and is even said to have brokered a deal for the US operations of social-media platform TikTok. From socialising losses and privatising profits to perhaps socialising profits, the party of Reagan has travelled a long distance. With US policy expanding from providing direct subsidies to intervening in the market, directing operations of companies and raising tariff barriers, troubling questions arise: What will guide firms\u2019 decision making? Can US exports to countries be curtailed like China\u2019s exports of rare earth minerals? While some restrictions are imposed on sectors such as defence hardware and nuclear reactors, will decisions of companies, like setting up factories and R&D centres, now be shaped by priorities of the White House or value-maximising shareholders? The correlation between industrial policy and stock market returns, at least in China, isn\u2019t tight. Between 1992 and 2025, while its economy grew from $428 billion to $18.7 trillion, the MSCI China index gave returns of just about 2 per cent (CAGR in US dollars). But, unlike Trump\u2019s industrial policy, which economist Stephen Roach has characterised as transactional in nature, industrial policy in China operates through a well-oiled machinery across various levels of government. The central government creates the overarching framework in line with the party\u2019s priorities, while the local governments drive most policies. Policies are tailor-made, with the support extended via various channels such as direct subsidies and regulation policies changing as industries evolve. Economists at the IMF have pegged the extent of support provided by China at 4.4 per cent of GDP. And this has remained relatively stable over the years. Of the total support, 2 per cent is in the form of cash subsidies, 1.5 per cent is tax benefits, 0.5 per cent is land subsidies, and 0.4 per cent is subsidised credit. But, even as its policies are only deepening the structural imbalances in the economy, government intervention is expanding, and is now not just limited to promoting sectors and companies, but to even regulating competition. With the Chinese market facing \u201cNeijuan\u201d or \u201cinvolution\u201d, which reflects price cuts to grab market share, its top economic policy body has said that \u201centerprises engaging in disorderly low-price competition must be regulated\u201d. In India, industrial policy tends to operate through a combination of tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers like quality-control orders, and direct subsidies such as the production-linked incentives scheme. And, like in China, subnational governments also offer their own set of incentives to persuade industries to locate in their regions. For instance, under the Gujarat Semiconductor Policy, projects that are being set up in the Dholera Special Investment Region are provided a land subsidy and a power tariff subsidy. Despite this, direct support extended by the state is considerably smaller compared to China. The Indian variant of industrial policy also straddles two different approaches. In some sectors, it tends to shield domestic companies from foreign competition, and even \u201cselects\u201d firms that receive support, while in others, it provides support to help firms, domestic and foreign-owned, to compete in the global market. The former is more along the lines of import substitution, while the latter mimics the East Asian model. But, the success of either approach is conditional on outside support. From capital to rare earths, from tech to technicians \u2014 becoming atmanirbhar requires help. It is perhaps this realisation that has prompted the government to recently change tack. Modi\u2019s statement reflects this growing realisation: \u201cMy definition of swadeshi is very simple. I am not concerned about whose money is being invested. I am not worried whether it is dollars or pounds or whether the currency is black or white. However, in the production, the sweat must be of my countrymen\u201d. Decades ago, Deng Xiaoping articulated the same pragmatic approach: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.\u201d But, unlike in India, a strategic vision underpins industrial policy in China. While the Indian government may well have decided that the visible hand of the state, and not the market, will have a greater say in the allocation of resources in the economy, a more prudent approach would be to focus on increasing efficiency and competitiveness, rather than prioritising self-sufficiency and resilience.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByBillee Howard, Senior Contributor. Leading organizations must modernize their insights and market research functions today because the landscape of customer expectations, technology, and competition has fundamentally shifted. There are many reasons why including: data abundance which requires smarter synthesis and actionable human insight, the need for uncovering the why behind the what in the new emotion economy\u2014which traditional data sets often don\u2019t do. Finally and most importantly, because brand differentiation, which is a critical business imperative in today\u2019s landscape, will only come via deeper customer understanding. The bottom line: modernizing insights is no longer about better market research\u2014it\u2019s about building a living system of intelligence that fuses data, emotion, and foresight to guide every strategic decision. The organizations that fail to adapt will be left with blind spots that will likely lead to lagging business performance. For all these reasons, I wanted to speak to an industry thought leader who has his pulse on exactly how leading organizations must be thinking about insights modernization. Critical to success will be finding ways to effectively move away from a sea of endless dashboards to real-time intelligence engines that drive better business decision-making at the highest levels of an organization. Nick Graham is among the leading consumer insights professionals in the world. He is an industry veteran who has led the function at leading companies such as PepsiCo and Mondel\u0113z International. Following is a recap of our conversation: Billee Howard: Why has consumer centricity never been more important and how does this tie to a need to modernize market research and insights? Nick Graham: Consumer centricity has never been more critical. In a world that is volatile, fragmented, and fiercely competitive, the companies that win will be those that understand their consumers better \u2013 and act on that understanding faster than the competition. Yet while billions have been poured into digital and business transformation, far less investment has gone into upgrading how companies generate insight. The result is a widening gap between the demands of the market and the level of consumer-centric decision-making. Closing that gap won\u2019t come from tinkering at the edges. It demands a fundamental rebuild \u2013 not just a basic retooling \u2013 of how we do market research and analytics. And the clock is ticking.  Howard: Insights teams and market research functions don\u2019t seem to have kept up with the pace of transformation, let alone environmental change. What are your thoughts on how and what they should do to get up to speed? Graham: The reality is that most insights teams aren\u2019t designed for today\u2019s demands. Business leaders need foresight, not hindsight. They need to anticipate what\u2019s coming next, not just replay what happened last quarter. Yet too many teams remain siloed and fragmented, drowning in proliferating data lakes and reliant on lagging indicators and legacy methods. In a world where speed, agility and data integration will decide who wins, this model is no longer fit for purpose. What\u2019s needed are agile, always-on systems that listen, learn and adapt in real time. Systems that bring together every source of data \u2013 qual and quant, structured and unstructured, syndicated and custom, functional and emotional \u2013 and turn them into usable intelligence. AI can undoubtedly help here, scanning, synthesizing and simulating at scale. But it cannot replace human judgment. Machines can tell you what\u2019s happening; people must still decide why it matters. And it is human empathy \u2013 our ability to understand fundamental human motivators like hope, fear, love, joy, excitement, and belonging \u2013 that will truly unlock the drivers of behavior change.  Howard: What are the key things CMOs must think about when retooling their insights functions in the year ahead and beyond? Graham: Tools and systems are only part of the solution. Insights must also redefine its role. For too long, the function has been treated as an order taker, or a support act for marketing. That has to change. Insights professionals must step up as strategic co-pilots: framing the growth agenda; guiding the business on where to play and how to win; and wiring consumer centricity into every decision, from advertising and innovation to commerce and culture. Reinvention is no longer optional. To stay competitive, companies must transform insights from reactive interpreters of the present into proactive, forward-looking decision engines. Ones that combine the speed of AI with the precision of analytics and the empathy of human understanding. But this won\u2019t happen without serious investment \u2013 in systems, in skills, and in talent. The truth is simple: you cannot win tomorrow\u2019s growth battles with yesterday\u2019s research machine. Howard: As insights continue to go through a massive recalibration to sharpen consumer understanding, why will it be more important than ever for insights leaders to have a seat at the C-suite decision-making table and how can organizations ensure that this happens? Graham: Every company claims to be consumer-centric \u2013 but few truly live and breathe it in the way they make decisions. That\u2019s why insights must have a permanent seat at the decision-making table, with real influence, veto rights and accountability for how consumer understanding shapes strategy. True consumer centricity isn\u2019t a slogan \u2013 it\u2019s a system. And only when every decision starts and ends with their consumer can businesses achieve sustained growth.","label":0}

It was forced to close in the aftermath of the incident as authorities began to investigate. Police sealed the museum gates and visitors were ushered out. No injuries were reported, according to spokespeople for the Louvre. \"A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,\" French Culture Minister Rachida Dati wrote on X, while the museum cited \"exceptional reasons\" for the closure. Dati called the strike the work of \"professionals,\" describing it on TF1 TV network as \"a four-minute operation carried out without violence.\" Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez previously told France Inter radio that the heist took seven minutes and the thieves used a disc cutter to slice through the panes. He said it was \"manifestly a team that had done scouting.\" The heist occurred at around 9:30 a.m., when several people broke into the Louvre through the Galerie d'Apollon and stole jewelry before fleeing the scene on motorcycles, a museum spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"An investigation has begun, and a detailed list of the stolen items is being compiled,\" the statement said. \"Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value.\" France's ministers of culture and interior were at the Louvre and working with the museum's management as well as law enforcement, the statement continued, adding that \"all possible measures are being taken to recover the stolen items.\" The interior ministry similarly said that forensic work was underway Sunday morning and a precise inventory of the stolen items was being compiled.\u00a0 Video from the scene showed confused tourists being ushered out of the glass pyramid and surrounding courtyards as officers shut the iron gates and closed nearby streets along the Seine. The Galerie d'Apollon is a vaulted hall in the Denon wing that displays part of the French Crown Jewels beneath a ceiling painted by King Louis XIV's court artist, according to the ministry.  French daily Le Parisien reported the thieves entered via the Seine-facing facade, where construction is underway, and used a freight elevator to reach the gallery. After breaking windows, they reportedly took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon and the Empress. One stolen jewel was later found outside the museum, the paper reported, adding that the item was believed to be Empress Eug\u00e9nie's crown and that it had been broken. Security around the marquee works remains tight. The Mona Lisa is protected by bulletproof glass and a custom high-tech display system as part of broader anti-theft measures across the museum. Staffing and protection have been flashpoints at the Louvre. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions have warned that mass tourism strains security and visitor management.  It wasn't immediately clear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday's theft.  In January, President Emmanuel Macron announced a decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan \u2014 roughly \u20ac700 million to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece its own dedicated gallery by 2031 \u2014 but workers say relief has been slow to reach the floor. The theft, less than half an hour after doors opened, echoes other recent European museum raids.  In 2019, thieves smashed vitrines in Dresden's Green Vault and carried off diamond-studded royal jewels worth hundreds of millions of euros. In 2017, burglars at Berlin's Bode Museum stole a 100-kilogram (220-pound) solid-gold coin. In 2010, a lone intruder slipped into Paris's Museum of Modern Art and escaped with five paintings, including a Picasso. The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia, a former worker who hid inside the museum and walked out with the painting under his coat. It was recovered two years later in Florence \u2014 an episode that helped make Leonardo da Vinci's portrait the world's best-known artwork. Home to more than 33,000 works spanning antiquities, sculpture and painting \u2014 from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to European masters \u2014 the Louvre's star attractions include the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The museum can draw up to 30,000 visitors a day.        \u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByJohn Hall, Senior Contributor. Fast and furious isn\u2019t just the title of a popular movie series; it\u2019s also the pace of the business world today. Companies can\u2019t rely on market research older than a few weeks, or even a few days. Products that seemed to match consumers\u2019 needs on paper might fall flat upon launch. And the push to quickly adjust deeply established processes and ways of thinking to what\u2019s happening now is increasingly pervasive. It's a lot to take in, particularly if you\u2019re someone who prefers a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach. As someone who has been navigating these waters for years, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how waiting can compromise a company\u2019s ability to stay ahead in a rapidly changing market. When market dynamics shift on a dime, maintaining a competitive advantage may feel like you\u2019re caught in a perfect storm. You can\u2019t thrive and excel with just a life jacket. You need cutting-edge tools, innovative strategies and optimized business processes. If you\u2019re unsure of where to start, you\u2019re not alone. Here are a few examples to inspire you. It\u2019s human nature to resist change, especially when it involves adopting new technology. There\u2019s a certain pride in the adage, \u201cIf it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d Sticking with the way things have always been done can feel familiar and predictable. But consider this: Is it easier to sell a home with a dated interior or one with the latest finishes? When you resist innovation, like embracing new AI tools, you risk losing opportunities to convert customers. For many businesses, a branded website is an integral part of attracting leads and turning them into sales. A strong online presence is also key to engaging with existing customers and encouraging repeat business. Most companies don\u2019t just build a website and call it done. It\u2019s a continuous work in progress, involving new platforms, integrated media components and conversion rate optimization (CRO) tests. You need to know if your design and copy are inspiring consumers to act. If not, you tweak until your conversion rates meet your goals. Doing this manually or with outdated tools may prevent you from implementing ideas quickly enough. Using AI tools, such as the platform Do What Works, can significantly increase the scale of your website\u2019s CRO tests. This technology provides the necessary data to make website design and messaging decisions faster, including the ability to test multiple variables simultaneously. This allows your decisions to keep pace with the market\u2019s changing behaviors and preferences. A strong marketing strategy is built on a deep understanding of consumer behavior. It\u2019s natural to equate preferences with predictions about how a market will respond to a product or message. You might start by pulling out your customer persona summary and aligning your decisions with what these personas tell you. Classic marketing strategy also relies on tools like consumer surveys, opinion polls, focus groups and blind product tests. Yet, history is filled with examples of marketing strategies that didn\u2019t connect with consumers as intended. Think of the introduction of a new classic Coca-Cola formula in the mid-1980s or Life Call\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up\u201d campaign. Another example is the backlash from a Burger King UK\u2019s Women\u2019s Day tweet. None of these strategies went the way they were planned. This is likely because these companies failed to uncover or consider consumers\u2019 underlying beliefs. Proof Positioning, a company that uses a personal and customized approach to user research, highlights how beliefs are what truly drive action. Aligning your marketing strategies with customer personas alone won\u2019t be enough to get the results you want. You need to think outside the box, revamping your strategies to truly connect with your target audience. Beliefs can be subtle and may not be revealed in a conventional survey. Since beliefs aren\u2019t always logical, you must consider how your company\u2019s actions might make your consumer base feel. Start thinking about the emotions the use of your products and the stories you tell may provoke. Once consumers get used to something, their expectations align with more of the same, but their demands also tend to increase. Environmental factors outside of their control could cause them to change their behavior even faster than the data can reveal. For example, shifts in the economic climate, like the burden of higher prices, can alter buying patterns overnight. The introduction of two-day shipping has led consumers to expect this service from everyone. If an email or voicemail isn\u2019t returned within a few hours, the consumer might feel abandoned, express dissatisfaction and seek alternatives. Businesses with rigid processes can fall behind as quickly as market behaviors change. Amazon is a powerful illustration of how to not only keep processes nimble enough to adapt but also to lead the way. The company\u2019s use of robotics, machine learning and integrated virtual reality tech has redefined online shopping. Prime members can often get their orders in a day or less, depending on the product\u2019s location. Items once thought impossible to buy from a website, such as furniture, may now be virtually placed in a customer\u2019s home before purchase. Returns are simpler than ever, with some products not needing to be sent back at all. Staying open to new ways of doing things can drive innovation for your company, your industry and the entire market. When market dynamics evolve faster than you can say \u201cchange,\u201d it can feel like an impossible race to win. What you\u2019ve come to rely on for making decisions may no longer work, which can be frustrating and perplexing. You might feel unsure about what steps to take or whether you have the necessary resources to adapt. Staying ahead means changing your mindset and learning to identify subtle cues from the market. Companies that have successfully outpaced their competitors have done so by embracing new tools, rethinking conventional strategies and optimizing internal processes. Initially, it may be challenging to go against what you know. But working through that discomfort is how your brand will stay relevant to consumers\u2019 needs. ","label":0}

Cheap and cheerful, the GTX 735 Mylox Wireless Mobile Gaming Controller is a decent way to level up your mobile gaming. Naturally, the low price means there are concessions when it comes to build quality and specs \u2013 with its exclusive Bluetooth connectivity being one such compromise \u2013 but for casual gamers or those on a budget, it\u2019s a good start. Affordable Decent battery life Fun RGB lighting accents Versatile Cheaply made Not great ergonomics Bluetooth connectivity  Why you can trust TechRadar     We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.  The GTX 735 Mylox Wireless Mobile Gaming Controller is a budget-friendly alternative to some of the best mobile controllers on the market, offering iOS and Android compatibility. Coming in at less than half the price of our current top-rated mobile gaming controller, the Backbone One 2nd Gen, the GTX 735 Mylox is a great choice if you\u2019re a more casual user or if you\u2019re buying for a younger gamer. To keep costs low, there are some compromises: aside from its RGB lighting, the Mylox controller is a bit plain, and it isn\u2019t the most ergonomic. The buttons can be a little stiff, and it connects exclusively via Bluetooth rather than USB-C, so you\u2019ll need to consider both battery life and the potential for some latency. However, there\u2019s a lot to like here. The grip extends and ensures your phone is pretty tightly secured in the controller, aided by the rubber base, and there\u2019s a recess to accommodate the camera bump. While this design may not be a perfect fit for every phone, it is serviceable, at least, for a wide range of models. Sitting more on the affordable end of the spectrum, the GXT 735 Mylox mobile gaming controller retails for \u00a344.99 (roughly $60 \/ AU$90) and is available at a number of retailers in the UK. That makes it about half the price of our current top mobile gaming controller, the Backbone One, and one of the most affordable options available. If you want to save even more, I\u2019ve seen it on sale for as low as \u00a335 during the process of writing this review, and you can expect to see this price around major sales events. Price \u00a344.99 Dimensions 1.8 x 4.1 x 7.2 in \/ 46 x 106 x 185mm Weight 0.49lbs \/ 220g Connection type Bluetooth Compatibility iOS and Android smartphones Software N\/A      Available in black and grey, the GXT 735 Mylox mobile gaming controller is simple and understated in design. The two \u201carms\u201d of the controller can be pulled apart to reveal an extending mechanism where your phone rests. It isn\u2019t particularly sophisticated, and while its universal design will suit a wide range of the best gaming phones \u2013 and worked well with the devices I had to hand \u2013 it won\u2019t be the perfect fit for all. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Note, though, I have found that I frequently pinch my fingers in the bed mechanism when I remove my phone. While the GXT 735 Mylox does lack character, with the only real accents of interest being the RGB lighting behind the controls, the more basic setup is welcome for those who want to use it on the go without looking too flashy. The budget build of the model does make itself apparent, though: the buttons are all slightly stiff, lacking the smooth and spongy responsiveness that other, more premium controllers such as the Scuf Nomad or Razer Kishi Ultra offer. In addition to the D-pad, face buttons, and two joysticks, there are four system buttons: turbo, select, start, and home. The shoulder and trigger buttons are microswitches and pretty springy, although I have some concerns about their longevity. The USB-C charge port is seated at the tip of the left side of the body, and there\u2019s a small lip on the underside of the extendable rubberised phone bed to keep it secure during use. The controller isn\u2019t designed with optimal ergonomics in mind, and it could be uncomfortable for those with especially small or large hands. I found mine started to ache about an hour in, especially when playing on standard brick phones versus larger XL models. It lacks some of the convenient design features of its pricier competitors; there\u2019s no passthrough charging and no 3.5mm headphone jack. Still, at its price, those are pretty fair omissions. However, it\u2019s a shame that you can\u2019t charge and play. When it comes to performance, the GTX 735 Mylox wireless mobile gaming controller offers a responsive and easy-to-use experience with some minor caveats. Game support is wide-ranging, for controller-friendly iOS and Android games as well as cloud gaming with PC, PlayStation, and Xbox titles, although an important note is that PlayStation is supported only on iOS. I tested the controller predominantly on iOS, playing games such as Zenless Zone Zero, Katamari Demacy, and Vampire Survivors. There\u2019s no game compatibility list that I could find, and support outside of Apple Arcade was fairly spotty. Even when it does work, there\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s seamless \u2013 Stardew Valley, for example, wasn\u2019t very well optimized. Connecting the controller via Bluetooth is super easy, and while I always prefer USB-C connectivity for minimal input lag, there\u2019s a lot to be said for the universality of this controller. My phone slots easily inside, and the tray offers a recessed area to allow for the camera bump on most phones. Its haptics are nice, but incredibly dull. I would have liked a punchier feel, even in a budget model such as this, and the RGB follows in kind with slightly washed-out colors. That being said, it\u2019s a fun option, especially for younger players, and can easily be toggled by pressing the turbo button and clicking the right trigger. When playing for more than an hour or two, those poor ergonomics I mentioned earlier make it quite uncomfortable \u2013 I had achy wrists and hands for the majority of my testing. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for regular mobile gamers, as such. The battery life is decent, especially with that in mind. With RGB lighting turned off, it lasts roughly 12 hours, and with lighting on, it\u2019s 5 hours.      You\u2019re on a budgetThis is a great budget option that will meet the minimum requirements for most casual gamers, although for a few pounds more, there are options offering better connectivity and features. You want a neutral controllerThe gamer aesthetic isn\u2019t for everyone, and the simplicity of Mylox will be welcome for some. Plus, you can easily toggle the RGB backlighting if that\u2019s too garish.  You want ergonomic designIt isn\u2019t uncomfortable from the get-go, but don\u2019t expect to pull long shifts gaming on the Mylox. You want to charge and playThe Mylox is a Bluetooth controller, so there are no passthrough charging options and no way to plug in your phone separately.  If your budget will stretch, it\u2019s worth considering our current top mobile gaming controller, the Backbone One; but our favorite affordable alternative is also a great choice.

Read our full Razer Kishi Ultra review      I tested the GXT 735 Mylox Wireless Mobile Gaming Controller over the course of a week, playing a variety of OS games to test compatibility and user experience. I tried a wide variety of compatible mobile games, found mostly through trial and error. This included plenty of Stardew Valley and Zenless Zone Zero, in addition to a few hours in Katamari Demacy and Vampire Survivors.  I compared the 735 Mylox\u2019s performance to other mobile controllers, including other budget-friendly options such as the GameSir X2s Type-C.

He is also looking for 100,000 people that want to buy Cybertruck. I wonder which miestone will be reached first. :) Elon\u2019s Martian Death March.  [1] The cosmic radiation exposure involved in a round-trip to Mars aboard one of Musk\u2019s crappy chemical rockets \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have a launcher that can directly reach GEO yet \u2014 would expose astronauts to ~660 mSv of radiation, nearly 20 times the annual limit for nuclear workers.  [2] Mars doesn\u2019t have a magnetosphere and is too small to have enough gravity to ever retain an atmosphere so can\u2019t be terraformed \u2014 pace Kim Stanley Robinson \u2014 so any survivors of the trip would then be exposed on the Martian surface to radiation levels almost as bad at about ~0.67 mSv\/day, or over 20 times Earth\u2019s background level. So there\u2019s a chicken-and-egg problem there [3] What about the shielding challenges? Effective protection would require underground habitats or regolith-based shielding, which besides not yet being proven at scale, means that construction workers \u2014 many of them riddled with tumors by that point \u2014 would have to be on the Martian surface for however long that construction takes (as the Mars Rovers may be the full scope of what we can do in the way of long-distance robotics currently). Kind of a Catch-22 there. ~ ~ Musk can no more deliver a thousand living humans to Mars than P.T. Barnum. The terrifying thing is that he may not even know this \u2014 he dropped out of Stanford\u2019s physics masters program and most of the people who\u2019ve encountered him and I\u2019ve asked think it was because he wasn\u2019t bright enough to hack it The problem of radiation shielding for space travel is basic and simple, put the habitat inside a ring of water, or water ice. This increases the power needed to move the complex, but that is a simple technical problem. Another, but truly weird solution would be to engineer the crew to tolerate higher levels of radiation exposure. This would imply a multi-generational project. Mars may not have a magnetosphere now, but if the findings of primitive life on that russet orb in the far past pan out, then such may not be a deal killer. Some sort of upper atmospheric radiation shielding could be worked out. Again, another technical problem. As for the gravity problem, while a real problem for atmosphere retention, one must look at perhaps a mid-range solution. Lightweight coverings over Martain valleys to retain both atmosphere and heat. Yet again, a technical problem. The construction problems can be ameliorated by the heavy use of remotely controlled robot machines. Human controllers ensconced in underground control rooms managing the construction activity on the surface. The real deciding factor to this scheme is political will. Such a program is truly a nation state level enterprise. I\u2019ll wager that Musk is hoping that once he proves out the concept, that some nations will pile on the bandwagon. This premised upon said nation state elites finally realizing that Global Warming is an extinction level threat to the Terran human population. Anyway, that\u2019s my narrative and I will continue spin it. Stay safe. Re: Lightweight coverings for Martian valleys.  But again, that is why the moon is better, cheaper  and closer. Lightweight coverings for lunar valleys becomes almost doable. And if you\u2019re engineering artificial habitats, the \u201cextinction level threat\u201d becomes less about transportation issues (radiation, energy) and more about what environmental issues must be addressed. If the Mars project is such a great idea, Musk should be among those 100,000 lining up first on board. Or perhaps the only one. Musk could expand the project a bit. 510,810 ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) \u2014 each worth over $30 million \u2014 control $59.8 trillion in combined wealth Full impulse engines and head for Mars. Or the Sun! Thanks! I was in the process of drawing up my own list; this will help! If they miss the sun, there are plenty of other places they can hit\u2026 the universe is huuuuuugeeee. No reverse-gear allowed on that rocket though\u2026  What would aliens think about us sending a bunch of crap into their space? Offended? Happy to recieve specimen for their trials? Advanced recycling systems? How would they reuse this waste? Not returning to us, I hope.  So many questions. ~musical interlude~ Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun, by Pink Floyd https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3zuEfmmCA5s&list=RD3zuEfmmCA5s I would pledge what little disposable income I have towards ridding our planet of the top 100,000 wealthiest people in the world. I don\u2019t think I am alone. Sure getting rid of the other almost 411,000 would be wonderful, but the billionaires and near billionaires would be a good start.  If there were a second I might go with  100,000 current and past Presidents, Premieres, MPs, and legislative heads, but it would be a tough call not to go one more rung down the wealth ladder.  But whoever ends up on Musk\u2019s Mars expedition it does need to include Musk, Thiel, Ellison, Bezos etc no matter what. I\u2019d start with the Genocidaires. I hear Venus is nice this time of year..

There were whole companies of them running around Africa in the 50s and 60s which really made the people there happy. The difference is that back then was that these were small groups recruited by people like \u201cMad Mike\u201d Hoare under contract by local governments. These days you have major multinational corporations that have cornered the market of mercs and are only one step away from major governments- https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mad_Mike_Hoare#Congo_Crisis_(1961%E2%80%9365) Same way as Europe, especially Italy and German States did not need the mercs companies that roamed those places for hundreds of years: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Hawkwood Pandemic fears grow amid alarming rise of variant in China Daily Mail Surprisingly good reporting in the Daily Mail, and sounds alarming. I haven\u2019t yet completely read the scientific paper but this, just before winter, is something to watch closely. I am missing a comparative analysis of this strain to well known human infecting variants in the very same paper and the serologic analysis is incomplete, IMO, and would have required simultaneous analyses with human Influenza antisera even if they claim there is no cross reactivity citing references that supposedly say so. The fact that the virus spreads airborne amongst ferrets is something to note. Yet again, comparative transmission analyses with other flu strains are missing there. The human sample consisted in >600 samples obtained between 2020-2024 with positivity rates not dissected by year of sample but origin (rural\/urban) and that makes me suspicious. A few grains of salt on this paper after a very fast read. I found the article strange because it never mentioned what the symptoms were. Nor did it talk about how this pandemic could be deadly or dangerous.  Also, whatever happened to bird flu? I just noticed that it has disappeared from the headlines completely, after being the most terrible thing going on. Where can I get an update? Avian flu diary blog has daily info posted. It\u2019s been featured in the daily links a number of times. It\u2019s here in Outer Pentagonia. Until mid-September I would refill my feeder 2 or 3 times per week. Today I refilled it for the first time since Oct. 3. It\u2019s not just my feeder or seed-eaters. the robins and wrens and bluebirds have also disappeared. The birds are all gone from the surronding woods. Apart from one sickly finch, my only customers seem to be juncos heading south. There was an article linked (Substack) here about 1-2 days ago saying (not verbatim) something like \u201cavian flu is one mutation away from a new pandemic\u201d. This was a good one but the mutations being discussed there were found not in China but somewhere else in SE Asia (Indonesia, Vietnam\u2026 I don\u2019t remember). The recommendation was that vaccination against H1N1 could be the best approach from a personal point of view. NASA Scientist Offers Another Flimsy Opinion on Alien CIvilizations\u2026 This non-theory is indeed a weak Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.  First, the Fermi Paradox, which Wikipedia, of all places, reports amusingly and anecdotally. On the way to lunch, our hero Enrico: Fermi blurted a question variously recalled as: \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d (Teller), \u201cDon\u2019t you ever wonder where everybody is?\u201d (York), or \u201cBut where is everybody?\u201d (Konopinski).[19] According to Teller, \u201cThe result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact that, in spite of Fermi\u2019s question coming out of the blue, everybody around the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life.\u201d[20] Yep. And Fermi was right.  The reason is fairly simple. The famous Drake Equation. Plug in one low value (and there is a variable for technological development) among the variables, and the number of space-traveling civilizations in our Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy drops to, ooooh, a dozen.  Habitable worlds are too far apart. And by now, the Lucy Show in reruns has reached everyone else by radio waves, so they know not to show up on Earth. Of course there is the time factor. Not everybody is developing at the some time and at the same rate. So as an example, suppose that we develop warp drive and can visit stars several hundred light years away. So we may find that one on planet they they are still going through their age of dinosaurs and there is no sapient life. On another, it may be that we missed them in that they developed a major civilization, reached into space but then eventually died out only leaving only stuff for our archaeologists to sort through. We might be able to get enough of their equipment working to see them moving and to here their voices but there would always be the incredibly sad realization \u2013 \u2018Oh we just missed you\u2019. Your comment gives me hope for Humanity. There is a very simple answer. A sufficiently advanced civilization collapses into virtual space. Freed from biological evolution, it no longer needs to deal with mass and distance, and travel becomes moot. However, even if we assume life forms similar to our type, the current estimate of over 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 habitable planets in the observable universe renders the idea of space exploration ridiculous. The assumption of similar life forms is a curious one. And whatever the form, maybe \u201cthey\u201d just don\u2019t care. It has much to do with a limited view on what is considered or valued as \u201cintelligence\u201d. Some societies may collapse into virtual navel gazing, but humanity is a strange beast, and there will likely always be the marginalized, the dissatisfied, the independent thinkers, and the weirdos who are ready and willing to travel to one of those 10 sextillion habitable planets to try something different and see new things.  The only moot for me is that 10 sextillion habitable planets sounds like opportunity and what are we waiting for? And yes, I do get the scale of cosmic distances, which makes the project of exploring the Milky Way an exercise on the order of hundreds of thousands if not a few million years.  But unlike some, I see no particular reason for humanity to go extinct.  Which is the -only- endgame of staying on this particular object in the universe. Hear, here I\u2019m with you and have decided to stay put. Yes! Why would navel-gazing provide an evolutionary advantage? A recipe for a predator to have a field day, and the species to have gone extinct before it became technological. \u201cHabitable worlds are too far apart.\u201d From More Everything Forever by Adam Becker. Much thanks to NC commentariat for recommending this book. No human has traveled faster than Apollo 10\u2019s Earth reentry speed of 24,816 mph.  The fastest speed of any man made object is the Parker solar probe, 430,000 mph or 0.64 percent of the speed of light. These speeds are made possible not so much by propulsion as by the enormous gravitational force of the sun.  \u201cAfter millennia of technological advances, humanity\u2019s best method for making things go really fast is to drop them.\u201d Much was made of Death Valley Scotty setting a blistering new speed record from LA to Chicago in 1905, averaging about 50 mph! 64 years later, we\u2019re doing almost 25,000 mph https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scott_Special Stil faster than Hypeloop. re: Guillotine Watch Funny how that $60k bottle of water kinda looks after the fact of a very quick hack, Marie. My bubbly water is sourced from Mexico, and a liter of Topo Chico is $2.50 I wonder how much of that 60K is the bottle deposit. I\u2019m not a real Picasso, but I play one on tv\u2026 Maybe they can put that empty bottle up on eBay for sale. As a palate cleanser, here\u2019s a taste test of el cheapo $600 bottle of water: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e5nlD2LfGd0 Soda Springs is about a mile or so walk from the trailhead parking lot in Mineral King Valley, it\u2019s a little off trail and right next to Farewell Creek, and easily identifiable as the area around it is orange-ish brown from high iron content. You bring a cup to draw from the source, which is about a foot deep, and add it to the lemonade powder in your Nalgene and give it a shake-presto sparkling lemon soda on the house. One hundred bottles of Acqua di Cristallo Tributo a Modigliani on the wall, one hundred bottles on the wall, take one down and pass it around, ninety-nine\u2026 On the other hand, if it was one hundred bottles of AI, all the money in the world would be spent by the time you got to ninety-six or so. Meanwhile in France, a six pack of 1 litre bottles of Perrier goes for around 3.75\u20ac. Pellegrino is usually a little cheaper. I priced it in the States and was flabbergasted. Even your local stuff is crazy expensive. Pricing algos was all I could figure. USA is the land of the expensive, not the free. The new favorite bolthole for British \u201cwealth creators\u201d and other creatures out of a Monty Python sketch. Believe me, their presence has been duly noted.  Given the current gigantic real-estate investment and permitting scandal currently going on in Milano, the ultra-wealthy Brits are considered part of the problem. There are plenty of articles in the Italian press about this, errrr, debatable tax break. And there\u2019s this smidgeon (and it doesn\u2019t get more Brit than this): \u201cNatasha Slater, founder of The Robin Club, a private members\u2019 club in Milan that connects wealthy entrepreneurs across cities, told the Daily Mail why Brits are moving to the city.\u201d Enrollment fee: 5,000 euro. And this bit of geographic \/ cultural info: \u201cMany Brits moving to Milan head for the upmarket Brera and Concilazione districts \u2013 which both Nicola and Antonia describe as \u2018the south Kensington villagey part\u2019 \u2013 although prices in both areas have begun to creep up.\u201d Picio da corsa, as we say in the Undisclosed Region, which will remain undisclosed. It\u2019s as if the Brits haven\u2019t already fucked up Tuscanyland! Pass the bonet. You prefer to get Israelis? gk: They\u2019re screwing with the Valsesia and Varallo? Varallo is a gem. I was there a year ago, a lapsed lapsed lapsed Catholic making a pilgrimage to the monte sacro, which is a remarkable place. From article caption: \u201cThe town of Varallo, in the Valsesia valley in northwestern Italy, where one Israeli couple paid 57,000 for a spacious home on a large plot of land, adding 10,000 euros for renovations. \u201cThe surroundings here are a dream that words can\u2019t describe,\u201d they say.\u201d At a certain point, though, these dreamy intentionalists (of any stripe) are going to run up against reality. Varallo has been a (minor) center of power and major center for the arts for more than 500 years. As self-absorbed as the Israelis are, they may come to find out that they are just a blip. Also, too, there is a limit on the number of dog groomers needed in a mini-metropolis of 7 500 inhabitants. How close is the nearest synagogue? An amusing little article courtesy of the Daily Mail.  Italy is a tax haven?  Really?  Who\u2019d a thunk?  I ought to inform my local tax accountant, but he might die of laughter at the very idea.   Tax havens, like beauty, are in the eye of the beholder.  It\u2019s just a question of where you live and whom you\u2019re trying to hide your money from.  Back in the day, flying across the Atlantic on Lufty business class, I would skim the inflight magazine and see ads (auf Deutsch, with a smiling attractive young lady) for Delaware corporations.  Privacy!  Security!  Confidentiality!  America!  Incredible nonsense, this Yankee propaganda, but lots of people buy into it.  And I recall a taxi ride in Geneva in 2012 or so where I was asking the taxi driver (in my atrocious French, but of course he wasn\u2019t a Swissie so his wasn\u2019t exactly flawless either) how things were in lovely Geneve (supposedly the richest city on earth), and of course (like all taxi drivers worldwide) he began ranting about how bad everything was.  \u201cBut you live in a tax haven, no?\u201d  That shut him up briefly. \u201cTuscanyland\u201d is largely confined to Chiantishire.  Up here in the far north of Tuscany, English voices are few and far between.  The locals are proudly monolingual and speak very good Italian.  Suits me fine. Maxwell Johnston: Touch\u00e9. The city I like most in Tuscany is Lucca, which is its own strange historic principality and wrinkle in spacetime. On the other hand, I am hearing that Firenze is more overrun with Anglos than ever. On a few trips in the summers to\/from Roma, I marvelled at how the train empties at Firenze.  You are right in that the tax break has many restrictions. One must establish residence. The break is on foreign income only (which isn\u2019t much of a break because Italy doesn\u2019t claim extraterritoriality with regard to its tax laws, as the U S  of A does). Income that the suffering tax exiles make in Italy gets the usual treatment.  Two articles. The flat tax max is going to 300 000 euro: https:\/\/www.ilfattoquotidiano.it\/2025\/10\/18\/flat-tax-aumento-300mila-ricchi-stranieri-notizie\/8165090\/ The many rules: https:\/\/www.quotidiano.net\/economia\/flat-tax-ricchi-stranieri-rktbkrqv People talking to God\/AI\u2013 What a friend we have in AI Jesus!  All our sins and griefs to bear.  Feuerbach, the man who said we had created YHWH in our image rather than the other way around, would feel affirmed. On a related note, I\u2019m noticing a lot of YouTube talkers addressing the origins of Zionism, and I\u2019ve commented here about Darby-ism and the Scofield Bible.  Here\u2019s a YouTube discussion with a fellow who\u2019s written a book (published by Oxford Academic) traces Christian Zionism back even further to the early Reformation and an English Presbyterian (i.e. Calvinist) preacher.  The thread continues through the Pilgrims to the New Jerusalem in the Americas and even the new Zion, first in Independence, MO, then in Salt Lake City.  The guy may be a little off-putting, but he knows his stuff.  I learned a lot. The Christian Zionists are a big part of why AIPAC has such clout. Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who cares Your own personal Jesus Someone to hear your prayers Someone who\u2019s there Johnny Cash, covering Depeche Mode Arkies. Okies, et al that made it to Godzone during the Dust Bowl brought their dogma with them, Christian Zionism. So much in regards to religion is based upon what your parents did, you having no say in the matter.  The thread continues through the Pilgrims to the New Jerusalem in the Americas and even the new Zion, first in Independence, MO, then in Salt Lake City. Utah might be the prettiest state in the union, in particular the southern part.  Mormonism strikes me as a most orderly order-little old towns have ancient orchards still bearing fruit, and everything is neat and in its place-kinda like Germany in terms of how the people are order oriented in Oder and elsewhere.  It\u2019s essentially Scientology of the 19th century, in that the gobbledygook its derived from is often nonsensical, with the difference being that they bred like rabbits early on, ensuring a return on their investment. Zion or Zions is the name of everything you can imagine in the Beehive State, Zions Muffler, Zions Bank, Zion NP, etc. At least part of those aren\u2019t so much Zionists as end timers. Most Mormons believe the location of the  promised land moved with the lost tribes. Their support of Israel is about the rise of the Anti-Christ bringing about the Second Coming. It is about giving them enough rope to destroy themselves, violence expected. I don\u2019t have enough experience with other Evangelical or Evangelical adjacent religions, but I grew up among the Mormons. The guy may be a little off-putting, but he knows his stuff. I learned a lot. Not off-putting at all \u2013 thanks for the link. The first proto-Zionist he mentions, Francis Kett, was burned alive for heresy. When people believe the real world lies elsewhere, they drive this world mad. \u201cRebuilding Gaza will take \u2018decades,\u2019 cost $70B, experts say\u201d On the bright side, Israel has agreed to put their hands in their own pockets and offered to build the foundation for every new building in Gaza. Zion will want to oversee the demolition\/clearing work, to undercount the bodies recovered. The First 48 Hours of a War With China \u2018Could Be Ugly\u2019 National Security Journal Probably Battle of Adrianople level of ugly. The delusions run high; I guess the US not fighting someone their own size for almost a century meant they forgot what actual total war is like. Completely ignored in this article is the question of logistics which tells me that this is not a serious article. Like, how do you re-supply all those units that you have scattered around the Pacific like so much confetti. Supply drones? Submarine supply? More to the point, how will the Pentagon replace all those weapons and missiles after the first coupla days if they do not have the refined earths to build them or the years that it will take to actually build them if they did have those refined rare earths. Rev Kev: Completely ignored in this article is the question of logistics which tells me that this is not a serious article.  It was beyond \u2018not serious\u2019 into Qing dynasty-level delusional, with passages saying things like the US will somehow meet such a war\u2019s demands for \u201cmagazine depth\u2014surging production of key munitions and operationalizing at-sea reloading\u2014and fully integrating allied firepower.\u201d Hilarious. Comedy gold. Marianas Turkey Shoot but in reverse.  Historically, the US  military has performed awfully in a debut battle against peers and non-peers, more often than not. In any modern 1st wold hypothetical war, there won\u2019t be a 2nd chance.  So goes the first  48 hours, there goes the war. theonly question becomes will the losing side (the US) graciously accept defeat or escalate to tactical nukes over an island (or NATO ally) that the majority of Americans cannot locate without Google\u2019s help Remember, Mommy I\u2019m off to get a Commie So send me a salami And try to smile somehow I\u2019ll look for you when the war is over An hour and a half from now The first 48 hours of a war with China could be ugly, but not as much as what comes after. That was my first thought as well. Even Vizzini in \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d knew one of the great blunders is to get involved in a land war in Asia.  Best case scenario we\u2019d suffer societal collapse due to loss of modern tech. Worst case we\u2019d start a nuclear war and life on earth would be eradicated. The argument seemed to ignore the fact that Chinas has a vastly greater manufacturing capability.  To use the WW2 analogy, it would be as if Japan launched a surprise attack knowing it would be able to manufacture 50,000 war planes per year while the U.S. coukd make a tiny fraction of that number. I think the field of national security studies must attract a lot of strange Walter Mitty types. These are all spreadsheet cultists now. If I change a number in a database or spreadsheet, I am changing reality.  It does not matter if I didn\u2019t talk to anyone about changing that number. It doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t understand the conditions which derived that number. Gantt charts be damned. Production time tables are stuff to be ignored. Stress testing supply chains is unnecessary. I did all I needed to do by changing the number in the cell on the spreadsheet. Others will work to make that happen.  AI hallucinations are just an example of a child emulating its parent. Since WWII, national security studies in the West has always been a highly specialised sub-field of marketing communications populated by fantasists whose work is muchloved by members if the MIC, politicians, the media and assorted members of the grift set.  In the rest of the industrialised world, national security studies are highly disciplined and primarily concerned with solving logistical, engineering, strategic and communications and control problems by specialists with practical experience working in conjunction with each other and the all important bean counters whose purpose is to get the biggest bang for every single buck with as little publicity as possible. i was surprised to learn that the author was a perfesser, and not a newby freshman who got in the door with a shotput scholarship. i just hope he had the decency to clean up after himself after writing this drivel. i could almost hear the panting, and that gentle slapping sound. Ah, he\u2019s game for a good birching is he? Zounds! I\u2019d just like to point out that with Isabella\u2019s Islay you pay for the bottle, not the content. The bottle is carved from crystal and covered with white cold, diamonds and rubies. I think they may even have diamond inside the bottle. Indeed one for the guillotine watch. The highest price paid for actual whisky is $2.7 million for the Macallan Fine & Rare 1926. It was distilled in 1926, bottled in 1986 (60 year old whisky) and auctioned in 2023. Only ten remains from the original 12, which Macallan never sold publicly, but reserved for high-end customers. Macallan was the first whisky to be granted the Royal Warrant in the early 19th century, so it\u2019s The Whisky for the English upper classes and the most overpriced one, too. It is probably far too expensive to ever open and drink. That makes it an asset that give status like a mansion or a yacht as big as a frigate. Waiting for stone pyramids to become a trend among such people. Eating Egyptian mummies was a thing in the Middle Ages\u2013as medicine or something\u2013presumably those taken from stone pyramids, too, if they could be managed.  Just wondering aloud. An asset? Whiskey so expensive it is undrinkable. How does having something useless confer status? Does you status-o-meter fall if you drip the bottle? Clearly, I am not obscenely wealthy and thus do not, cannot, understand this l;usrt for possession. Check out Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen for that explanation. The fact that a person can afford to spend lavishly on something useless or expensive to maintain is what gives it status, like a sports car or a trophy wife. It shows that someone has money to burn \u2013 hence the status. Luxury packaging is not a novel idea. Somewhere down in the cellar I\u2019ve a 70 yo Cognac bottled in a Baccarat crystal decanter. It\u2019s been designated \u201capocalypse booze\u201d and with some luck I may never crack the seal. My \u2018apocalypse food\u2019 is a can of Underwood deviled ham that I hope never to use the pull back tab on the lid, to be honest.  I appreciate that it has been pre-masticated for easier chewing, and as far as I know, is the only canned foodstuff that is wrapped in paper-just add a festive bow and you\u2019ve got the Xmas gift exchange dilemma down pat. yeah. underwoods devilled chicken is what does it fer me,lol. that and grits, boiled twice, once in water, then in milk\/cream\u2026w butter and bacon. with a fried egg on top, blindfolded, with a dash of tabasco. i can hardly find either of them out here. (Jim Dandy is my fave grits) \u2026and so we see\u2026its not that hard, after all, to keep the hoi polloi happy and sated,lol. Underwood deviled ham was my go to sandwich in first and second grade. I haven\u2019t tried it in years, decades actually, but now I\u2019m curious. Going to pick up a tin next time I\u2019m at The Choppa. aye, i hadnt had the chicken in (edit: more like) 40+ years, when Tam showed up with some. all that was missing was guvmint cheese,lol. she didnt see the allure\u2026altho she grew up eating tater chip sandwiches\u2026. (our boys like those, too,lol) Back when people played tennis, \u2018tennis bracelets\u2019 were popular and a jewelers whet dream as it solved the issue of smaller sized diamonds, what do you do with them? An earlier way to get rid of smaller goods was the cocktail ring-which is a funny name, as if booze and a bunch of small time diamonds got together. Getting rid of diamonds on a spendy bottle of booze, perfect. Origin of the name \u2018tennis bracelet\u2019\u2026 they were known as straight line diamond bracelets. Chrissy Everett, the tennis pro, wore one when she was playing. During a game, her bracelet broke and fell to the court. The tv camera zoomed in on it and it gained instant popularity with everyone heading to jewelry stores asking for tennis bracelets. In the mid-\u201970s I worked at a liquor store on Fillmore and California in SF. We considered it to be the edge between Fillmore Heights and Pacific Depths, delivering to alkies in the projects, as well as the swells in the mansions. Also purveyed various substances to newspaper heirs, etc. One night, when  the Stones were playing The Fillmore, we almost sold their managers\u2019 errand-boy the most expensive bottle in the store, a Louis the whatever cognac in, of course, a Baccarat bottle. I remember its\u2019 price as being in the thousands. He instead bought the 2nd most expensive bottle, a similar cognac in a lesser container. We didn\u2019t get a taste, unfortunately. Regarding new films of note: One Battle After Another (2025). This is Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s new and rather free adaptation of Pynchon\u2019s Vineland. It\u2019s a pretty fun ride with a Honkywood-competent vibe. I will go out on a limb to say that if there is any single new film in 2025 that comes close to capturing the current insanity in the U.S., this is it. Thanks, I\u2019m going to check that out. Vineland is a terrific read. Been an interesting year for auteur directors making social upheaval films. From Alex Garland\u2019s \u201cCivil War\u201d to Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington\u201d to PTA\u2019s \u201cOn Battle After Another\u201d.  I really like all three directors but have not watched any of these films.  Reading NC and keeping up with current events \u2013 and just existing in our current society \u2013 is enough of that subject for me. Not looking for a cinematic version of it at the movies.  Was talking with a feisty 80+ year old woman while in Amsterdam last week. She asked why I was there and I said I was doing video work for a corporate client. She replied, \u201cThat\u2019s stupid. Don\u2019t do stupid work in our country. Go home and do good work to fix your stupid country.\u201d It got me thinking about not just the work I\u2019m doing but what I have done. What I can do. I\u2019ve tried to make films that unify, bridge divides, and offer positive visions of our humanity. That few have seen them is not the main concern. What concerns me is how media that divides and perpetuates negative visions of humanity saturate our landscape. Chicken or the egg: does negative  media create our negative society or vice versa? The old \u201cif it bleeds it leads\u201d mentality?  Went to see Abby Martin\u2019s new film \u201cEarth\u2019s Greatest Enemy\u201d last night. Happy to support her stellar work. But couldn\u2019t help noticing it was an echo chamber audience. I\u2019d be willing to bet not a single mind was changed in that theater.  That\u2019s what I love about Naked Capitalism. Every day we get a cross section of news and opinions to digest and see real in real time as debates go down in the comments. Open minds meeting each other respectfully to engage in ideas and facts. Sure, it can be depressing but such is life. It is also hopeful because it shows growth and change is possible.  That\u2019s what I want to bring more to in my own work and see in the work of others. And why I have no interest in Hollywood tales of division and unrest even if made by the best filmmakers in the business. Give me Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof\u2018s \u201cThere is No Evil\u201d (one of the greatest films of the past decade in my opinion) any day over that stuff. Maybe no one will watch it (I don\u2019t know anyone else whose seen that film, and as I said, few have seen my own films) but I\u2019d rather create and support positive visions of humanity and unity then more divisiveness.  But that\u2019s just me. To each their own. Geo: Hmmm. You didn\u2019t receive advice. You received a disquisition from John Calvin in a brassiere. To wit: She asked why I was there and I said I was doing video work for a corporate client. She replied, \u201cThat\u2019s stupid. Don\u2019t do stupid work in our country. Go home and do good work to fix your stupid country.\u201d Why order you around? It may be that, living here in Italy, the mother culture of the West, and along with Greece, the great teacher and preserver of classical and Western culture, I would present a  response to you to observe what the Italians do and then make contrasts.  Since I have arrived in Italy, I have still \u2014 still \u2014 to spend time dismantling U.S. daft racial categories and the tendency toward racial categorization. That\u2019s something you could start in Amsterdam. Further, outside the U S of A looking in, one sees how badly that U.S. government and the powers-that-be treat the citizens. It is stark from afar. So you can use the distance to reshape your ideas.  And then (hypothetically, here in the Undisclosed Region), you could indulge in bonet and make choices about what your work is. Go see TRON: ARES in IMAX 3D. Skip the civil war, coronavirus, and libtard movies even if they are technically good. I love PTA but as soon as his characters start talking about Revolution I\u2019m like PTA NEEDS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT CLASS POLITICS NOT IDENTITY POLITICS. I hate the anxiety inducing madness of Ari Aster. I hate all this talk about a Civil War from the great filmmaker of Dredd. So, once again, I am imploring the NC Commentariat to support Jared Leto and TRON! Geo: whats yer opinion of Kino Film Collection?(or anyone else\u2019s, for that matter?) only place i could find the film you recced, and i wandered a bit, and man..they got all manner of stuff i dig. considering a year\u2019s sub for either that, or Criterion Collection as a gift to myself, come tax return(if IRS, Fedgov, etc are still functional, that is\u2026) \u201cEurope and the US Are Drifting Apart and It Isn\u2019t Just Because of Trump\u201d If there even is a \u201cEurope\u201d as a unitary actor of sorts (which is debatable), it cannot craft a coherent trade position in the world until it seriously engages with Russia in a mutually acceptable security architecture. Until then it will remain a plaything of the US State Department. Exactly. I was very interested in reading what this author, writing in Jacobin, thought about the devastating effects of the Ukraine war on the European economy, not to mention its politics and social policies. Imagine my surprise when I found out that this barely merits a mention. Here is the mention: \u201cAfter Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, security suddenly became the scarce and costly good \u2014 and only the United States could provide it, as Europe\u2019s post\u2013Cold War order had prioritized the \u201cpeace dividend\u201d over defense.\u201d \u201cThis tilted the balance of power toward Washington, giving America leverage to demand a higher premium in other areas, including trade.\u201d That\u2019s it. Perhaps it\u2019s a clue. There is another line about Trump whining about Europe continuing to buy Russian oil. Perhaps that is another hint about the costs to Europe in completely severing economic ties with that rather large and resource-rich country to its East. These ties were mutually beneficial and promised increased opportunities as Russia was reintegrated into the European economy after the Cold War. This was recognized by many European leaders at the time. But those leaders no longer exist.  The number one goal of the Ukraine war was to severe this growing economic relationship between Europe and Russia. It has almost succeeded. How was this accomplished? By whom? Who benefits? Was ending this \u201cdependency\u201d on Russian energy and the resulting increase in \u201cAmerican leverage\u201d worth it? To whom? There are a whole bunch of related questions that seem crucial to me if you are going to discuss the European economy in the context of geopolitics. This author does not seem to want to deal with them. The unstated assumption seems to be that Russia started the war in 2022, and that reliance on the \u201cpeace dividend\u201d might have been a mistake but regardless Europe can no longer afford it. Sounds about right for the \u201csocialism\u201d of Jacobin. It repeats the tired old idea that the US can \u201cguarantee security,\u201d which is taking a long time to die. Without much of a security capability, the US has very little security leverage, and what it has now  is in the process of disappearing. For the moment, the Europeans are prepared to make sacrifices to avoid the consistent nightmare of a US\/Russia deal which affects their interests but where they have no voice. But I suspect that\u2019s a lost cause as well. The idea that Russia invaded Ukraine to destroy its economic relationship with Europe is, well, innovative \u2026. To be clear, if you are referirng to my own view, it is that it was the US\/NATO and their European compradors that wanted to sever the economic ties between Europe and Russia, once it became clear that Russia could not be completely dismantled and looted from within.  And so they did so, by continuing to back Russia into a corner for 30 years. Russia desired quite the opposite. You will likely see this as an ethnocentric view with the US as the center of the world that does not give enough \u201cagency\u201d to the many complex European interests involved in this history. Again, my response is: we had people writing about this strategy, predicting the outcomes, getting themselves into positions of power, taking advantage of these many competing and conflicting interests (including those in Eastern Europe and Ukraine itself) and doing what was necessary to get the task done.  We had Putin desiring closer ties with Europe, then issuing plea and warning after plea and warning as the West continued to reject these with disdain while moving closer to Russian borders. This is not to deny the existence of Russophobia in Europe, especially in the East. These fears and historical tensions, and the leaders pushing them, proved quite useful in constructing this new Iron Curtain that benefits neither Europe nor Russia. It repeats the tired old idea that the US can \u201cguarantee security,\u201d which is taking a long time to die.  Thank you. re: ending Russia \u2013 Germany Another item of evidence is the most recent appearance of former Chancellor Schr\u00f6der at this totally ignored NordStream 2 investigation Committee by the state parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.  announcement of the hearing: https:\/\/www.landtag-mv.de\/aktuelles\/artikel\/untersuchungsausschuss-zur-stiftung-klima-und-umweltschutz-mv-befragt-gerhard-schroeder-und-helge-braun-1 The Committee:  https:\/\/www.landtag-mv.de\/aktuelles?tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bsearch%5D%5BfilteredCategory%5D=115&tx_news_pi1%5Bsearch%5D%5Byear%5D=2022&tx_news_pi1%5Bsearch%5D%5Bsubject%5D=&tx_news_pi1%5BcurrentPage%5D=1 It had been set up in June of 2022 to investigate the events surrounding the construction of NS2, because of the alleged environmental impact.  They since tried to somehow not entirely ignore the elephant \u2013 that is the destruction of the very subject of their investigation in autumn 2022 \u2013 without seriously drawing conclusions.  This farce has been going on for 3 years now.  Schr\u00f6der had been supposed to give testimony months ago but apparently was ill.  Schr\u00f6der\u00b4s appearance was streamed on October 17th. I have not yet found the original record of this hearing. I hope it  will be soon released.  MSM have reported but needless to say in  an insane, demonising way.  As far as I understand none of the people involved in building NS2 heard on Oct. 17th were sorry for their decision. MSM of course cried foul and pestilence and pictured Schr\u00f6der as Putin\u2019s one-man-5th column. So I have no 100% assurance based on those MSM-reports what was really said (and what not.).  We do know from past hearings that witnesses did mention odd visits by most likely CIA in Northern Germany or those threats by the Trump I administration to stop NS2. Back then Scholz was \u201cdealing\u201d with that (he did nothing of course) under Merkle as her minister of finance.  Considering all this background and all the personnel involved the way how this decoupling from Russia has been taking place defies any serious debate. It\u00b4s merely \u201cDaddy\u201d-level of acting.   Everybody involved knows the truth.  Another rather comical one is the ongoing attempt to spread that idiotic tale about ANDROMEDA and using those Ukrainians as patsies. Most embarrassing is the unbelievable fact that it actually is being taken seriously enough even by German alternative media (yes I am talking about NACHDENKSEITEN but also smaller ones.) Ugh, even Jacobin has to squawk MUH FULL SCALE INVASHUN? Sim\u00f3n says invade Bolivar\u2019d of broken dreams\u2026 I want those heavy truck eyes for my minivan. They appear to be mimicking what the drivers eyes are doing \u2013 this might be a good thing if all cars had it\u2026 or not! Best\u2026H They remind me of the beautifully painted trucks in Pakistan. However, with all the flashing lights and glitter, it may be difficult to see the basics, such as a turn signal. Available on Temu \u201cIs the US about to attack Venezuela?\u201d Funny thing you know. Trump has been having random boats being blown up because they were all full of drugs and crewed by narcoterrorists. Or so he says. But he just had another boat blown up but this time there was a difference \u2013 there were two survivors. The Navy went in and grabbed them instead of machine gunning them in the water. So what did they do with those two narcoterrorist? Send them to Guantanamo Bay for an extended visit? Keep them in the ship\u2019s brig while they undergo intensive question-answer sessions by teams of burly men? No, they sent them home. One to Colombia and one to Ecuador so that the courts there could deal with them. Unfortunately for Trump, neither was from Venezuela. Strange treatment for a pair of narcoterrorists who pose a deadly threat to the US I would say. I\u2019m sure our bombing of little fishing boats in the Caribbean is striking fear into the hearts of the Chinese government and all other global adversaries. Between the Trump military parade, our DoW Hegseth spouting \u201cFAFO\u201d, and these shows of force, we must look so macho and not at all like a clown car with the wheels falling off. Blowing small boats to smithereens and killing those on board is a show of force? It is akin to stomping on a bug to show that you can take on Godzilla. It is murderous performative nonsense. If the orders to do so are not illegal, I should like to know in what manner they are legal. \u201cmurderous performative nonsense\u201d is now written above the door i installed, today, to block the wind from the new part of the wilderness bar. that just about sums it up.

There is equipment that will tell you from where a shell came from and how far away but it seems strange that Grossi never asked for them to be deployed at that plant so he could find out who to blame. Grossi cant even properly operate mark 1 eyeball, let alone advanced equipment (like the counter-battery radar you are talking about). If Russia was Israel, Grossi wouldn\u2019t be alive still. If Russia was Israel, Grossi would be working for Russia. Nexperia. I was reading an article yesterday and it said if nexperia will stop selling its chips unless this whole thing is reversed. If it does stop selling car chips it\u2019ll cause most of Europes auto makers to not be able to make cars in just a few weeks. And will also have a big impact on US automakers. Just another realism about the west has no control over China, it\u2019s not just rare earths.  And the classification on this company started under Biden. It\u2019s like the Dutch government went into pirate mode and just stole this company from the Chinese but never stopped to game out how the Chinese could retaliate and what it would means for chip supply in the EU. What is wrong with this people? Do they really believe that actions never have any consequences? If so, I have news for them and it is all bad. In a article published yesterday, and which  states the same as you wrote (in Spanish) it says that the EU Commission is evaluating if the decision by the Netherlands government breaks the rules of free competition or if it simply jeopardizes the security of supply. Yet i don\u2019t believe this stance. the Commission has apparently endorsed the decision and there are voices asking for \u201ca more offensive way\u201d toward (against) China. EU policymakers have definitely lost their minds if this is true. MicaT: the west has no control over China, it\u2019s not just rare earths. Meanwhile, just China\u2019s control over rare earths is enough to shut down the AI bubble and crash the US\u2019s stock market and economy any time Beijing wishes. World\u2019s landscapes may soon be \u2018devoid of wild animals\u2019, says nature photographer The Guardian ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ With the exception of the Marmot Cong hanging out in lower altitude haunts than usual in clandestine troop movements along the Ho Chi-Mineral King Cong trail, there was less deer and bears this summer, everybody in the community being in agreement. ive got birds, galore. and fikken to have a whole lot more: chickadees, titmice, cardinals, robins and on and on overwinter with me. hence the cat massacre happens around this time of year(23, so far), before the winter birds arrive in bulk. i have maybe 12 more cats to feed to buzzards(whom i get to then observe, going about their secret purposes) That rhythmic gymnastics video was quite something, she was in complete command of the canvas, wow! Regarding the \u201cNo kings\u201d protest. What a load of crap. Obvious democrat party nonsense. Trump thinking he is a king, the least of our troubles. It\u2019s the policies he is using. Typical, distracting nincompoops with some pretend crapola like this! Not worth anyone time! F the Dem party to hell and back!!!!! We\u2019ll convince them that Errorstroika is wrong via performance theater, yeah that\u2019s the ticket! The \u201cIf Kamala was president we\u2019d be at brunch\u201d signs didn\u2019t inspire you? Only makes you wonder if missing one brunch in ten months to protest because your candidate was incompetent and lost constitutes commitment.  (And it really makes me happy that I haven\u2019t been at the almost forty brunches to hear the wailing and complaints when so much of what is wrong would be happening with their preferred ruler anyway  just with less bombast and chaos. That is not to say that authoritarian overload we are experiencing is good just merely experiencing less of it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening.) Was it over when the Germans bombed as his loan harbor\u2026? Hell No! No it was not a democratic party party. I looked at all the media coverage and response. The NY times comments was illuminating. I was surprised at the push back against the protests. But like most times comments, both sides were pretty lame. What was missing was acknowledgement that the protests were not especially partizan. At the core it was about the administration exceeding its authority. People were not grousing about losing an election. They were pissed about having jack boots in their city. They were upset that domestic policy was being directed from within the white house by the reincarnation of Herman Goring. You seem to have missed the point that half of registered democrats didn\u2019t vote. No real majority elected this government. The culture wars are the distraction you are buying right into. Like the guy down the road who still has his F Biden sign up. He does not care about the constitution or the law as long as he thinks his side is winning. And let\u2019s see what would not pretend protests look like, armed resistance, a real civil war? Not Goring, Heydrich or maybe Himmler.

Namtan\u2014a name that means both \u201cbrown sugar\u201d and references his coat color\u2014has been working at the PTT station on Thanyaburi-Wang Noi Road in Klong Luang district for four years.

Station owner Thirapong Lappholtaweying found Namtan wandering the streets years ago and decided to take him in. \u201cI felt sorry for him,\u201d Thirapong said. \u201cBut he turned out to be naturally friendly and liked approaching people, so we made him our patrol unit to help look after customers.\u201d\u2026   For more evidence of the devolution of US politics, and the current administration in particular, into juvenile delinquency, the latest Simplicius post \u201cZelensky Gets the Fig Amid Trump Admin\u2019s Whacky Day\u201d offers a couple of morsels. >>> [in re: potential US-Russia summit] HuffPost asked the White House: Who picked Budapest?

Additionally, JD Vance apparently posted an image on Bluesky of Trump wearing a crown (presumably mocking No Kings).  I wonder if he recognizes the ambiguity in this. If I may offer an analogy for the Trump II admin (with apologies for anyone who may have earlier formulated the same): he has obtained the keys to the country and is taking it for a joy ride. {knock Knock} Grammar police, open up!

Efffing Stoopid behaviour, of which I see much more of as time passes. Public figures take no Covid precautions and I wonder how much Covid induced brain damage contributes to the increasingly risky and stupid behavior of the \u201celites\u201d. For a moment I thought you were talking about the decline of Motown, and then I realised you were talking about the decline of the American Republic which is a lesser matter in the great scheme of things.  Republics come and go, but there will never be another Motown.  Or a Stax\u2026 I was lately considering that I\u2019ve gotten the timeline for COVID wrong; I thought that perhaps by 2030 there might be enough of a population level heath burden that some kind of awareness might kindle an idea that as a society we should maybe do something. But I\u2019m beginning to realize that this is a slow moving generational health catastrophe that is going to take place over the course of lifetimes, well beyond my own. Even repeat infection isn\u2019t fatal enough to spur some kind of public awareness and response. What damage is done is often sub-clinical, the immediate symptoms from infection brief in duration, however unpleasant. Other damage is not easily relatable to a recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. I was wondering what kind of effect this might have over a millennia on humanity. Searching the Internet didn\u2019t turn up much. We seem to use death as a proxy for the severity of epidemics; what kind of historical proxy would you use for mass disability? So I haven\u2019t been able to come up with any historical analogues for what happens to a population due to some pathogen that causes a wide variety of impairments, over a time, to a population. I did come across this, which I agree with (The rise and fall of diseases: reflections on the history of population health in Europe since ca. 1700): It is in the confrontation with cholera that public health developed its paradigmatic approach, which can be summarized in three axioms. (1) Most diseases arise in the interaction between people and the environment, (2) so we can and must try to radically remove their causes, and (3) this can only be done if we take collective responsibility for these measures, i.e., if the government takes the lead [24]. Public health has played a decisive role in the decline of many diseases, not only of plague, smallpox, typhus and cholera, but also of pneumoconiosis, lung cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, road traffic injuries and many other health problems. Over the last three centuries, public health clearly wins out over other forms of human intervention [3] (pp. 284\u2013287). I\u2019m probably thinking about something like this, but for the past 1,000 years, given how slow COVID is unfolding: Burden of 375 diseases and injuries, risk-attributable burden of 88 risk factors, and healthy life expectancy in 204 countries and territories, including 660 subnational locations, 1990\u20132023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023 For more than three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has provided a framework to quantify health loss due to diseases, injuries, and associated risk factors. This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions. Looks like someone made an attempt: The greatest health problem of the Middle Ages? Estimating the burden of disease in medieval England (paywalled sadly) And this is my point Among medieval health problems, we estimate that plague was probably 7th\u201310th in overall importance. Although lethal and disruptive, it struck only periodically and had less cumulative long-term human consequences than chronically endemic conditions (e.g. bacterial and viral infections causing infant and child death, tuberculosis, and other pathogens). Anyway, my contention is that COVID is going to break humanity over lifetimes, and what\u2019s happening is opaque to the overwhelming majority of people, so there is no end date where we\u2019ll begin to see broad awareness and a desperately necessary course correction. We\u2019re cooked, like with Climate. This timeline is lit. Long term lead poisoning among the Roman Empire elites and City of Rome population? That took generations to play out. See: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roman_lead_poisoning_theory That\u2019s exactly the kind of situation I\u2019m considering; but tracking disability over time in ancient populations is non-trivial. This is definitely an area of research I\u2019d need to devote considerable time to, but whatever I find isn\u2019t going to change the outcome. So I\u2019ll leave it to any future historians that we might have. Speaking of lead, just look at the relationship between leaded gasoline and public health that\u2019s been I think pretty conclusive proven, but it took ages for that to become clear, and this in the modern area where we kind of sort of keep public health records and track more than just deaths. If we assume that one of the major \u2018impacts\u2019 of the coronavirus, and indeed many prior examples of pandemic, is diminished mental ability, could the quality of recorded political discourse act as a proxy indicator of general \u201cintelligence?\u201d Compare recorded political discourse over time and see if there are measurable declines in the intellectual \u201cdepth\u201d of the debates as the supposed pandemic develops. Anyway, there should be other \u2018markers\u2019 for cognitive decline apart from formal medical records available. For the Middle Ages, ecclesiastical writings, both public and private perhaps. The Church kept very good records I have read. Stay safe. lol. thats likely a good marker. ive seen it, anecdatally, of course\u2026no formality, here. driving, and just general idiocy has increased. ive looked at the uncomprehending face for all my life, as it were,lol\u2026and it IS worse, now. Surprise, surprise, Israel is already violating the cease fire Israel strikes Gaza and orders halt to aid after accusing Hamas of violating ceasefire (CNN, paywall) (CNBC, working link) Not agreement capable. Israel on Sunday struck targets in southern Gaza after saying its troops came under fire from Hamas militants, in the first major test of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire meant to halt more than two years of war. Militants used a rocket-propelled grenade, and Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery, the military said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu consulted with Israel\u2019s security heads and directed the military to take \u201cstrong action\u201d against any ceasefire violations, but didn\u2019t threaten to return to war. > China Seizes the Master\u2019s Weapon As It Makes Itself the New Hegemon A New Hegemon? China has a \u201cmercantilist\u201d productive structure based on commodity exports. To make themselves \u201cthe new hegemon,\u201d it would be necessary to create monetary and financial levers capable of replacing the dollar. As Yves has argued, that\u2019s not going to happen in the foreseeable future. If that analysis is correct, the challenge from China isn\u2019t one of revolutionary hegemony (replacing one system with another) but of resistance (reform within a system). The aim of the Chinese state is to renegotiate the world order, not to create a new one, but to assure that the qualitative superiority of US imperialism doesn\u2019t prevent China from moving up the value chain.  In the face of that challenge, it is the United States that is posing a hegemonic challenge. Yes, that\u2019s right. The US under Trump is challenging the basis of the very order that had the US as it hegemon since the end of WW2. The goal is clearly to create a new hegemony that will be very different from the previous postwar liberal order, even if formally similar in that the US still occupies the summit of global hierarchy.  I haven\u2019t read Mr Walsh\u2019s blog in some time, so I am not sure if he is intentionally deflecting attention from the hegemonic challenge coming out of the US itself or is simply using a sensationalist title to attract readers. Perhaps I\u2019ve missed something so I\u2019d be grateful for any corrections or response. Or the examples of China and Russia encourage a shift towards autarky on the basis of a single country, a complementary bi-lateral relationship, or small and manageable regional economic communities coupled with the absolute minimum of international trade to assist those countries who require help in tackling resource theft and to help them build their legitimate economies from scratch.  Establishing the greatest possible degree of self-sufficiency\/autarky strikes me as an admirable economic, political and socially beneficial goal.

We pray to God who is seemingly passive, supposedly listens, but does not respond verbally to our entreaties. We just assume He understands, is sympathetic to our conditions, and will resolve our problems. It is an assumption that may or may not be true. Just as there are instances, where some people cite gracious divine intervention, there are others where God let his innocent, pious worshippers suffer from tragic events and situations. Why do bad things happen to good people, a nonbeliever asks. Many have concluded that God just does not exist. The number of atheists and agnostics world over is reportedly on the rise. But the thought of there being no supernatural benefactor can make many a beleaguered person feel lonely, clueless, helpless, and depressed. Idea of God thus satisfies a deep human craving for a protective Father figure. Were God not serving a profound psychological need or being an existential necessity in a world which is not always very kind and congenial, belief in Him may not have survived for long. Even a sceptic once remarked, \u2018There is no God, so let us create one\u2019. Coming back to an AI conceived virtual God, say for example in case of Hindus, his physical form, qualities, attributes and knowledge could be based on a comprehensive information, data that is, from religious texts like Mahabharat, Bhagvad Gita, Ramayana, and other hollowed treatises like Vedas, Upanishads etc. This virtual God, in a word, would be a close approximation of the supposedly real God in terms of appearance, wisdom and sagacity as occurring in Hindu religion. He may do no miracles but would be a similar counsellor and guide to the ignorant and perplexed as say Krishna was to Arjun. An emotionally turmoiled person could thus be soothed and made to choose the best course of action to come out of his crisis by this virtual God. One\u2019s communication with \u2018real\u2019 God is one way course, a monologue, of a believer addressing and beseeching Him. But in case of virtual God, it could be a dialogue, say like of what Arjun had with Krishna in Gita. All queries and doubts of the \u2018believer\u2019 would be responded to thoroughly, which would strictly be in consonance with spirit of the religious texts. AI could even conjure up on screen, or holograms, images of Krishna, Shiva, Ganpati or whatever other God one may will, in his most glorious form while this dialogue happens. He would even act and make gestures in a commanding but soothing vein. I wonder would this virtual God who listens, responds, and guides not be a more helpful entity than a supposedly real but silent God. This virtual God, even I as a sceptic, would like to have dialogues with. Believers as well might want to do it because renouncing faith is not required for doing so. I have tried the \u2018talk to God\u2019 experiment with AI \u2013 Jesus in my case. I asked him to take a look at the modern world and tell me what he thought of Christianity and how it had evolved. It turned out he wasn\u2019t a fan. I was impressed with the AI\u2019s ability to figure out what I was looking for (from minimal cues) and deliver it. It makes sense if you think about it \u2013 they have been trained in the same way as the Facebook algorithm, by allowing people to rate their responses so they can deliver more of what people like. What you get in most cases is a highly sophisticated bias confirmation engine. If you ever find yourself reading an AI conversation and thinking \u201cYes! That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve always thought!\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s probably why the AI chose that particular response for you. i reckon that that way lies disaster. much like with the AI girlfriends, who(so i hear) are now free to get \u201cintimate\u201d,lol. \u201cThey\u201d will, of course, include all manner of Dopamine Manipulation in these things. it\u2019s about control. not liberation or epiphany. better to find a tree, and sit underneath it. when people ask me what church i go to\u2026i say, \u201cwell, i pretty much live in \u201cChurch\u201d\u2026\u201d \u201cthe Kingdom of Heaven is within you, and all around you\u201d and like Einstein, \u201ci believe in Spinoza\u2019s God\u2026\u201d \u201cFor happiness, how little sufficeth for happiness!\u201d Thus spake I once and thought myself wise. But it was a blasphemy: that have I now learned. Wise fools speak better.

Wars come home A Squalid Building, a Tip to the Feds, and Then \u2018Straight-Up Chaos\u2019 (NY Times paywalled) On a humid September night in Chicago, Cameo Polk was asleep in his fifth-floor apartment when he heard the thump thump thump of a helicopter overhead. Outside, hundreds of men with masks and rifles were scurrying around the building. He briefly wondered if an invasion was underway. But they were U.S. law enforcement agents, rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter and swarming the 130-unit building he lives in. Once inside, they kicked down doors, emptied bookshelves and overturned mattresses. By dawn, at least 37 of Mr. Polk\u2019s neighbors, nearly all Venezuelan nationals, would be in the custody of the U.S. government, part of President Trump\u2019s plan to crack down on illegal immigration. Trailed by drones and a camera crew, federal agents with their guns drawn carried out one of the most aggressive immigration operations in recent memory. The raid has become a defining image of the Trump administration\u2019s surge of federal agents into Chicago, where masked immigration officers for weeks have been chasing down people suspected of being in the country illegally. An immigration raid, with a Blackhawk! It\u2019s a shame Obama normalized DHS. Meanwhile, the building is owned by a slum lord  On this, the residents of 7500 S. South Shore Drive could agree: The building was full of danger. The conditions inside were squalid, with mold, broken pipes and the persistent reek of urine in the darkened stairwells. \u201cDrugs, gangs, prostitution,\u201d said Twana Pickens, 44, who had lived in the building for three years until she moved out this summer. \u201cAnything illegal? Name it. It happened there. It\u2019s just a very unsafe environment for people who just want to come home, go to work and try to raise their families there.\u201d  Needless to say, DHS didn\u2019t go out and arrest the capitalist owners, eh? From the moment the Patriot Act was signed into law, something like  these immigration raids was baked in. Was that the intention? Don\u2019t know, but it might as well have been. When the potential exists in the laws, it is a matter of time until someone will take advantage of it. Trump has done so, but even he is building on the foundation of the actions of his predecessors.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Get real bang for your buck with these TVs  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  It can be a real headache looking for a new TV, especially with similar-sounding model names from rival brands touting the same features and technologies for almost identical prices. Browsing the best TVs on the market comes down to one major thing: which TV is going to give you the best bang for your buck? Buying one of the best OLED TVs like the awesome LG G5 or Samsung S95F flagships would be great, but they come at a premium price, often exceeding $2,000 \/ \u00a32,000 for a 65-inch model. Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to spend these premium prices to get an excellent TV that should cover all your needs, especially for movies and gaming. Nowadays, TVs from more \u2018budget\u2019 brands such as Hisense and TCL compete with major brands when it comes to both features and performance. As TechRadar\u2019s TV tester, I\u2019ve picked three models that do bang for your buck better than any other TVs. TCL QM7K\/C7K The mid-range model in TCL\u2019s 2025 mini-LED TV lineup, the 7-series, referred to as the QM7K in the US and the C7K in the UK, has a robust list of features and delivers great performance for the price. With high brightness (over 3,000 nits!) and bold, vibrant colors, the QM7K\/C7K also has effective local dimming, which produces deep blacks and strong contrast. Textures look realistic on 7-series TVs, and detail is refined. I was seriously impressed with the QM7K\/C7K\u2019s picture quality when I tested it, and while not perfect, it\u2019s a real improvement over previous TCL mid-range TVs. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The QM7K\/C7K is also one of the best gaming TVs you can get in its price bracket. With 4K 144Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM all supported, plus a respectable 13.5ms input lag time for smooth performance, there aren\u2019t many better gaming TVs at this price. I've seen the 65-inch QM7K selling for as low as $799 and the 65-inch C7K for \u00a3799 \/ AU$1695. For what this TV offers, those are staggeringly low prices.      The Hisense U8Q is one of the flagship models in Hisense\u2019s 2025 mini-LED TV lineup. Its predecessor, the Hisense U8N, was one of the best mini-LED TVs of 2024, so the U8Q had some big shoes to fill, and it does just that. The U8Q delivered staggering brightness when we tested it, hitting 3,337 nits. Its superb backlight control also delivered powerful contrast in challenging scenes from TV shows such as The Last of Us. Colors were rich and vivid and the U8Q\u2019s higher brightness gave them that extra level of pop. The U8Q is also an excellent gaming TV. Its three HDMI 2.1 ports support 4K 165Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, ALLM, and Dolby Vision and HDR10+ gaming. Plus, it has an ultra-low 9.9ms input lag time for snappy, responsive gaming performance. For what it offers, the U8Q is brilliant value. It costs $1,099 for the 65-inch model in the US, and has been as low as $999 before. In Australia, it\u2019s priced at AU$1,895. Those are fantastic prices for a flagship TV with this level of performance. In the UK, the U8Q\u2019s value isn\u2019t quite as good, with the 65-inch model costing \u00a31,699. Still, given the specs, that price is very competitive.      The LG B5 is the latest entry in LG\u2019s B-series of OLED TVs, which sell at a cheaper price than most OLEDs. The B5 delivers all the picture quality highlights expected from an OLED TV. It has deep, inky blacks, vibrant color and 3D-like detail. It doesn\u2019t have the brightness of more premium OLEDs, clocking in at 668 nits, but its picture still has punchy contrast and looks fantastic. It\u2019s also a superb gaming TV, with a full suite of features supported across four HDMI 2.1 ports, including 4K 120Hz, AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, HGiG, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM. An ultra-low 9.2ms input lag time (in the TV\u2019s Boost mode) makes for fast-paced and ultra-responsive gaming, as I discovered when playing Battlefield V on the B5. Buying the B5 is the cheapest way to get a 2025 OLED TV. The 65-inch model costs $1,099 \/ \u00a31,349 \/ AU$2,295, and while that's more than what you\u2019ll pay for mini-LED models from Hisense and TCL, it\u2019s a brilliant price for an OLED. For the 65-inch step-up LG C5, you\u2019d be paying $1,399 \/ \u00a31,799 \/ AU$4,295!      OK, so this is a cheeky honorable mention. The LG C4 sat at the top of most of our best-of lists for the past 12 months as it delivers exceptional picture quality and brilliant gaming features and performance for a very competitive price. Now that we\u2019re in the latter part of 2025, however, the C4 has become difficult to find. Where available, it's currently getting great discounts, so if you see this TV listed, it\u2019s absolutely worth buying! \u00a0James is the TV Hardware Staff Writer at TechRadar.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByDoug Gollan, Contributor. Tired of crowded airports and airliners packed like sardines? Magnifica Air is the newest entry into the semi-private airline space.  Like others, it seeks to split the large gap between less expensive first class seating on scheduled airlines and more costly charter flights on private jets. Magnifica Air is planning to join JSX, Aero, Slate, and several others currently in the segment. Its first commercial flight is planned for the third quarter of 2027. It will offer the most luxurious version to date, testing a market that is still in the proving stage. The Orlando, Florida-based start-up is hoping to grow to as many as 50 aircraft. The initial routes will link Miami, New York, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, and Houston. There will also be seasonal flights to resort destinations and pop-up flights to significant events such as the Super Bowl and Art Basel Miami. It plans to use a combination of Airbus A220-300 and A321neo twin-engine jets. They will have a luxury configuration with just 45 to 54 seats, including two to four private suites.  Air France puts 148 seats on its A220-300 fleet; Delta Air Lines has 130 seats on its version with 194 seats on its A321neos. Magnifica Air will operate under Part 121 supplemental ops regulations. Like other semi-private airlines, it will offer a published schedule of flights and sell individual seats on its flights, mirroring the way you buy tickets on airlines. Like the others, Magnifica Air will also fly from private terminals so passengers can avoid crowded airport terminals. That feature can cut as much as an hour of travel time at each end.  The seating appears like what you find on those round-the-world private jet tours.  Seats are in a 2-by-2 configuration with plenty of legroom. That hints a bit at Magnifica Air\u2019s bigger play. When it isn\u2019t running its scheduled flights, executives see a robust market for sports team charters, corporate shuttles, and yes, that ever-growing segment of private jet tours by Four Seasons, A&K, Disney and others that use similarly configured passenger jets. Its launch last week during the National Business Aviation Association\u2019s annual convention in Las Vegas, where the trade show floor attracts corporate flight department heads, speaks to how its success may in part be based on the charter market. Offering the public a nicer by-the-seat option to the scheduled airlines has historically not always worked out well. From Air 1, MGM Grand Air, Legend Airlines, EOS, MaxJet, Silver Jet, OpenSkies, Surf Air, Rise and others, including an all-business class flight between New York and London by British Airways, none had staying power. That\u2019s not to say all attempts have been failures. La Compagnie offers all-business-class transatlantic flights; JSX has grown its version of semi-private flights to a nationwide network and has seemingly carved a niche in the market. Aero, after retrenching, has found success attracting Los Angeles-based flyers. There are a handful of similarly scheduled services that fly between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii, catering to residents of private communities there. With the growth of HNWs and luxury travel riding a seemingly unstoppable wave of demand and increased prices, where a 5-star hotel room in major cities regularly starts at over $1,000 per night, there could be an appetite for Magnifica Air. The press release teases making \u201cair travel as an invitation into a cultural, emotional, and curated world.\u201d In truth, Magnifica Air\u2019s success will likely depending heavily on schedules, the airports it selects for those flights, pricing, service where you don\u2019t feel like the enemy, and most importantly on-time performance.  Co-founder and CEO Wade Black says, unlike the other by-the-seat outfits, Magnifica Air will attract business travelers with schedules that enable them to fly out and back on the same day. It has already announced a membership program starting at $14,950 for families and $29,950 for companies. Members will get guaranteed pricing and seats.  Black says think $2,500 each way, New York to Miami. That fits between the $400 to $800 charged by the airlines, $500 to $1,200 on JSX, which operates reconfigured regional jets with extra legroom, Slate, which comes in around $2,000 on similar regional jets, with more spacious seating, and the cost of a six-seat light jet, which would be in the $15,000 range.  One-third (32.9%) of subscribers to Private Jet Card Comparisons who mainly used jet cards, jet flights, and fractional ownership, say they are interested in by-the-seat options while in the buying process. Nearly 90% toggle between the airlines and private jets based on time savings, ability to use more convenient airports, and avoiding connections. Magnifica Air will also have reserve aircraft to backup any mechanical delays, which can be the Achilles heel of the model, not that the regular airlines do an excellent job on rebooking passengers these days.  There\u2019s an old joke in the airline industry. If you want to make a million dollars, start with a billion. Aviation Week reported that Magnifica Air has already raised $150 million to get it going, with plans to attract even more money.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Bitcoin BTC$108,101.57 investors, it\u2019s time to buckle up. Jon Glover, Elliott Wave analyst and Ledn\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, known for his precise market forecasts, is going against the bullish consensus with a stark warning: The bitcoin bull market that began in early 2023 appears to be over following a recent fall from $126,000 to $104,000. Glover now foresees a sustained bear market that could push prices down to $70,000 or lower, a potential drop of more than 35% from the going market rate of around $108,000.  \"I firmly believe we have completed the five-wave upward move and are now entering a bear market that may last until at least late 2026,\" Glover said. \"I expect bitcoin to trade between $70K and $80K, and possibly even lower.\" Glover explained that while the possibility of bitcoin retesting its record highs around $124,000 or climbing slightly higher cannot be ruled out, the broader trend has now flipped bearish, meaning prices are likely to be lower a few months from now. Introduced by Ralph Nelson Elliott in 1938, Elliott Wave Theory is based on the idea that collective investor psychology moves in predictable cycles. These cycles form a five-wave structure in the direction of the main trend, with three impulse waves and two corrective waves. Bitcoin\u2019s bullish five-wave pattern started in late 2022, when prices were below $20,000, culminating with the fifth wave peaking at a record above $126,000 earlier this month. Initially, wave 5 was predicted to bring prices to between $140,000 and $150,000 by year-end. Glover made this call in early August against a backdrop of growing bearish concerns after a sharp dip from $120,000 to $112,000. While prices surged as forecasted, momentum stalled beyond $125,000 this month, prompting Glover to warn that a repeated failure to hold above that level would weaken the bull case. Subsequently, bitcoin tumbled to $105,000 last week, confirming an early end to the bull run. \"Now that we have broken down below $108k, I am ready to make the call as to whether we are on the orange path in the chart below and therefore looking for a move up to $145k, or are on the yellow path, which would mean that we have seen the highs in this market,\" Glover said. \"Here\u2019s my call: THE BULL RUN IN BITCOIN IS OVER!\" The bearish outlook is consistent with bitcoin\u2019s historical trend of peaking and then entering a bear market roughly 18 months after each halving event. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024. Supporting Glover\u2019s bearish sentiment, data from Amberdata shows BTC's Deribit-listed put options, providing downside protection, are trading at a premium compared to calls through the September 2026 expiry. This suggests that some traders are preparing for downside risks extending well into next year.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"NYDIG is calling time on what it says is one of crypto\u2019s most persistent myths: that stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar. In a post-mortem on last week\u2019s $500 billion crypto market sell-off, the bitcoin-focused financial services firm\u2019s Global Head of Research Greg Cipolaro pointed to the instability of supposedly stable assets like USDC, USDT and Ethena\u2019s USDe, which dropped as low as $0.65 on Binance. The price swings revealed that these tokens don\u2019t operate on fixed pegs, but rather that they float based on market supply and demand. \u201cStablecoins are not pegged to $1.00. Period,\u201d NYDIG\u2019s Cipolaro wrote in a research note. \u201cIn reality, stablecoins are market-traded instruments whose prices fluctuate around $1.00 due to trading dynamics.\u201d He argued that terms like \u201cpeg\u201d imply a guarantee that doesn\u2019t exist. What appears to be stability is actually just arbitrage: traders buy when the coin drops below $1 and sell when it rises above, with issuers offering mechanisms to create or redeem tokens in response to those moves. When panic hits, that system can break down. USDT and USDC traded above $1 during the crash, while USDe, which uses derivative positions to stay \u201cdelta-neutral\u201d and generate yield, collapsed. While it fared worse on Binance \u2014 which later compensated users as a result \u2014 it also saw significant drops on other major exchanges. The result, he added, is a fragmented ecosystem where even widely used assets can fail in real-time, and where users misunderstand the actual risks. One outperformer during the crash was the lending markets. Leading DeFi protocol Aave liquidated just $180 million worth of collateral, or 25 bps of its total value locked.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"I met Alina Rotenberg in the summer of 2012. At thirty-six, she was no longer married, but her last name spoke volumes in Moscow: her ex-husband, Igor, was the son of Arkady Rotenberg, one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s childhood friends and judo buddies. There were a lot of women like Alina in Moscow. They were beautiful, their laser-toned skin and ostentatiously luxe clothing advertising their wealth. But, to the city around them, they were only beautiful despite: despite having been cast off, despite being deemed old in their thirties, despite having a \u201ccharacter\u201d\u2014the Russian analogue of \u201cdifficult.\u201d After Putin was elected President in 2000, he went about creating a new oligarchic class, handing out plum no-bid contracts to old friends or members of the government hierarchy. This was how Arkady Rotenberg, Alina\u2019s former father-in-law, became a billionaire. The post-Soviet nomenklatura was not that different from the one it replaced\u2014and that was intentional. Putin had joined the K.G.B. during Leonid Brezhnev\u2019s tenure, in the seventies, and, having used its power structure to reach the country\u2019s upper rungs, he was all too happy to reproduce it. Back were the villas and the apartments, the chauffeurs and the mistresses swaddled in foreign luxury. This time, however, it was on an entirely different scale. Now Russia had access to world markets\u2014a boon for its exports and for its \u00e9lites\u2019 insatiable appetite for real estate and high-end goods. Among Russian women, there was a desperate desire to launch oneself into this gilded stratosphere, which could only be accomplished by snaring a man who hovered there. In the constellation of the Putinist aristocracy, Alina\u2019s last name was a measure of how high she had risen and how far she had fallen. She arrived for our meeting in a white Audi coup\u00e9\u2014her summer car, she told me. (A Range Rover Sport was her chariot of choice for the winter.) She was a striking woman, with dark, expertly curled hair spilling over her shoulders. Her wrist was adorned with a Rolex, her neck and earlobes with diamonds and pearls. It was a steamy late-summer afternoon, but for a former duchess of the new Russian empire there was no skimping on ceremony. In some ways, Alina\u2019s story could have been mine. We were both from Soviet Jewish families, the third generation of women born into a radical social experiment that began when the Bolsheviks seized power and set out to make the traditional bourgeois family obsolete. Vladimir Lenin believed that such families were a prison for women, and his revolutionary comrades\u2014among them, his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya; his mistress Inessa Armand; and his ally Alexandra Kollontai\u2014were assigned the task of freeing them from it. Kollontai, who was the first female cabinet minister in the world, oversaw the most radical reforms. In 1918, Soviet women were given the right to higher education, equal pay, no-fault civil divorce, child support (including for children born out of wedlock), paid maternity leave, and access to free maternity hospitals. In 1920, the Soviet Union legalized abortion. By the time that my mother and Alina\u2019s were born, female illiteracy, the norm in imperial Russia, had been all but eliminated. When Alina and I were born, women constituted more than half of the Soviet workforce and seventy per cent of the country\u2019s doctors. In families like ours, girls were expected to attend university and work. It was a given. Alina was born in Lvov, in Soviet Ukraine, and immigrated to Israel in her teens, when the U.S.S.R. was disintegrating. In Israel, she earned a degree in psychology and sociology from Tel Aviv University, then moved to England, where she studied organizational psychology at the London School of Economics. In London, she ran with a crew of women just like herself: smart, educated twentysomethings who worked in the financial sector as investment bankers and consultants. In 2001, she followed a Russian boyfriend to Moscow. After coming of age around the hard women of Israel and the emancipated ladies of London, she was amazed by the priorities of Russian women. \u201cI see them a lot in the gym, these very obvious one-day butterflies,\u201d Alina told me. \u201cLong, styled hair; very thin. These are physically very attractive girls, usually without any real education, and usually from out of town. You see them one day suddenly drive up in a Bentley, and you think, O.K., she made it.\u201d These were the girls to whom Alina would find herself losing, time and time again, in the city\u2019s fierce battle for men. She eventually left the boyfriend, started working for an oligarch, and, in 2003, married spectacularly well, to Igor Rotenberg. As his father\u2019s wealth grew, Igor was groomed as his heir, and handed state contracts. But Alina couldn\u2019t seem to get the hang of the marital dynamic. \u201cWe had a very good relationship for a long time, until my career took off and I started competing with him for attention,\u201d she said. She had quit her corporate job and, like so many \u00e9lite wives, started an interior-decorating business. She figured that there were now two entrepreneurs in the family, but her husband didn\u2019t see it that way. Even as Igor\u2019s fortune grew, Alina told me, she kept pointing out her achievements and his lack of them. She had been educated abroad at prestigious universities; he had gone to St. Petersburg\u2019s State University of Physical Education. She was sophisticated; he was a jock. \u201cEveryone was looking at him adoringly, and I was constantly haranguing him,\u201d she said. \u201cAt some point, he just got sick of it.\u201d They divorced in 2009. \u201cIt was my fault,\u201d Alina concluded. If she could do it over again, she would change everything. \u201cYou have to protect the male ego very carefully,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s delusional to think that a man needs some kind of exceptional woman. He needs a woman with whom he feels exceptional.\u201d Igor had since remarried, to a woman Alina considered to be of \u201cdubious internal composition.\u201d And yet, \u201cwith her, he feels like a great man,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand this before. I always thought that he\u2019d take joy in my success, that he\u2019d say, \u2018This is my dog. I\u2019m very proud of it. I am its owner.\u2019 But it\u2019s not like that at all.\u201d In fact, Alina said, none of the ultra-wealthy men in her circle had married educated, professional women like her. They married women like Igor\u2019s second wife. Two years after Alina and Igor got married, Igor\u2019s father, Arkady, married a twenty-four-year-old peroxide blonde named Natalia. She was a dance teacher from Kurgan, an impoverished backwater just past the Urals. Natalia had gone from a shabby apartment building to the Moscow and London mansions of one of the richest men in the world. To Alina\u2019s amazement, Natalia, who was five years younger than she was, never seemed self-conscious about her origins. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely confident in the fact that she deserves everything,\u201d Alina said. \u201cSomeone once asked her if she could have ever imagined that she\u2019d have a three-hundred-foot yacht, and she says, \u2018Yes.\u2019 How? How did she imagine it? She\u2019s from a family with many, many kids, and they all lived in a tiny apartment.\u201d Whenever Natalia called her husband, Alina told me, Arkady always answered the phone, even when he was in a meeting with Putin. A trained observer of psychology, Alina had made careful note of the strategies that seemed to work for these gazelle-like young women. For example: \u201cA man values a woman a lot more if she is constantly dragging presents out of him,\u201d she said, \u201cand he values her a lot more than the woman who says, \u2018No, no, no, I don\u2019t need anything.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Alina cradled her teacup, half awestruck. \u201cThey get everything this way,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that these things should be explained to girls in childhood. It\u2019s very important. And it doesn\u2019t matter if the girl is smart or not, because you can have a girl who goes to university and gets a Ph.D. and is tremendously accomplished but then loses to these pretty young things who will take away her husband before she can count to three.\u201d Feeling superior to these women, Alina warned me, was a fool\u2019s comfort. \u201cEveryone makes fun of them because they\u2019re walking around with designer bags with diamond clasps, but things are working out just fine for them,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cThey\u2019re geniuses. Absolute geniuses.\u201d A few months later, on a cool evening in September, I sat cross-legged with a dozen women on the floor of the Academy of Private Life, just off Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Street. Our teacher was Olga Kopylova, a middle-aged psychologist with a blond bob. \u201cA man doesn\u2019t go where he is nagged, he doesn\u2019t go where he is put down, but where he is told that he is exceptional, the god-emperor, the light in the window,\u201d Kopylova said. The Academy of Private Life was holding an open house, and Kopylova and her fellow-instructors were here to explain how these busy Moscow women might find happiness in their personal lives. It was no small task. During the Second World War, some twenty-seven million Soviets were killed, most of them men in prime reproductive age. Hoping to rebuild and repopulate the country, Nikita Khrushchev encouraged women to get married and have as many babies as possible, but there were no men left to marry. Those who had managed to return from the war often came back wounded, both physically and psychologically. These men, too, were encouraged to get married\u2014and stay married. Divorce became much more difficult to obtain. As a result, millions of women had to settle for having children with men who were married to other women\u2014something that the state endorsed. By the twenty-first century, the male population had long since recovered, but there was still a sense, bordering on panic, that good men\u2014single, decent, with well-paying jobs\u2014were an endangered species. As one Russian girlfriend told me, \u201cMen are like public toilets: either taken or shat in.\u201d Many Russian women felt time keenly, as if they knew to the second how long they had until their physical beauty\u2014their main aktiv, one\u2019s chief asset\u2014would cease to be competitive in a cutthroat market. Until then, they capitalized on what nature had given them, investing as much as they could in clothing, makeup, and beauty procedures. (I was often asked by women in Moscow why their American counterparts \u201cdidn\u2019t take care of themselves.\u201d) During the financial crisis of 2008, Russia was the G-20 country hit hardest by the economic collapse, and yet cosmetics sales didn\u2019t budge. Russian politicians, usually male, frequently touted Russian women as the most beautiful in the world, as if they were, like oil and gas, another natural resource to be exploited in the country\u2019s march back to superpower status. Among themselves, Russian women competed fiercely for male commitment\u2014a commodity even rarer than the actual men. Expecting a man to be faithful in a marriage was seen as puritanical and unrealistic; infidelity was just men\u2019s nature, women said, implying that, in this country that had once diverted wild rivers and dried up whole seas, a man\u2019s nature was immutable. If anything, having mistresses was a status symbol: How many women (and love children) could a man afford to maintain? One Moscow banker I knew, who was on his third marriage at thirty-six, told me about a real-estate project that his bank was thinking of financing: an \u00e9lite gated community with ten-million-dollar homes in the center, for the wives and legitimate children, surrounded by a ring of smaller, humbler homes, worth around two million each, for the mistresses and their illegitimate kids. This would be more convenient for everybody, explained the banker, who told me he always vacationed with his wife, two ex-wives, and all their children, even though each successive wife had started out as a mistress. And yet, despite the paltry, tentative prize at the end of this race, it was one that Russian women never stopped running: first to win a husband, then to fend off the other women who were surely scheming to take him from her. The Academy of Private Life was created to serve this demand, which was itself an outgrowth of the failure of the Soviet feminist experiment. By the late nineteen-eighties, Soviet women were accustomed to coming home after a draining work day to run unmechanized households and hunt for vanishingly rare food and clothing for their children, who were primarily their responsibility. These women, in the words of the historian Greta Bucher, \u201chad to perform each of her roles\u2014worker, mother, and homemaker\u2014as if it were her only occupation.\u201d And as if it were her occupation alone. The collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, only accentuated their hardships. Faced with hunger, instability, and salaries that weren\u2019t paid for months, men and women responded differently. Millions of Russian men, unwilling to take on lower-status work, lay down on the couch and took to drink. Women, meanwhile, stepped into the breach. Former school principals scrubbed toilets; physicists became cashiers. As their men fell away\u2014and divorce rates surged\u2014women did whatever they needed to do to feed their families. All of this left many of them dreaming of being a stay-at-home wife supported and protected by a rich and masculine man. As Elena Zdravomyslova, a sociologist and feminist scholar in St. Petersburg, argued, with respect to motherhood and a career, the liberation of women from \u201cthe double burden\u201d can \u201cbe seen, at least in part, as a liberation of women.\u201d This new ideal, which Zdravomyslova called \u201ccivilized patriarchy,\u201d offered the Russian woman many benefits, the chief one being choice. She could, theoretically, stay at home, or she could work for her own pleasure and self-actualization. She could call the reproductive shots while her husband earned the money, shielding her from the harsh reality of the Russian workplace. A family with one breadwinner is \u201call people dream of here, because they never had it,\u201d Zdravomyslova said. A hundred years after Kollontai and Lenin railed against traditional, economically motivated marriage, it had become women\u2019s ultimate fantasy. At the Academy of Private Life, Kopylova explained how that fantasy could be fulfilled. Every woman, Kopylova said, cycled through four states of being: the little girl, the seductress, the queen, and the khozayka, or the mistress of the house. What did it mean, Kopylova asked her students, if a man stopped giving you gifts? \u201cIt means the state of the little girl is suffering, that the girl isn\u2019t present enough,\u201d she declared. \u201cBecause the girl moves the man to action, to feats of chivalry.\u201d Or, Kopylova asked, what if you were able to attract a man but not keep him? That was obviously the weakening of your internal khozayka. \u201cThis is a man,\u201d Kopylova said, holding up a dry-erase marker to signify a phallus. She wrapped her manicured hand tightly around it. \u201cA man has a special little device that shows his vector, his direction. So if he suddenly finds some woman attractive, his little device immediately shows him what direction to move in.\u201d But it was possible, Kopylova explained, to confuse a man\u2019s little device. \u201cWhen we keep saying, \u2018I\u2019ll do it myself,\u2019 or when we give him advice\u2014stupid advice, let\u2019s be honest\u2014a man interprets it as you taking a sickle to his balls.\u201d A woman who was too headstrong, Kopylova said, risked turning her feminine energy into masculine energy. \u201cA man can see, on an intuitive level, that you have a member and he has a member,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you have sex with him? You can\u2019t!\u201d Of course, the expert teachers of the school were happy to guide women back to a true feminine balance. The Academy of Private Life, which claims to have served more than a hundred and fifty thousand women, has several national outposts and a large syllabus of classes: Flirtation from A to Z, The Art of Walking Beautifully, Mysteries of the Jade Cave: How to Use Your Intimate Muscles, How to Play the Magic Flute: The Art of Fellatio. (These last two offerings aroused the most interest during the open house.) In all of the courses, the pedagogy is an awkward pastiche of traditions, combining Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Slavic paganism, Siberian shamanism, and Asian spiritual practices, spiked with elements of Jungian and American pop psychology. After explaining the four feminine states, Kopylova revealed that an imbalance could be corrected only by realigning one\u2019s chakras, an ancient Hindu concept. \u201cI had one young woman who really wanted to give her boyfriend an expensive new car,\u201d Kopylova said, illustrating how an errant chakra could backfire. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s your choice, but if you give a man expensive presents then you are definitely not his girlfriend. You are his mommy, and men don\u2019t want to sleep with their mothers.\u201d By the end of the session, she was pitching the women on a very handy dildo, which was for sale at the academy for just twenty-two hundred rubles\u2014perfect for practice in the Magic Flute class. One evening not long after the open house, I stopped by the Academy of Private Life to interview its founder. Larisa Renar was soft-spoken, with dyed copper hair and big blue eyes. She wore a long, diaphanous dress and the Medallion of Women\u2019s Strength\u2014a filigreed pendant, worn by many of the academy\u2019s instructors, with four gemstones that represent the four states of femininity. As Renar poured me tea, I asked why she had opened the academy, back in 2000. \u201cI think the real problem is that modern society, not just in Russia but in the whole world, forces women to live according to male standards: to be like a man, to act like a man, to look like a man,\u201d she began. In Russia, this problem was especially acute. \u201cWomen carry all the responsibility,\u201d she explained. \u201cA woman makes all the decisions. She makes the money. And in Russia a lot of women are too active, too independent. It\u2019s related to historical events, to wars and revolutions when men were killed and women had no choice but to take on leadership roles. My generation of women, the ones born in the sixties\u2014it really is easier for us to do everything ourselves and not depend on the men.\u201d I told Renar that I had to agree with her. By that point, I\u2019d been living in Russia for several years, and had been dating a Russian man for some time. This particular man gave me flowers and paid me poignant compliments; he held the door and pulled out my chair in restaurants. By all outward appearances, he was successful and handsome, but with me he was a needy and manipulative child. His inability to make hard decisions or abstain from becoming a maudlin, clingy drunk had transformed me from his girlfriend and lover into his mother and disciplinarian. I hated myself for what I had become with him: a scold, a jealous girlfriend who waited for him to fall asleep so I could read through his phone, a woman angry and bitter beyond my years. And yet I knew that, in Moscow, he was the best that I could get. Other women openly pined for him; one tried to kiss him in public. \u201cMen don\u2019t grow on trees,\u201d my grandmother chided whenever I despaired at his behavior. Plus, as she and my Russian girlfriends pointed out, he really loved me. What did it matter that I no longer loved him? Many of those Russian girlfriends believed my problems would vanish if I simply married him and had a child. \u201cYou can always get divorced!\u201d my grandmother said, by way of reassurance. After all, I was nearing thirty and, apparently, the end of my life. \u201cYes, men have been ground down,\u201d Renar said. \u201cThis situation when a woman is strong, and not in a feminine way but a masculine one, and a man is weak\u2014this role reversal is what has led to women\u2019s unhappiness.\u201d The solution, as Renar outlined in her 2015 book, \u201cMake Your Husband a Millionaire,\u201d is to channel your feminine energy into inspiring your man to become wealthy and successful. Renar is herself a successful businesswoman, and she told me that she thinks it\u2019s wonderful for women to have careers. But she was also wary of modern feminism, because it destroyed the natural equilibrium between the sexes. \u201cA man gives us women a home, physical protection, and a woman gives him pleasure, enjoyment of sex, beauty,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we should be ready to follow our man, to say, \u2018You\u2019re the boss, you\u2019re right.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Eleonora and Leyla never attended the Academy of Private Life, but they understood its teachings instinctively. Like me, they were both born in 1982; Leyla in Ufa, the capital of the Soviet Republic of Bashkortostan, Eleonora in what was then Leningrad. They came from the Soviet middle class, from families of engineers and accountants and factory workers who, in the stagnation of the eighties, found themselves to be, practically, rather poor. Both women had provincial lives, until they met men significantly older than themselves. Leyla\u2019s was a Frenchman, an art collector twice her age, who picked her up in one of Moscow\u2019s posh night clubs and began to educate her intensively. There were days in Parisian galleries and museums, quizzes at night. \u201cLike Pygmalion,\u201d Leyla told me. Eleonora met the scion of a celebrity Moscow family in St. Petersburg. He taught her about luxury hotels, about fine dining and silk napkins. \u201cLike \u2018Pretty Woman,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Eleonora recalled. After Leyla and the Frenchman parted ways, she made use of that education and became an interior designer, the universal profession of a glamorous Russian devushka. Although she loved her work, she craved the economic security of marriage, and found it in record time. After meeting a charming man through a friend, she quickly determined that he ticked most of her boxes. Ten days later, he proposed. How did she do it? \u201cI think that my abilities helped me: conviction, marketing, management,\u201d Leyla said. \u201cI successfully advertised myself and was able to show myself in a positive light.\u201d If it had been love with the Frenchman, Leyla admitted, this relationship was \u201ccold calculation.\u201d And yet things hadn\u2019t turned out as she had hoped. When we met, she showed me around the well-decorated apartment she shared with her husband, who was also her boss in the design business they ran together. He wasn\u2019t home, and he\u2019d been gone all summer, though he sometimes called to remind her that he owed her nothing. Recounting this, Leyla, who had told me she strived to be \u201ca flinty woman\u201d like Margaret Thatcher, began to cry. \u201cWhen I got married, I was hoping for solid ground under my feet, a husband as my shoulder, and I\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married for two years, and for the last six months I\u2019ve been realizing that there\u2019s only me, my work, my brains, my ambition, and that\u2019s it. There is absolutely nothing around me.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure that she was ready for divorce. The women in her circle who had found rich husbands \u201cwill absolutely stay with them,\u201d she said, even if these husbands openly cheated or had families with their lovers. Her friends took lovers, too, usually men over whom they had some power: bodyguards, drivers, or hachiki, a racial slur for men from the Muslim North Caucasus. Leyla gave a generalized description of a man in this vein\u2014perhaps named Mahmoud, perhaps from Dagestan. One such man told her that he looked for women like her friends: rich, married, and neglected. They were perfectly low-maintenance, he said, and they wanted only one thing from him. Alina Rotenberg also remarked that several of her friends, even those married to Forbes-listed billionaires, liked to play around with the occasional Mahmoud. Eleonora, who I chatted with over coffee at a Moscow restaurant, at first appeared to be an anomaly, in that she was still unmarried at the advanced age of twenty-nine. A pink-cheeked real-estate broker, she had spent the morning examining an out-of-town warehouse in heels and an elegant cashmere sweater. In Moscow, real estate can be a strikingly lucrative career, and Eleonora was in no rush to get married. But when the time came, she said, she wanted a man who was \u201cstronger\u201d\u2014by which she meant a man who earned more money than she did. \u201cIt is the nature of Russian women to be protected behind a man\u2019s back no matter how successful they are,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a man, then the woman will always prefer to be No. 2.\u201d This was strange to hear. Eleonora reminded me of my girlfriends back in New York: beautiful, intelligent, and ambitious, someone who loved her career and made a fabulously good living doing it. But, unlike them, she would gladly give it all up in an instant. Renar would have approved, I thought. I first met Renar just a few months after Putin won his third Presidential term. He has held on to the throne ever since, weaving a legitimizing ideology of traditional gender norms, Orthodox Christianity, and Russian neo-imperialism. In recent years, the \u201cglobal L.G.B.T. movement\u201d has been declared an extremist one, putting gay Russians on par with ISIS terrorists. Abortions have become harder to obtain, while domestic violence has been decriminalized. Putin\u2019s cabinet ministers now encourage young women to forgo higher education and have babies\u2014as many of them as possible. As Putin has sent hundreds of thousands of men to die trying to conquer Ukraine, he has reintroduced Stalin\u2019s Order of Maternal Glory, military-style honors for women who produce an eye-popping number of children. (Stalin himself borrowed the idea from Nazi Germany.) In the militant revanche of the late Putin era, men are men, women are women, and the men are in charge. This doesn\u2019t seem so distant from Renar\u2019s vision, but when I met her again, in 2015, I discovered that she had struggled to apply her teachings to her own life. She had once had a marriage that most Russian women only dream of. Her husband was a handsome and intelligent older man, a pioneer in the post-Soviet advertising market. He had helped her achieve her dream of getting into a psychology Ph.D. program, and bought her a building in St. Petersburg to house the business that eventually became the Academy of Private Life. And yet she hadn\u2019t been happy. On the scale of love that she had developed, the fifth and highest level described two people who love each other so completely that their hearts block their bodies from lusting after anyone else. Most love in the world falls short of that ideal, Renar told me. She and her husband\u2019s love, for instance, had been on the second level, when you choose your mate not with your heart but with your head. At this level, Renar explained, your desire for others does not disappear. And so he had affairs, she had affairs, and in this way they were just like so many other Russian couples \u201cwho are always searching for someone better, constantly scanning the options,\u201d Renar said. As the academy had flourished, Renar had increasingly questioned her marriage. \u201cI thought, My God, how is this happening?\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019m smart, I\u2019m beautiful, I\u2019m sexy, I\u2019ve learned every sexual technique I can think of. I\u2019m trying to develop myself. I\u2019m doing everything for our family.\u201d When she asked her husband for a divorce, he thought it was foolishness. This was as close to happiness as any married couple could get in Russia. Asking for more could lead only to being alone, a far worse fate for a Russian woman than being unhappy. But he complied. When I last spoke to her, Renar was dating a man a decade her junior, which clearly delighted her. \u201cI think I will get married again, absolutely,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd I will only marry a man not because he loves me, or because he checks the boxes on some checklist, but only when, inside of myself, I will have that knowledge that this man is the best man for me.\u201d\u00a0\u2666 This is drawn from \u201cMotherland: A Feminist History of Modern Russia, from Revolution to Autocracy.\u201d The case for not being born. The sorrow and shame of the accidental killer. Notes from Prince Harry\u2019s ghostwriter. How I learned to cycle like a Dutchman. A guide to getting rid of almost everything.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":" Finding a soundbar that delivers cinematic audio without clashing with your living room d\u00e9cor feels impossible most of the time. Most options either look like industrial equipment or sacrifice acoustic performance for sleeker aesthetics. Design lovers and audiophiles end up compromising, choosing between sound quality and visual harmony rather than getting both in a single package. The KEF XIO Soundbar addresses this frustration through a collaboration between Andrea Ponti Studio and KEF\u2019s product design team. The result merges high-fidelity acoustic engineering with a minimalist, architectural presence that feels equally at home below a television or mounted flush against a wall in contemporary living spaces. Designer: Andrea Ponti for KEF        The rectilinear form emerged from extensive exploration of potential shapes, chosen specifically for its ability to maximize internal acoustic volume while maintaining a minimal footprint. This geometric clarity gives the soundbar a timeless, architectural quality rather than the overtly technical appearance that characterizes most home theater equipment currently on the market. The frameless construction stands out immediately with large, continuous fabric surfaces wrapping the front and sides. This approach conceals the drivers while creating a cohesive, controlled aesthetic that softens the visual impact. The dual-tone fabric weave adds subtle depth and texture, making the soundbar feel more like furniture than electronics sitting in your entertainment center.        Material choices demonstrate thoughtful attention to both visual and tactile experience. The top panel is crafted from sandblasted aluminum that extends horizontally with a gentle chamfer around the center driver. This detail softens the transition between materials while adding a premium feel that rewards closer inspection beyond initial impressions from across the room.  The domed touch controls on the aluminum panel provide intuitive interaction through tactile feedback that feels natural and precise. Subtle LED indicators communicate volume levels and source selection without disrupting the visual harmony or creating distracting light pollution during movie watching or music listening sessions in darkened rooms.   KEF\u2019s acoustic engineering powers the experience with support for Dolby Atmos and 5.1.2 spatial audio that creates genuinely immersive, three-dimensional soundscapes. The proprietary Music Integrity Engine delivers hyper-realistic sound reproduction with crystal-clear dialogue and vocals, managing phase, timing, and distortion for seamless, lifelike audio whether you\u2019re watching films or streaming music.   Versatile placement options allow the XIO to sit on credenza surfaces or mount directly to walls, adapting to different room layouts and furniture arrangements with equal effectiveness. The available colorways, Silver Grey and Slate Black, offer choices between light and dark tones that complement various interior design schemes without demanding attention or clashing with existing furniture and fixtures.   The low-contrast, tonal palette and understated design philosophy ensure the soundbar complements rather than competes with existing home environments. The combination of sandblasted metal and premium fabric creates visual balance while celebrating simplicity, making the XIO feel like a natural extension of thoughtfully designed interiors.  The KEF XIO Soundbar represents what happens when acoustic engineering and industrial design receive equal priority throughout the entire development process. By blending high-fidelity audio performance with tactile materials and timeless geometry, it delivers an upgrade that enhances both how your home sounds and how it looks, proving that uncompromising quality is possible.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Crypto\u2019s year-end setup still skews positive, according to Coinbase Institutional\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025 \u201cCharting Crypto: Navigating Uncertainty\u201d report produced in collaboration with Glassnode. The team characterizes its stance as cautious but biased higher after the Oct. 10 shakeout. Coinbase links the slide to heavy leverage meeting thin order books, then worsening when some exchanges\u2019 auto-deleveraging capped market-maker shorts and drained liquidity. The firm says prices stabilized into the weekend, but the tape stayed tentative as macro jitters resurfaced. Liquidity and macro sit at the center of Coinbase\u2019s outlook.  The firm\u2019s Global M2 Money Supply Index \u2014 which Coinbase says has historically tracked bitcoin and tends to lead by roughly 110 days \u2014 began the quarter in a supportive posture, though the report warns conditions could tighten later in Q4. Coinbase also anticipates two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts before year-end, a shift it believes could coax some cash out of money-market funds and back toward risk. Policy and market plumbing round out what Coinbase calls a constructive setup.  The report highlights stablecoin supply and monthly volumes at or near record levels \u2014 evidence, in Coinbase\u2019s telling, that more payments and transfers are moving on-chain. It also notes that U.S. spot ETF infrastructure for bitcoin and ether continues to deepen, improving access for traditional allocators and strengthening market depth. These developments, Coinbase argues, are less about headlines and more about rails that keep usage and liquidity flowing through volatility. On positioning, Coinbase favors bitcoin, citing its \u201cdigital gold\u201d role amid persistent doubts about fiscal and monetary discipline. The report says ether looks constructive as well: scaling progress has pushed more activity to layer-2 networks while fees have fallen, and sentiment has improved since earlier in the year. An investor survey included in the report shows a majority of institutions bullish on BTC over the next three to six months, even as many flagged the macro backdrop as the top risk. Coinbase devotes space to digital-asset treasury companies (DATs), describing them as meaningful, relatively steady buyers of BTC and ETH. The firm says that the cohort now holds a notable share of the circulating supply and remains an important source of demand. At the same time, Coinbase acknowledges open questions around long-run business models \u2014 particularly after recent equity-market weakness in the group. The report does not dismiss near-term hazards. Coinbase flags missing U.S. data tied to the government shutdown, the chance that liquidity fades in November and uncertainty around DATs as reasons to keep sizing and time horizons disciplined.  Even so, the bottom line from Coinbase Institutional is steady: liquidity conditions, policy progress and expanding on-chain usage \u2014 led by stablecoins and maturing ETF plumbing \u2014 remain supportive into year-end, with bitcoin best placed to lead if those supports hold.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Ethereum ETH$3,941.99 emerged as the frontrunner in crypto\u2019s third-quarter recovery, leaving bitcoin BTC$108,101.57 behind as capital flowed into altcoins, DeFi protocols, and a new wave of tokenized assets, a report by CoinCecko found. The broader market added over half a trillion dollars in value, its second straight quarter of meaningful growth, but this time, it wasn\u2019t bitcoin leading the charge. Instead, investors looked to ethereum ETH$3,941.99 and other large-cap tokens to carry momentum forward, a report by CoinCecko found. At the start of July, it looked like bitcoin would again set the pace. Its price hit new highs early in the quarter, buoyed by retail interest and institutional inflows through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  But by September, the narrative had changed. While bitcoin cooled off, ether caught fire. A combination of ETF demand, growing interest in tokenized real-world assets, and renewed attention from corporate treasuries helped ETH hit a fresh all-time high before settling back. That shift in focus was one of the quarter\u2019s defining trends, analysts at CoinGecko wrote. Trading activity, which had fallen for two straight quarters, snapped back with strength. Spot volumes surged across centralized and decentralized exchanges. But the story wasn\u2019t just about volume, it was about where that volume was going. Meme coins, long considered fringe, made a dramatic return with tokens like M climbing the charts. Stablecoins like USDe gained ground, and lesser-known altcoins entered the top 30 by market cap. DeFi, which had faded from the spotlight in late 2024, mounted a comeback as total value locked in lending and staking protocols climbed alongside Ethereum\u2019s rise, according to the report. Behind the scenes, structural shifts were taking shape.  Bitcoin\u2019s share of the total crypto market declined, a sign that investor appetite had moved toward other narratives. Ethereum gained ground, but so did categories that had struggled to break through in previous years, particularly tokenized assets. A new generation of on-chain stocks and bonds began to take hold, and protocols like Ondo and Backed Finance gained traction with investors looking to bridge traditional and decentralized finance. Bitcoin also became less tied to legacy markets. Its price movement decoupled from the S&P 500 for the first time in over a year. That could be read as a positive, the report stated, and proof that crypto is becoming a more independent asset class. But it also reflects how investor attention has fragmented, the report stated. Even the mining sector reflected this changing dynamic. Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate hit record highs, and miner-focused ETFs posted strong returns.  However, the spotlight was elsewhere: on emerging tokens, Ethereum\u2019s momentum, and the rebirth of DeFi, the report found.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Despite moving back with her parents to save for a home, one young person described the situation as \"impossible\". The Chartered Institute of Housing said Wales was in the middle of a \"deepening housing emergency\" and more needed to be done. Ministers have put more than \u00a32bn into social housing and have set a target of 20,000 homes being built in this Senedd term.  However, figures from housing charity Shelter Cymru earlier this year revealed that up to 94,000 households, or 177,000 people, were waiting for a home, with about 55,000 children part of this number.  At Dinas, a few miles outside Caernarfon, Gwynedd, the Adra housing association is putting up 30 new homes.  It already looks after about 7,000 properties in the area, and says some of the new-builds will be affordable properties and others are for social housing.  But the development does not fill young people on the streets of Caernarfon with any great hope.  \"I've moved back in with my parents now to try and save up for a house but it's difficult, especially being on minimum wage... it's just impossible,\" said Bethan Owen.  For Leah Jones, the issue was not even necessarily the availability of enough properties to go around.  \"I think there are probably issues with the private sector as well, with landlords charging really high rents that people can't afford,\" she said.  \"I think it's a bigger social issue than just housing stock. \"People not having good enough wages, not being able to buy their own homes.\" Ifor Jones, from Llanrug, believes the situation is dire for people of all ages.  \"I imagine it's difficult for young people, but probably more difficult for families,\" he said. \"Because obviously with families if you've got two or three children you need more than young people in my opinion.\" Adra's chief executive Iwan Trefor Jones said Welsh government money to help with new-builds was crucial.  \"The Social Housing Grant is a very important source of funding for us to deliver schemes like this, and that grant has increased significantly over the last two to three years, to around \u00a3450m by now, but we still need more,\" he said.  \"The demand is there, and we could do more schemes if we received more funding.\" According to Shelter Cymru, that demand is fuelled through 94,000 households waiting to be homed, which is why the Chartered institute of Housing's Matt Dicks calls it a \"deepening housing emergency\".  \"We're simply not building at the pace and scale we need to, we haven't got the structure to the housing system that we need in order to deliver that fundamental right of a home for everyone,\" he said.  \"It's about one-bed accommodation, because a lot of young people can't access housing.  \"It's about rebalancing that tenure to provide a housing system that can cope with demand of all types of housing.\" He believes everything is interlinked in this crisis, including the so-called property ladder - where people move up to bigger houses as they get older, or start a family.  \"We don't look at the housing system as a one system approach,\" added Mr Dicks. \"We need to start doing that and until we start doing that, we're not really going to touch the sides in terms of getting to root of the problem.\" In response, the Welsh government said: \"Making sure everyone in Wales has a decent, affordable and safe place to call home is a priority. \"Despite unprecedented economic challenges, we've invested more than \u00a32bn this Senedd term in social housing and are seeing some of our highest delivery rates in almost 20 years. \"We recognise the increase in demand for social housing. The Homelessness and Social Housing Allocation (Wales) Bill sets out proposals to maximise use of social housing for those most in housing need, including those who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\" The Welsh Conservatives' housing spokesperson Joel James said the Welsh government \"continues to miss its 20,000 affordable homes target\". He blamed local development plans being out of date and housebuilders being faced with \"overly complex regulations\". \"This consistent failure has now meant that available housing in Wales is at crisis point, leaving many people unable to find homes that they can afford,\" he added. Plaid Cymru's housing spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian believes the problem is growing. \"Housing is probably about half of the casework we deal with in my constituency and talking to other members of the Senedd it's the same across Wales,\" she said.  \"People are living in flats which are not suitable for their needs, there's mouldy conditions, we see that.  \"We see families who may have a child with special needs being cooped up in a tiny flat with no space for that family to use outside.\" She also highlighted \"soaring\" rents, adding: \"We have an emergency here, but it's not being taken seriously enough, and hasn't been taken seriously enough for 26 years.\" If approved the development will bring 14 new apartments close to the city centre. Arun District Council has deferred the decision over concerns about affordable properties. A derelict property in Ashford is soon to be replaced by 34 new apartments. Woking Borough Council said it will introduce the scheme in January 2026. The homes could be on three acres of farmland, between Mappenors Lane and the Kenwater river. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByBill Stone, Contributor. The third-quarter earnings season begins its third-busiest week, which includes an earnings report from one of the Magnificent 7. 88 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Coca-Cola (KO), 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), and Procter & Gamble (PG). With relatively few companies reporting so far, 86% have beaten consensus earnings estimates. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500\u2019s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 8.5% year-over-year, above the expectations of 7.9% at the end of the quarter. The expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 11.0%, and for 2026, it is 13.9%. A strong start to earnings season helped lift the S&P 500 last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. Bank earnings were well above expectations, sending the expected year-over-year earnings growth rate for the financials sector to 18.2%. However, there was a scare after some smaller banks, Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), reported loan fraud. Additionally, JPMorgan\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, warned of \u201ccockroaches\u201d in the credit market on his earnings conference call. The mega-banks, JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), can offset small loan losses thanks to robust trading and investment banking revenues. Still, the smaller regional banks don\u2019t have that luxury, causing the regional bank stock index to plunge while the large bank index is sharply higher for the year. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7 are expected to grow earnings by 14.9% year-over-year in the third quarter, while the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 should grow at 6.7%. The first of the Magnificent 7, Tesla (TSLA), is scheduled to report results this week. According to FactSet data, the positive earnings surprises by Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Travelers Companies (TRV), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 last week. The blended earnings growth rate for the financials sector increased to 18.2% from 13.2%. The energy sector is expected to experience the most significant year-over-year earnings decline due to lower oil prices. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. If the third-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth estimate of 4.8% is correct, there could be downside to expected sales growth. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 6.6% is above expectations. Consistent with the earnings picture, energy-sector revenues should see the most significant year-over-year decline. The US dollar weakened relative to the same quarter last year. On the margin, this should benefit companies\u2019 international earnings. According to FactSet, 41% of S&P 500 sales are from international sources. With almost no US economic releases on the calendar due to the government shutdown, the focus will be on earnings. In addition to being the third-busiest week of earnings reports this season, the breadth of companies reporting is expanding further beyond the banks. Despite the lack of government economic reports and the government shutdown, the economy is holding up just fine, with the betting odds of a US recession in 2025 falling to 5%. Economic and market sentiment was helped last week by President Trump indicating that the massive tariffs on China were unsustainable and Fed Chair Powell reinforcing the case for two more rate cuts this year. As the earnings season heats up beyond the financials, earnings will be monitored closely. Given the additional economic visibility issues due to the government shutdown, forward earnings guidance from management will be even more closely watched.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. In October 2025, a revealing quote surfaced from Ken Griffin: General AI, he said, \u201cfails to help hedge funds produce alpha.\u201d That\u2019s not the kind of statement you see in the press often. A prominent financial visionary has openly questioned the fundamental promise of the newest trend in finance. However, upon closer examination, this statement also serves as a cautionary tale for investors who are still chasing alpha.  Because here\u2019s what Griffin\u2019s line signals: Markets may already be pricing in too much expectation regarding disruption. Easy gains (the ones you can capture via momentum or thematic exposure) are growing more contested. When the narrative drives the trade, profit margins decrease. That\u2019s where special situations, spinoffs, breakups, and carve-outs reassert their relevance. Unlike thematic bets, the value of special situations is rooted in structural change and inefficiency, rather than consensus momentum. At The Edge, we believe the future of alpha lies less in hype and more in the gaps between story and structure. Generative AI has its place. It can accelerate research, clean up noisy data, and help analysts move faster through the monotony of information gathering. But that\u2019s operational efficiency, not alpha. The mistake many funds make is that they assume that speed and automation will somehow produce differentiated returns. They don\u2019t. What we\u2019re seeing instead is the mass commoditization of processes. Everyone is building off similar models, scraping the same filings, and summarizing the same earnings calls. The result? Convergent thinking disguised as innovation. GenAI doesn\u2019t interpret regime shifts. It doesn\u2019t recognize when a CEO is under pressure or when a spinoff\u2019s incentives have quietly changed. It can\u2019t detect misalignment between what management says and what they do. These are behavioral signals, not data points. In many ways, GenAI is becoming a consensus amplifier. It reflects the market\u2019s assumptions faster but rarely challenges them. And that\u2019s where it fails to deliver alpha. Excess return has never been about understanding what the market already knows. It\u2019s about spotting what it hasn\u2019t priced. Insight comes from dislocation, from asymmetry, from context. AI gives you summaries. It doesn\u2019t give you structure. And when the edge lies in nuance, speed without interpretation is just noise. If If AI is becoming the new baseline, then real alpha exists in the areas that the market still overlooks.at edge exists inside structural inefficiencies, not in faster processing of the same information. Spinoffs, breakups, and carve-outs are prime examples. These events are not born from optimism. They are born from pressure. A parent company is forced to act, whether due to regulatory constraints, activist demands, or balance sheet repair. That urgency creates disruption. It triggers index exclusions, mandated selling, and temporary confusion. What follows is not efficient repricing but a vacuum. New companies come to market with no analyst coverage, no models, and very little institutional understanding. Investors sit back, unsure of what they are even looking at. That is where opportunity lives. These situations create dislocations that are mechanical, not narrative-driven. There is no story to chase because the story has not been written yet. You are buying misunderstood change before the structure becomes obvious. Management incentives often shift overnight. Operational clarity improves. Once the market catches up, the discount has already narrowed. These setups are not about sentiment. They are about sequence. While the world focuses on headline themes and macro noise, spinoffs reward those who understand alignment, timing, and quiet dislocation. This is where alpha still lives, patiently compounding in the background. At The Edge, we have spent more than two decades studying spinoffs across industries, geographies, and cycles. What we\u2019ve learned is that their outperformance is not random or dependent on sentiment. It is repeatable because the same structural forces continue to create the same inefficiencies. When a parent company sheds a division, the initial move is not driven by investor enthusiasm. It is driven by necessity. A regulatory push, balance sheet stress, or activist involvement forces the decision. That urgency leads to selling, not buying. Index funds drop the spin because they no longer fit their mandate. Institutional holders offload it because it is too small or unfamiliar. Liquidity providers exist. This flood of mechanical selling happens before the market ever stops to evaluate the business on its own terms. What follows is silence. Most spinoffs arrive in the public market without coverage. There are no earnings models, no consensus targets, and no sell-side initiation notes. The absence of a framework leaves institutional investors in a temporary void. This scenario is when informed capital has an advantage. With no crowd, no narrative, and no anchor, early analysis matters more than ever. Inside the business, the shift is equally powerful. The same management that once operated under a conglomerate now has full accountability. The success of the newly independent company, not the broader parent, determines their compensation. That alignment changes how decisions are made. Strategy sharpens. Capital is allocated more efficiently. Operations become visible. Spinoffs offer line-of-sight results. Financials are cleaner. Growth drivers are easier to see. And once the market catches up, the mispricing closes quickly. But by then, the advantage has already shifted to those who understood the structure from the start. A live example of how structural alpha plays out is our position in Western Digital and its subsequent spinoff, SanDisk. We entered WDC pre-spin on January 3, 2025, at $64.07, anticipating the breakup under pressure from Elliott Management and other shareholders. The move was not a creative capital allocation decision. It was a forced structural correction after years of strategic inefficiency. That\u2019s what made it investable. The market reacted predictably. Passive flows rebalanced. Index funds adjusted. Analysts were slow to initiate coverage. But we understood the setup early. We held SanDisk post-spin, and to date, that position has returned 115 percent. During the same period, the S&P 500 returned just 12 percent. That\u2019s 103 percent of clean outperformance, not driven by hype, but by structural change the market hadn\u2019t priced. We doubled down on April 8, issuing another Buy call on WDC in our \u201c8 Fallen Breakups\u201d report at $31.55. That trade has now delivered 233 percent. The thesis wasn\u2019t complicated. Capital was misallocated, structure was broken, and the separation created visibility and accountability. Alpha followed. These stories are common. They are just rarely understood in time. When structure shifts before the narrative forms, that\u2019s where you want to be. At The Edge, we don\u2019t follow narratives. We focus on structure. Our process starts by identifying dislocation situations where the company is pressured to act, not choosing to. That includes regulatory mandates, balance sheet constraints, board friction, or activist involvement. When those catalysts converge, we take notice. We monitor potential spinoffs well in advance of their announcement. We study parent structures, carve-out financials, and management signals. We model the businesses independently and map where incentives are likely to shift post-separation. We do not wait for consensus or coverage. By the time the sell side initiates or index funds rebalance, the opportunity has already moved. Our position size is built around asymmetry, not certainty. We\u2019re not trying to be right on every trade; we\u2019re trying to be early when the market is still uncertain. That\u2019s where the edge lies. When structure changes quietly, and no one is paying attention, disciplined preparation creates outperformance. This is not a one-off strategy. It\u2019s a repeatable framework. And we\u2019ve seen it work across geographies, sectors, and cycles, because inefficiency isn\u2019t a theme. It\u2019s a constant. When thematic trades dominate the market, portfolios begin to blur. Everyone eventually adopts the same names: AI, cloud, semis, and other common names. Correlation increases, conviction dilutes, and true differentiation disappears. In that environment, outperforming becomes less about the next idea and more about the next structure the market has overlooked. Spinoffs offer something most trades can\u2019t: uncorrelated alpha tied to internal corporate change, not external macro cycles. They aren\u2019t driven by inflation expectations, rate pivots, or sentiment whiplash. They are mechanical, behavioral, and repeatable. Forced flows create mispricing. Lack of coverage creates opportunity. Incentive realignment drives performance. And when the rest of the market is late, you already own the move. For fund managers, this matters. Allocators are no longer impressed by exposure to consensus themes. They want to see the process. They want to see repeatable frameworks that capture what others miss. Special situations allow managers to demonstrate foresight, not because they predicted the future, but because they understood structure before the story unfolded. That\u2019s what builds trust. That\u2019s what compounds over time. And that\u2019s why, in a crowded field, this part of the market still quietly separates the good from the average. The window on a spinoff is never open for long. Once coverage picks up and the story gets modeled, the mispricing begins to tighten. What was once an opportunity becomes a narrative. And by then, the edge has shifted to someone else. Currently, we\u2019re seeing spin candidates with all the ingredients: forced divestitures, mandate-driven selling, minimal analyst attention, and fresh incentive structures. These are the setups that don\u2019t just offer return. They offer a return with insulation from the noise. The question isn\u2019t whether spinoffs work. The question is whether you\u2019re early enough to benefit from why they work. This is where Alpha still exists. If AI is no longer producing alpha, the answer isn\u2019t to wait. It\u2019s to pivot toward what still compounds quietly while the rest of the market chases headlines. Because by the time it becomes obvious, the asymmetry is already gone.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"BySachin H. Jain, Contributor. Open Enrollment is upon us \u2014 and across the country, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are in more flux than usual. Premiums are up, benefits are changing, and members are expected to switch plans at record rates. Why? As someone who leads a nonprofit Medicare Advantage plan, I\u2019ve seen the market pressures up close. Here are five reasons the industry is struggling \u2014 and why this year\u2019s Open Enrollment period likely feels different to consumers.   For more than a decade, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \u201cStar Ratings\u201d program has served as the industry\u2019s north star. These 1-to-5 star ratings are not just symbols of quality \u2014 they\u2019re tied directly to plan revenues. When star ratings drop, bonus payments decline, and so do the resources plans can use to fund benefits and reduce premiums.  In some geographies, the difference between 3 Star Revenue can be close to $150.   In recent years, CMS has tightened scoring methodologies, raised performance thresholds, and changed the relative weighting of measures that are difficult to control (like member experience scores). As a result, even historically strong plans are seeing their ratings \u2014 and, because ratings are tied to revenues, their margins \u2014 fall. For Medicare beneficiaries, that can mean fewer benefits and narrower networks. For plans, it\u2019s a fight to maintain quality and affordability amid a moving target.  CMS recently completed a three-year phase-in of the v28 risk adjustment model, which recalibrates how plans are paid based on the health status of their members. The goal: to ensure more accurate payments and reduce gaming by which doctors and health plans aggressively documented codes that might not be truly correlated with her costs. The result: significant revenue compression, especially for plans that had invested heavily in coding and care management infrastructure. In some geographies, the shift has produced payment reductions exceeding 20% for both plans and the provider groups that serve their members. While the intention may be to make payments more equitable, the real-world effect is that many plans are being forced to cut benefits or absorb losses just to stay competitive.  Across the industry, medical utilization is higher than expected. Seniors are presenting with more complex conditions \u2014 often deferring care during the pandemic \u2014 and are now accessing care at rates above actuarial estimates. Hospital admissions, skilled nursing stays, behavioral health visits, and high-cost specialty drugs are all higher than expected. For plans, these costs are largely unavoidable. The math is simple: when utilization increases but payments are flat or declining, margins disappear. Many actuaries and CFOs underestimated just how much pent-up demand would persist in 2024 and 2025. The result has been a painful recalibration of what \u201cnormal\u201d looks like\u2014and many managed care companies are choosing to leave Medicare Advantage altogether, pushing seniors to find new plans this annual enrollment period.  Over the past decade, supplemental benefits \u2014 things like dental, vision, hearing, grocery allowances, and Part B cash rebates \u2014 have become the marketing centerpiece of Medicare Advantage. These benefits help drive enrollment, but they also cost real dollars. Many plans have overextended, offering richer benefits to compete for new members without fully accounting for how expensive those programs have become. Dental benefits, in particular, have proven costly, as utilization has skyrocketed and provider networks have demanded higher reimbursement rates. What was once a differentiator is now a financial drag. As plans face tighter margins, there is a clear pullback in the generosity of these offerings \u2014 leading many seniors to rethink their plan choices as active shoppers this fall.   Finally, the healthcare landscape is shifting. Medical groups that once eagerly entered into Medicare Advantage risk-based contracts are now facing declining revenues and higher utilization and face significant utilization management from plans. Many are demanding higher rates or exiting contracts altogether. Plans are being forced to make difficult trade-offs: either pay providers more (and pass costs onto members) or risk losing access to key networks. Some provider groups are even \u201crationalizing\u201d \u2014 selectively terminating relationships with plans they view as financially unsustainable. The tension between plans and providers \u2014 both squeezed by the same economic forces \u2014 is creating instability in local markets.   Medicare Advantage remains one of the largest public-private partnerships in American healthcare \u2014 covering more than 33 million seniors nationwide. But success has bred complexity. Today, plans are navigating higher medical costs, lower revenues, and a tightening regulatory environment \u2014 all while trying to keep premiums affordable and benefits robust. For consumers, it\u2019s more important than ever to shop carefully during Open Enrollment. For policymakers, it\u2019s a reminder that financial sustainability and member protection must go hand-in-hand.   And for plan leaders, this is a moment for clear-eyed realism \u2014 and renewed commitment to the mission that started it all: helping older adults live their healthiest, most independent lives.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByIngmar Rentzhog, Contributor. Russia\u2019s coal collapse marks the breaking point of the fossil era. With thermal-coal prices down nearly 80 percent from their 2022 peak and over half of Russia\u2019s producers now losing money, Moscow\u2019s lifeline industry is imploding \u2014 even as renewables, batteries, and storage become the fastest-growing assets in the world economy. According to the Financial Times, the sector lost Rbs 225 billion (\u2248 US$ 2.8 billion) in the first seven months of 2025 \u2014 more than double 2024\u2019s total losses \u2014 as exports vanished and subsidies fail. Twenty-three coal companies \u2014 about 13 percent of the national total \u2014 have already shut down, and another 53 are at risk of closing. Once Russia\u2019s fourth-largest export, coal has become its worst-performing industry in more than 30 years. \u201cThe coal industry is going through its sharpest crisis since the 1990s\u201d   President Putin himself has admitted that \u201ccoal producers are having a tough time.\u201dThe reason is brutally simple: logistics costs have soared \u2014 rising from 50 to almost 90 percent of the coal\u2019s final price \u2014 while discounts to Asia remain steep, sometimes forcing producers to export at a loss merely to secure foreign currency and protect mining-region jobs. Even Russia\u2019s energy heartland of Kuzbass ended 2024 with a Rbs 70.6 billion deficit, deepening to Rbs 36 billion in the first half of 2025. A government rescue plan signed in May offered only limited tax deferrals and discounted freight tariffs \u2014 not enough to stem the collapse. Three years ago, fossil producers celebrated record profits as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent oil above US$120 per barrel and coal prices to historic highs. Many declared a new age of hydrocarbons. It wasn\u2019t. Even before the war, global oil demand had plateaued, coal use was declining across advanced economies, and clean-energy investment was already outpacing fossil growth. When the war triggered supply shocks, the market did what markets do: panic, speculate, correct. According to the World Bank, coal prices are forecast to fall roughly 27 percent in 2025 and again in 2026. The era of scarcity is ending. What comes next is the era of technology \u2014 and it rewards efficiency, not extraction. That shift is now visible not only in prices but in bankruptcies. Russia\u2019s coal industry has entered free-fall. Once a pillar of post-Soviet industry, it is now losing money faster than the Kremlin can rescue it. According to The Moscow Times (July 2025), global coal prices have plunged from US$400 per ton in late 2022 to about US$100 per ton by May 2025, while Russian export prices have fallen even lower \u2014 averaging US$69 FOB (Free On Board, meaning at the port before shipping), the weakest since 2020. At those levels, many producers sell below cost, and more than half (53 %) of coal companies are unprofitable, up from 31.5 % two years earlier. Four of Siberian Coal Energy Company\u2019s ten coal enterprises have already scaled back operations or are facing closure. \u201cAt current prices, exchange rates, financing costs and logistics, thermal-coal production in Kuzbass is unprofitable across the board,\u201d   The government approved a 178 billion-ruble (\u2248 US$2.2 billion) relief package in May, but losses could reach 300 \u2013 500 billion rubles (US$ 3.7 \u2013 6.2 billion) this year, with sector debt near 1.5 trillion rubles (\u2248 US$18.6 billion). Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports that the industry had already lost Rbs 225 billion (\u2248 US$2.8 billion) in the first seven months of 2025 \u2014 more than double 2024\u2019s total \u2014 with 23 coal companies (13 %) shut down and another 53 at risk. \u201cWages have been cut everywhere, absolutely everywhere in Kuzbass \u2026 they say it\u2019s the crisis: coal isn\u2019t in demand.\u201d  Together, the two reports paint a stark picture: Russia\u2019s once-booming coal economy is collapsing under sanctions, falling prices, and soaring logistics costs \u2014 a structural breakdown that even subsidies can\u2019t slow. Russia\u2019s geography and sanctions make adaptation far harder than for exporters like Australia or Indonesia. The result: a fossil-era cautionary tale \u2014 how quickly entire sectors can unravel when markets move faster than politics. Russian coal export prices have plummeted faster than global averages since 2022, driven by lost European markets and sanctions \u2014 a snapshot of how fossil economies unravel when markets shift faster than politics. Russia\u2019s implosion is mirrored \u2014 though for different reasons \u2014 in the United States, where the fossil sector is facing structural decline not from sanctions, but from market irrelevance. In October 2025, a federal coal lease auction in Montana attracted just one bid: $186,000 for 167 million tons of coal \u2014 roughly $0.001 per ton, a 99.9 percent collapse in value versus a similar 2012 sale at $1.10 per ton. The Department of the Interior then postponed additional auctions in Wyoming and Utah, citing \u201cmarket conditions.\u201d Analysts read the signal plainly: the market has priced coal out of future portfolios. \u201cIt tells you that there\u2019s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it\u2019s not worth very much money. It points to the fundamental, structural decline the coal industry is facing \u2014 and that story hasn\u2019t been reversed.\u201d  The U.S. and Russia are opposite sides of the same transition: one constrained by sanctions and geography, the other by economics and innovation. Both reveal how quickly fossil demand can evaporate once investors price in the future. The so-called fossil \u201csuper-cycle\u201d was never the start of a new age \u2014 it was the last gasp of the old. In 2022, oil majors posted historic windfalls as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent global prices soaring. ExxonMobil earned nearly US$56 billion \u2014 the highest profit ever recorded by a U.S. or European oil company \u2014 while Shell reported US$40 billion, its biggest haul in 115 years. Chevron followed with US$36.5 billion, more than double its 2021 earnings. At the time, many called it a fossil-fuel renaissance \u2014 but the data tells a different story. By 2025, growth had already stalled. The International Energy Agency now projects that global demand for coal, oil, and gas will all peak before 2030, marking the beginning of structural decline rather than resurgence. The illusion of a fossil revival has unraveled under market realities. What began as a wartime windfall has ended as a transition turning point \u2014 from scarcity and speculation to technology and scale. In the first half of 2025, global wind and solar generation hit a record high with 5,072 TWh, surpassing coal\u2019s 4,896 TWh for the first time. These aren\u2019t policy targets \u2014 they\u2019re meter readings. Every new unit of global electricity demand is now met primarily by clean energy. And while renewables dominate growth, zero-carbon nuclear is re-emerging as a stabilizer for low-carbon grids. France, the U.S., and China are investing in small modular reactors (SMRs) \u2014 compact, factory-built systems designed to complement variable renewables. The IEA projects nuclear capacity in advanced economies could grow by around 40 percent by 2050 under current policies. If Russia\u2019s coal collapse marks the end of one energy era, batteries mark the beginning of the next. According to an in-depth Financial Times analysis, California\u2019s \u201cmega-battery build-out\u201d has transformed its grid, tripling capacity since 2020 to more than 13 GW and redefining how power systems handle peak demand. Cost declines of around 90 % have made storage one of the fastest-evolving assets in energy, and forecasts suggest global battery-storage volumes could increase by two-thirds in 2025 and grow several-fold by 2030. Batteries are doing for electricity what silos once did for grain: turning abundance into reliability. Together with renewables and nuclear, they form the new backbone of the global energy system \u2014 and a growing threat to fossil fuels. This change isn\u2019t moral \u2014 it\u2019s mathematical. The fossil economy relied on constrained supply chains and monopoly pricing power; the clean economy scales production and compounds learning. Lord Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics puts it bluntly: \u201cInvestment in climate action is the growth story of the 21st century. High-carbon growth is futile because it ends in self-destruction.\u201d Solar, wind, and battery storage costs have fallen over 80 % over the past decade. Clean technologies compound; fossil assets decay. For investors, this isn\u2019t ideology \u2014 it\u2019s fiduciary duty. As markets pivot toward fossil-free technologies, a new fight has emerged \u2014 over truth itself.  In the U.S., the White House has ordered NASA to shut down its two CO\u2082-monitoring satellites, OCO-2 and OCO-3 \u2014 the world\u2019s most precise tools for tracking emissions. Together they deliver vital data for farmers, scientists, and policymakers at a cost of just $15 million a year out of NASA\u2019s $25 billion budget. Former NASA officials warn the decision \u201cmakes no economic sense.\u201d It\u2019s not about saving money \u2014 it\u2019s about blinding the evidence that holds polluters accountable. In Europe, parties such as Germany\u2019s AfD and the U.K.\u2019s Conservatives are moving to cancel net-zero targets, appealing to voters anxious over costs and regulation. These moves won\u2019t stop the transition \u2014 but they can delay it at enormous cost. The irony is sharp: political denial now targets the science that enabled economic success. The political backlash isn\u2019t just ideological \u2014 it\u2019s already hitting consumers. In the U.S, electricity bills are surging \u2014 wholesale prices up roughly 40 percent in the first half of 2025, with residential rates rising 9\u201320 percent year-on-year. It\u2019s a perfect storm: exploding demand from new data centers colliding with stalled clean-energy projects. By blocking the cheapest, fastest-to-build sources of supply \u2014 solar, wind, and storage \u2014 policymakers are driving prices up and competitiveness down. Global fossil-fuel subsidies still exceed US$7 trillion a year, according to the IMF \u2014 distorting markets, crowding out innovation, and delaying investment in cleaner, cheaper technologies. Every year of hesitation locks in more heat, debt, and disaster risk. Every year of acceleration multiplies jobs, resilience, and competitiveness. Yes, the transition will cost. We must modernize grids, rebuild infrastructure, and retool entire industries for a fossil-free economy.But the cost of transformation is measured in investment \u2014 the cost of inaction will be measured in collapse. Insurance experts warn that unchecked climate damage could erase up to 50% of global GDP within decades \u2014 an uninsurable future no one can afford. This isn\u2019t just an energy transition \u2014 it\u2019s a race against time.If we stay the course, we will make it.If we slow down, we won\u2019t. Russia\u2019s Coal Collapse, America\u2019s failed coal auctions, and the unstoppable rise of clean energy all tell the same story: the market has moved.Now leadership must do the same. We\u2019re not waiting for the transition anymore.We\u2019re living it.And whether the coal collapse will help us win or lose will depend on one thing \u2014 if we keep going.Written by Ingmar Rentzhog, climate communicator and Founder & CEO of Wedonthavetime.org.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"ByNeil Winton, Senior Contributor. The European auto industry may appear, like the proverbial swan, to be sailing serenely on, but it is working furiously beneath the surface to survive and ward off the threat from China. Europe\u2019s carmakers seem to be functioning well. Sales have stabilized and are set to hold steady this year.  Leading manufacturers have ridden out the storm set off by the U.S. tariff changes and a spate of profit warnings, with much talk of profit margins being restored in 2026.  But the threat from China hasn\u2019t gone away and some say it is being encouraged by European Union regulations. These rules mandate a cut in carbon dioxide emissions so severe only new electric vehicles will be available for sale by 2035. Chinese automakers, with their 30% price advantage, are known to be ready and able to fill the EV gap; Europeans are struggling to do this profitably. Currently, the European industry and automaking countries are trying to persuade the EU to end its plan for this EV monopoly and open up the market to any technology. Without this dilution, the industry says it faces an existential threat. Green groups oppose the changes. The introduction of tariffs on EVs last year by the European Union might have caused a momentary hiccup but China is poised to resume its attack with products increasingly made in Europe. Europe is likely to be forced to close many factories which are becoming surplus to requirements. This is would undermine profits and cripple the region\u2019s most prestigious industry which employs millions and pays high wages. A spate of factory closures and temporary production halts demonstrates the gravity of the problem, led by Volkswagen and Stellantis and their many brands. Stellantis has introduced temporary shutdowns at six plants across Europe. Volkswagen has acted on a similar scale, with its EV production particularly impacted. VW brands lead sales charts across Europe and Stellantis is number two. Together, they account for about half of the new sedan and SUV market.  GlobalData, in its monthly report on the outlook for Western Europe, paints a sanguine picture, saying the new U.S.-EU trade deal has smoothed out trade policy uncertainty. \u201cWhen combined with rising real wages and increased government spending particularly in Germany, the outlook for the region has improved since mid-year,\u201d GlobalData said. GlobalData expects sales of sedans and SUVs to be broadly flat this year at just over 11.5 million. This sounds fine until you remember that before Covid, sales were about 4 million a year higher. European manufacturers have finally got to grips with their production of electric vehicles and now have competitive products, according to Berenberg Bank.  \u201cThe September Munich Motor Show finally showcased European products now approaching or on par with Chinese competitors in terms of specifications \u2014 and at significantly improved cost levels. The BMW iX3 \u201cNeue Klasse\u201d is potentially on track to approach internal combustion engine\/battery electric vehicle margin parity by 2026,\u201d the bank said in a report. Matt Schmidt, founder of Schmidt Automotive Research, agrees, saying the Europeans have done their homework and now have EVs on a par with the Chinese. \u201cPreviously Europeans had to make cost cuts to get EVs as close to positive profit margins as possible. Now, as battery prices come down and they adopt to using (cheaper) LFP they are the best of both worlds of profits and being able to return some of that windfall into higher quality interiors,\u201d Schmidt said.  But evidence mounts that the Chinese threat not only hasn\u2019t gone away, its potency is increasing. As Schmidt concedes, outside rich Western Europe, Chinese products make a compelling price case at the lower end of the market in the rest of the continent.  The British market is said to be the most threatened. Michael Dunne\u2019s latest edition of Dunne Insights reports that experts say, led by MGs, BYDs and Chery Jaecoos, Chinese market share in the U.K. hit 13% in September, and could reach 30% in two years.  Dunne said Chinese automakers are faced with huge overcapacity in their home market, wiping out profits. \u201cThis extreme overcapacity has ignited brutal price wars at home, causing profits to vanish. This is forcing Chinese automakers to face an ultimatum: export or die,\u201d Dunne said, in the latest edition of his newsletter headlined \u201cHow China Is Gutting Western Automakers\u201d.     The signs of impending doom for Europe mount. Consultants AlixPartners said in a report because of subdued demand and Chinese competition, as many as eight factories in Europe could be surplus to requirements by 2030.    AlixPartners said European car factories are running at an average 55% of capacity. Between one and two million vehicle sales will be lost to China, which will reach a market share of about 5% this year and could reach 10% by 2030 led by BYD and SAIC\u2019s MG.  Investment researcher Jefferies has said Chinese brands could account for up to 6% of European production by 2028 or about 860,000 vehicles, including BYD plants in Hungary, Turkey, and maybe Spain too. According to investment bank UBS, data for September showed strong sales of the MG HS, BYD Seal U and Jaecoo 7 plug-in hybrid, which pushed Chinese market share to a record 7.3% in the five largest European markets. It\u2019s not just China\u2019s manufacturing competence that endangers Western competition. Dunne also points to the Chinese domination of key automotive manufacturing components from rare earth magnets to battery materials. Without these products, factories in Europe and the U.S. would soon grind to a halt. \u201cThe real test now is whether companies and governments can work together to build new and reliable supply chains and secure access to the materials that power the modern world. If the world does not act collectively, it could soon wake up to find the entire mobility industry - and the technologies that flow from it \u2013 running on China\u2019s terms,\u201d Dunne said.  The West has taken comfort from the belief that the consequences of a long-reported possibility of a China invasion of Taiwan would so devastate its own economic progress that it was insurance policy against it ever happening.  Does the same reasoning apply to an overly aggressive automotive policy? If China is too successful, the EU might seek to defend its industrial base by seeking to shut out China completely. The problem for Europe is that would also mean their automakers led by BMW, Mercedes, VW and its Audi and Porsche subsidiaries, would lose their hugely profitable business in China, although that is a shadow of its former self.  \u201cThe pain for Western automakers is real. As a group, they are selling eight million fewer vehicles in China than they did five years ago,\u201d Dunne said.     ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. 16 hours ago As the weather gets colder and the days get shorter, that can only mean one thing: fall is officially here. Not only is this the time for pumpkin spice lattes and haunted houses, but there\u2019s also a good chance you\u2019re starting to think about your upcoming holiday shopping. And if you\u2019re an Android fan, you\u2019re probably going to do some of that shopping on the Google Store. Front and center on the Google Store today are all of Google\u2019s latest releases \u2014 including the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel Watch 4, and the shockingly good Pixel Buds 2a. They\u2019re the best of what Google has to offer, and they\u2019re likely what you\u2019re visiting the Google Store for. But if you find yourself digging deeper through Google\u2019s catalog, you\u2019ll come across plenty of other gadgets available, many of which are older but still officially sold by Google. And there are 6 of these, in particular, that you should avoid buying. The first of those is the Pixel Tablet. Google proudly advertises a \u201cTablets\u201d section on the navigation bar of the Google Store, with the Pixel Tablet as the only available choice. You might be inclined to pick it up for yourself or as a gift for someone else, but I\u2019d have to advise against it. The Pixel Tablet already had pretty outdated specs when it launched in June 2023, and that\u2019s only become a bigger problem by 2025 standards. Its 60Hz refresh rate is slow and clunky, the Tensor G2 chip is now three generations old (and shows it), the 8GB of RAM is just stingy, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the Pixel Tablet is still way too expensive. For the Pixel Tablet and the included speaker dock, Google is still asking the full $499 retail price that it debuted at over two years ago. Alternatively, you can buy just the Pixel Tablet itself for $399, but that takes away the best thing about it. And even if you really wanted to buy the Pixel Tablet, many of the 128GB models are out of stock, meaning you\u2019d have to pay another $100 for the 256GB version. Even if Google discounts the Pixel Tablet closer to the holidays or gets more 128GB units in stock, I still struggle to recommend this one. It\u2019s not a particularly good smart display and not a great Android tablet either. It\u2019s certainly a unique device, but not one that\u2019s worth shelling out this kind of money for at this point in its life cycle. The other \u201cold\u201d Google gadget you should avoid on the Google Store is the Pixel 9. Even with the Pixel 10 now available, the Pixel 9 retains its full $799 asking price \u2014 the same as the Pixel 10. Given the choice between both phones at the same price, there\u2019s no question that you should skip the Pixel 9 and get the Pixel 10 instead. There are a few reasons for this, one of which is the Pixel 10\u2019s newer Tensor G5 chip. While it\u2019s not a dramatic performance boost over the Tensor G4 in the Pixel 9, it does run significantly cooler throughout daily use \u2014 a big upgrade in my book. The new 5x telephoto camera is an even bigger upgrade, as it allows for new photography options you simply don\u2019t get with the Pixel 9. And, of course, the Pixel 10 gives you built-in magnets on the back for use with magnetic chargers, battery packs, and other accessories. It really is a huge convenience and difficult to live without once you\u2019ve used it for yourself. If you find a hefty discount on the Pixel 9, that changes the conversation a little bit. But if you\u2019re being asked to pay the same price for the Pixel 9 or Pixel 10 as the Google Store currently is, you should choose the Pixel 10 every single time. I have similar advice for the Pixel 9 Pro. It\u2019s also available on the Google Store for its original $999 MSRP, which, again, is the amount you\u2019ll pay for the newer Pixel 10 Pro. And if you\u2019re being asked the same price for both phones, don\u2019t bother with the Pixel 9 Pro. That\u2019s not to say the Pixel 9 Pro is bad, but the Pixel 10 Pro is much better \u2014 and in some ways that might surprise you. Like the Pixel 10, the Tensor G5 chip and built-in magnets are also on the Pixel 10 Pro, and they\u2019re just as great. The Pixel 10 Pro\u2019s screen is also a bit brighter, which is always appreciated. What\u2019s surprising about the Pixel 10 Pro is that, despite having the same cameras as the Pixel 9 Pro, its photos look a lot better. I confirmed this in a Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro camera comparison, as did my colleague Rita in her recent analysis of the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s bizarre color processing. Google\u2019s updated processing on the Pixel 10 Pro is overwhelmingly better, so much so that if cameras are a priority for you, the Pixel 9 Pro just isn\u2019t worth it \u2014 even if you find it discounted on the Google Store. At least, not until Google (hopefully) releases a software update to fix it. Besides the new Pixel Watch 4, you\u2019ll find a few other smartwatches and fitness trackers on the Google Store. The Pixel Watch 3 is a great deal if you want the Pixel Watch experience for less, thanks to a reduced starting price of just $250. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap entry point into the Fitbit ecosystem, the Fitbit Charge 6 is a good way to do that. However, I can\u2019t in good conscience still recommend buying the Fitbit Sense 2 or Fitbit Versa 4. Both watches launched in September 2022, and since then, Google has pretty clearly abandoned any plans for future Fitbit smartwatches in favor of going all-in with the Pixel Watch. We had trouble recommending the Sense 2 and Versa 4 when we originally reviewed them, and at this point in October 2025, you absolutely shouldn\u2019t spend your money on either one. If you want a Fitbit smartwatch, both the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Watch 3 are significantly better \u2014 and the latter isn\u2019t even that much more expensive. And the Charge 6, while not perfect, delivers most of the experience you get on the Sense 2 and Versa 4 but for less money. The Google Store often runs discounts for the Fitbit Sense 2 and Fitbit Versa 4, but even when you see those sales, I\u2019d recommend staying far away from both smartwatches. Lastly, we have the Nest Hub Max. This is the most powerful smart display currently on the Google Store, offering a camera for video calling and security monitoring, good sound quality, and a 10-inch display. It\u2019s a fine product if you already own one (especially with Gemini now available), but buying the Nest Hub Max in 2025 just doesn\u2019t make sense. There are a few reasons for this, one of the biggest being the price. Given its age (released in September 2019), the Nest Hub Max just isn\u2019t worth the $229 Google still asks for it. If you\u2019re committed to buying a Google smart display, the regular Nest Hub is a far better value at $100. And if you aren\u2019t married to Google\u2019s ecosystem, Amazon has much better (and cheaper) options in its Echo Show lineup \u2014 including a new Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 11 that were just announced last month. The other factor is that Google recently teased that it has a new smart display in the works. We aren\u2019t sure when it\u2019ll be released or how much it\u2019ll cost, but it seems silly to drop $229 on the Nest Hub Max right now when it may be replaced in a few months.

{"date":"2025-10-19","content":"Windows 11 has a lot of problems. Yes, we know. But I\u2019m tired of complaining, and the truth is, I\u2019m not switching to another OS anytime soon. So instead of fighting it, I\u2019ve decided to make it better. And today, it\u2019s the right-click menu\u2019s turn. It\u2019s easy enough to revert the Windows 11 context menu back to the classic Windows 10 version. But frankly, the Windows 10 right-click menu doesn't look good, and it doesn't have what I want either. So what if, instead of rolling back, you could just fix the Windows 11 context menu without making it look outdated? That's where Nilesoft Shell comes in. My main frustration with the Windows context menu wasn\u2019t just that it lacked what I needed \u2014 it was that it included everything I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s full of useless junk added by apps that assume their presence is mandatory. Of course, I still use these apps and some I respect, but I just don't use them enough for them to deserve a spot on my right-click menu. The classic Windows right-click clutter A more refined and practical right-click menu with Nilesoft Shell Another issue I had was that apps like WinRAR, bless its ancient soul, still uses old-style icons. Don't get me wrong, I love WinRAR, but it does make the Windows context-menu look incoherent. All in all, the vanilla Windows 11 context menu is both ugly and inefficient, at least to me. It doesn\u2019t do what I want, and it doesn\u2019t look the way I want. Nilesoft Shell fixes that. It\u2019s a free, open-source context menu manager that gives you full control. You can add, remove, and modify entries; group them into submenus; or add entirely new sections. It\u2019s not limited to shortcuts either \u2014 you can insert custom commands, scripts, or shell actions that integrate directly into Windows. Installation is straightforward. Download the installer, run it, launch the app as Administrator, and hit Register. That\u2019s all it takes to hook it up. Once it\u2019s active, you can start customizing right away. Nilesoft Shell is a lightweight, highly customizable Windows shell extension that lets you take full control of your right-click context menu. Instead of being stuck with cluttered or redundant options, you can completely redesign the menu to fit how you actually use your PC. Even before you dive into customization, Nilesoft Shell improves the default Windows context menu immediately. Try right-clicking the taskbar. Normally, you\u2019d only see Task Manager and Taskbar Settings. With Shell, you suddenly have a whole set of useful tools. The Go To menu lets you jump straight to key system folders in a single click. If you need to reach AppData, it's now literally two clicks away. Same with the settings app \u2014 no need to open the Start menu for it. In the Window menu you can tile or stack all open windows instantly. I tested it by maximizing everything on my desktop and then selecting Show side-by-side. It was fast and pretty efficient. I've attached the results below, if you're curious.  There's also the Terminal menu, which is a godsend if you ever use the command line. Both Command Prompt and PowerShell are one right-click away, and this menu also appears when you right-click a folder. Like the default Windows context-menu, the Nilesoft Shell menu items adapt depending on where you right-click. You get different sets of options if you right-click, say, an image file. Regardless of where you click, all the items are practical, minimal, and far more useful than the stock Windows 11 clutter. Nilesoft Shell uses a configuration file (shell.nss) where you can add, remove, and modify menu entries. Editing the config is simple. The file lives in the install directory (usually Program Files), or you can access it faster by holding Shift, right-clicking the taskbar, opening the Shell submenu, and choosing config. Each rule is written in plain text, one per line. There\u2019s no indentation or formatting to worry about. For example, to remove \u201cEdit with Photos,\u201d you just add this line: remove(find=\"Edit with Photos\") Save the file, reload File Explorer, and the change is live. I started by cleaning house. \u201cOpen in Visual Studio\u201d (which I don\u2019t even have installed), \u201cCombine files in Acrobat,\u201d and \u201cScan with Microsoft Defender\u201d were all first on the chopping block. I use the right-click menu most for resizing images with Windows PowerToys' image resizer and converting them with an open-source file converter. The image right-click menu was the worst. I'm pretty sure I'll never click \u201cAsk Copilot\u201d or \u201cCreate with Designer.\u201d Thankfully, they're all gone now. WinRAR\u2019s menu entry still had its classic colored books icon, which I\u2019ve always liked but doesn\u2019t fit modern Windows aesthetics. So, I replaced it with a clean glyph. Nilesoft Shell comes with its own glyph library, so you can easily replace ugly old icons with sleek symbols. The color code lets you tweak accent hues to match your theme. modify(find=\"WinRAR\" image=image.glyph(\"\\uE1A4\", #22A7F2)) I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface. You can add nested menus, command-line scripts, app launchers, and automation actions. You can make context menus behave differently in File Explorer versus the desktop. You can even create dynamic items that only appear when certain conditions are met. The flexibility here borders on absurd, but in a good way. For something that replaces a piece of Windows so integral yet so overlooked, it\u2019s remarkably lightweight and stable. There\u2019s one caveat: configuration is entirely text-based. There\u2019s no graphical UI, no drag-and-drop interface \u2014 you\u2019re editing code. That might scare some people off, but the tradeoff is worth it. The text config keeps it efficient, powerful, and free of bloat. And once you\u2019ve got your menu the way you want, you\u2019ll rarely need to touch it again. For me, it's worth it just because I don't need to use the terrible Windows settings app \u2014 because now I have a shortcut to Control Panel in my right-click menu. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved  Remove the new UI and most people will be happy. Most people don't GAS.  It's only techies who care, I don't, and techies aren't close to the Windows 11 population. I'd like to have Send To on it but the only one I find annoying is having to go to More Option for Refresh. The new Windows 11 context menu is frankly no better or worse than the classic one.  I didn't like it removed the cool Copy etc.. buttons and it introduces just as much gumpf as it removes. I'd never want Folder Permission or Hide\/Show File Extension menus in a context menu. It's just not appropriate place to have them. I know you can run scripts to remove them, but who wants to do this.  I do like the concept of it though.  BE CAREFUL OF INSTALLING THIS IF YOU USE ONEDRIVE. It also removes all the Download vs. File On Demand icons against each folder\/file. So you can't see which are\/aren't.  I uninstalled it and had to restart to restore them. Closing\/reopening OneDrive and End tasking Explorer.exe wasn't enough.  I DIDNT TRY restarting the PC with Nilesoft Shell installed, maybe that restores them too.","label":0}
