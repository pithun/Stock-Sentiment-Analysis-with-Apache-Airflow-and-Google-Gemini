Michael Burry is officially a meme. Michael Burry right now $NVDA $SPY $BTC pic.twitter.com\/GWmgFMTTb6 The investor of \"The Big Short\" fame is lighting up social media after he bet against Nvidia and called out the chipmaker and other AI companies on X, which may have contributed to the stock market's slump on Thursday. Cassandra winsBrutal day... pic.twitter.com\/DwGiTtbG59 Burry is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble. His massive, contrarian wager was immortalized in the book \"The Big Short\" and a movie adaptation starring Christian Bale as Burry. Known for his dire warnings of crashes and recessions, Burry goes by \"Cassandra\" on X \u2014 a reference to the priestess from Greek mythology who was cursed to speak true prophecies but never to be believed. He burst back onto X in late October after more than two years of silence, and wasted no time firing off several warnings about a dangerous bubble in AI stocks. His hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, revealed days later that at the end of September it held bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir with a combined notional value of $1.1 billion. Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets \"batshit crazy\" in a televised interview, spurring Burry to fire back that the AI company's boss couldn't \"crack a simple 13F.\" In later posts, Burry said that he wasn't short and had exited the Palantir puts in October. He also terminated Scion's SEC registration, closing it to outside cash. Most recently, he took aim at Nvidia after its third-quarter earnings beat on Wednesday. He questioned the longevity of its chips, its \"give-and-take deals\" with other AI companies, and its stock dilution. Some market watchers rushed to ridicule his bearish stance on the AI boom after Nvidia shares popped more than 5% following its earnings beat. Live look at Michael Burry pic.twitter.com\/nYJb5dHPSE Other commenters poked fun at Burry's defiance, and his willingness to go up against technology titans and the dominant market narrative. Michael Burry trying to keep the $NVDA short narrative alive after that earnings print pic.twitter.com\/k1W9zfAW7o Still others have defended Burry, saying he's many things but foolish isn't one of them. 100% of people who think they\u2019re smarter than Michael Burry are 100% not smarter than Michael Burry. pic.twitter.com\/wxde2212P1 Shares of Nvidia opened higher on Thursday but swung to a 3% decline by the market's close, and fell another 1% on Friday. Nvidia is the world's most valuable public company with a market capitalization above $4 trillion, so its sudden downswing dragged the entire stock market lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 gave up a 1.9% gain to close 1.6% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite went from a 2.6% rise to a 2.2% fall, marking the indexes' largest intraday swing since April. Both closed less than 1% higher on Friday. The reversal led some market watchers to rally behind Burry, celebrating his surprise comeback and suggesting he may have been right to be skeptical. Michael Burry in the past 12 hours https:\/\/t.co\/LfUscwdnrj pic.twitter.com\/kN4FEtxVDu They also gave him kudos for cashing in on the chaos, even though Burry hasn't said whether he holds Nvidia puts or profited from Thursday's selloff. Michael Burry right now pic.twitter.com\/87nXleZLX2 Burry also received praise for his Palantir bet, as the AI stock has tanked 25% since November 3, when it reported earnings and Burry disclosed his puts. Update: It's been 17 days since Michael Burry publicly went bearish on Palantir $PLTRIt's down -25% since pic.twitter.com\/EtxvlYakpB By no means was Burry solely responsible for the market slump. Investors also soured on Nvidia after analysts flagged increases in inventories and deferred revenues, raising concerns the company's growth may have been frontloaded and could slow in future quarters. Moreover, delayed economic data showed US unemployment rose to an almost four-year high of 4.4% in September. Burry is yet to post about the online furor surrounding his crusade against the AI giants. But his followers may hear more from him very soon, as his X bio reads: \"'Unchained' coming maybe sooner than Nov 25th.\" Jump to","label":1}

Zohran Mamdani won a resounding mayoral victory by promising to make it cheaper to live in New York City. However, his victory earlier this month may have the unintended effect of making it even more expensive for the ultrawealthy to afford their homes in favorite ex-New Yorker haunts like Greenwich, Palm Beach, and the Hamptons, top real estate agents told Business Insider. Real estate agents in these elite zip codes say that the \"Mamdani effect\" is already creeping into prices or causing some to pull the trigger to buy, as locals anticipate another migration wave. 2025 was already a \"banner year\" for Dina Goldentayer, a Miami-based real estate agent who, with more than $3 billion in sales since 2021, is the top earner at real estate firm Douglas Elliman. Even as prices are dropping in Miami at the median-home level, they're growing for ultra-luxury buyers. As of September, the median home price for Miami was down about 4% year-over-year, while it was up 8.4% for luxury homes in Miami, according to Redfin. \"Every year, our price points get higher and higher,\" she said. Referencing million-dollar listings, she added: \"30 is the new 20.\" This dynamic mimics a broader consumer dynamic, with wealthy Americans spending more while the rest cut back. She has not had any New York to Miami transplant clients say they were moving because of Mamdani, but she said Miamians believe the \"election results will flood the market with New Yorkers.\" \"I've had some sellers in Miami say, 'Let's raise my price,'\" Goldentayer said, though she has cautioned them to wait until he actually rolls out policies before raising it. Socialist Mamdani, who will take office in 2026, has proposed raising taxes on those making more than $1 million a year, and criticized the New York Police Department. His campaign left ultrawealthy New Yorkers concerned he's going to target their wealth and make the city less safe. While sellers are salivating at steep price jumps, buyers are worried that New Yorkers will drive prices up, Goldentayer said. \"I had one client use the expression 'The Mamdani effect is being baked into the price,'\" Goldentayer said. Nancy Batchelor, a top Miami real estate agent who heads her own group with Compass, wrote to BI that she's had \"a handful of buyers mention the election,\" but that it's never the \"sole reason.\" \"What we're seeing is more subtle; people who were on the fence are now exploring their options with more urgency,\" Bachelor wrote. \"Many are waiting it out to see if anything changes in New York City before making a decision.\" That might mean buying a second home in Miami for now, but not actually moving their family south in the middle of the school year, she said. And in markets like Palm Beach, which has been a magnet for Manhattanites, what started as a pandemic trend is turning into a \"full lifestyle shift,\" Samantha Curry, a top Palm Beach real estate agent, wrote to BI. South Florida has attracted a number of billionaires like legendary investor Carl Icahn and Citadel's Ken Griffin, who moved his firm's Chicago headquarters to Miami. Steven Ross, former CEO of Related, which developed the upscale Hudson Yards neighborhood in NYC, spun out the firm's Palm Beach operations to form Related Ross. Curry has heard from ex-New Yorkers who said the potential tax implications and safety concerns of Mamdani have been a reason for their searches. Right now, it's mostly \"driving conversations,\" especially with the top tier of clients, but actual increases in taxes will really change things. \"If that happens, we expect to see another wave of buyers from the north heading to Palm Beach,\" she wrote. While Miami and Palm Beach have become destinations for financial types, a more traditional post-Wall Street destination, Greenwich, CT, is actually seeing some post-election sales. Ultra-luxury Greenwish home sales jumped after Mamdani's June primary victory, with more homes sold in a shorter period, and at higher prices, with an average of $19.7 million per home after the nomination compared to $14.9 million before, according to the mid-November analysis by Mark Pruner, a top Greenwich agent for Compass. Pruner said the town has seen three large sales go into contract since the election, ranging from $14 million to $28 million. He has had some clients say that Mamdani is a factor behind their move, but that the evidence is \"anecdotal.\" What is certain is that Greenwich is having a record year, he said, saying that it's on track for more than 50 sales over $10 million, compared to a prior high of 19 in 2007. \"A significant portion of it is the concern about the stock market,\" Pruner said. \"We're at record highs, people are sitting at lots of unrealized profits, and there are people who are taking money out of their stock investments and putting it into high-end real estate here in Greenwich.\" If a Mamdani wave continues, home hunters will have slim pickings in Greenwich. Inventory is down 82% from where it was pre-COVID, according to Pruner, pushing prices higher before any Mamdani effect became part of the equation. So far, the numbers don't match the chatter. Despite all the talk of wealthy fleeing, and that penthouses and brownstones would be going for bargain rates, luxury home sales surged in the city following the election. The week of the election saw 41 contracts signed at $4 million and above, the most in a single week since late May, according to the Olshan Luxury Market Report. New York's continued strength is a result of \"multi-market living,\" said Miami's Batchelor. \"Many aren't choosing between New York and Miami, they're choosing both,\" she said. Now that's not to say there won't be some ultrawealthy people selling properties in New York, but many of the ultrawealthy will buy in Florida and change their domicile to shake off the tax man while keeping their pad on Billionaire's Row. \"The nice thing is, if you can afford an over $10 million house, you generally can afford two, or three, or four,\" said Pruner.

Lego Architecture city sets almost never go on sale throughout the year with the company keeping tight control over pricing on these collectible skyline models. The New York City set is one of the most popular entries in the Architecture collection, capturing the Big Apple\u2019s iconic silhouette in brick form. Amazon chose to clear final stock with particularly aggressive Black Friday pricing that fans will not want to pass up: This set dropped to $47 for Black Friday, down from $59, which is a new all-time low on this NYC skyline model. See at Amazon The set brings together, in one cohesive display, the Flatiron Building, Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, One World Trade Center, and the Statue of Liberty. Each structure captures its architectural essence through clever brick design that suggests details rather than recreating them literally. The Empire State Building rises as the tallest element, anchoring the skyline with its distinctive art deco spire. The Chrysler Building\u2019s famous terraced crown translates beautifully into Lego form despite the miniature scale. Lady Liberty stands proudly at the edge, welcoming visitors to this brick interpretation of America\u2019s most famous city. The 4\u00d732 tiled base gives a clean foundation to the model with a decorative nameplate identifying the city. It is the same presentation style used for other sets in the Architecture Skyline series, thus creating visual consistency if you collect multiple cities. The finished model measures 10 inches high, 9 inches wide, and just 1 inch deep\u00c2\u00a0which makes it perfect for shelves and desks where space is limited. The included booklet raises this from a building toy to an educational experience by allowing you to learn about the design history, architectural significance, and cultural impact of the structure you build. Such information turns construction into a journey through New York\u2019s architectural evolution. This context gives even more meaning to the finished model because you know what each building stands for. The 12+ age rating indicates the right complexity for teenagers and adults looking for engaging builds, but not overwhelming difficulty. The construction provides several hours of focused activity that acts as genuine relaxation: you disconnect from screens and daily stress while creating something tangible and beautiful. Gift applications extend to anyone who loves New York, architecture, travel, or Lego building. The set works as a souvenir for NYC visitors, a reminder of home for transplants, or simply an appreciation of iconic design. The premium packaging and collectible booklet make this gift-ready without extra wrapping effort. It holds a 4.8-star rating out of over 7,700 reviews, and confirms consistent satisfaction from buyers who complete the build. Reviewers praise the balance between complexity and accessibility that makes construction enjoyable rather than frustrating. At $47, you\u2019re getting a detailed architectural skyline with five iconic buildings and a collectible booklet for 20% off.

For a long, long time, the premium adventure watch market was dominated by Garmin and Suunto, but then Apple came to the party with the Ultra series and hasn\u2019t looked back since. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 competes directly with flagship models from both brands\u00c2\u00a0and adds in smartphone integration that those dedicated sports watches just can\u2019t match. Apple keeps strict pricing on their own website and in Apple Stores, so it\u2019s a complete waste of your time checking there for deals. But Amazon just dropped the Ultra 2 to $599 for Black Friday, down from $799, which marks a record low and saves you $200 on Apple\u2019s most rugged wearable. This 25% discount is the deepest cut this watch has ever seen. See at Amazon A 49mm case made of titanium resists corrosion and impacts that would destroy aluminum watches within months of serious outdoor use. The sapphire front crystal laughs at scratches regular glass couldn\u2019t survive, maintaining clarity through years of adventure abuse. Verification through military standard MIL-STD 810H testing shows the watch handles extreme temperatures, shocks, and conditions that exceed those most users ever encounter. Water resistance reaches a depth of 100 meters, enabling serious diving alongside swimming and water sports. The 49mm size provides space for a bigger battery and a more luminous display than standard Apple Watch models have. The Always-On Retina display peaks at 3000 nits of brightness, and remains readable under direct sunlight where other screens totally wash out. The larger Digital Crown and customisable Action button work with gloves on, as well as in cold weather where touch-only controls fail. Precision dual-frequency GPS delivers accuracy that serious athletes and navigators require. By utilizing both L1 and L5 satellite frequencies, the system reduces errors from signal reflection off buildings and terrain. The recorded routes of your runs better match the actual paths you run, rather than placing you directly through buildings or zigzagging all over. The running features compete directly with dedicated running watches from Garmin and Coros. Advanced metrics track running form, including ground contact time, vertical oscillation, and stride length. Automatic track detection senses when you\u2019re running on a standard track and makes adjustments accordingly. Support for custom workouts accommodates structured training, like warmups, intervals, recovery periods, and cooldowns. Training load analysis shows how your workouts are affecting your body over time to help you avoid overtraining. Cellular connectivity lets you leave your iPhone behind while maintaining communication capabilities. You call, text, stream music, get directions, and access apps without your phone nearby. That sense of freedom completely changes outdoor activities where carrying a phone would add bulk or create risk. Emergency SOS works anywhere with cellular coverage, providing safety during solo adventures. That means battery life reaches 36 hours of normal use with the Always-On display active, extending to 72 hours of runtime in Low Power Mode for multi-day adventures. This is considerably beyond the typical Apple Watch models and closer to what dedicated adventure watches can manage. The extended battery life makes the Ultra 2 a practical choice for ultra-long hikes, ultra-marathons and multi-day trips in general. Health monitoring includes tracking heart rate, the measurement of blood oxygen, ECG capability, and sleep analysis. Fall detection and crash detection provide automatic emergency alerts in case of accidents. Temperature sensing tracks overnight variations useful for cycle tracking and illness detection. All of these features run continuously without affecting battery life much. At $599, you\u2019re getting Apple\u2019s flagship adventure watch with titanium construction and precision GPS for 25% off its standard price. Comparable Garmin watches cost between $800-1000 without the smartphone integration that Apple provides. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"New car buyers will be well aware of the \"new car feeling.\" You get to enjoy all the best bits of having the car \u2014 the smell of a freshly prepared interior, the chip-free paintwork \u2014 but you won't have had to live with its quirks or annoyances just yet. However, for some unlucky buyers, that new car feeling doesn't last long. The novelty of the car being new wears off, and they're left with a vehicle that isn't quite what they'd hoped for. If the owner really isn't satisfied with the car, they could choose to resell it, sometimes less than a year after they bought it. A new study by iSeeCars breaks down which cars are most likely to be resold within a year, with each of these 10 models being far more likely than average to end up back on the market. The study found that, on average, 3.6% of new cars were resold within their first year on the road, but each of these poor performers saw well over 10% of new models resold. Although it's easy to assume that the high resale numbers are solely down to owners deciding that they don't like the car in question, iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer said it wasn't quite as simple. According to Brauer, \"financial hardship and even creative dealer accounting\" can contribute to high reported resale rates, since \"some retailers [have] register[ed] demonstration vehicles as sold to increase sales numbers for their stores and the manufacturer.\" Jaguar's controversial reinvention as an all-electric luxury brand is well underway, with nearly all of its old lineup already discontinued. In the U.S., the 2025 model year will be the final year for Jaguar's last surviving combustion model, the F-Pace SUV, and production is set to end globally in 2026. The F-Pace was last given a notable overhaul in 2021, so Jaguar has had more than enough time to smooth out the production process to ensure the brand's notorious quality control inconsistencies don't spoil the ownership experience. However, plenty of F-Pace buyers are still reselling their cars early, with 13.3% of new registered sales reappearing on the market after less than a year. Exactly why the resale rate is so high remains unclear. Potentially, it could be that plenty of buyers are genuinely dissatisfied with their experience. Or it could be that Jaguar dealers have employed some creative accounting practices to make it look like they're shifting stock in time for the upcoming rebranding. Whatever the reason for the high number of resold cars, buyers looking for a lightly used F-Pace certainly won't be short of examples to pick from. We thought the 2021 refresh went a long way to making the car competitive against its luxury SUV rivals, several of which also appear in the top 10 most resold models. The latest generation of the BMW 5-Series hit dealerships for the 2024 model year and looks very different to its predecessor. It's also very different underneath, with a range of combustion, hybrid, and all-electric variants available. Even the base-spec variant of the car is far from slow, but we thought that the pricier powertrains in the 5-Series range were better value for most buyers. Anyone looking to make the leap to all-electric power also has multiple variants of the i5 to pick from. Despite all the mechanical and styling changes, the core appeal of the 5-Series remains the same as it always has been. It's a comfortable, well-equipped executive car that's just as suited to interstate road trips as it is to the daily commute. However, it appears that a significant proportion of recent buyers found it to be too different to what they were expecting, with 13.4% of them selling the car within a year of purchase. For the 2026 model year, Land Rover has announced multiple special editions of the Discovery, including the Tempest edition, which the brand describes as, \"the most luxurious Discovery vehicle ever.\" The Disco hasn't been selling as well as other models in the JLR stable for some time now, and in 2023, its maker confirmed that it was looking to overhaul the model in order to generate new interest. Fast-forward two years, and that overhaul has yet to arrive, with the special editions presumably launched as a stopgap measure to keep buyer interest alive. Even buyers that have opted for a Discovery over a Defender or Range Rover haven't kept it long. According to the iSeeCars analysis, 13.6% of new buyers sold their car in a matter of months. It isn't just the Discovery, either \u2014 three out of 10 of the most frequently resold models are Land Rovers. At least, if you're looking for a used Discovery rather than a new one, you won't be short of options. The C-Class is the first of four Mercedes-Benz models to appear in the top 10 most frequently resold cars, with 14% of buyers trading it in within a year. It competes in a tricky segment, with rivals from German, Japanese, and South Korean brands all available to tempt buyers away from Mercedes' dealerships. Nonetheless, we think the latest C-Class remains a compelling choice, mixing a comfortable, tech-heavy interior with a sleek exterior and impressive efficiency figures. It's not quite as athletic as other sedans in its segment, but it offsets that by being among the smoothest to drive. All-wheel drive is also available for added wintertime reassurance in colder parts of the country. Parts of the interior take heavy inspiration from the flagship S-Class, which results in the C-Class having one of the plushest interiors in its segment. It's arguably a solid all-rounder, but clearly buyers aren't as won over by its charms, at least judging by the rate that they trade them in. It might be the baby Range Rover, but its price still isn't all that small. The base-spec Evoque starts around $50,000 for 2026, but tick enough of the options list and the final price will sail north of $65,000. After putting the Evoque to the test in 2025, we also found its fuel economy to be far below the segment average, so buyers can expect big fuel bills too.\u00a0 However, in return for their money, buyers get an SUV that's arguably one of the best looking in its class, as well as an interior that's similar to pricier Range Rover models. None of those things explain why buyers are so keen to hand over the keys to their Evoques to someone else after less than a year behind the wheel. According to iSeeCars, 16.4% of buyers do exactly that \u2014 a figure that's well over four times the overall market average. American buyers no longer get the A-Class sedan, but they do get Mercedes' SUV sibling, the GLA. It serves as the entry level model in the brand's expansive SUV lineup, with the current generation having debuted for the 2021 model year. Inside, it isn't particularly different from other entry-level Mercedes models, but that's no bad thing. After all, the brand's current interiors are regarded as being among the best in their respective segments. Unlike some brands that have opted for a screen-only approach, the GLA's cabin still features plenty of physical buttons too. As appealing as they might be on paper, iSeeCars data shows that several of Mercedes' entry-level models are particularly likely to be resold by buyers. The GLA isn't the worst of the bunch, but its 16.7% resale rate is still far higher than most rival SUVs. That's despite the GLA having the lowest average new price out of all the frequently resold models here \u2014 $48,548 \u2014 and being the only model here with an average price below $50,000. Alongside the GLA, another entry-level Mercedes-Benz with a relatively attainable starting price is the CLA. Much like the GLA, the CLA is also one of the most frequently resold models on the market, with 20.4% of buyers parting with theirs within a year. The CLA is available in multiple guises, some of which prioritize sportiness while others prioritize comfort. We found both variants on both ends of the spectrum to be likeable, with our AMG CLA 35 being a good companion for spirited driving, while the CLA 250 was a comfortable commuter. The CLA can fit adults in its rear row, but it isn't as roomy as other attainably priced Mercedes models like the C-Class. Since it's more low-slung than the likes of the GLA and GLB, buyers with limited mobility might also find it trickier to get in and out of. It's far from the most practical entry-level Mercedes, then, but it makes up for that with attractive styling and a sportier edge than most of its similarly priced stablemates. The GLB is a relatively recent addition to the Mercedes-Benz lineup, having first debuted for the 2020 model year. It was given a facelift in 2023, with tweaked exterior styling, new headlights, and additional interior tech. While the brand's other entry-level SUVs sport a modern, aerodynamically-optimised design, the GLB has a more traditional boxy look. Its styling takes inspiration from Mercedes' original SUV, the G-Class, but unlike the latter, the GLB is available with a third row. The GLB offers impressively generous levels of legroom and headroom in its first and second rows, and retains a small overall footprint considering its ability to seat seven. Mercedes also offers an AMG-fettled version with 302 horsepower in case any buyers fancy giving their premium, compact family hauler an extra dollop of power. Despite being practical and relatively quick in its top-spec form, the GLB has the highest resale rate of any Mercedes-Benz model. According to iSeeCars, 21.2% of buyers traded in their new cars within the space of 12 months. The all-electric Porsche Macan might not be to some purists' tastes, but we found very little to dislike when we put one through its paces earlier in 2025. It still handles like a Porsche should do, it's powerful enough to push you back into your seat if you floor it, and it's as roomy and practical as other similarly sized SUVs. One of the few downsides is its limited range \u2014 the sub-300 mile range of our tester wasn't ideal, although it's still plenty for most people's everyday driving duties. Porsche still offers a Macan with a combustion engine under the hood alongside its all-electric model. Neither variant comes cheap: a base-spec gasoline Macan starts at a little under $70,000, while the cheapest electric Macan will cost slightly over $80,000. Adding options can push the final price much higher. Among buyers who were willing to cough up the cash, 22.2% sold the Macan within a year of their ownership. By a significant margin, the car that's most frequently resold within a year is the Land Rover Discovery Sport. Slotting below the Discovery, the Discovery Sport is Land Rover's joint most affordable new vehicle, alongside the Range Rover Evoque. The Evoque also makes an appearance on this list, but it's nowhere near as frequently resold as the Discovery Sport, which sees a whopping 28.3% of buyers sell it on within a year. The current generation of the Discovery Sport has been on the market for a long time by the standards of its segment, with its last major facelift debuting in 2020. At its launch, we came away impressed with its refined cabin and plentiful tech, but in the intervening half a decade, its segment has become more crowded with highly competitive rivals. The car has also gained a reputation for being less reliable than many of those rivals, which likely contributes to its exceptionally high resale rate. This list uses data from an iSeeCars study published in October 2025 that analyzed data from 18.5 million new car sales. The study considered cars with model years between 2022 and 2025, and tracked each car's vehicle identification number (VIN) to establish whether it was sold within a year of its original recorded purchase date. According to the study's authors, heavy-duty vehicles, ultra-premium, and low-volume cars were excluded from the analysis. Each of the listed vehicles was available as a 2024 model, and each remains available in 2025.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"In my many years as a journalist, I never thought I would be asking someone how it feels to have trout sperm injected into their face. And yet, here I am. Abby is lying on a large, black padded chair at a small aesthetics clinic in south Manchester.  She winces as a small cannula is delicately inserted into her cheek. \"Ouch. Ouch,\" she exclaims. I should make it clear that 29-year-old Abby is not actually receiving a pure dose of trout sperm.  The lower part of her face is being injected with tiny fragments of DNA, known as polynucleotides, which have been extracted from either trout or salmon sperm. Why? Well, interestingly, our DNA is pretty similar to that of a fish. So the hope is Abby's body will not only welcome these tiny strands of fish DNA, her skin cells will be spurred into action, producing more collagen and elastin, two proteins which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of our skin. For Abby, the aim is to freshen her skin, keep it healthy, and hopefully, treat the acne she's lived with for many years by reducing scarring and redness. \"I just want to target those problem areas,\" she explains. Polynucleotides are being touted as the next big skincare \"miracle\" and are rapidly gaining popularity after a number of celebrities have spoken candidly about their \"salmon sperm facials\". Earlier this year, Charli XCX told her nine million Instagram followers that she felt \"fillers are kind of over now\", and explained she had moved onto polynucleotides, which are \"kinda like deep vitamins\". Kim and Khloe Kardashian are also reportedly avid fans. And when asked about her skincare routine on a recent episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Jennifer Aniston responded: \"Don't I have beautiful salmon skin?\" So, despite their fishy beginnings, are polynucleotides transforming skincare? \"We are having a Benjamin Button moment,\" Suzanne Mansfield, who works for aesthetics company Dermafocus, tells me. That's a reference to the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, where Brad Pitt plays a man who ages backwards. By the time he's in his later years, he has the skin of a baby's bottom. While such an effect is highly unlikely and would probably be a tad disconcerting, Ms Mansfield says polynucleotides are forging the way when it comes to regenerative skincare. A small but growing body of research and clinical trials suggest that injecting polynucleotides can rejuvenate skin, not only making it healthier but potentially reducing fine lines, wrinkles and scars. \"All we are doing, by using it in the aesthetics industry,\" she says, \"is enhancing something the body already does. That's why these are so special.\" But they also come with a pretty hefty price tag. A single session of polynucleotide injections can cost anywhere from \u00a3200 to \u00a3500 - and it's recommended you have three of these over several weeks.  After that clinics tend to advise you need to top up every six to nine months to maintain the look. Back at the clinic, Abby's treatment is almost finished. \"Just one area left,\" Helena Dunk, the aesthetic nurse practitioner who owns the clinic, Skin HD, reassures her. She says polynucleotides have massively increased in popularity over the past 18 months. \"Half my clients really notice a huge difference - their skin feels more hydrated, healthier, younger - while the other half don't see such a big change. But their skin does tend to feel tighter and fresher.\" Abby has already had the area under her eyes injected as part of a three-course treatment at the clinic - and she's really pleased with the results. She received lots of tiny injections of polynucleotides, which was a \"pretty painful procedure\", but says it's helped reduce the dark circles under her eyes. While a growing number of studies consider it a safe and effective treatment, it is still relatively new and some experts warn the hype may be outpacing the science. Consultant dermatologist Dr John Pagliaro, based in Brisbane, Australia, says that while we know that nucleotides play an important role in our bodies - they are the building blocks of our DNA for a start - he questions whether \"injecting salmon DNA, cut into little pieces\" into our faces is going to work as well as our own nucleotides. \"We do not have good, strong data,\" he says. \"As a medical specialist, I would want to see at least a few more years of big, credible studies showing safety and efficacy before I started using them in my practice. We're just not there yet.\" Charlotte Bickley describes her foray into the world of polynucleotides as \"salmon-gate\".   The 31-year-old from New York had the treatment last year as part of her \"wedding glow up\", shortly before she was due to get married. But Charlotte ended up with a skin infection, inflammation and darker rings under her eyes than before she had the treatment. \"I got the complete opposite of what I wanted,\" she says. \"I trusted that doctor, but he's left me scarred.\" Charlotte believes she was injected too deeply under her eyes, causing a negative reaction. There can be side effects - such as redness, swelling and bruising but these tend to be temporary. In some cases, people can have an allergic reaction, or, if polynucleotides are not injected properly, there are longer term risks, such as skin pigmentation and infections. Polynucleotides are widely used across the UK. They are registered as medical devices with the Medicines Health and Regulatory Authority (MHRA) but they are not regulated like medicines.  They have not been approved by the UK\u2019s equivalent in the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \"I just keep thinking, 'Why did I go through with it?'\" Charlotte says. \"When something goes wrong on my face I hyperfixate on it.\" She's paid thousands in medical bills to try to rectify the situation, but 10 months on, there's still some scarring below her eyes. \"I would never have salmon DNA injected into my face again,\" Charlotte says, \"ever.\" Ashton Collins, director of Save Face, an organisation which campaigns for better regulation of the cosmetic industry and who runs a government-approved register of clinics in the UK, says polynucleotides are generally considered a safe treatment when administered by a medically-trained professional and the brand of polynucleotides used is from a reputable company. \"But, we are now seeing products coming onto the market that haven't been tested properly, that's the worry,\" she says. Dr Sophie Shotter, president of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, agrees. \"Due to the lack of regulation, anyone can use products that have not been robustly tested. It is a real issue.\" In her opinion, are polynucleotides effective though? \"I have them on my shelf, in my toolbox. I definitely offer them to clients, who want a natural look and want to potentially invest long-term,\" Dr Shotter says. \"Polynucleotides as a treatment is not the panacea. There are plenty of other treatments out there that can do similar, and have more data behind them.\" There is no one treatment that will work for everyone, she adds. \"We all respond differently to different things, and that is not always predictable.\" Shea Osei says it has been \"meaningful\" to see the film's fans recreate her designs. The BBC looks into whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help people who struggle when clothes are oddly sized. Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of footwear.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Strategy (MSTR) has become the go-to tool for crypto investors trying to manage risk, according to Tom Lee, chairman and CEO of Bitmine, partly explaining its 43% drop over the past month.  \u201c[Strategy] is probably the most important stock watch right now, because that is the bitcoin proxy, it\u2019s the most liquid name,\u201d Lee said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday.  With limited options to hedge losses directly in crypto markets, institutional traders have turned to shorting Strategy shares instead. The company holds nearly 650,000 bitcoin BTC$85,775.32, making its stock price closely tied to bitcoin\u2019s performance.  \u201cIt seems to me that in the crypto world when they\u2019re trying to hedge their loss in bitcoin and ethereum they can\u2019t find any other way to hedge it except shorting the liquid stocks that it proxies and that\u2019s the MicroStrategys,\u201d Lee said.  He added that crypto-native hedging tools, like derivatives on bitcoin and ether ETH$2,801.75, aren\u2019t liquid or deep enough for major players. \u201cAnyone who has a sizable bitcoin long position \u2026 they have very limited ability to hedge it in crypto derivatives,\u201d he said.  But Strategy, he explained, offers a workaround. \u201cSomebody can use [Strategy\u2019s] option chain which is so liquid to hedge all of their crypto.\u201d  In effect, he said, \u201c[Strategy] is essentially absorbing all the hedging pressure that the crypto industry is trying to do to protect their longs.\u201d  Lee also pointed to the lingering effects of the Oct. 10 market crash, which wiped out $20 billion in value and disrupted liquidity across exchanges. \u201cIt really crippled market makers,\u201d he said, describing them as the \u201ccentral bank\u201d of crypto.  Since then, cracks in the system have remained, with liquidity still thin across altcoins, miner stocks and bitcoin proxies like Strategy. MSTR has been among the hardest hit in the current downturn, which Lee believes is partly due to it serving as a pressure valve for the rest of the market.  He believes crypto\u2019s market plumbing remains fragile, and Strategy\u2019s role as a hedge is a sign of deeper structural issues.

Health tracking usually means strapping a bulky smartwatch onto your wrist and then remembering to charge it every few days. The Oura Ring 4 takes a completely different approach by putting comprehensive health monitoring into a sleek ring that disappears on your finger. You forget you\u2019re wearing it within minutes which can\u2019t be said about even the smallest smartwatches on the market. Amazon dropped all colors and sizes to $249 for Black Friday, down from $349, and marks a record low that makes this discreet fitness tracker genuinely accessible. The 29% discount applies across silver, black, gold, and stealth finishes in every ring size. See at Amazon The position of a ring on your finger gives cleaner biometric signals than is possible with wrist-based devices. The arteries in your fingers sit closer to the surface, with less interference from tendons, bones, and movement artifacts. This placement captures heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen levels with improved accuracy compared to the traditional fitness trackers. Sleep tracking represents the Oura Ring\u2019s greatest strength: an analysis of your rest in granular detail that actually displays patterns invisible to casual observation. It tracks the stages of sleep, movement, temperature variation, and calculates sleep efficiency scores. When you wake up, you get a detailed picture of how well you actually slept, rather than how many hours you spent in bed. It takes a variety of health metrics and puts them into one daily number that shows if your body is ready for intense activity, or if you need to recover. Sleep quality, heart rate variability, body temperature, and recent activity levels are factored in to give an estimate. A high score would suggest that you can push hard in workouts, while lower scores recommend taking it easy. Temperature tracking reveals small variations in your body\u2019s baseline that are indicative of various states of health. It is used by women for cycle tracking, where body temperature changes predictably across menstrual phases. The ring spots illness before you feel any symptoms, often showing a rise in temperature a day or two before the worst cold symptoms set in. Battery life reaches about a week on a single charge, and dramatically outlasts smartwatches that need daily charging. The wireless charger tops up the ring in about an hour, and you\u2019re even able to charge while working at your desk. That extended runtime means you capture sleep data every night without needing to charge before bed. Activity tracking counts steps, active calories, and movement throughout the day. It doesn\u2019t require workout logging, as the ring automatically detects activities and categorizes them accordingly. Heart rate monitoring during exercise shows intensity levels and recovery patterns. The main focus remains on daily activity rather than detailed workout metrics which suits users who want health insights without obsessive exercise tracking. The Oura app presents all this data in clean visualizations, highlighting trends and actionable insights. Daily scores for sleep, readiness, and activity provide easy status checks without the need to deep-dive into charts. The app can identify patterns across weeks and months, showing how changes to lifestyle decisions impact health metrics. Personalized recommendations based on your own data help one improve scores rather than just broad, generic advice. The cost for the subscription model, after the first month is free, is $5.99 a month, which grants access to full features and historical data. At $249, you\u2019re getting premium health tracking in a form factor that traditional fitness trackers can\u2019t match. Apple Watch and Fitbit devices cost similar amounts, but require wrist real estate and daily charging. This Black Friday pricing opens up the Oura Ring to users who want in-depth health data without the commitment to the wrist.

The noise-cancelling headphones market has become incredibly crowded with Sony, Bose, Apple, Sonos and others fighting for your attention. Each brand also offers multiple models at many different price points and if I\u2019m being honest, the differences between them have gotten increasingly tough to justify. At a certain point, when premium ANC headphones are all performing fantastically, the smartest move is finding the best deal and pulling the trigger. And the great news is that the Bose QuietComfort headphones have dropped to $199 for Black Friday, down from $349. That\u2019s 43% off a legendary pair of cans, and the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on these. See at Amazon Bose invented the category of consumer noise-cancelling headphones and has refined the QuietComfort line over decades. That heritage shows in how effortlessly these headphones eliminate ambient noise: the hum of airplane engines, office chatter, city traffic, and noisy coffee shops-all just fade into silence when you put them on. At the same time, the ANC technology automatically changes intensity with your surroundings, increasing or decreasing as needed. Sound quality lives up to the Bose reputation for rich, balanced audio. Deep bass hits with authority without overwhelming mids and highs, which keeps music sounding natural across genres. Acoustic tracks feel intimate while electronic and hip-hop deliver the punch you\u2019d expect. Bose tuned these headphones to sound great out of the box without requiring EQ adjustments, though the app lets you tweak things if you want. With 24 hours of battery life, you can make it through an entire week of commutes and work sessions on a single charge. When you\u2019re in a rush, a quick 15-minute top-up adds roughly 2.5 hours of playtime. USB-C charging keeps things suitably simple and compatible with the cables you already own. Should you somehow manage to drain the battery completely during a long-haul flight, the headphones also work in wired mode. Comfort is a huge factor when you\u2019re having to wear headphones for long periods of time, and Bose really nailed the ergonomics here. The plush ear cushions create a seal without excessive clamping pressure against your head. The headband distributes weight evenly around your head, so you won\u2019t feel soreness building up after a few hours. It feels premium in terms of build without being heavy, treading a nice line between durability and wearability. The on-board microphone handles calls clearly enough for professional conversations. Colleagues and family members will hear you sans that muffled, distant quality that plagues many Bluetooth headphones. Wind noise reduction helps when you\u2019re taking calls outdoors or in less-than-ideal conditions. It won\u2019t replace a dedicated desktop setup for podcasting, but the mic performs quite well for everyday voice communication. Bluetooth connectivity has been rock solid in real-world use: the headphones pair quickly and connections have remained stable even in busy wireless environments. Multipoint pairing lets you stay connected to two devices at once, perfect for toggling between your laptop and your phone. The Bose app offers further customizations, including adjustable EQ, ANC levels, and shortcut button assignments. At $199, the Bose QuietComfort headphones are outstanding value in the premium ANC category. You\u2019re getting legendary noise cancellation, refined sound quality, all-day battery life, and exceptional comfort from a brand that pioneered this entire product segment.

Smart lighting turns any room from ordinary to extraordinary with a tap of your phone. Philips Hue lightstrips tuck behind TVs, under cabinets, along staircases or around ceiling edges to create ambient glow that sets the perfect mood. The trick is buying several to really tie a space together and Black Friday finally makes that affordable: Amazon has dropped the 10-foot Solo light strip to $46, down from $76 (40% off). This is the lowest price ever recorded and you won\u2019t find Philips Hue discounts anywhere else during this sale period. See at Amazon Cheap LED strips are flooding the market but Philips Hue earns its reputation through superior color accuracy and build quality. That sets this strip apart from basic RGB alternatives that inevitably have issues delivering clean white light. Most budget strips attempt to achieve white tones by blending red, green, and blue LEDs together which is what causes that weird purple or green tint you\u2019ve probably seen. Philips includes dedicated warm and cool white LEDs solely to deliver pure, natural whites alongside the full color spectrum. Brightness counts when you\u2019re lighting up larger spaces, and the Philips light strip delivers 1700 lumens of output. That\u2019s enough to serve as functional accent lighting rather than just decorative glow. You can use it as under-cabinet task lighting in the kitchen or soft ambient illumination behind a media center. The premium silicone sleeve with a milky white finish diffuses the light for even dispersion, eliminating those harsh LED hotspots that make cheaper strips look cheap. Installation takes minutes with the adhesive backing built into the strip: Just peel off the protective layer, stick it where you want it, and plug it in. You can cut this strip to size for your particular space, but you won\u2019t be able to reconnect the pieces once they\u2019re cut. Do your planning in advance to save a headache. The 10-foot length works perfectly for TV backlighting, bed frames, desk setups, or shorter ceiling runs around a room. The Philips Hue app unlocks your lightstrip\u2019s full potential once you\u2019re all set up. You can choose from 16 million colors and adjust brightness levels to your liking with real precision. Once you start creating scenes that match your activities, it gets addictive: Be it movie nights with a warm orange glow, morning routines with energizing daylight tones or late-night gaming with deep purple ambiance-all in one strip. Voice control integration through Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Homekit works seamlessly. Telling your speaker to dim the lights or change colors feels genuinely futuristic the first few times you do it. Hands-free control proves especially useful when you\u2019re cooking, lounging on the couch, or turning in for bed. The lightstrip responds quickly to commands with no noticeable lag. You can also group it with other smart devices for coordinated whole-home automation. Adding a Philips Hue Bridge extends the functionality of your lightstrip even further: The Bridge enables various forms of automation such as having the lights sync with sunrise and sunset times, or having specific scenes turn on when you arrive home. It offers you much more stable connectivity and allows for control from anywhere through the cloud. Compatible with Matter, your Hue system will work seamlessly with other smart home ecosystems. At $46, this Philips Hue Solo light strip is a great value in premium smart lighting. You\u2019re getting true RGBWW color accuracy, impressive 1700-lumen brightness, seamless smart home integration, and the reliability of an established brand.

Competition in premium headphones has never been as fierce as it is currently with Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats in a heated contest over the over-ear market. Each brand brings legitimate quality to the table which makes choosing sound alone an increasingly difficult decision. The tiebreaker becomes price when comparable products are competing at similar performance, and Beats just made that decision incredibly easy. Amazon just crushed the Beats Studio Pro to $149 for Black Friday, down from $349, delivering a 57% discount no competitor can match. See at Amazon The battery endurance is up to 40 hours of playback with active noise cancellation on, beating what Sony, Bose, and Apple offer at any price. You charge these headphones once and use them for an entire week of commuting, working, and exercising without seeing low battery warnings. The extended runtime transforms how you think about wireless headphones since charging becomes a weekly ritual rather than a daily annoyance. Fast Fuel charging adds 4 hours of playback from just 10 minutes of charging when you forget to plug in overnight. Lossless audio via USB-C (paired with compatible sources over cable) provides audio quality that even an audiophile can appreciate. Wired mode switches off Bluetooth compression entirely, ensuring studio-quality playback that simply can\u2019t be replicated by wireless transmission. Three built-in sound profiles allow the listener to tailor the listening experience to the content or personal preference. This custom acoustic platform creates rich and immersive sound that is on par with many headphones costing considerably more. The bass response remains controlled without bleeding into midrange frequencies, and the vocals sit clearly atop the mix. High frequencies extend smoothly without any harshness to cause fatigue in long listening sessions. Fully adaptive active noise cancellation continuously adjusts based on your environment and fit on your head. The system monitors external noise and internal seal and optimizes cancellation in real time as conditions change. Transparency mode lets outside sound through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Switching between modes happens instantly through on-ear controls without interrupting playback. Personalized spatial audio with dynamic head tracking provides a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience. The system interacts with your head movements and adjusts audio placement to maintain the exact positioning of the sound elements, even as you move your head to either side. This technology works with compatible content to accurately place instruments and vocals in three-dimensional space around you. Improved compatibility works seamlessly across both Apple and Android ecosystems. One-touch pairing connects straight away to iPhones via the Apple chip inside, while similar quick-pairing functionality is in place for Android devices. Native features work across the board, unlike some competitors, where specific operating systems receive the best features. On-ear controls manage music playback, phone calls, and voice assistant activation without reaching for your phone. The physical buttons offer a type of tactile feedback that touch controls can\u2019t compete with, enabling adjustments to be done without looking or removing the headphones. Siri, Google Assistant, or other voice assistants are activated with the press of a button for hands-free queries. For $149, you get premium noise-cancelling headphones with 40-hour battery life and lossless audio for 57% off of its MSRP, which puts it below budget competition offering far less value. Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra are $300-$400 options that don\u2019t offer near the same level of battery life.

The portable power station market gets fiercely competitive during Black Friday, with brands like Jackery and Anker dropping prices to the $350-400 range. Here\u2019s the thing though: most of those deals cap out at 1,500W output. Ecoflow just changed the equation by slashing the Delta 2 to $349, down from $699 and you\u2019re getting here 1,800W of continuous power for less than competitors charge for their smaller units. This 50% discount marks the all-time lowest price for a power station in this performance class, and it probably won\u2019t last long. See at Amazon The 1,800W output puts the Delta 2 in a different league than most portable power stations in this price range. That extra 300W compared to 1,500W competitors might sound modest on paper but it opens up a whole new category of appliances you can run. Power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, and small space heaters suddenly become viable options. The 2,700W surge capacity handles startup spikes from compressors and motors without breaking a sweat. You\u2019re essentially getting mid-tier performance at entry-level pricing. The 1,024Wh capacity provides enough juice to keep your essentials running during extended outages or off-grid adventures. A full charge can power a mini fridge for about a day or keep your phones and laptops topped up for a week. Ecoflow designed the Delta 2 to be expandable too, so you can add extra batteries down the line if your needs grow. LiFePO4 battery chemistry gives the Delta 2 a serious longevity advantage over traditional lithium-ion power stations: This type of battery maintains over 80% capacity after 3,000 charge cycles which translates to roughly a decade of regular use. The chemistry is also inherently safer with better thermal stability and reduced fire risk. You can store it in your garage or RV without worrying about temperature extremes causing problems. Charging speed is where EcoFlow really flexes its engineering muscle: The Delta 2 goes from empty to 80% in just 50 minutes using a standard wall outlet, with no bulky external brick required. Solar charging maxes out at 500W input, so a couple of panels can fully recharge the unit in a few hours on a sunny day. You can even combine AC and solar charging simultaneously for maximum speed. That rapid turnaround keeps you powered up and ready to go when time matters. The port selection covers pretty much every charging scenario you might encounter. Six AC outlets handle your larger appliances and power tools, while the 100W USB-C port delivers laptop-level charging speeds. Four additional USB-A ports and a 12V car outlet round out the options. Everything can run simultaneously without juggling or prioritizing devices. The built-in display shows real-time input and output wattage along with remaining capacity. At $349, the EcoFlow Delta 2 delivers unmatched value in the portable power station category. You\u2019re getting 1,800W output, LiFePO4 durability, ultra-fast charging, and expandable capacity for less than competitors charge for inferior specs. This Black Friday deal essentially gives you a $700 power station at half price. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

In 2017, Google was criticized for a bad emoji. This week, CEO Sundar Pichai fixed it. How he did this says a lot about the progress Google has made in generative AI. The internet giant schooled the rest of the tech industry when it launched its latest model, Gemini 3, on Tuesday. It followed that up by rolling out an upgraded image-generation tool called Nano Banana Pro, which is churning out impressive, realistic pictures, diagrams, and charts. Google proved that AI scaling laws still work, just as its rivals are being questioned. The stock jumped to a record, making the company worth more than Microsoft. This is all a long way from 2017. Back then, Google rolled out a cheeseburger emoji for Android smartphones. It had the cheese under the meat. Absolute scandal. I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top pic.twitter.com\/PgXmCkY3Yc Pichai apologized and said Google would get working on a fix immediately, in a joking kind of way. Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday:) if folks can agree on the correct way to do this! https:\/\/t.co\/dXRuZnX1Ag Fast forward to this week with the launch of Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro. These new AI models are much better at creating and rendering images. Their understanding of 3D space and how the world works, physics-wise, has improved so much that they now absolutely nail the cheeseburger stack. Pichai tweeted an AI-generated image out to prove the point, writing \"iykyk\" as a nod to the 2017 furor. As you can see, the earth has been set back on its correct axis, and we can all calm down: the cheese is above the meat. iykyk pic.twitter.com\/LCqGm5VSQf OK, it's time to get serious. Why am I telling you this? The ability of AI models to innately understand where stuff should go in the world is really important. \"Normally, AI models struggle with spatial orientation, particularly with respect to the relative position of objects,\" Balaji Srinivasan, a tech investor and former Coinbase CTO, wrote on X after Pichai's latest burger post. \"But this image (if rendered by Gemini 3) seems to resolve that issue, as the exact spatial positioning of the cheese is handled correctly and precisely.\" If AI models can know where cheese should go in a burger, they might also know where more important stuff should be in the real world. That could mean better machine decision-making in design, engineering, and other fields. One theoretical example: A safety barrier likely needs to be placed in the right spot on the corner of a road. Maybe AI models can guide workers to put this structure in exactly the best spot, down to the millimeter. There's another takeaway from this eight-year cheeseburger saga. Google has been criticized for being behind in generative AI, and this week's releases have finally put those questions to bed. Powerful products like Gemini 3 take many years, and a lot of technical research and plumbing, to pull off. Google has been working at this for a very long time, and Pichai has been pushing the company toward an AI-first mindset for about a decade. Now the fruits of these labors are showing through. \"Google really did drop everything they were doing to truly focus on AI. And Gemini 3 represents the moment when they actually retook the lead, at least for now,\" Srinivasan wrote. \"When combined with Sundar doubling Google's revenue to $100B, he's proven he can lead Google to unprecedented heights both technologically and commercially.\" \"Hence: iykyk. If you know, you know,\" he added. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"The Eiliko is so much cooler than a Labubu and \u00a310\/$10 off for Black Friday.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Like robots? ME TOO. Not everyone is a fan, and that's totally okay. But if you're looking for a unique deal this Black Friday, then let me introduce you to the Eilik robot \u2013 which is currently $10 off over at Amazon in the US right now or just \u00a3139 in the UK. I know a $10 discount isn't a lot, but we almost never see discounts on cool tech like this, and I've been wanting an Eilik for about 2 years now, since I first wrote about these AI desk pets taking over workspaces in 2023. Not only is it absolutely adorable, but you can get a smaller, portable, keychain version too with the brand new Eiliko robot, which was launched via Kickstarter in August this year. There's a deal on this mini robot companion too, but only in the UK at the moment, where you can get it for \u00a310 less at a price of \u00a359.90 at Amazon. Whichever robot you choose (it also comes in pink or silver), I have all the details for you below. I can almost guarantee an Eilik would be a lot more fun to have around than a boring Labubu or motionless action figure. Priced at $139.99\/ \u00a3139.99, the Eilik certainly isn't cheap. But when you think about how much you might spend on LEGO sets or action figures that once built, do nothing, then the price of an Eilik and the interactivity it offers isn't so bad. I'm yet to make the purchase myself,  but I'm sure the intrigue might get the better of me at some point.\u00a0 How would you feel about having a robot companion the size of a keychain? These \"pets\" are a branch of emotional intelligence robots designed to broaden the social interactions that humans have with AI devices, and they're pretty dang cute too.  Without sounding miserable, life can be incredibly boring. Especially if you work an office job or a 9-5. What's life without a little whimsy, eh? A desk pet can be a fun way to liven up your office space if only for a while. The Eilik robot in particular is one of the coolest things you can buy to sit on your desk, and it can keep you entertained with interactivity that includes dancing to music, responding to touch, reacting to its surroundings (including a rational fear of heights), and it can act as a helpful desk companion too, with features like a countdown timer to keep you on schedule, and it can play fun games with you to help pass the time. Its hands also have built-in magnets for holding accessories, and Energize Labs suggests that there's even more fun to be had if you get Eilik a friend, as these desk robots can interact with one another through friendship or the occasional fight, which I'd love to see. Believe it or not, the Eilik \/ Eiliko bots are actually very reasonably priced compared with others on the market. For example, I recently wrote about a hideous AI companion robot called the Moflin, created by CASIO, which retails for almost \u00a3400. You can get AI robots that look like smartphones on wheels (the LOOI Robot) for around $150. There's also the Anki Cozmo and Vector robots, which are admittedly really cool, but can only be had for just under \u00a3500. The Aibi Pocket Pet is $299, the new Loona robot by KEYi Tech is essentially a robot dog (with ChatGPT-4o) for $500, and I dread to think how much the Samsung Ballie will cost once it's released. As for cheaper alternatives, there aren't many. You can get a Smart Pet Planter for around $60 on Amazon, but that's the best I can find unless you opt for a high-tech Tamagotchi. Want to know the best thing I have on my gaming shelf? It's an interactive Hasbro talking Deadpool head, and it's also currently on sale at Amazon for $119.95 down from $140, and in the UK for just \u00a373.99. It's a purchase you seriously won't regret and you can talk to it for HOURS. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

The future of commuter aviation may be a teal-green octocopter that has yet to take flight. As traffic worsens in major cities worldwide, aviation companies are betting that more consumers will soon opt to fly above the gridlock using a radical new technology that aims to cut the costs and noise of piloted helicopters. Enter the electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) \u2014 zero-emission air taxis that lift off like helicopters but fly like airplanes. This fast-growing market, still in its early days, is expected to reach at least $4 billion by 2030, but achieving its lofty goals hinges on persuading travelers of the eVTOLs' convenience and safety. One frontrunner is Brazil-based Eve Air Mobility, a division of Embraer \u2014 the world's third-biggest planemaker behind Airbus and Boeing. Its CEO, Johann Bordais, told Business Insider that the new Eve eVTOL is expected to enter service by 2027 and will be more affordable than helicopters. \"The safety level, operating cost, and quietness of the eVTOL make it better than the helicopters flying today,\" he said. Customers can expect the buzzing sky taxis over cities like Manhattan and S\u00e3o Paulo for airport transfers, ride-hailing, and sightseeing. Bordais added that Eve is designed to one day need no pilot \u2014 it'll be like the Waymo of the skies. The focus on eVTOLs comes as other major players, including Hyundai's Supernal and Airbus' CityAirbus NextGen, have paused their electric-taxi programs this year. Still, Embraer \u2014 which has already presold hundreds of units to United and SkyWest \u2014 has yet to fly a full-scale prototype, while two California rivals have. Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, partnered with Delta and United, respectively, showcased their eVTOLs to the public at a California airshow in October. Both are targeting 2026 launches as they race to carry the first passengers. Bordais said he isn't fazed: \"Flying a prototype is one thing; going through certification is another.\" He said Embraer is prioritizing engineering and modeling all systems and subsystems to meet operator needs and federal standards before flying what will be its first eVTOL airframe. He added that Embraer's decades of experience certifying commercial, military, and private aircraft give it a major edge: \"Certification is a milestone, and we've been through those milestones before,\" he said. Here's what customers can expect onboard Eve. Eve is meant to whisk passengers within minutes between major cities like Manhattan or S\u00e3o Paulo and their airports. A simulation on Eve's website shows a hop from Miami International Airport to South Beach would take 15 minutes. Eve is built with extensive redundancy \u2014 eight rotors and multiple battery packs \u2014 so if one component fails, others take over. It's like how an airplane can safely fly on just one jet engine if the other fails. Many target markets already have heliports or vertiports, and Bordais said the US alone has over 5,000 airports. Scaling up, however, requires investments in charging stations, ground support, and other infrastructure. Embraer is working with countries including Bahrain, the US, the UK, Singapore, and Costa Rica to develop vertiports and support urban air mobility. Bordais said Eve is designed to reduce the pilot's workload, allowing them to focus on flying. But, he said, it's also built to eventually be pilotless. Without a pilot, the eVTOL could be configured for six passengers instead of four. \"We're talking about inserting autonomous and non-autonomous aircraft into the airspace,\" Bordais said. \"It's a journey of how to do this.\" Andy Day, the SVP of operations at the private aviation safety risk management firm Wyvern, told Business Insider that he would \"never be okay with completely autonomous aircraft\" and that you can't replace a human's reaction and intuitiveness in an emergency situation. Companies like Airbus, Bulgaria's Dronamic, and American planemaker Pyka are working toward autonomous flight. Bordais said Eve's first full-scale prototype is expected to fly within two months. It will serve as a \"knowledge accelerator,\" but it's not part of the certification process. Eve has completed nearly a dozen campaigns evaluating aspects such as propeller efficiency and noise, as well as rotor behavior while the aircraft transitions between vertical movement and forward flight. Eve would be a workhorse for airlines. United, for example, aims to build a network in San Francisco and has entered into a conditional purchase agreement for 200 Eve eVTOLs. Bordais didn't offer fare estimates but said air taxi fares are trending downward with new technology. \"Would we want to see Manhattan to [New York] JFK be $220 or $250? Yes, but it's going to be up to the operator to decide the price,\" he said, adding that eVTOLs are expected to be cheaper than helicopters. Based on midday rates on a recent Wednesday, an UberBlack from New York-JFK to Grand Central Terminal costs $172 for the entire car. Joby and Archer would charge per seat, so an eVTOL ride would be $508 for a family of four. The car is cheaper, but, based on average drive times, the UberBlack would take at least three times as long as Eve's 10-minute hop. Safety is crucial, especially amid a negative public perception stemming from two high-profile helicopter crashes in 2025. Bordais said Eve's propellers are off during boarding \u2014 unlike a helicopter's spinning blades \u2014 and the aircraft can glide during a power loss, making it more survivable during forward flight than a helicopter's auto-rotation. \"Embraer has a long history of making safe airplanes that fly 100 million people a year,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"                 Reading time 2 minutes        Following the success of New Glenn\u2019s second test flight, Blue Origin announced a super-heavy variant of its rocket that could compete with SpaceX\u2019s Starship. Jeff Bezos\u2019 rocket company unveiled the new design for its rocket, named New Glenn 9\u00d74 for the number of engines it boasts on the booster and upper stage. That\u2019s an increase of two engines for each stage from New Glenn\u2019s current design, which features seven engines on the booster and two on the upper stage. \u201cThe next chapter in New Glenn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roadmap is a new super-heavy class rocket,\u201d Blue Origin wrote in a statement. The company recently launched New Glenn for its second mission, sending NASA\u2019s ESCAPADE mission on its way to Mars. Although Blue Origin didn\u2019t specify when it would start launching the larger variant of New Glenn, the rocket has a packed schedule for 2026 and 2027. Blue Origin debuted its New Glenn rocket in January after years of delays. The rocket\u2019s inaugural flight didn\u2019t go so smoothly, with the company failing to recover the booster during its descent. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration laid out seven corrective measures for the rocket to fly again, and its second mission was a major success for the company. Now, Blue Origin is focusing on going bigger. Outfitted with nine engines on the booster and four on the upper stage, the added thrust will allow the new New Glenn to lift more than 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit, over 14 metric tons directly to geosynchronous orbit, and over 20 metric tons to trans-lunar injection. That\u2019s way below Starship\u2019s capability of carrying up to 150 metric tons to low Earth orbit, but it\u2019s a powerful launch vehicle nonetheless.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"In 1986, Hyundai launched the second-cheapest car the United States had ever seen: The Hyundai Excel, which had an MSRP of $4,995 (about $14,800 in 2025). Since then, it's doubled down on the affordability strategy to undercut budget car competitors like Honda and Toyota. In fact, Hyundai Motor Group's average transaction price as of April 2025 was about $37,674 (via Cox Automotive), whereas the industry average hovers just under $50,000. As such, you'll find multiple Hyundai models on Consumer Reports' list of best cheap cars. Historically, though, Hyundai's reliability \u2014 especially on Consumer Reports' findings\u00a0\u2014 has had mixed receptions; the cars were cheap, but their reliability remained questionable. But that's been changing in recent years, and now, some of Hyundai's offerings are outranking those of rivals. Hyundai Motor Group placed second among mass market brands in the\u00a02025 J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study, and now the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid ranks seventh on Consumer Reports' 2025 list of the 10 most reliable cars, with an aggregated reliability score of 79 out of 100. Consumer Reports calculates this score based on member survey data from hundreds of thousands of vehicles. It tracks 20 trouble areas across vital parts of cars, including transmission, cooling, brakes, engine, body hardware, and, for electrified cars, motor, battery, and charging. The Elantra Hybrid is the only Hyundai that made the list, and with its $25,450 starting price, it's tied for third as the cheapest on the list, after the Toyota Corolla and Toyota Corolla Hybrid. Despite not making Consumer Reports' reliability list this year, the non-hybrid Hyundai Elantra is already one of the most reliable cars to buy used. The hybrid shares the same body shell, using the same third-generation K3 compact platform. Therefore, they share the same\u00a0size and space: 99.4 cubic feet for passenger volume and 14.2 cubic feet for cargo. They also have the same general features and infotainment systems, which means the hybrid carries over some of the reliability from the gas version. However, the Elantra Hybrid brings its own hybrid powertrain and a new multilink rear suspension system, which experts\u00a0say should be a notable improvement from the torsion beam system used in the basic non-hybrid version. Reviews,\u00a0 like the one on Car and Driver, don't tout this as an exciting car to drive; the emphasis is on looks, economy, efficiency, and everyday comfort. The Elantra Hybrid pairs a relatively weak 1.6-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with a 32kW electric motor and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, producing a combined 139 horsepower. It may not be built for speed and excitement, but drivers praise it for its smooth ride and stellar fuel economy \u2014 up to 54 miles per gallon\u00a0for city and highway combined on the base Blue trim, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It's a solid choice for non-enthusiast retirees or economy daily drivers who need something affordable, reliable, and comfortable. The 2025 Elantra Hybrid comes in three trims: base Blue with a starting MSRP of $25,450, SEL Sport with a starting MSRP of\u00a0$27,425, and Limited with a starting MSRP of\u00a0$29,800. All in all, these prices are competitive for new hybrid sedans, since the base trim undercuts both the Civic Hybrid and Prius \u2014 the only way to really get much lower is to buy used but cheap hybrids, which can dip well under $15,000.\u00a0The Sport doesn't come with better specs but adds gloss black wheels, a spoiler, sport pedals, and quality-of-life improvements; meanwhile, the Limited adds more driver aids, upgraded audio, and even more quality-of-life improvements. However, the base Blue also offers the best fuel economy at 54 combined MPG compared to the 50 MPG you'd get from the other two more expensive trims. For context, 2023 model year cars have an average MPG of 27.1.\u00a0The fuel economy of the base hybrid Elantra is more than double that, meaning double the savings. It also places high on the 2025 hybrid fuel economy leaderboard, although not by very much. As for maintenance, you're\u00a0covered for the first 10 years or 100,000 miles (whichever comes first) for the powertrain. Hyundai also has robust maintenance warranties, offering powertrain repairs or replacements, hybrid\/electric battery guarantees of no more than 70% degradation for 10 years, roadside assistance for five years, and other packages. In short, you likely won't be spending much on this car after you buy it.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Liquidation calls from the sidelines are growing louder for Strategy (MSTR) as bitcoin tumbles and the company's common stock has plunged nearly 70% from last year's peak, calling into question \u2014 for some \u2014 the firm's ability to continue to meet its obligations. Throughout 2025, Strategy has relied on perpetual preferred stock as its primary financing vehicle for bitcoin purchases, while mostly using at-the-market (ATM) common share issuance mainly to cover its preferred dividend obligations. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company issued four U.S.-listed preferred series during the year: Strike (STRK) pays an 8% fixed dividend and is convertible into common stock at $1,000 per share. Strife (STRF) carries a 10% fixed non cumulative dividend and ranks as the most senior of the preferreds. STRD$0.05498 also pays 10% but on cumulative terms and sits junior in the structure. Stretch (STRC), the newest series, debuted in August at $90 with a 10.5% fixed cumulative dividend and now trades just above its offer price. As of Nov. 21 STRK trades near $73, an 11.1% current yield, with a 10% decline since issuance. STRD has been the weakest performer, falling to about $66 for a 15.2% yield and a 22% total return loss. STRF is the only series still above issue, trading around $94 and delivering roughly an 11% gain, reflecting its senior standing. Bitcoin's plunge over the past weeks has market participants focusing on the roughly $74,400 level at which Strategy \u2014 after more than five years of accumulation \u2014\u00a0would actually be in the red on its bitcoin holdings. While that's surely an important level for talking points, a decline below $74,400 surely does not mean the company would face a margin call or need to engage in forced sales of any part of its BTC stack. The nearest structural pressure point is almost two years out on September 15 2027, when holders of the $1 billion 0.625% convertible senior notes receive their first put option.  The notes were priced when MSTR traded at $130.85 and carry a conversion price of $183.19. With the stock now at about $168, holders would be unlikely to convert and would probably seek cash repayment, potentially requiring Strategy to raise or liquidate assets unless the share price rises meaningfully before 2027. Even if the MSTR share valuation premium to bitcoin holdings (the mNAV) collapses further and maybe even goes to a discount, Strategy still has a clear path to cover the annual preferred dividend bill. The company can continue to issue common shares via ATM offerings, or sell small slices of its bitcoin treasury, or even pay dividends in-kind with newly issued stock. This isn't to say all is well. While preferred dividends are not at immediate risk, use of any of the above options would surely dent investor confidence in Strategy even further, likely putting to an end \u2014\u00a0for at least a temporary time \u2014 any efforts to raise additional capital for more bitcoin purchases.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Save money (and the planet) on a new iPad  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  iPads are among the most popular products in any year's slate of Black Friday Apple deals, but even with discounts applied, the best iPads are expensive bits of kit. That said, I\u2019ve been covering Black Friday sales for years now, and I\u2019ve noticed a significant iPad-related sea change this year: refurbished tech products \u2013 and in particular, refurbished iPads \u2013 are even more discounted than usual. Refurbished gadgets aren\u2019t new, with some major and specialist retailers having built up a reputation for sprucing up pre-loved tech. But I\u2019ve never seen so many early Black Friday deals appear for iPads, specifically, which means there\u2019s scope for you to save loads of money if you know what to look for. In fact, I bought a refurbished iPad several years ago, so I can guide you through what to know about the tech and what to expect from these deals.      Refurbished tech is gadgetery that's been professionally serviced; experts will make sure it works to a high standard, sometimes conducting tests or replacing parts, though the exact process varies from retailer to retailer. It's not the same as pre-owned tech, which will often be sold without these (or any other) assurances. I bought my refurbished iPad for one key reason: it was cheaper than buying a brand-new model. I bought it from Apple's own refurb store, so I could trust that it'd be up to a high standard \u2013 and it was. If you gave me a new iPad alongside an Apple-refurbished model, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Even the packaging was very similar, subconsciously telling me, \"this isn't some cheap leftover, but a fully-functioning tablet.\" There are other reasons that people opt to buy refurbished, the primary one being the environmental aspect. There's no denying that we're in an e-waste crisis, with the World Health Organization citing electronic products as one of the fastest-growing solid waste streams. And by keeping a gadget in circulation, you save it from going to landfill and also avoid more rare earth materials being used for the new device you'd be buying instead. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Those are the big-ticket reasons for buying refurbished, but I'm going to list you two more that are just as relevant for some people. Firstly, buying refurbished gives you a way of getting older gadgets that a manufacturer has stopped selling. If you want to get a past-generation iPad, for instance, Apple and major retailers might not have any, but refurbs come to the rescue. Secondly, and perhaps more anecdotally, I see amazing deals around refurbished gadgets. While 10% off an iPad is often seen as a great discount during Black Friday, I'm used to seeing much bigger reductions on refurbished models (and that's a discount over the already-cheaper price).      I've had my refurb for three years now; it was a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021), so when I bought it in late 2022, it wasn't from the newest range. I didn't mind it being older, since I'd been happily using one of TechRadar's 2018 models for years with no problems, but the 2022 model was also too recent to have any refurb stock. Honestly, I've never looked back. Three years on, the battery still lasts as well as it ever did (admittedly, that's not saying much, given how poor iPad battery lives are), which is the main worry I had when buying refurbished. I've never had any issues with it, and I use it almost every day for various tasks (well, apart from abandoning it recently for an ereader). In fact, it's fared a lot better than the peripherals I bought alongside it, as the new Apple Pencil I picked up at the same time broke a year ago. I've already documented my attempt to find a cheap knock-off iPad stylus, though I've just noticed that Apple and Back Market sell refurbished styli too. I'm also glad I bought an iPad when I did: newer Pro models are stuffed full of specs I don't need (why do I need an M5 chip on a device I'm using for drawing and typing?), and I can bypass Apple's insistence on useless AI features by simply not updating my iPad.      This isn't the first time I've written about this refurb purchase for TechRadar, having waxed lyrical about it a few years ago to encourage people to follow in my footsteps. But I've noticed changes in the refurb market since then. When I first started writing about refurbished tech and bought my iPad, you really had to hunt down retailers. Back Market was the only major one I knew about, but it hadn't started promoting itself as insistently as it does now (which was arguably a good thing; I'm plagued by its low-effort YouTube ads). Apple's own refurbished line is something I only heard about from a friend, and I'd have never thought to buy from the company if it wasn't for that mention. Back then, major retailers didn't stock refurbished gadgets, and it was something of a fringe topic, even for someone writing for a tech website! Nowadays, it's very easy to go onto your chosen shop's website and find pre-loved devices listed alongside new ones. I was surprised, covering early Black Friday deals this year, by just how many I was finding on refurbished tech. It's not just iPads and smartphones now; I've been very tempted to buy one of the many Black Friday PS5 deals, and you can also find laptops, earbuds, home hubs, and even printers. And that's a good thing all around: cheaper tech, greener purchasing. Like I said, I've seen quite a few good refurbished deals so far already, and more will come and go as Black Friday gets closer. They don't always last long; refurbs naturally have lower stock than new models. So, instead of listing specific deals, I'm going to share a few places you should go to look for refurbished tech. I'll list the perks of buying from their respective refurbished programs, too, which is often important.

Plastic webcam covers\u2014especially of the sliding kind\u2014boomed in popularity sometime in the 2010s as a low-tech way to keep hackers from eavesdropping on compromised machines. The concern felt justified at the time. But by 2020, Apple was beginning to issue warnings that those covers aren\u2019t actually needed and can even damage a MacBook\u2019s display. For this Security Bite, let\u2019s set the tin-foil hats aside and talk about why webcam covers don\u2019t meaningfully improve privacy, can cause features like True Tone to not work properly, and are far more likely to damage your screen than stop someone from spying on you.  On more modern Macs\u2014those with Apple Silicon and Intel (post-2008)\u2014a malicious hacker can\u2019t turn on your webcam without also triggering the green privacy indicator. The camera module hardware doesn\u2019t allow it. Macs produced before 2008 are a different story, though. Security researchers at Johns Hopkins published a 2013 paper showing that Macs released prior to 2008 could, under certain advanced attacks, be coerced into powering the camera without the green LED indicator. It makes sense considering back then, Apple tied the camera sensor and indicator together with software. However, this changed in late 2008, when Apple redesigned the camera module so the sensor and the green light share the same physical circuit. This way, the camera couldn\u2019t receive power unless the LED did too. Fast-forward to today, and there\u2019s still no known malware capable of bypassing that hardware design, likely because there\u2019s no software to compromise anymore. Apart from the danger to privacy, there\u2019s also a danger of seriously cracking your MacBook\u2019s screen. Apple explicitly warns against closing a MacBook (Air or Pro) with anything thicker than 0.1 mm\u2014basically a sheet of paper\u2014between the display and the chassis. Today\u2019s Retina panels are super thin and sit on extremely tight hinge tolerances. When you stick a cover over the camera and close the lid, you\u2019re applying pressure to a concentrated spot on one of the most fragile parts of the screen. I wouldn\u2019t dream of putting one on my M4 MacBook Air daily driver, which already shows ghostly marks where the display presses against the keyboard in my backpack.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"     Here's what you get with the stripped-down Model Y and Model 3.    The Tesla Model Y Standard model in white. Notice that the front has standard headlights instead of the light bar found on the original version. Tesla has launched a range of more affordable electric cars, which are stripped-back versions of the\u00a0refreshed Model Y\u00a0and\u00a0Model 3. These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to step into Tesla ownership.  This change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\u00a0  The idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.  It comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from\u00a0Kelley Blue Book, the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.  This is what the rear of the Tesla Model Y Standard looks like. It has the same light bar as the regular version. The Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.  Inside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\u00a0  Tesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.  Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. The rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.  The Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\u00a0  The front of a Tesla Model 3 Standard driving along a road. It looks identical to the regular Model 3. Meanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\u00a0  Tesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.  It retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\u00a0  Charging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.  Both cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\u00a0  Full Self-Driving is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.  I think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\u00a0  In my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.  Pricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\u00a0  For now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Apple announced the redesigned Mac mini with M4 chip last October. It\u2019s by no means a new product at this point, and it\u2019s nearly a year old. However, I think it may be one of Apple\u2019s greatest gifts to up and coming creators, developers, and all sorts of creative professionals. It\u2019s no secret that Apple Silicon has enabled Apple to ship far more performant chipsets in lower end machines. Before the transition to Apple Silicon, a MacBook Air being able to edit 4K video sufficiently was nothing but a dream. Wanted to compile an Xcode project on your lap with an Intel MacBook Air? Good luck. Apple Silicon, in a way, made Macs much more affordable. You no longer needed a 16\u2033 MacBook Pro, for example, to get a high-end chipset in a laptop. On top of that, certain Macs straight up became less expensive. The 2018 Mac mini used to start at $799, and it lowered to just $699 with the M1 model. With the M2 model, it became $599. I know a lot of people who used to buy high end 15\u2033 and 16\u2033 MacBook Pros in the Intel days, who were now able to get away with a MacBook Air with a couple RAM and SSD upgrades. It\u2019s a great thing. The new Mac mini takes high end performance at an affordable price-point to a new extreme. It equips 16GB of RAM by standard, which was previously a $200 upgrade. The M4 chip is also incredibly performant \u2013 and all of this is available in a package that you can purchase for just $479 with early Black Friday deals. In short, this computer is an incredible gift to any aspiring developers or creative professionals. Back when I bought my first Mac in 2019, if you wanted something for ~$500, you wouldn\u2019t get more than a dual core processor, and you certainly wouldn\u2019t be getting it brand new.  The barrier-to-entry to get into the Mac ecosystem is as low as it\u2019s ever been. That\u2019s something worth appreciating.  I picked up a refurbished Mac Mini M4 Pro a few weeks ago and haven't looked back. As a longtime iMac user it is not only much faster using my apps but smaller and cooler as well. M4 Mac mini is currently on sale for $479 on Amazon in the 256GB\/16GB configuration, $669 for 512GB\/16GB, $869 for 512GB\/24GB, and $1199 for an M4 Pro with 512GB\/24GB. These are the lowest prices seen to date. One last cool thing about the M4 Mac mini is the fact that it has removable SSDs. This allows you to upgrade your storage without paying Apple\u2019s high upgrade prices, if you\u2019re willing to open up your computer. Some third party SSDs are already on the market, and you can watch us install one of them on our YouTube channel.

Bags nearly $14 billion in revenue.  Reading time: 2 minutes Samsung has enjoyed being the top dog in the global DRAM market for many years. It has lately been under pressure from cross-town rival SK Hynix which dethroned it as the leading global DRAM supplier earlier this year.  After a solid recent quarter, Samsung has once again emerged as the leading company in this highly lucrative market.   According to reports, Samsung became the number one vendor by revenue in the global DRAM market in Q3 2025. Its revenue for the quarter came in at $13.942 billion, a nearly 30% jump from the previous quarter. The stellar performance enabled Samsung to expand its market share to 34.8%.  Samsung had lagged behind SK Hynix earlier this year primarily due to slow high-bandwidth memory sales. The company was struggling with getting traction for its HBM products, particularly HBM3e, as key approvals from major clients like NVIDIA were delayed. This enabled SK Hynix to capitalize on the opportunity to leap ahead of Samsung.  SK Hynix is still highly competitive, despite losing the top spot to Samsung. Its earnings for Q3 2025 came in at $13.79 billion with a market share of 34.4%. The two companies are still neck and neck so we may see this crown changing hands in the near future.   The coming quarters are likely to be highly profitable for memory chip companies like Samsung. Intense demand for AI chips are pushing memory chips into super cycle territory. Samsung is already said to have hiked prices for some memory products by up to 60%, showcasing its ability to capitalize on opportunities in the market to increase the bottom line.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Immortalize your epic gaming triumphs with the Elgato 4K S Capture Card, now on sale for $25 off  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  While many modern consoles and PCs have built-in software to capture gameplay footage and screenshots, having a capture card is a much better method as they can record with higher video quality without causing in-game lag. One of the best capture cards we've ever found for gaming is the Elgato 4K S, which is currently having its $159.99 MSRP chopped by a modest 17% discount for $134.99 at Best Buy. The Elgato 4K S is a top-tier capture card that can record gameplay footage in crisp, beautiful 4K resolutions with 60fps or 1440p resolutions with solid 120fps thanks to its Full VRR and HDR10 pass-through.       Jez Corden, one of our highly-regarded tech experts who's been using Elgato capture cards for years, gave the Elgato 4K S a perfect review with 5\/5 stars, stating that, \"The Elgato 4K S is the best capture card for anyone looking to record or stream gameplay from a video game console. The new software is far more streamlined than it was previously, and the captured footage is corruption-free and crisp every time.\" It features a sleek design, it's easy to use and install, and its bundled Elgato Studio software app is very intuitive and responsive for editing and storing footage.      Of course, the biggest draw of the Elgato 4K S is its video recording capabilities. This little beauty can record gameplay footage flawlessly with 4K resolutions at 60fps, 1440p at 120fps, or 1080p at 120fps without any corruption or artifacting. On top of that, the Elgato 4K S features full HDR10 and VRR pass-through to prevent your recorded footage from getting any screen-tearing while games are running in \"balanced\" graphics modes. The only drawbacks of this device are that it doesn't allow PC microphones to record your voice onto the footage directly unless you use its 3.5mm port, and that it's so lightweight that it's extremely prone to accidentally sliding off a table easily and being damaged. If you can ignore those issues, this is one of the best Xbox accessories you can have for recording gameplay footage for reviews or showing off your most epic boss kills in games like Elden Ring or Monster Hunter. The Elgato 4K S is now available with a 17% early Black Friday Discount for $134.99 at Best Buy or $134.99 at Amazon if the first option runs out of stock. To get this capture working on your PC, it must have the following minimum requirements: Windows 11 (64-bit) OS, an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU or an equivalent AMD Ryzen, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 10xx GPU, 8GB of RAM or higher, and a USB-C 3.0 port. It is compatible with Windows PC and laptops, maxOS laptops and computers, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, iPhones, iPads, Steam Deck, Samsung Galaxy phones, and Google Pixel phones.  No, it isn't, as the Elgato 4K S only has one HDMI input port to work with. While an HDMI splitter can let you switch sources, the capture card will only be able to record footage and screenshots from one console at a time. No, it can't. It requires being connected to a PC or an iPad in order to record footage from consoles, as it doesn't feature standalone tech to record footage onto an SD card. The Elgato 4K S is a top-tier capture card that can record gameplay footage in crisp, beautiful 4K resolutions with 60fps or 1440p resolutions with solid 120fps thanks to its Full VRR and HDR10 pass-through.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Written byOluwapelumi Adejumo Edited byMohammad Shahid Grayscale will introduce new exchange-traded fund products tied to Dogecoin and XRP on Nov. 24 after securing approval to list both vehicles on the New York Stock Exchange. The Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF (GDOG) and the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF (GXRP) will debut as spot ETPs holding their respective underlying tokens. The firm is converting its existing private trusts into fully listed ETFs, a move that represents a major liquidity event for current investors. GXRP will enter a market that already includes spot products from Canary Capital and Bitwise.  Those funds have drawn about $422 million in combined inflows during their first two weeks of trading, signaling early institutional interest in XRP-linked products. On the other hand, GDOG will be one of the first Dogecoin ETF available to US investors. Dogecoin, once a meme token, has grown into the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its deep retail following has made it one of the most frequently traded and discussed digital assets, a trend Grayscale expects will support ETF demand. Considering this, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said the product could attract as much as $11 million in volume on its first trading day. Grayscale Dogecoin ETF $GDOG approved for listing on NYSE, scheduled to begin trading Monday. Their XRP spot is also launching on Monday. $GLNK coming soon as well, week after I think pic.twitter.com\/c6nKUeDrtI GDOG and GXRP\u2019s launch broadens the mix of crypto ETFs available in the US market, extending the industry\u2019s expansion beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum products that dominated the initial wave of approvals. Their arrival also reflects shifting regulatory conditions in Washington. Both approvals are part of a broader acceleration in digital asset oversight under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins.  Since taking office, Atkins has moved the agency away from a \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d approach and toward a disclosure-focused framework.  Through his \u201cProject Crypto\u201d initiative, he has signaled that the SEC is open to reviewing compliant digital asset products, clearing the path for issuers seeking to list new ETFs.

I believe Apple\u2019s rise as the preferred device for IT teams comes from its focused approach to solving real problems first, then building the tools that make it easy for companies to connect their entire stack and have everything just work. While some companies in years past built their ecosystems around lock in and doing everything, Apple built its enterprise strategy around integration. The new collaboration between JumpCloud and Google Workspace is the latest reminder that the future of enterprise IT is not about competition. It is about cooperation for the customer, even when you compete at the same time.  \t\t\t\t\tUpgrade your doors with Apple Home Key and the Aqara U50.\t\t\t\t About Apple @ Work:\u00a0Bradley Chambers managed an enterprise IT network from 2009 to 2021. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise grade Wi-Fi, 1000s of Macs, and 1000s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments. The announcement of the Work Transformation Set, which combines JumpCloud\u2019s identity and device management platform with Google Workspace, is a strategic move for both companies. It shows that even in a world where companies compete fiercely in one area, they can still build together when it makes sense for the customer. In a previous generation, these companies, including Apple, would have tried to offer everything a customer needs and avoid partnerships. For years, IT teams have struggled with companies offering a half baked version of everything a company needs and then avoiding collaboration. I am all for both competition and cooperation. Apple fits naturally into this model. Managed Apple Accounts, federated authentication, and Platform SSO make Apple devices easy to integrate into any identity provider. Instead of forcing IT teams into a closed loop, Apple\u2019s ecosystem now works hand in hand with platforms like JumpCloud and Google Workspace. A Mac can be set up with the same credentials an employee uses for Gmail and automatically enrolled into management with zero friction. I love this. Even if Apple built out an SSO tool based on Managed Apple Accounts, they would still offer the deep integration with other companies as well. This is a win for customers.  \t\t\t\t\tAbode is the best home security system and includes compatibility with HomeKit.\t\t\t\t The old model of enterprise IT was built on rivalry and licensing. You picked a vendor and lived inside its walls. That approach is no longer effective in 2025. The future belongs to open ecosystems where the best tools in each category connect without friction. Google and JumpCloud\u2019s partnership shows how that future looks in practice. It is also proof that Apple\u2019s enterprise strategy is paying off. Even when Apple is not part of the headline, its devices are the endpoint of choice at work. That happens when a company focuses on making its technology work everywhere rather than trying to own every piece of the stack. The Work Transformation Set is a signal that modern IT is defined by cooperation. Google may compete with Apple in the hardware market. JumpCloud may overlap with other management platforms. They are offering a model that makes life easier to connect the tools a team might already be using in a way that helps customers. Apple\u2019s strength in the enterprise has always come from this kind of alignment. When companies that offer solutions in productivity, identity, and management all make Apple a first-class citizen, it is clear that cooperation has replaced competition as the real driver of innovation across the industry.  \t\t\t\t\tUpgrade your home security with wireless cameras that includes HomeKit compatibility.\t\t\t\t Apple @ Work is exclusively brought to you by Mosyle, the only Apple Unified Platform.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Investing  \t\t\t\t\tSending You to Google News in 3  \u00a9 Nuthawut Somsuk \/ iStock via Getty Images In a world that is full of potential market volatility, and maybe there is, maybe there isn\u2019t \u201cAI bubble,\u201d investors, mostly of the retail variety, are looking for a safe place to park their cash. As a result, ETFs have been surging in popularity in 2025 as hopeful investors want to go for a ride and earn money as the \u201cFAANG\u201d stocks push the market to new heights. As the world looks to 2026, investors are heading into this year with a new mindset. This is especially true as cash yields are slipping from recent highs and the bond world looks a little more uncertain as interest rates are likely to drop again, at least a few times in the next 12 months. Before 2026 arrives, there are three ETFs that stand out for investors who are looking for income stability, long-term performance, and broad diversification. Some of the best recommendations aren\u2019t high-yield funds, but ETFs, where their total return profiles have become essential for portfolios that rely on dividends and capital appreciation to fund retirement. For income investors who focus on yield, it\u2019s worth remembering that high yield without growth can lead to flat returns over time. This is a truth that most people need to acknowledge before 2026, in that their portfolios are going to need growth engines that work in parallel with dividend payouts to increase the overall value of their portfolio. Sadly, cash and CDs cannot do this, and they certainly can\u2019t do it alone. As a result, investors need to look at ETFs like the three options below and remind themselves that by investing in these options, they are doing what they need to do to avoid leaving money on the table that they might regret in the future. Investors looking for an ETF that might work well as the backbone of a portfolio should look no further than iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) as a durable and core holding that can be used to build a portfolio around. In 2025, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has returned 15.66% to shareholders year-to-date, and over 24.28% over the last 36 months. These returns exceeded category averages and help reinforce why total-market exposure can and still should play a role in an income strategy. The current 1.17% dividend yield and $7.76 annual dividend are almost certainly the most appealing aspects of this ETF. As cash yields fall, it\u2019s hard to ignore the benefits of something like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, which is full of large-cap US companies that are continuing to raise their dividends, all while delivering consistent earnings. The delivery on both sides helps make iShares Core S&P 500 ETF a foundational position inside investor portfolios. In the world of ETFs, the Invest QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) needs no introduction. While the Invest QQQ Trust isn\u2019t traditionally used as a dividend driver, it is offering a $2.84 annual dividend as of November 2025. Even with a low yield, the Invest QQQ Trust offers premium capital appreciation that is going to allow retirees to withdraw income without touching their principal. It\u2019s for this reason that this ETF is often viewed as a smart passive income enhancer. Better yet, the Invest QQQ Trust has delivered 20.07% YTD for investors and a wonderful 32.31% in the last three years. This is not only well above category averages, but names like Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, NVIDIA, and Meta are helping to drive growth, making the long-term story of the Invest QQQ trust feel very strong. Even conservative income investors can make use of this ETF to help capture tech-driven returns while they are still moving the market to new highs seemingly every day. Last on this list, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSE:VGT) is a pure technology ETF that has unsurprisingly outperformed just about every major index over the last 10 years. With a 0.42% dividend yield and $3.07 annual dividend, it won\u2019t come as any surprise to learn that income investors should look at the Vanguard Information Technology ETF as a way to future-proof their portfolios. Companies inside this ETF are increasingly moving to become significant players in the dividend world and dividend growers as well, which is the most important part. Over the last year, this ETF has delivered a 23.01% return to investors and 35.56% over the last three years, once again, beating category benchmarks. These returns are important to know for income investors because you get the benefit of both growth and passive income. At the end of the day, as we move into 2026, investors need to know that income investing is changing, and they can no longer rely just on high-yield picks or cash accounts to meet long-term goals. Instead, portfolios need to have consistent dividend players as a central component, and long-term growth ETFs help fulfill this role, all while bringing the right amount of growth and flexibility.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Nvidia\u2019s blockbuster earnings late Wednesday set up the stock market for a ferocious rebound as the chipmaker appeared to ease fears that an AI bubble was about to pop. Thursday began with a massive rally with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 700 points, regaining some ground after an earlier AI-related selloff. Upbeat results from retail giant Walmart helped too. But the market suddenly turned lower, and the Dow lost 300 points, leaving Wall Street wondering what the heck happened.  Some commentators pointed to persistent worries about an AI bust, while others cited the mixed September jobs report that showed strong payroll gains but an uptick in the unemployment rate to the highest level in four years. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve policymakers have been sounding increasingly hawkish, putting a rate cut next month in doubt.  Market veteran Ed Yardeni, cited these factors in a note late Thursday along with the selloff in the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. \u201cWe attribute some of today\u2019s stock market selloff to the ongoing plunge in bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere has been a strong correlation between it and the price of TQQQ, an ETF that seeks to achieve daily investment results that correspond to three times (3x) the daily performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index.\u201d Yardeni blamed bitcoin\u2019s slide on the GENIUS Act, which was enacted on July 18, saying that the regulatory framework it established for stablecoins eliminated bitcoin\u2019s transactional role in the monetary system.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the rout in bitcoin is forcing some investors to sell stocks that they own,\u201d he added. Bitcoin has tumbled more than 30% from earlier highs, suffering its worst slump since 2022. Traders who used leverage to make crypto bets would need to liquidate positions in the event of margin calls. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, also said bitcoin could swing the entire stock market, pointing out that it\u2019s become a proxy for speculation. \u201cAs a long-time systematic trader, it tells me that algorithms are acting upon the relationship between stocks and bitcoin,\u201d he wrote in a note on Thursday. \u201cTraders have always sought to find relationships between asset classes, and there are teams of skilled quants who pore through data, both long- and short-term, seeking inputs that guide their decisions.\u00a0We called them \u2018leads.'\u201d And in recent days, Sosnick added, bitcoin has become one of the most reliable leads.\u00a0 Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 head of research, linked crypto with the AI trade in particular, noting that investors with big holdings in AI-related stocks also tend to own bitcoin.\u00a0 \u201cI think crypto, bitcoin and ethereum are in some ways a leading indicator for equities because of that unwind and now this sort of limping and weakened liquidity,\u201d he told CNBC on Thursday.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"                 Reading time 4 minutes        The allegations detailed in a new whistleblower lawsuit against a Silicon Valley robotics company read like the first act of a sci-fi suspense movie: a sidelined safety technician plays Cassandra while a robotics company allegedly rushes ahead trying to commercialize a powerful humanoid robot with bone-crunching capabilities. The situation gets more and more sinister\u00e2\u0080\u0094and intolerable for the safety officer\u00e2\u0080\u0094and finally, company leadership allegedly just gets rid of him so they can build their terminators in peace. These are just allegations, to be abundantly clear, and a spokesperson for the company itself, Figure AI, has told CNBC the safety technician was \u00e2\u0080\u009cterminated for poor performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The claims in the lawsuit are \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalsehoods that Figure will thoroughly discredit in court,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the spokesperson further claims. If the lawsuit\u00e2\u0080\u0094framed as a case of alleged retaliatory termination against a whistleblower\u00e2\u0080\u0094is really fiction, it\u2019s the start of a blockbuster. It invokes riveting corporate dramas like Michael Clayton or The Insider, with a dash of Robocop.You may remember Figure AI. The company released an eye-popping demo of its 01 model last year in which a humanoid robot appeared to respond to spoken, open-ended commands by carrying out tasks of its own choosing. A request for \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething to eat\u00e2\u0080\u009d results in the robot gently handing the user an apple, for instance. The plaintiff, Robert Gruendel, a robotics safety engineer, who once worked in R&D for Amazon according to his LinkedIn, says he only joined Figure after that demo was made. The suit he filed Friday in a federal court for California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Northern District, claims that in his first week on the job, he discovered that Figure had \u00e2\u0080\u009cno formal safety procedures, incident-reporting systems, or risk-assessment processes for the robots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that the only other person responsible for worker safety was an outside contractor with experience in chip manufacturing, not robots.\u00c2\u00a0 Most mentions of a robot in the suit concern Figure\u2019s\u00c2\u00a002 model, depicted below: Initially, as outlined in the suit, company brass is receptive to these concerns when Gruendel voices them, and CEO Brett Adcock and chief engineer Kyle Edelberg approve a safety \u00e2\u0080\u009croadmap.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But then, the following ominous conversation with company leadership occurs, the filing alleges: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdcock and Edelberg expressed a dislike of written product requirements, which Plaintiff responded to by indicating that their stance was abnormal in the field of machinery safety and of concern to him as Head of Product Safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the filing, the heads of the company frequently come across as dismissive of the safety officer they themselves hired. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of commercial allegedly says at one point that Gruendel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety mandates would be ignored because the CEO \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould shoot us if we did it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt the start of 2025, the pressure on Gruendel seems to intensify when Adcock, the CEO, supposedly asks Gruendel \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat it would take to put Figure robots in the home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Per the suit, Gruendel, concerned about the robot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power, and the unpredictability of the AI at its core, designs another \u00e2\u0080\u009croadmap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d publishes it internally, and holds a meeting about it that the CEO skips. So, allegedly, Gruendel writes a condensed version and sends it to the CEO, but is ignored. Investors allegedly see a fairly comprehensive safety plan, which they like, after which company leadership downgrades it, an action Gruendel flags to leaders, according to the suit, saying it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould be interpreted as fraudulent.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThen things get really cinematic in the lead-up to Gruendel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s September 2025 firing. In July, Gruendel conducts safety tests involving just how hard the robot can hit, the suit says. \u00e2\u0080\u009dDuring the impact test, [the robot moves] at super-human speed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and generates force \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwenty times higher than the threshold of pain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to Gruendel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculations, it produces \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore than twice the force necessary to fracture an adult human skull.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe next day, according to the suit, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vice president of growth gets in touch with Gruendel to tell him he had just received a raise in the amount of $10,000 per year with an admiring note about Gruendel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinued growth and impact at Figure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The supposed note also acknowledges Gruendel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsistent effort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpositive mindset.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFresh from receiving his raise, and apparently undeterred, he sends a Slack message to the CEO, saying the robot could inflict \u00e2\u0080\u009csevere permanent injury on humans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d only to be ignored again, the suit alleges. So the suit says he tries the chief engineer, telling him Figure needs to take \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmediate action to distance personnel from the robots.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gruendel starts worrying, the suit says, that near-misses are occurring, and that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no system in place to track them. And then: \u00e2\u0080\u009dThis conclusion was further evidenced by an instance where an employee was standing next to [a robot] and the [robot] malfunctioned and punched a refrigerator, narrowly missing the employee. The robot left a \u00c2\u00bc-inch deep gash in the refrigerator\u2019s stainless-steel door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So Gruendel, as depicted in the suit, seems to pour everything into getting an emergency stop button added to the robot system in the workplace in order to protect the employees who have to be near it. The company seems to cooperate with the effort, and then more or less abandon it, the suit alleges. Also, a safety feature allegedly gets axed around this time because someone doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like how it looks. Between mid August and early September, the suit alleges that Gruendel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authority within the company degrades, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally fired by the same guy who had praised him and given him a raise earlier that summer. You can read the whole filing for yourself here.As CNBC notes, Figure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation has grown 15-fold since last year when it received capital injections from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Microsoft. A funding round this year from Parkway Venture Capital places the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value at $39 billion. As evidenced by the viral reaction to the more recent Neo robot from 1x technologies, there seems to be a race to bring household humanoid robots to market. And there are, of course, bubble concerns accompanying this gold rush-style corporate mindset. In September, roboticist and iRobot founder Rodney Brooks wrote an essay claiming that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humanoid robots will not learn how to be dexterous despite the hundreds of millions, or perhaps many billions of dollars, being donated by VCs and major tech companies to pay for their training.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Gizmodo reached out to Figure for additional comments about the allegations in this suit, and will update if we hear back.\u00c2\u00a0 Explore more on these topics    Share this story           Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Many people in Chad already depended on humanitarian assistance even before the start of the war in Sudan. By Al Jazeera Staff Share Save Thousands more Sudanese people fleeing the country\u2019s bloody war continue to arrive in neighbouring and impoverished Chad, as the humanitarian situation deteriorates on the ground in the region. More than 4.3 million Sudanese have fled to neighbouring countries since the start of the civil war in April 2023 between the government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), according to the latest data confirmed by the United Nations. Sudan is experiencing the world\u2019s worst displacement crisis, with nearly 12 million people forced to run from homes under fire and hunger. Tens of thousands of Sudanese are believed to be waiting to enter eastern Chad, because they believe it will be safer and they will find food. However, their destination is a country where some seven million people, at least half of them children, already require humanitarian assistance. Dozens of families continue to arrive in Tine, a border town between Sudan and Chad, daily. Tine resident Abdulsalam Abubakar told Al Jazeera\u2019s Ahmed Idris that the same money he spent a few days ago at the market to buy food and other essential supplies will no longer buy the same quantity. \u201cEverything in the market here is expensive; nothing is cheap,\u201d he said.      The food sellers say they are not to blame either, as hugely increased demand during catastrophic wartime conditions is driving up prices. \u201cNow food is expensive because more than 10,000 Sudanese arrived here after their country disintegrated,\u201d said trader Khadijah Kurgule. \u201cThere are goods everywhere but people can\u2019t afford them,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. The thousands who fled the RSF-led mass killings in and around el-Fasher in western Sudan\u2019s Darfur to arrive in Chad over the past few weeks only add to the more than one million people who have entered the country since the start of the Sudanese war. Al Jazeera\u2019s Idris said the continuous arrival of refugees from Sudan has intensified competition for food, shelter and water. \u201cHumanitarian aid workers worry that could lead to friction between refugees and host communities,\u201d he said. At water and aid collection distribution points, long queues have become common, and hospitals and schools are overextended as well. John-Paul Habamungu, a UNHCR representative working on the ground, said 57 percent of the incoming Sudanese population are school-age children, but there are no schools for them. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the funding to construct at least temporarily learning spaces. We don\u2019t have the means to recruit teachers,\u201d he said. The UN has been trying to ease the load by moving several thousand refugees to nearby areas, but aid workers have warned that the worst may yet be approaching as the war in Sudan shows no sign of stopping. The European Union on Thursday imposed sanctions against Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo, the deputy leader of the RSF and the brother of its leader, Mohamed Hamdan \u201cHemedti\u201d Dagalo, over crimes committed during the storming of el-Fasher. The sanctions place Dagalo under an EU-wide travel ban, freeze potential assets, and ban him from making indirect or direct profits, and from other resources within the 27-nation bloc, according to the European Commission. \u201cThis sends a signal that the international community will come after those who are responsible,\u201d EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters during a news conference on Thursday.

Typically, these vehicles have longer wheelbases because local customers prefer the extra rear legroom compared to the regular models sold worldwide. In many cases, they also feature nicer interiors with better materials and equipment. Recently, Audi went a step further in responding to local trends by setting up a separate company with help from SAIC. The goal is to target \u201cyoung, tech-savvy customers\u201d with high-end EVs. As for the name of the new brand, it\u2019s called\u2014wait for it\u2014AUDI. Written in all caps but without the iconic Four Rings, the new marque launched its first car a few months ago. The E5 Sportback led the way, and now there\u2019s a second model, albeit still in concept form. AUDI shows the E SUV concept as a near-production model previewing a \u201clarge premium SUV.\u201d How large? It measures 199 inches (5057 millimeters) long, 80.3 in (2,042 mm) wide, and 70.3 in (1,786 mm) tall. Thanks to a bespoke EV platform, Audi, um, AUDI, stretched the wheelbase to 120.4 in (3060 mm). It\u2019s roughly the same size as the BMW iX. However, by the time it reaches showrooms, the Audi E SUV will likely compete with the iX5. Munich hasn\u2019t said whether next year\u2019s new electric model will have a stretched wheelbase for China. The reason we\u2019re bringing this up is that the current X5 has had its wheelbase elongated for the G18. Come 2027, a fully electric iX7 will join the lineup as well.  As with the E5 Sportback, this new SUV doesn\u2019t really look like an Audi, and that\u2019s because it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s an AUDI, complete with massive 23-inch wheels, a roof-mounted LiDAR, and side cameras replacing conventional mirrors. Further setting it apart from international models, the headlights and taillights appear as if they tuck themselves into the body. Underneath the China-only design is a large 109-kWh battery pack with enough energy for over 435 miles (700 kilometers). However, that figure is based on the CLTC test cycle, which is known to be more generous than WLTP and EPA. The AUDI E SUV also benefits from an 800-volt architecture, enabling roughly 200 miles (320 kilometers) of range after just 10 minutes of charging. As for power, there\u2019s plenty. The dual motors deliver a combined 671 hp to a Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Despite its size and likely substantial weight, this silent luxobarge needs only about five seconds to hit 62 mph (100 km\/h). AUDI will put the new electric SUV on sale in China next year.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"A research team at Mass General Brigham has released new evidence directly comparing how well tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) protect the heart. According to the analysis, both medications lowered the chances of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause. The study appears in Nature Medicine, and the findings were also presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2025. Earlier studies had already shown that semaglutide lowers the likelihood of major cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. What had remained uncertain was whether tirzepatide, another widely used treatment for type 2 diabetes, offers similar protection. Large Real-World Dataset Offers New Clarity To investigate this, researchers examined national health insurance claims and compared cardiovascular outcomes among nearly one million adults using tirzepatide, semaglutide, or other type 2 diabetes therapies. \"Randomized controlled trials are often considered the reference standard in the medical evidence generation process. However, not all questions can be answered using this time- and resource-intensive method,\" said first author Nils Kr\u00fcger, MD, a research fellow in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. \"Data generated in clinical practice and used secondarily for research allow us to address a wide range of clinically relevant questions time- and resource-effectively -- when applied correctly. Moreover, we can study patients who reflect the reality of everyday clinical care, in contrast to the highly selected participants of randomized experiments.\" Risk Reductions Seen in Both Medications The results showed measurable cardiovascular benefits among people with type 2 diabetes who were at higher risk for heart-related complications. When compared with sitagliptin, a diabetes medication known to have a neutral effect on cardiovascular outcomes, semaglutide lowered the combined risk of heart attack and stroke by 18 percent. Tirzepatide produced a 13 percent reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death when compared with dulaglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been on the market for many years. \"Both drugs show strong cardioprotective effects. Our data also indicate that these benefits occur early, suggesting that their protective mechanisms go beyond weight loss alone,\" said Kr\u00fcger. Although the study highlights strong results, the biological pathways behind these heart-protective effects are still not fully understood. Head-to-Head Comparisons Show Only Small Differences Since these medications are relatively new, scientists continue to investigate how they protect the heart, especially in studies that directly compare tirzepatide and semaglutide. Kr\u00fcger noted that \"According to recently presented database analyses by the respective manufacturers, each company's own drug appears to reduce cardiovascular risk much more effectively than the competitor's.\" He added, \"However, our study found only small differences between tirzepatide and semaglutide in cardiovascular protection among populations at risk of adverse events, underscoring that both agents provide protective benefit and could be integrated into clinical cardiovascular practice.\" \"We hope that our study will help clinicians better understand how these new medications work in clinical practice. Our transparent and open science practices, including pre-registration of a public protocol and shared analytic code, are designed to support scientific discussion,\" said last author Shirley Wang, PhD, an associate epidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine.

Reviews ethics statement      We asked a bona fide turkey expert to share the six biggest turkey pitfalls to avoid on the big day.    Don't make these common Thanksgiving turkey mistakes. If you're in charge of the bird this Thanksgiving, you might be worried about the potential for poultry blunders. Even if this isn't your first time cooking a\u00a0full turkey, you don't want the centerpiece of your feast to come out dry or undercooked. But don't panic: We'll show you how to prepare the perfect Thanksgiving turkey for your guests. To get the skinny on common turkey mistakes made on Thanksgiving, we asked Heidi Diestel, a fourth-generation turkey farmer who runs the 75-year-old Diestel Family Ranch in California with her kin. With Thanksgiving on the brink, Diestel shared six of the biggest mistakes, blunders and oversights she sees from folks making turkey and what to do instead.\u00a0 Avoid these fowl faux pas and you'll have yourself a joyful Thanksgiving with plenty of moist turkey for dinner and a heaping helping of leftovers for later. Not enough turkey on Thanksgiving is a far bigger sin than too much, so plan accordingly. Thanksgiving is famous for leftovers but if you're feeding a large group, it's possible to underbuy. \"A good rule of thumb,\" Diestel says, \"is to buy 1 to 1.5 pounds of turkey per person.\" This accounts for the weight of bones and shrinkage during cooking.\u00a0 As an example, if you're feeding eight people, plan on at least an 8-pounder and more like 12 pounds of turkey if you want leftovers. Your turkey should be fully thawed before it hits the oven. A turkey should be cooked only after it's fully thawed to avoid toughness and uneven cooking. Diestel recommends thawing a turkey in the fridge, allowing 24 hours of thawing for every 4 to 5 pounds of bird.\u00a0 \"If you're in a time crunch,\" she says, \"you can thaw it in a sink of cold water (changing the water every 30 minutes), but this method requires more attention and careful handling. Never thaw turkey at room temperature.\" Read more:\u00a0How to Safely Defrost a Turkey Thanksgiving isn't the time to experiment with new brine recipes or spice mixes, so try them ahead of time.\u00a0 If you stumble across a new turkey brine recipe, Diestel cautions against putting it to the test on the big day. \"Sure, free recipes found on a blog are great for a weekend meal, but not a Thanksgiving feast. Make sure you test your turkey recipe or it comes from a reputable source or test it on a turkey or chicken ahead of time.\" Read more:\u00a0How to Brine a Turkey\u00a0 Resist the urge to carve the turkey immediately. After pulling that gorgeous bird from the oven, you might be tempted to carve it up post haste, but Diestel stresses that some patience will pay big dividends. \"Carving immediately can result in dry meat and juices spilling out onto the platter. Instead, Let the turkey rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes after cooking before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making the turkey moist and flavorful. Resting also makes the carving process easier and helps the meat stay intact.\" Ain't no gravy like a neck and giblet gravy. If you leave the neck and giblets out of the meal, you're missing out on big flavor. \"Use the turkey neck, giblets (minus the liver) and other parts to make a flavorful homemade stock or gravy. Simmer the neck and giblets with some aromatics (like onion, garlic, celery and carrots) to create a rich base for gravy or to enhance your stuffing.\" Your entire turkey should read at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, so don't just check one spot. It may cook an additional few degrees out of the oven so pulling it out at 160 degrees Fahrenheit  is usually a safe bet. Making sure the bird is fully cooked and safe to eat is one of the chef's biggest responsibilities.\u00a0 \"Recognize that your bird will roast more quickly in the second half of the cooking time,\" Diestel said. \"Use a thermometer to check both the thickest part of the breast -- should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit -- and the innermost part of the thigh -- should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit or 74 degrees Celsius. If you stuff the turkey, check the stuffing's temperature as well to make sure it reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. And remember, when your bird is resting, it will still be cooking.\" Read more:\u00a013 Common Thanksgiving Mistakes You Absolutely Need to Avoid This Year While I had a turkey expert on the line, I asked about bonus tips and ideas for Thanksgiving hosts. Here's what Diestel told me. Inject your Thanksgiving feast with bold flavors. A budget-friendly marinade injector lets you infuse the turkey with a flavorful brine or butter mix. Imagine injecting the meat with a bourbon-brown sugar concoction or a citrus-herb mixture. Not only is this a fun way to experiment with flavors, it also keeps the turkey juicy from the inside out.\u00a0 A slightly frozen section of your turkey can lead to uneven roasting with a well-done exterior and undercooked interior. Ultimately, you'll be roasting your bird longer and this can lead to moisture loss and dry meat.\u00a0 A little white wine into the pan about halfway through cooking is one of Diestel's big turkey tips. Heat but do not boil 1 cup of white wine. Pour it over your turkey halfway through cooking and it will mix with the juices to make a marvelous jus or gravy starter. There's no need to turn the bird while roasting, as it will brown to a rich, golden color. A foil tent can be placed loosely over the turkey during the last hour of roasting to prevent over-browning. Make sure the foil is loose so you aren't creating steam inside the foil, which will prevent a crisp skin. Carving the turkey properly includes three distinct steps. First, remove each wing then leg at the joint. Then cut each breast as close as possible to the bone. Finally, slice the breast meat at an angle and arrange it all on a platter with thighs, legs and wings.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"BySara Dorn, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump\u2019s net worth has declined $1.1 billion since September, as stock in his family\u2019s social media and crypto company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), traded at all-time lows this week.  Trump\u2019s $6.2 billion net worth is down from a record $7.3 billion in September. The decline comes as his technology company stock TMTG, which trades under the ticker DJT, dropped to $10.18CK Friday, near an all-time low, amid a steep dip in bitcoin and other tokens. As of September, Trump\u2019s net worth had grown $3 billion over the past year, putting him at No. 201 on the Forbes 400 list of America\u2019s richest, an improvement of 118 spots from the 2024 list. The increase was largely driven by the Trump family\u2019s crypto investments, including a venture announced last year\u2014World Liberty Financial\u2014which secured a $75 million investment from crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun. Trump and his three sons are listed as co-founders of World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform that debuted in September 2024. The firm created 100 billion $WLFI tokens and gave 22.5 billion of those tokens to DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company Trump owns 70% of. World Liberty\u2019s digital token, $WLFI, launched in September, and traded at a high of $0.31 the day it debuted, but has since dropped to $0.158. It\u2019s unlikely Trump is cashing in on $WLFI yet, per the firm\u2019s policy that states \u201cfounders, team and advisor tokens will not be unlocked initially and will be subject to a longer unlock schedule than early supporters.\u201d","label":1}
{"date":"2025-11-22","content":" If you've ever wandered down Shaw Street on a sunny afternoon and wondered who gets to live in that stately brick Victorian\u00a0right across from Toronto's Trinity Bellwoods Park\u2026 well, this might be your moment to become that person. After more than 40 years with the same owner, 232 Shaw St., a bona fide 1870s showstopper and easily one of the neighbourhood's most recognizable homes, has officially\u00a0hit the market. And with a recent price drop from $3,199,000 to $2,675,000, this crown jewel of Trinity Bellwoods just became a little more within reach\u2026 relatively speaking, of course. This is still Toronto, after all.  The side of 232 Shaw St.\u00a0 Sitting proudly at the corner of Shaw and Halton, the\u00a0home's exterior\u00a0looks like it was peeled straight from a Victorian novel.  The foyer.\u00a0 The current owner has restored it top to bottom over the decades, preserving all the character you hope an 1870 build would have.  Exposed brick and plenty of ornate details make this house stand out.\u00a0 There are soaring ceilings, high baseboards, ceiling medallions, dramatic arched windows, stained glass that catches the afternoon sun, exposed brick, ornate wainscotting, and so much more.  The formal living room.\u00a0 But don't let the old-world charm fool you; according to the listing, this is more than up to 21st-century living standards.  A bedroom.\u00a0 The updates are meticulous and thoughtful, giving the home that rare combination of \"historic masterpiece\" and \"you can actually cook dinner here without blowing a fuse.\"  The main floor kitchen.\u00a0 That being said, the kitchen is in need of refresh, both in terms of cabinets and paint, because lavender, yellow, and teal are colours that should probably be reserved for Easter eggs.  The front hall.\u00a0 In fact, the daring hues throughout the house might explain why it's been on the market for over two months in an area where homes usually sell in just over two weeks.  The primary bedroom.\u00a0 Currently set up as a single-family home, the property is zoned as a multiplex and comes with seven bedrooms, five full bathrooms, and two kitchens, making it ridiculously flexible.  The third-floor loft.\u00a0 Live in it as your own stately Victorian? Absolutely. Convert it back into multiple income-generating suites? Also doable.  The kitchen in the coach house.\u00a0 And then there's the bonus most downtown houses only dream of: a coach house, complete with its own bedroom, kitchen, and bath.  The bedroom in the coach house.\u00a0 If you're thinking investment, rentals in this area often bring in $3,000+ a month, giving you serious potential.\u00a0  The dining room.\u00a0 Add in two-car parking \u2014 a mythical concept in West Queen West\u00a0\u2014 and you've got a property that checks basically every box imaginable.  A hallway. Between the park-side location, the painstaking restoration, and the sheer amount of space and potential packed into this corner lot, 232 Shaw St. is the kind of listing that makes you forget the inside of the house looks like an\u00a0Easter egg... almost.\u00a0 realtor.ca    Iconic 1800s Toronto Victorian house just hit the market for first time in 40 years   Average Toronto renter earns more than $94k but still can't afford to buy   5 Ontario cities rank among top 10 best places to live in Canada   Homes are selling like hotcakes again in these parts of the GTA   Stunning Toronto home got glow-up of the century yet its price has still dropped   Mortgages in Ontario cities are totally out of control and Toronto is the worst of all   Almost century-old Toronto theatre will be reduced to just a facade for condos   Spacious 2-bedroom condo in Ontario with two parking spots is under $550k ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"Every year, your family and friends probably sit around debating whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie. After all, it takes place at Christmas, so it counts, right? But what about Lethal Weapon? Gremlins? Do you even remember that those movies are also set during the most wonderful time of the year? In fact, there are quite a few movies that may not be the first ones you think of when it comes to a Christmas movie, but that may be because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten that the festive holiday season is the backdrop for action-packed thrills, rom-com vibes, or superhero surprises. Mel Gibson stars as a reckless detective whose wife recently died alongside reasonable cop Danny Glover in this \u00e2\u0080\u009880s action flick about two cops who are paired up to catch drug smugglers. Shane Black, the writer of the Lethal Weapon script, has described setting movies at Christmas as a deliberate choice for several movies he's been a part of.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople take reckoning, they stock of where their lives are at Christmas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt just provides a backdrop against which different things can play out, but with one unifying, global heading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks have starred together in multiple rom-coms, including Sleepless in Seattle, which starts out with a call to a radio station on Christmas Eve from a boy who is looking for a new wife for his widowed father. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a call that just happens to be heard by Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character and leads to her reevaluating her life and looking for something more from her boring life and not-quite-Mr.-Right fianc\u00c3\u00a9. You probably remember While You Were Sleeping as the movie where Sandra Bullock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character pretends to be the fianc\u00c3\u00a9e of a man she has a crush on, who ends up in a coma, creating a major misunderstanding with his family. But did you remember that it takes place at Christmas? Yep, she saves her fake fianc\u00c3\u00a9e while the Christmas season is in full force in Chicago, only to fall for his brother. Any kid in the \u00e2\u0080\u009880s knew about Gremlins and the three strict rules you had to follow if you cared for a Mogwai: Do not expose them to bright lights, do not get them wet, and do not feed them after midnight. And when you break those rules, chaos reigns on Christmas with a cute Mogwai turning into terrorizing trolls who take over a quaint small town at Christmas.  Even though it was originally released as a summer flick, Gremlins\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Christmas themes mean you're welcome to pull it out for the festive season. Imagine your Christmas Eve going from bad to worse when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the run from the cops and get stuck hiding out in a house with a bickering couple that makes you want to turn yourself in. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where Denis Leary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character finds himself in The Ref, complete with unusual traditions and awkward family moments that make this Christmas movie a good option anytime of the year. Michael Keaton reprised his role as Bruce Wayne in the 1992 flick Batman Returns. But while the movie played up its literally dark setting from the first Batman movie with Tim Burton directing, there are also pops of red and green to remind viewers it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Christmas flick.  Danny DeVito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Penguin origin story includes getting thrown in the sewer at Christmas by his parents and Christopher Walken showing up as a Scrooge-like, evil businessman, putting a damper on the festive holiday spirit. Set in Philadelphia around the holidays, Trading Places is an \u00e2\u0080\u009880s comedy version of the traditional The Prince and the Pauper tale, with Dan Aykroyd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Eddie Murphy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characters trading places as part of a bet between two millionaires. And while the story may be universal and could take place anytime, there is something special about seeing Aykroyd in a dirty, ratty Santa suit that makes this a festive option if you need a Christmas comedy for the family. The 2005 movie adaptation of the Broadway musical Rent starts out the same way the musical does, with the lyrics, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDecember 24th, 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to set the scene.  But the story written by Jonathan Larson and based loosely on the opera La Boheme has more of a Christmas vibe than a Christmas main character. Despite that, actor Jesse L. Martin, who starred in both the Broadway production and the movie, once declared that Rent is \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely, 100 percent Christmas movie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It may be a bit of a stretch, but this Monty Python classic does involve Christmas. After all, the Brian in the title is born on Christmas Day in a stable\u00e2\u0080\u0094 just like Jesus, who is born in a stable next door\u00e2\u0080\u0094leading to a series of confusing events in his life in which he is constantly confused with the Messiah.  And while Christmas Day looks different through the eyes of Brian, the film is a classic comedy that viewers have come to expect from Monty Python. Loading recommendations...

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"With Thanksgiving fast approaching, chances are that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re among the 81 million Americans who are planning on traveling over the holiday period. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hosting this year, of course, perhaps you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one of the nearly 200 million people who will be heading to the store in the coming days and weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0094either to stock up on Thanksgiving dinner essentials, or to make the most of the Black Friday sales.  And now, a new survey by Google has uncovered the best (and worst) times to set off.\u00c2\u00a0 Ahead of the big day, you can expect road traffic nationwide to be at its busiest on Wednesday, and in particular on Wednesday afternoon, peaking between 1\u00e2\u0080\u00933 p.m. If possible, the study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors suggest heading off late on Tuesday afternoon instead\u00e2\u0080\u0094or else, if your travel plans extend onto Thanksgiving Day itself (or you need to pop out to pick up something you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten!), aim for Thursday morning, as traffic is expected to be most congested in the early afternoon, from 12\u00e2\u0080\u00933 p.m.\u00c2\u00a0 If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heading to the Black Friday sales, the busiest time is again predicted to be between 1\u00e2\u0080\u00933 p.m., so a better option would be sometime before noon. And when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to head home, the weekend traffic looks likely to peak between midday and 3 p.m., on both Saturday and Sunday, with the quietest time on both days being before 10 a.m. The study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors also analyzed business data from each state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most popular malls to find the best and worst times to head out shopping, plotting all the figures on a state-by-state map. In the majority of states, Tuesday is the quietest day overall, with Saturday afternoon predictably being the busiest time of the week.\u00c2\u00a0 But the same data was also used to look ahead over the coming weeks in the runup to Christmas, revealing which specific dates are typically the busiest for Christmas shoppers outside of Black Friday, which states tend to get things prepped well ahead of time, and which are the most likely to have a last-minute rush.\u00c2\u00a0 By far the most organized state is Rhode Island, where the busiest holiday period shopping day is the first Saturday in November. Maine, Massachusetts, South Dakota and Vermont are also at the better end of the preparation stats, with their shopping peaking a week later, on the second Saturday in November.  In no less than eight states, however, shoppers tend to leave things to the last minute, with the shopping malls in Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Utah tending to be at their busiest on December 23.\u00c2\u00a0 When it comes to last-minute prep, the Google data also showed what kinds of stores tend to see the biggest increase in trade in the last few days before Christmas, in twenty of the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 largest cities. Add Mental Floss as a\u00c2\u00a0preferred news source! Predictably, shopping centers, outlet malls, and department stores came out on top in a number of cities, but there were a handful of more curious findings dotted across the country.  Austin and New York were the only cities in which toy stores made the top three (alongside leather goods stores in the case of New York, oddly), while Christmas markets made the list in Atlanta, Seattle, and Washington. Shoppers in Austin and Honolulu also headed to coffee shops for a little pre- or post-shopping pick-me-up, while shoppers in Denver showed their frugal side by making dollar stores one of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most frequented places between December 20\u00e2\u0080\u009325.\u00c2\u00a0 When it comes to dropping gifts and cards in the mail, meanwhile, the Google data also showed that post offices see their busiest day two Mondays before Christmas, with Mondays routinely being the busiest day of the week (and 2 p.m. being the busiest time of day). To avoid the queues, try going at 2 p.m. Tuesday when the post offices are at their quietest.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0For more information on the study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data and its findings, head to the Google Maps blog here.\u00c2\u00a0 Loading recommendations...

When someone says Turkey, most people picture Thanksgiving feasts and tables overflowing with comfort food, the same way hearing Christmas instantly brings to mind gingerbread, plum cakes, and hot chocolate. Food has this magical ability to anchor us to traditions almost instantly. Across cultures, festive dishes become part of the celebration itself, so much so that the holiday feels incomplete without them. Every country has dishes that show up only once a year, making them even more special. It\u2019s amazing how the world celebrates its festivals with a plate in hand. Desserts follow the same universal rule: no celebration feels whole without something sweet. In many regions, every festival is practically defined by its signature dessert. India is a perfect example, where each celebration has its own sweet tradition. During Holi, families prepare colorful treats that match the vibrancy of the festival. Diwali turns the entire country into a glowing marketplace of mithai boxes.\u00a0 According to Statista, the Confectionery & Snacks industry is enormous and still growing. Revenue in 2025 alone is projected to reach US$23.67 billion. The market is expected to grow annually by 6.31% between 2025 and 2030. By 2030, the total volume is predicted to reach 5.85 billion kilograms. Even 2026 is projected to show a volume growth of 3.8%. All these numbers show just how big and competitive this market really is. People love their snacks and sweets, and demand isn\u2019t slowing down. The industry is evolving quickly, fueled by both tradition and innovation. With stats like these, it\u2019s clear this is a massive space to enter. In such a huge and traditional market, introducing nontraditional desserts like cakes and brownies isn\u2019t a simple task. People already have strong attachments to the sweets they grew up with. Winning their trust requires patience, creativity, and a lot of tasting. Today, we spoke with Akshita Agarwal from caramella_by_akshita, a brand that has carved a space for itself in Kolkata. She specializes in premium artisanal tiramisus and modern desserts. Her journey shows how passion can blend beautifully with innovation. Competing in a mithai-driven landscape is bold, but she has managed to make her mark.\u00a0 \u201cPeople absolutely love gulab jamun and ladoos, those are always the first choices for gifting,\u201d Akshita shared. \u201cThese classics have been around for so many years that they feel familiar and safe.\u201d She explained how deeply emotional and nostalgic people are about these sweets. They remind them of festivals spent with family, childhood celebrations, and happy moments. For many, these flavors are part of their identity. Getting customers to explore something new was definitely a challenge. Traditional mithai has a charm that\u2019s hard to shake. But rather than fighting this, she chose to understand it. Respecting those preferences became step one. \u201cIn the beginning, convincing people to try different desserts was tricky,\u201d she laughed. \u201cSo we started really small, offering free samples just to break the ice.\u201d Gen Z instantly connected with the brand, but older generations needed more time. They already knew their favorite sweets and rarely stepped outside them. To bridge that gap, she started experimenting with fusion-style creations. Ras Malai Cake, Gulab Jamun Cake Jars and similar flavors soon appeared on the menu. These blends quickly caught people\u2019s attention and became instant favorites. Customers found comfort in the familiar flavors and excitement in the new form. It was the perfect meeting point between tradition and novelty. \u201cWe realized that dessert isn\u2019t just about taste, it\u2019s tied to emotions,\u201d Akshita said. \u201cPeople want to hold on to their traditions because they carry memories.\u201d Instead of trying to replace classic mithai, her team decided to blend traditional flavors with modern textures. This approach gave customers something new without losing what they love. It honored their nostalgia while still feeling fresh. By respecting emotional connections, they created desserts that appeal across generations. Slowly, this fusion style started winning hearts everywhere. It proved that tradition and creativity can coexist beautifully. \u201cI believe it\u2019s always best to conclude on a simple thought,\u201d Akshita said with a smile. \u201cTradition doesn\u2019t have to be replaced to make space for something new.\u201d She emphasized that food evolves the same way people do: slowly, naturally, and with an open mind. Her brand\u2019s journey taught her that blending old and new can create something truly memorable. It\u2019s not about proving one dessert better than another; it\u2019s about expanding the table. She feels that every sweet, whether classic or modern, has its own charm. What matters most is the joy it brings to the person eating it. And if a dessert can spark conversation or curiosity, that\u2019s already a win. For her, that\u2019s the perfect note to wrap things up on. In this particular scenario, it did feel like the woman\u2019s nontraditional dishes were judged a bit too quickly. It\u2019s understandable that people cling to familiar flavors, but such harsh criticism seems unfair. A little openness never hurts, especially when someone puts effort into cooking. Food has a funny way of changing minds when given a chance. Everyone has different tastes, but kindness should stay constant. And honestly, trying a new dish costs nothing, who knows, it might even become the next family favorite.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"MLB Trade Rumors  By Charlie Wright | November 21, 2025 at 11:38pm CDT  The Yankees are interested in bringing free agent closer Devin Williams back to the Bronx. League sources told Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon of The Athletic that the team has discussed a reunion with Williams\u2019 camp. Williams is one of the top names on the closer market. He landed at No. 16 on our Top 50 Free Agents list, which put him second among relievers, behind only Edwin Diaz. The 31-year-old is expected to have many suitors, with the Reds and Red Sox linked to him last week, and the Mets, Tigers, and Giants joining the mix this week. The Dodgers and Marlins have also been connected to Williams. New York sent Caleb Durbin and Nestor Cortes to Milwaukee for Williams in December 2024. He struggled in his first month with the team, losing the closer role by May. An injury to fill-in closer Luke Weaver allowed Williams to regain the role, and he pitched well in June and July. The trade deadline acquisition of David Bednar pushed Williams back into setup duty. He closed the year with his best stretch of the campaign, posting 13 scoreless innings from September 7 through the postseason. Williams said he would \u201cdefinitely be open\u201d to returning to the Yankees back in October. As for whether being the closer would impact his next destination, Williams said it \u00e2\u0080\u009cdepends on the scenario.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Weaver is a free agent, New York still has Bednar and fellow trade deadline acquisition Camilo Doval under team control for next season. Williams isn\u2019t the only high-profile free agent on the Yankees\u2019 radar. General manager Brian Cashman told reporters on Thursday, including Bryan Hoch of MLB.com, that he\u2019s been in contact with agent Casey Close on several players. That list of possible targets includes Kyle Tucker, Kyle Schwarber, Michael King, and former Yankee Paul Goldschmidt. Cashman also mentioned interest in Tatsuya Imai, who was posted by the Seibu Lions earlier this week. \u201cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly engaging all these players in the marketplace,\u201d Cashman said. Tucker will likely have just as many suitors as Williams, perhaps more. Toronto is considered by some teams to be the favorite to land the star outfielder, but the Dodgers, Yankees, and Orioles have been linked to him. Given that he\u2019s the big prize in free agency this offseason, additional teams are bound to come forward as potential candidates. New York regained an outfielder when Trent Grisham accepted the qualifying offer, but lost one when Cody Bellinger opted out of his contract. Jasson Dominguez is penciled in alongside Grisham and Aaron Judge, but he hasn\u2019t performed well enough to discourage the Yankees from going after a massive upgrade in Tucker. They could also re-up with Bellinger. As far as paying for these potential acquisitions, Cashman was noncommittal about whether payroll would exceed $300MM. \u201cI think it could go both ways. So it just depends on how things shake out and what opportunities present themselves,\u201d he told reporters, including Hoch. FanGraphs\u2019 RosterResource tool currently has the Yankees\u2019 payroll at around $260MM next season. Grisham\u2019s deal added about $22MM to the ledger, and he\u2019s just the sixth-highest-paid player on the team next year. New York\u2019s payroll was around $296MM this past season after topping $300MM in 2024. A deal for Tucker, Schwarber, Williams, or any of the other marquee names will likely require a big commitment across many years. The Yankees already have several of those types of deals on the books between Judge, Max Fried, Gerrit Cole, and Carlos Rodon, who are all on large contracts through at least 2028. Cashman expressed confidence he could make it work, though. \u201cThe job right now is to find out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available, and those all have different price points,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cThere could be cheap players that are available that are good, or there could be very expensive players that are available that are good.\u201d New York Yankees Devin Williams Kyle Schwarber Kyle Tucker Trent Grisham  MLB Top 100 Commenter  20 hours ago Even the 2025 version of Tucker could separate the Blue Jays from the rest of the division.  bigdaddyt  18 hours ago I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind if the jays signed Williams especially cause Pete Walker is a gawd and it would look rubbed in the Yankees faces if he had a bounce back season and the jays bullpen became a 3 headed beast of Williams Hoffman Varland  jdgoat  11 hours ago I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Williams needs much help. His metrics were still very good. He had one bad stretch that tanked his ERA for the year  jerseyjohn  9 hours ago jdgoat: It was more than a bad stretch. He blew a ton of games last year. He had 2 good stretches is the better way to look at it. Not saying he\u2019s cooked but that was an ugly year results wise. I can\u2019t see him coming back to the Bronx, someone will give him 3 years to close.  JoeBrady  5 hours ago I thought of mentioning that.  He was great in June, good in September, weak in May & August, and bad in April & July.  99Captain Judge99  4 hours ago Ok he sounds perfect for the Red Sox, ok? Smh  Big whiffa  13 hours ago I really hope making it to the WS was a turning point for the blue jays and their free agency struggles. Love to see them land Bo and Tucker \u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00a8\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00a6  imissjoebuzas  11 hours ago Sorry Yankee Fans, but I guess if you read this story, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d know that Spencer Jones is either as good as gone in a trade or a non-prospect.  Probably traded. Either him or Dominguez. But No mention of Mr Untouchable Jones. What do they need Tucker for if they have this gold star prospect tucked in their minor leagues just waiting? What would they have needed Caballero or Rosario or Peraza or Chisholm to play third if they had just kept Caleb Durbin? Cashman Still chasing headlines after all these years, though he needs a better understanding of who to keep and who to trade. The Peraza\/Peroza\/LeMatheiu at third base mistake is one he is still trying to clean up.  DogDays2  11 hours ago I am in no way a Cashman fan but nobody complained when the Williams trade was made last year. Sometimes the GM is blamed when we should be blaming the player.  KnicksFanCavsFan  9 hours ago @Dog agreed. I loved the prospect of Durbin at 2b and Jazz staying at 3rd but thought Williams was an excellent pick up to address the bullpen. Williams had fluky results though pretty good underlying stats that should give hope that he wasn\u2019t as bad as he seemed.  robluca21  9 hours ago What an awful take. You always try to acquire the best players available and worry about the rest later.  Reggie Smith  7 hours ago roblucka: \u201cWhat an awful take. You always try to acquire the best players available and worry about the rest later.\u201d \u201cAlways\u201d? I\u2019d say your take is the awful take. Every team, at any given time, is at a different stage of contending and rebuilding. Right now, Yankees have to start laying the groundwork for rebuilding, because the \u2018worry about the rest later\u2019 is coming to roost. How many years over the salary threshold are they? How many prospects have they shipped out the past few years? It cant go on forever the way MLB is structured now.  JoeBrady  5 hours ago robluca21 What an awful take. You always try to acquire the best players available ========================= Not even close.  Unless you are LAD, you acquire the best value, or the best fits.  Acquiring the most expensive players will usually backfire.  crs  4 hours ago \u201cyou acquire the best value, or the best fits.\u201d I agree with this (For whatever my opinion is worth).  KnicksFanCavsFan  9 hours ago @imiss Cashman, nor any other GM, are ever going to sit there and say they \u201caren\u2019t\u201d interested in a FA. In fact, I think they aren\u2019t allowed to publicly declare disinterest in a FA. Secondly, saying that he\u2019s \u201cengaged all these players in the marketplace\u201d isn\u2019t anywhere close to saying Tucker or any other guy is a huge priority. Thirdly, Jones clearly has room for improvement. Maybe he appears in 2026 or maybe not. Clearly he\u2019s a prospect and the majors are littered with guys who strike out north of 150 + ks but can hit 40+ bombs. What he can do is tbd but the Yanks do, and are justified in doing so, view him as a legit prospect. As for Dominguez,  I don\u2019t get the idea that having Grisham means they MUST do dinnering to get rid of Dominguez or Jones. Grisham is only signed to a 1 year deal and is a bit to get more expensive. Give Cashman props for getting him as a \u201cthrow in\u201d in the Soto deal. Cashman would be a full to decide he\u2019s not star potential at age 22 with 400 AB to go off of. I can\u2019t see him bring trading unless for a really big impact bat.  melfman1  6 hours ago Who the heck is Peroza?  rocky7  11 hours ago Anyone know why Toronto is continually mentioned to be the frontrunner for Tucker?  Dustyslambchops23  10 hours ago Because his agents are use the jays as a stalking horse.  jerseyjohn  9 hours ago Unless they\u2019re going to overpay he won\u2019t sign there. The team is obviously quite good but tax issues mean when everything is equal the Jay\u2019s need to add a few million more to equalize their offer.  Dustyslambchops23  9 hours ago Not necessarily JJ. Firstly Ontario tax rates are comparable to NY and CA, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just Toronto that is a high tax location. Secondly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to circumvent, signing bonuses are taxed in resident state, so you just put heavy signing bonus per year, with a spring training (Florida) address and the player bypasses Canadian taxes on that portion. They did this with the Vlad deal  jerseyjohn  8 hours ago Dusty: The top federal rate for Canada is 16% higher. You are right a big bonus can help but I am right they need to add extra millions to their contracts for their players. It also depends on who they\u2019re bidding against. States with no state tax have advantages over places like CA and NY, that gap gets even wider with Toronto.  Dustyslambchops23  8 hours ago For the most part tax free states haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been handing out big contracts, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think Miami, rays, Houston or rangers will be factors for Tucker.  Top blended income tax rates for NY is 46.7%, CA 45.6% and Ontario is 51.3%. This only applies to home games of course so extra tax for playing in Toronto would be 2-3%.  Now of course that adds up with these contracts but spending USD when the CAD is so weak more than makes up for that delta. Add a signing bonus per year to remove that 2-3% impact and pretty much all things are equal.  Reggie Smith  7 hours ago Dusty: \u201cFirstly Ontario tax rates are comparable to NY and CA\u201d Not what Ive heard for high earners at all. Here\u2019s what Google says, when comparing NY, LA and Tor: \u201cToronto generally has the highest combined personal income tax rates, especially for high earners.\u201d Also, there are many other revenue sources in NY or LA to supplement a star player\u2019s income that dont exist in Toronto. Playing baseball in Canada is akin to joining the witness protection program.  Dustyslambchops23  6 hours ago I gave you exact numbers and your rebuttal is anecdotal google language lol the numbers are above, and you only pay home tax on home games.  Toronto is the 4th biggest by population in the mlb, Toronto is consistently top 10 in attendance and top 1 for viewership. Spare me your anecdotal garbage that lacks any facts, do some research and gently pull your head out of your backside  Dustyslambchops23  5 hours ago Jays are 11th in free agency spend in the last 10 years, if the jays are witness protection what are the 19 other teams that are giving out less money in free agency?  Reggie Smith  4 hours ago \u201cI gave you exact numbers\u201d  I was responding to your earlier post where there were no numbers. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 \u201cTop 10 in attendance\u201d You mean 9th place, when they have the best record in AL. So basically poor position. Toronto is ahead of the 20 teams that would never bid on Tucker anyways, the teams ahead of them (LAD, SD, NYY, Phi, NYM, ChiC, SF) are the ones Toronto would have to bid against.  Jaysfansince92  4 hours ago Only around 40% of their income is taxed in Canada when you consider road games and spring training. Also there\u2019s things like signing bonuses and RCAs to further mitigate any tax differences. By the time it\u2019s all said and done, it doesn\u2019t usually work out to much more than a couple percentage point differences between places like New York and California. Past Blue Jays also won court cases recently that legitimized the methods they used to lower their tax obligations bringing greater clarity to how small the differences will be for future players. The idea that there\u2019s a huge difference is pretty much a myth at this point. The Blue Jays also have the ability to put in tax equalization clauses to further mitigate the difference.  Jaysfansince92  4 hours ago Why do Americans think that there\u2019s no way for baseball players to supplement their income in Canada? They have an entire country to a market themselves to. That shouldn\u2019t be a secret anymore considering it was brought up repeatedly during their pursuit of Ohtani.  JPR  5 hours ago Because someone wrote it somewhere and then it was repeated so often it became a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfact\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2013 there are no front runners for anyone \u2013 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all noise to get clicks  99Captain Judge99  10 hours ago Airbender will be back? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll believe it when I see it.  YankeesBleacherCreature  7 hours ago There\u2019s no reason he will be back as he\u2019ll set-up for Bednar. He\u2019s better off going to a team where he can close games and get paid to do so.  Jaysfansince92  4 hours ago It depends on whether or not they also bring back Bichette. If they bring in Tucker and let Bichette walk it\u2019s kind of a lateral move. Tucker may be a little bit better, but the difference between the two is not going to separate the Jays from the pack. They\u2019ll have to do a fair bit more than just Tucker for that.  davemlaw  19 hours ago The Yankees want to bring back Williams, who was not very good for them? I don\u2019t believe it.  Besides, I didn\u2019t pick Williams for NYY in the contest so it can\u2019t happen.  LordD99  19 hours ago There really is no significant rumor. Even Rosenthal said he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect Williams to return.  robw5555  12 hours ago Williams was lights out in Milwaukee. But they were willing to move him out. He cant handle NY pressure. He can handle Milwaukee pressure. I would not sign that guy for big bucks. With some of these guys you look at the past and see big stats. But today and tomm matter more. He wants a big multi yr deal after a bad yr.  Hammerin' Hank  8 hours ago Milwaukee only moved him out because he was going to be a free agent at year\u2019s end. And that whole thing about him not being able to pitch in New York is a myth. Like everyone says above, his underlying numbers were good. He just ran into some bad luck and ran hot and cold last year. He\u2019s still a dominant reliever. All these teams wouldn\u2019t be interested in him otherwise.  JPR  5 hours ago Everyone who succeeds in NY can handle NY pressure, and everyone who fails can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Repeats that substituting any MLB city for NY and the statement will be equally true, or false, or neither.  Jaysfansince92  4 hours ago To be fair, most of his underlying stats remained pretty much the same. It feels like there was a decent amount of bad luck involved during his New York tenure. His FIP was 2.68 last season. People often go to the argument that that players can\u2019t handle the pressure of New York too quickly without actually looking into things properly.  GreatLiberator  10 hours ago Cash is just making sure the price for Williams is high. No Yankees interest, cheaper contract for the Sox or Jays  Scott the Travel Agent  19 hours ago It feels good to be an Orioles fan and see big name free agents with the Orioles name mentioned as a possible landing place. I\u2019m thinking 1 more outfielder, 2 starters, & 2 more bullpen pieces. One can only hope the team stays the way with our young core of players. We had some good times with what we had before last season.  Go O\u2019s!  Oppo nacho  19 hours ago Same, just hearing that the reds or the pirates are in a conversation for a meaningful name feels good.  Ignorant Son-of-a-b  19 hours ago Tucker is going to the Orioles on an overpay\u2026Book It !!!  Scott the Travel Agent  18 hours ago Since you have your Son-of-a-b crystal ball out, what else do you see the Orioles doing this off season? I can\u2019t wait for the Winter Meetings to begin.  WadeBoggsWildRide  8 hours ago Orioles sign Tucker and Cease. Win world series as their young guys all click.  ba$eba||F@n21  17 hours ago There is no way the Orioles sign Tucker. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be in the neighborhood of 400 million dollars. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to spend that all on one player anyway, especially with needing a couple starters and bullpen pieces, as you mentioned. IF the Orioles bring on another major free agent that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a pitcher, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be Alonso (and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less likely now that they kept Mountcastle, unless traded)- the outfield group is pretty full with Ward, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill, Cowser, Beavers, Jackson etc  They should bring in one of the top free agent starters, also go after Imai, and then get at least one high leverage bullpen arm. They can then trade or sign lesser coveted free agents than the major ones, to fill any additional needs from there. That would be a great offseason and still allow for deadline additions mid season.  robw5555  11 hours ago Orioles are not where he is going.  gorav114  12 hours ago While I agree and love the optimism, it is not happening. I have been fooled by this many times. Elias wants to prove how smart he is and the Os are now run like a private equity firm. Not a chance in the world the Os sign any free agent for even close to Tucker money.  Hammerin' Hank  8 hours ago You just know that Elias is eyeing a Ramon Urias reunion. That\u2019ll be his big signing. Then Ramon can go back to blocking prospects.  Salzilla  12 hours ago The O\u2019s who just traded for Ward? Nah, c\u2019mon now, not happening.  robw5555  11 hours ago Its Yankees, Mets, Dodgers. Every singel free agent at whatever price, the Dodgers will usually be in the bidding process.  Yanks4life22  19 hours ago For the love of Christ can the Yankees hire a friggin  GM already. Hal\u2026we get it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never live up to your father so Cashman is the default owner because of your insecurities therefore inability to stay in the building for more than a couple hours. So why not just hire a GM since Cashman is busy running the entire organization? He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the favorite son anyway so just turn it over and hire a dam GM. Billionaires sons are just the worst these days.  robw5555  11 hours ago Cashman and Boone will remain, until they want to retire.  rocky7  11 hours ago With Cash ensconced in the organization there\u2019s little hope for his ouster unless he wants out\u2026an alternative though would be for Hal to hire a good baseball guy as a consultant and use him  to help evaluate any trades, or moves Cashman and his analytics department want ( you know a baseball guy who uses his eyes and ears rather than stats created to make negatives into positives) ,,,,even Cash would have to admit that many of his recent (last 5 years or so) additions or subtractions can be second guessed.   Having a guy in-between Cash and Hal would allow Hal to hear a voice other than Cash\u2019s on any moves involving putting the team in better stead to win a WS.  Yanks4life22  9 hours ago I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even be mad at Cashman anymore. Hal has him in a CEO type role where he literally is running the NY Yankees multi-billion dollar beast. There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough time in the day to do that and also go be a GM.  KnicksFanCavsFan  8 hours ago I\u2019m a die hard Yanks fan since 1978 and I want to win badly every year. That being did, I wish my fellow Yankee fans would stfu about making changes to make changes. Cashman\/Boone have the highest winning % of any other team since his hiring, second only to Dave Roberts. And can we stop over romanticizing the \u201cBoss\u201d era. Yes he had a passion to win but that passion resulted in a great 5 year span in the late 80s and them a horrible 15 year span as one of the worst ran teams in baseball. It\u2019s not Cashman\u2019s fault that Judge and others choked in recent playoffs history. Or that they\u2019ve been unlucky with injuries. Winning isn\u2019t easy and the only team consistently doing it now at the Dodgers who\u2019s ownership personal wealth are a multiple of what Hal is worth. We have an ownership that, for the most part, will willingly spend, hundreds of millions every year to bring in talent.  Cashman may not deserve more praise but he definitely deserves less blame. And Boone I feel can do the job if the players do their\u2019s. Can\u2019t blame postseason defensive lapses from guys that are generally considered good defenders (Jazz, Volpe, Judge, Cole) on Boone.  Begamin  6 hours ago Having that high of a winning % with that payroll really isnt impressive. The money does a lot of the work for them. Boone is a figure head anyways i doubt he even sets lineups himself.  They should be the Dodgers of the AL but instead are just regular season warriors with major holes in every area of the roster but thats okay with you because theyre better than the Pirates. Goal post moving is fun aint it? Ahhh who cares about the World Series its all about regular season winning %!! foh  KnicksFanCavsFan  4 hours ago @Beg Having that high of a winning % shows that over the span of a 162 games you\u2019re team\u2019s success is not a fluke. Can we agree that the GM can\u2019t control whether a hitter hits in the post-season? Jazz, Beli, Grisham, Stanton, Wells, Rice and Volpe all posted .OPS under. 700 and Fried, Gil and Rondon couldn\u2019t get past the 3rd inning. I\u2019m not firing my GM nor manager because the players failed. Cashman did his job with what was available in the market at the deadline to address 3b and the pen and the team had a chance to go much further had their hitters not turned into garbage and his starters not failed to move up to their standards.  Begamin  4 hours ago A GM controls what roster he sends into the postseason. A high winning % shows that theyre able to beat up on teams spending 1\/3 of what they are but when they get spanked every post season its a reminder they cant beat actually good teams. If you gave me $300MM YEARLY to work with you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see similar results lol \u00e2\u0080\u009cIm not firing the GM nor manager because the players failed\u00e2\u0080\u009d Buddy guess who put those players out on the field. Your takes are mind numbingly dumb, stop trying to reduce the GMs job down to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwelp what are u gonna do its not their fault the team they assemble with nearly unlimited resources routinely fails!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  KnicksFanCavsFan  1 hour ago @Beg So please tell me what is Cashman to do to get Jazz Beli, Rice, Grisham, Stanton and Wells to hit like they did during the season or too he Fried, Rondon and Gil pass the 3rd inning in the post-season? I\u2019ll wait\u2026  crs  4 hours ago \u201cWinning isn\u2019t easy\u201d\u2026 this is very,very true. I have no opinion, at all, about the Yankees front office, but most FO\u2019s would be better off if they kept that in mind when they make a transaction.  Acoss1331  19 hours ago Devin didn\u2019t work out last season, move on and get other relievers instead. I\u2019m pretty sure Yankees aren\u2019t getting Tucker, Bellinger is the guy they will realistically pursue.  Ignorant Son-of-a-b  19 hours ago Tucker would be perfect in Baltimore plus it will help spread out the star player love so they aren\u2019t all amassed on two or three teams.  Rubinstein ready to spend some dough and this time Elias will be signing the contracts and getting deals done. They will likely sign one of the top three starters as well, my guess is Valdez. And a closer. Even though I\u2019m a Mariners fan would love to see it happen. More fanbases deserve to have teams that spend  Scott the Travel Agent  18 hours ago Thanks from an Orioles fan and part time Mariners fan (my son lives in Redmond WA). My thoughts are Michael Arougheti who is the next man in the ownership group behind Rubinstein was a fantasy baseball guy. Now he is doing it live since he can\u2019t play fantasy baseball any longer. From what I see in Aroughti I like. Hell he bought a round of drinks for us fans before the 2024 season on opening day. Can\u2019t not like a guy for putting suds in my mug. Even though I don\u2019t drink I did get a Coke on his tab.  Hammerin' Hank  8 hours ago Samuel\u2019s not going to be happy about having a fantasy baseball guy in the ownership group. Or as he calls it, \u2018Rotisserie League,\u2019 lol.  Acoss1331  18 hours ago Orioles can keep Tucker and I mean that in a nice way. Rubenstein did say he wanted to win so he\u2019d be a big star to add to a team that\u2019s looking to reset after last season.  bighiggy  18 hours ago Wonder if the Yankees would swing a deal with the cards for donovan and or noot with Dominguez going the other way. Obviously other pieces would be involved on either side but could totally see them matching up  Joe says...  15 hours ago If the Yankees sign Bellinger, Nootbar and to a lesser extent, Donovan, wouldn\u2019t fit as they\u2019re both lefty bats and the Yankees are already lefty heavy.  KnicksFanCavsFan  8 hours ago @Joe Why would the Yanks sign two more OF? Why would they sign Nootbar, who suffers to hit left- handers just as badly as Dominguez? At least with Dominguez you\u2019re yakking about a 22 yo with only a year under his belt which would make you hope he\u2019ll get better.  rocky7  24 seconds ago Agreed\u2026.this Nootbar guy have been rumored to be on the trade list of the Cards for the last couple of years\u2026.the Yankees don\u2019t need the Cards garbage when we have a ver serviceable Martian to compete for a job or be used as a trade chip to secure relief or starting pitching\u2026\u2026besides\u2026I would bet that the Cards try attaching their untraceable 3rd baseman in the deal\u2026.the Yankees definitely don\u2019t want or need him\u2026..  ArianaGrandSlam  16 hours ago How can they afford making the same mistake twice?  Astros_fan_in_Aus  15 hours ago It\u2019s what they do best.  ArianaGrandSlam  14 hours ago No wonder!  Armaments216  11 hours ago Maybe they don\u2019t really want Williams back but it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to pretend that they do. The Yankees signaling that they\u2019ll always support a player\u2019s next career move no matter how badly their time with the team works out.  mike156  13 hours ago I\u2019ve been a Yankees fan a very long time, and most of that they\u2019ve offered a good on the field experience and even sprinkled a few championships in there, I\u2019m not going to criticize their willingness to spend. But they have a habit of making the same FO mistakes year after year\u2013older players past their peak, stifling the occasional prospect by sticking him behind those players, trading or signing players who should be better than they actually perform, and bringing back players who didn\u2019t perform well.  They need fresh blood both in roster and in thinking,  sfes  12 hours ago What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your stance on Boone?  mike156  8 hours ago Without knowing what the clubhouse dynamic is, hard to be certain, but he does make a number of bewildering choices, especially with the bullpen.  Cash-Man-NY  3 hours ago Boone \u00f0\u009f\u00a5\u00b0\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u009d\u00a4\u00ef\u00b8\u008f  Hammerin' Hank  8 hours ago Nobody stifles prospects like Elias.  KnicksFanCavsFan  8 hours ago @mike What older players \u201cpast their peak\u201d have they signed for multiple years, so not guys like Goldy or guys like Rizzo or DJ who they signed because we didn\u2019t have an or internal farm option. What rookies pathway to the majors has Cashman blocked??? Lol at all the rookies he brought up over the last 8 years. Judge, Volpe, Wells, Gil, Schmidt, Rice, Dominguez or traded for young players under control like Jazz, Grisham, etc.  I think it\u2019s unfair to say Cashman, in recent years, has signed over the hill guys. According to most fans, he was suppose to sign guys like Bregman, Alonso,  Santander etc  Begamin  6 hours ago Cash routinely blocks prospects he doesnt believe in favor of vets. Stop having selective memory please, because youre constantly wrong on here. Trotting Hicks out there instead of any top OF prospect (Frazier, Florial for example), signing Drury to block Andujar just for Andujar to get lucky and play anyways, just for Cash to get another guy to take Andujars job and send him to the OF for him to tear his shoulder. Thairo Estrada got sent away for nothing. King was relegated to the pen because no rotation spot for him. Clogging 3B with Josh Donaldson. Grisham to block Jones JUST happened too.  Theres always guys Cash is stubborn about, whether its he believes in them too much or not at all, stop pretending he doesnt do this.  YankeesBleacherCreature  5 hours ago Jones isn\u2019t ready yet for The Show. Grish is only signed for one-year. That hardly qualifies as a block.  Begamin  5 hours ago In what way is he not ready for the show? Dudes 25 ffs. And its most definitely a block, regardless of contract length. When Cash signed Drury to block Andujar it wasnt a long term nor expensive deal, still tried to block him. Contract length is a non factor when considering what is and isnt blocking a prospect from a MLB roster spot  YankeesBleacherCreature  3 hours ago I\u2019d love to have Jones up but his high strikeout at 37% strikeout rate in 300 AAA plate appearances does not inspire confidence yet. That\u2019s Joey Gallo-like without his propensity for walks. Andujar and Florial both struck out too much at AAA to be useful at the MLB level.  Begamin  3 hours ago Andujar just posted a 125 OPS+ btw. Joey Gallo had a similar .OPS his last year in AAA to Spencer Jones btw. Prime Joey Gallo-lite on a rookie contract is MLB ready enough. Suggesting to keep him down until hes 26+ is silly  Salzilla  11 hours ago I say BS. I don\u2019t think for a minute Yanks re-sign him. He was the impetus first the beard rule and then sucked. Get outta here with that. Take that energy across town.  YankeesBleacherCreature  7 hours ago If Diaz doesn\u2019t re-sign, that could be a great landing spot for him.  Old York  10 hours ago The Yankees spend a lot but don\u2019t spend it wisely.  rocky7  10 hours ago So many of their missteps missing on free agents who would cost huge money, and settling for the second or third best options that also cost big money can be tied to the ill-fated acquisition of Stanton and his bloated contract\u2026.he was brought in to win a WS, and his first 2 years in pinstripes were MVP calibre\u2026however what Cash should have done when they didn\u2019t make it to the WS was sell high on Stanton and rid himself of the contract dollars he had to know was going to shape what and where he could acquire top talent for years to come\u2026.hence no WS title since 09\u2026..  RickEO  10 hours ago Our farm system is hot garbage  KnicksFanCavsFan  8 hours ago @Rick  You mean the one that\u2019s produced Dominguez, Gil, Schmidt, Volpe, Wells, Cortez, Rice, Warren and Schlittler of late and was instrumental in getting is Williams and Jazz? They have at least 4 or 5 interesting arms between A+-AA.  sfes  7 hours ago Michael King came from that system too  rocky7  7 mins ago Top arm system players are not guaranteed top major league players\u2026..with the Yankees making the playoffs 95% of the time, 95% of the time they are picking at the very rear of the round\u2026.do you think those teams picking at the end of the round have a better track record?\u2026..I would kind of doubt that\u2026.secondly, the Yankees have a tremendous amount of players playing around the league who came through the Yankee system\u2026maybe not all superstars but solid ballplayers all the same\u2026..  JoeBrady  9 hours ago Seriously doubt the NYY spend $15M for Williams to be a 7th\/8th inning guy.  oneiblnd  8 hours ago He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a closer. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a choker. Middle reliever at best.  Hammerin' Hank  8 hours ago He\u2019s going to be a closer again soon, so deal with it.  cajundago19  8 hours ago \u00e2\u0080\u00a6not a belly itch\u00e2\u0080\u0099er?  JoeBrady  5 hours ago Of course he\u2019s a closer; just not for NY.  rocky7  15 mins ago Maybe\u2026but his go to best pitch is a changeup\u2026.unconventional to say the least but he really is a 2 pitch pitcher\u2026.fastball and changeup\u2026\u2026and his fast ball doesn\u2019t scare anyone\u2026.for him, it seems all about location which was very sketchy the first half of last year\u2026\u2026  Captainmike1  5 hours ago I sure hope the Yanks pass on Tucker My brother and I agree he is way over rated and not worth what Borass wants for him  Nick W  5 hours ago I\u2019d bring Weaver before I brought back Williams.  rocky7  12 mins ago Weaver seems to want to convert back to starting, and he also had a bad habit of tipping his pitches and frankly couldn\u2019t figure out how not to even after he knew he was\u2026..that being said, the Yankees got rid of 5 members of their bullpen yesterday\u2026.maybe they have plans for either or both as serviceable pieces of the 26 Yankee bullpen.  AC Surf Baseball 609  53 mins ago Speaking of closers, would not be surprised to see the Astros trade Josh Hader (3\/$57) if they were offered a star OF\u00e2\u0080\u0099er or SP for him, plus a shot in the arm of prospects for a team that needs them.

Last month, circularity became the word keeping investors up at night, with investors haunted by visions of Big Tech's complicated web of circular dealmaking creating outsize risk for markets.  Enter a new boogeyman: depreciation. Fears that expensive GPUs and semiconductor chips that firms are buying up will lose value more quickly than they expect \u2014 therefore becoming more of a cost burden and weighing on earnings \u2014 are roiling the AI trade. The Nasdaq 100 is down 6.3% over the last few weeks, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has fallen more than 9%. Famed short sellers Michael Burry and Jim Chanos have brought depreciation worries to the fore in recent weeks as a key reason they're skeptical of the AI trade.  \"By my estimates they will understate depreciation by $176 billion 2026-2028,\" Burry recently wrote on X about the Big Tech hyperscalers, saying he estimates chips will have a two to three year lifecycle, not the roughly six years firms anticipate. It's not just big name short-sellers, though, who are nervous about the depreication issue.  \"Why are stocks falling? Because if you take the numbers in this chart seriously, the hyperscalers will hold at least $2.5 trillion in AI assets by the end of this decade,\" Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist at BCA Research, wrote in a LinkedIn post on Thursday. \"Assuming a depreciation rate of 20%, that would generate $500 billion in annual depreciation expense. This is more than their combined profits for 2025.\" Here's the chart Berezin references: Kai Wu, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Sparkline Capital, said in a recent report that depreciation values could rise from $150 billion a year to $400 billion in the next half decade. \"While the Magnificent 7 are extremely profitable, their net income will be dragged down over the next few years once depreciation charges from their surging capital expenditures kick in,\" Wu wrote. He continued: \"Many analysts believe that the hyperscalers' 5-6 year useful life assumption for AI data centers is overoptimistic, with 2-3 years more appropriate given Nvidia's accelerating GPU replacement cycle.\" Adjusted for that faster depreciation timeline, Wu put current AI spending levels in context with the railroad and internet booms. \"Relative to GDP, current AI spending already exceeds the peak achieved in the Internet boom,\" he wrote. \"While it remains below the peak attained in the railroad buildout, the useful life of AI chips is much shorter than that of railroads. If we adjust for faster depreciation, today's AI buildout tops the chart.\" This new depreciation argument isn't yet widely accepted on Wall Street or in the AI industry itself \u2014 few mainstream strategists seem to be warning of such a threat yet. \"GPUs can profitably run for about 6 years,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a November 17 client note. \"The depreciation accounting of most major hyperscalers is reasonable.\" But for now, the prospect of the theory being correct seems to be throwing a wrench into the once red-hot AI trade.

Stock Update: Users say this TV is already out of stock in Sydney and Perth Only 60HZ butr that depends on your use case Go check your local store. Heaps of stock in Marsden Park though online shows out of stock Then don't comment 'pointless listing' , plenty of people are happy to make the drive.

Nothing in Perth big screen TVs are getting so cheap. Wish I have a big enough room, so I can use 3 of these for PC 3 monitors setup. It'll be more efficient to just wish for more money. A good price but a reminder that this is only the Q6 QLED, not U6 Mini-Led. There is a huge difference in picture quality and motion blur going up thru the models, and moreso getting into U7 and U8. Scored a 65U8 for $1214 with stacked discounts from JB in October during perks offers. You're comparing a completely different class of television in a completely different price category. You could have 2 of these for that price but i'm glad you're happy with your purchase of said completely irrelevant television to this post. lol right!?!? Compares a tv double the price lol Might as well just say \"you're better off just getting the 83 inch LG OLED M5 for only $8k\" Reductio ad absurdum is one of the weakest forms of argument. There is a huge difference between a delta of $600, even when it is double and a delta of $7400k. A lot more people can stretch $600. Not useful to someone who doesn't have the extra money to spend. Very useful to give pause to a bargain hunter that might be happier with a more expensive unit in the long run. There was about 4 left in Ringwood, VIC at 2pm.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"     I put an AI-created meal plan to the test. Here are my thoughts.    ChatGPT created seven dinners that were all able to be cooked in under 45 minutes. I've cooked more this year than I ever have before. Between testing\u00a0meal kits\u00a0and kitchen gadgets, I've branched out farther than just using my air fryer for meals (even though it's still one of my favorite kitchen staples), and I've even gone into the world of AI. Yes, you read that right. When I decided to make a week's worth of meals, I turned to AI to help. My main goals were to save money, try new recipes and reduce food waste. While it's possible to build your meal plans manually, you'll end up investing a solid chunk of time into it. Given that, I started wondering if artificial intelligence, specifically ChatGPT, could help cut down the amount of time needed for this chore. If this generative AI\u00a0can be used to write resumes, negotiate bills and even help you talk to your doctor about your health symptoms, could it also handle simple meal planning and making a grocery list? Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.\u00a0Add CNET\u00a0as a preferred Google source. I put it to the test. I asked ChatGPT to create a seven-day healthy-dinner meal plan for me, with a few parameters, and a grocery list. Here's what happened. Read more: ChatGPT 4 Review: A Smarter AI Chatbot, but It'll Cost You Prompt:\u00a0\"Hi, ChatGPT. Can you provide me with a seven-day meal plan for quick and healthy dinners for two people?\"\u00a0 ChatGPT:\u00a0\"Certainly! Here's a seven-day meal plan for quick and healthy dinners for two people. Each meal is designed to be simple and fast to prepare.\" Here are the meals it gave me:\u00a0 Day 1: Lemon garlic chicken with roasted vegetablesDay 2: Beef stir-fry with broccoli and riceDay 3: Veggie tacosDay 4: Baked chicken with quinoa and spinachDay 5: Pasta primaveraDay 6: Chicken-and-vegetable skewersDay 7: Easy turkey chili Ingredients and a short sentence with instructions were also provided, but the ingredients didn't offer any measurements, though you could ask the application for specific measurements if you needed them. I was able to estimate the amount of each ingredient that my household of two needed. I headed to the grocery store with the list provided, then made the first meal that evening. ChatGPT ingredients: Chicken breasts, lemon, garlic, olive oil, mixed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers, zucchini).ChatGPT instructions: Marinate chicken breasts in lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper. Roast alongside mixed vegetables at 400 degrees F (200 C) for 25-30 minutes. I'm happy to report that ChatGPT kept its word and provided me with an extremely easy recipe to start the week. I was able to pop everything together in the oven, then clean up and set the table as it cooked.\u00a0 I made slight tweaks to this recipe, including cooking the carrots for about 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients to the pan, since I know from past experience that zucchini and peppers cook a lot quicker than carrots. I also added a couple of extra seasonings because the AI recipes were slightly lacking in that department. Sheet-pan dinners such as this one are perfect for weeknight dinners.\u00a0 ChatGPT ingredients: Beef strips, broccoli, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, rice.ChatGPT instructions: Stir-fry beef strips with garlic and ginger, add broccoli, and cook until tender. Serve over steamed rice. This recipe is the one I adjusted the most, but it was still fairly quick to prepare. I felt like something was missing from the ingredients ChatGPT suggested, so I decided to make a slightly more involved sauce. I was inspired by this recipe, which I've used in the past, and I ended up adding only two extra ingredients: cornstarch and brown sugar. This was a perfect and filling weeknight meal, but for the most part, I put in the same amount of effort into this meal as I would have if I didn't use AI.\u00a0 With a few adjustments to ChatGPT's original recipe, this dish turned out tangy and delicious.\u00a0 ChatGPT ingredients: Tortillas, black beans, corn, bell peppers, avocado, salsa, shredded cheese.ChatGPT instructions: Saute bell peppers, mix with black beans and corn. Fill tortillas with veggie mix, avocado slices, salsa and cheese. Although ChatGPT recommended veggie tacos, I ended up making quesadillas instead after accidentally buying the wrong size tortillas, but I love quesadillas just the same. The one notable thing about this recipe is that ChatGPT didn't add any seasonings to the ingredient list, so I made sure to add my own.\u00a0 Whether you make this meal as quesadillas or tacos, it'll be delicious.\u00a0 ChatGPT ingredients: Chicken thighs or breasts, lemon, olive oil, quinoa, fresh spinach.ChatGPT instructions: Season chicken with lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Bake at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 25-30 minutes. Serve with cooked quinoa and sauteed spinach. Even though this was probably the simplest recipe of the week, it was my favorite. I loved how the saut\u00e9ed spinach and quinoa tasted together. It's a great recipe to make when you have spinach left over in the fridge that may be on the brink of going bad, since even numerous cups of spinach still isn't a huge amount after it's saut\u00e9ed. If I made this meal again, I would add more seasonings than what ChatGPT recommended (this was a common trend during the week.) If you want to add more flavor to your quinoa, you can cook it in chicken or vegetable broth instead of water. ChatGPT ingredients: Pasta (e.g., penne or spaghetti), cherry tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers, olive oil, parmesan cheese.ChatGPT instructions: Cook pasta, saute vegetables in olive oil until tender. Toss pasta with veggies and parmesan cheese. It's hard to go wrong with pasta, but this recipe missed the mark. ChatGPT's instructions said to saute the cherry tomatoes, zucchini and bell peppers in olive oil, then toss the cooked pasta with the veggies and parmesan cheese. Though no seasonings were listed, I added them, but it was still a lackluster meal.\u00a0 I still ate it for dinner (and lunch the next day), because I didn't want to waste the meal, but if I make this meal in the future, I'll add fresh garlic, a few more varieties of vegetables, and lemon juice to enrich the flavor.\u00a0 Additional vegetables you can add to pasta primavera are onions, asparagus and carrots. ChatGPT ingredients: Chicken chunks, bell peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes, olive oil, your favorite seasoning.ChatGPT instructions: Thread chicken and vegetables onto skewers. Brush with olive oil and seasoning. Grill or bake at 400 F (200 C) for 15-20 minutes. These chicken thigh kebabs were delicious and filling even without an additional side. Something I liked about the ChatGPT meal plan was that meals were basic enough to make slight adjustments. For example, this recipe listed bell peppers, onions and cherry tomatoes for the vegetables, but it's simple enough to swap out those vegetables with any of your choosing.\u00a0 I skipped using cherry tomatoes, since I'd had plenty the night before in the pasta primavera,but mushrooms would be a great addition to this meal. You can cook these kebabs in the air fryer or oven.\u00a0 ChatGPT ingredients: Ground turkey, canned tomatoes, kidney beans, chili seasoning.ChatGPT instructions: Brown the ground turkey, then add tomatoes, beans, and chili seasoning. Simmer for 20-30 minutes. People either love chili or hate it. I'm in the former category so this meal was a great way to end my week (and to welcome in colder weather!). After you brown the ground turkey, this meal largely cooks itself while it simmers on the stove, so it's an especially good recipe for days you don't want to spend all night in the kitchen.\u00a0 Turkey chili is typically a healthier alternative to beef chili. I'm sure I'm not the only one who doesn't love grocery shopping, so one of my favorite parts about using ChatGPT for a meal plan was getting an accompanying grocery list along with it.\u00a0 The application made my trip to the market painless by grouping items by category for ultra convenience. With the list copied into my iPhone's notes app, I was in and out of the store within 30 minutes.\u00a0 Grocery shopping became much easier with ChatGPT's help. While the simple meals ChatGPT gave me weren't groundbreaking, I appreciate that you can continue asking the application questions to get exactly what type of meals you desire. Whether you want meals for the week that can be made in under 30 minutes or you want them to be vegetarian, gluten-free or even zero-waste, you can ask ChatGPT to customize a meal plan for you, but just know that you may have to work with the application for a few minutes to get exactly what you desire.\u00a0 Most importantly though, I realized this week that I didn't throw away any food -- not even a single scrap. My husband and I either ate all the food the night we cooked it or ate the leftovers for lunch the following day. And that felt even better than an uncomplicated grocery store trip.\u00a0 According to a recent CNET survey, Americans who grocery shop waste an average of $125 a month on food that's not cooked or eaten. This largely occurs from over-purchasing food or not eating it\u00a0before it spoils.\u00a0 This level of food waste can negatively affect the environment by forcing food production to increase, adding to its carbon footprint, which is based on how many greenhouse gasses are emitted into the atmosphere during the food production process. And\u00a0rotting foods in landfills actually release methane\u00a0into the environment, which is the second-largest contributor to\u00a0climate warming\u00a0(directly behind carbon dioxide). \u00a0 Read more:\u00a0Don't Throw Your Leftover Food Scraps Away.

{"date":"2025-11-22","content":"     The classic one-cent coin is being retired, but it still has purpose.    Treasurer of the United States Brandon Beach holds the last penny stamped at the US Mint on Nov. 12, 2025 in Philadelphia. The penny -- that lowly, grimy, circular piece of copper and zinc -- is getting the last laugh. It's been less than a month since the last one was minted on Nov. 12, and there are growing penny shortages all over the US. Stores are actually paying people to bring them in, and businesses fear they could lose millions of dollars. What's that old saying? You don't miss something until it's gone? Maybe the penny was more important than we thought. But that old one-cent coin had been fighting a losing battle for respect for years. You can't buy anything with them anymore, not even a gumball. Most of us just toss them into a junk drawer or a glass jar. A sad penny can even lie on a sidewalk all day and not get scooped up. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. CNET editor Gael Cooper spotted this sign at a Seattle Starbucks. The US Mint printed the last pennies on Nov. 12, ending a 230-year run. According to the Mint, the cost of making the coin was 3.69 cents for every one-cent penny -- hardly a smart return on investment for taxpayers.\u00a0 However, with the discontinuation of penny production, some brick-and-mortar businesses across the country have been unable to give back exact change because they lack sufficient pennies, if any at all. A Retail Industry Leaders Association\u00a0survey\u00a0revealed that thousands of stores have no pennies, and they are calling on the federal government to take action. Grocery chain Price Chopper and Market 32 recently held a\u00a0Double Exchange Day, where people brought in their pennies and received double the value back in the form of a shopping voucher. Similarly, grocery chain Giant Eagle offered gift cards worth twice the amount of pennies customers brought in during a one-day event on Nov. 1. CBS News\u00a0asked several large companies\u00a0how they would handle cash transactions if there were shortages of pennies at the counter. McDonald's said the company's restaurants would round up or down to the nearest nickel, meaning an order costing $12.43 would round up to $12.45, but an order costing $12.42 would round down to $12.40. Wendy's, Kwik Trip, and GoTo Foods -- parent company of Auntie Anne's, Cinnabon, Jamba and Carvel -- all said they would round down to the nearest nickel in favor of the customer. Kroger will encourage customers to use exact change, but still accepts pennies as payment. Rounding down is beneficial for consumers, but the National Association of Convenience Stores estimates that thousands of stores across the US\u00a0could collectively lose more than $1 million a day\u00a0by rounding down. The NACS wants US lawmakers to create a law that would allow businesses to round transactions up to the nearest nickel.   Until the federal government establishes guidelines or regulations on how to address the disappearing penny, things will remain chaotic for a while. Mark Stiving,\u00a0CEO of pricing strategy company Impact Pricing, said the discontinuation of the penny will have \"almost zero impact\" on consumers and businesses in the long run. And he's got the receipts from New Zealand to prove it. \"What I think is about to happen is that companies will still put prices out in '9's (like $49.99),\" Stiving told CNET. According to Striving, New Zealand used the rounding method after demonetizing and phasing out its penny. \"You'd still price something at $9.99, but you just rounded it to the nearest nickel. So whenever a transaction happened, it was always the nearest nickel.\" You're not going to find a fortune by foraging all the pennies in your home, unless you have an exceptionally rare one lying around. But if you dig around your bedroom, garage, kitchen and even your car, you might collect a few bucks worth. That's not nothing. Would you let a five-dollar bill collect dust in a drawer? Of course not. Find a Coinstar kiosk. You've likely walked by one of the company's 17,000 machines without even noticing it, but this is a pretty handy way to convert those pennies and other coins into cash. The process is simple: Locate a kiosk (typically found inside a grocery store) and deposit your coins to receive a cash voucher, which you can redeem at checkout or at customer service. There is a service fee of nearly 13%, so if you redeem $100 worth of coins, you'll get $87. Wrap the coins and find a bank: Many banks and credit unions will accept your coins. They might have a coin-counting machine, or they may ask you to organize the coins into wrappers, which is time-consuming but also will give you an idea of just how many coins you've been stashing. There may or may not be a fee, depending on whether you're an account holder. (Note: Some banks will not accept prewrapped coins; they must be counted out or machine-checked to ensure they are legitimate.) Yes, people do hide same-weight slugs inside coin rolls.) Just spend them: Gone are the days when you could ride your horse down to the general store and buy something with a penny, but there are still a few holdouts.\u00a0Dollar General offers a weekly Penny List featuring out-of-season or discontinued items that have been marked down to just one cent. Websites such as The Krazy Koupon Lady and The Freebie Guy provide weekly updates on what you can get for a penny at Dollar General -- if those items haven't already been removed from the shelves. Krazy Koupon Lady even has a Home Depot hack where you can get items for a penny. Find a collector's item: It's highly unlikely, but you never know. The most valuable penny is a\u00a01943-D Lincoln Wheat Cent Penny, which could fetch nearly $2.5 million. Or perhaps you have an\u00a01880 Indian Head Cent, which could net you around $150. USA Coin Book's list of valuable pennies is here.\u00a0 Fun and skills for kids: Those pennies could help you level up your arts and crafts toolbox. Help kids learn about budgeting, create some art, do a science experiment -- you've got options! Check out Greenlight's ideas.\u00a0 The penny is just the latest US coin to be discontinued. The half-cent, the half-dime, the large cent, the double eagle and several others\u00a0have all come and gone. The nickel could be next. It costs nearly 14 cents to make, almost three times the face value of the five-cent coin. The primary problem is that nickels are comprised of 75% copper and 25% nickel, metals which have doubled in price over the past decade. But it will be tougher to eliminate the nickel than the penny. Rounding up or down to the nearest dime could cost US taxpayers $56 million per year, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That is significantly more than the estimated $6 million rounding hit per year caused by the penny's retirement. The penny may be vanishing, but its history is full of fun facts. President Lincoln was not always on the penny. Honest Abe only became the star attraction in 1909, in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth. Lady Liberty was the first to appear on the penny, back in 1793. Newer pennies have little copper: Pennies minted after 1982 are made of copper-plated zinc, which consists of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper.   You can clean them: Vinegar, vegetable oil and water can help wash away decades of soot and grime off those pennies. But \"don't, don't, don't, don't\" even think about it if you want to hunt for any collectables in your penny stash -- it could significantly damage their worth, says one coin shop owner. Only Lincoln faces right: Our 13th president is the only person depicted on coins who is facing to the right. Everyone else faces left. Pull out some change and check for yourself. 50-50 coin toss? Try 80-20: Stanford math professor and former magician Persi Diaconis says that a penny will land tails up 80% of the time because the side with Lincoln's head weighs significantly more than the tails side. What D, S and P mean: Lettering on the front of the penny indicates where it was minted: D for Denver, S for San Francisco and P for Philadelphia. But you'll only see P on pennies minted in 2017, which was done to celebrate the US Mint's 225th anniversary. In all other years, pennies minted in Philly didn't have the P.\u00a0 Five special pennies: The final five pennies ever minted feature a special omega symbol, chosen because omega is the final letter in the Greek alphabet. You're unlikely to ever see one in real life. Those five pennies will not enter circulation, according to the Treasury Department. Instead, the government plans to auction them off. Details about the auction aren't yet available.","label":0}
