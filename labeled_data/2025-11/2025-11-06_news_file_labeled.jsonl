The first time I saw that ICE was investing up to $2 billion in Polymarket, I did a double take. What do the immigration police want to do with a prediction market? I quickly realized the ICE in question was actually Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. That makes more sense, I thought \u2014 but also, only slightly? I thought the stock exchange guys were supposed to be the serious ones in the room, helping companies grow and people save for retirement, not teaming up with the guys who let you guess when the US government will admit aliens exist. But thus is reality in the year of our Lord 2025: Americans have a growing appetite for leaving their fortunes to the fates, and businesses are eager to capitalize. \"When people are given the means to bet, they're going to bet,\" says Jordan Bender, an equity research analyst at Citizens JMP. The modern explosion of gambling in America began with the Supreme Court's 2018 decision to strike down a federal law prohibiting sports betting, leading to its proliferation across dozens of states. Now, much of the conversation is being dominated by another type of wagering: prediction markets. These platforms, which allow people to put money on a wide range of outcomes, from election results to natural disasters, have long been limited in the US. But recently, they've taken advantage of lax federal regulators and what they say are legal loopholes to offer their services in a growing number of states. \"It definitely looks, smells, and feels like gambling,\" says Steve Ruddock, a gambling-industry analyst and consultant and the author of Straight to the Point, a newsletter about the sector. So do a lot of things these days. The lines between gambling and investing are increasingly blurred, from the crypto market to the stock market to sports, and, increasingly, everyday events. Arguments that this type of activity is beneficial because it shows us something about the wisdom of crowds, market inefficiencies, price discovery, or capital allocation are becoming harder and harder to buy. And businesses, even stodgy incumbents and unexpected players, are increasingly willing to capitalize on Americans' urge to risk their hard-earned cash. Everything's casino, and you're either getting in on the action or getting left behind. I think a lot about a conversation I had a few years ago with Chris Grove, a sports-gambling-industry investor at Acies Investments, about the growth of sports betting apps such as DraftKings and FanDuel. He made a point that I discounted at the time: Once people get a taste for betting on one thing, they'll bet on a lot of things. This kind of gateway gambling represented a major opportunity not only for sportsbooks but also for investing apps and cryptocurrency platforms. When I relayed this to people, it felt like I was wearing a paranoid little tinfoil hat, but that case has quite clearly borne out in reality. The recent hotspot has been prediction markets, most notably Kalshi and Polymarket, which match users willing to wager on either side of a discrete event. Kalshi has made a major push into sports, including in states such as California and Texas, where traditional sports betting is illegal. And as part of its push to become a \"financial super app,\" investing platform Robinhood has started branching into betting markets in partnership with Kalshi. ICE has invested in Polymarket and will distribute the prediction market's data to investing customers trying to gauge sentiment on issues such as politics, business developments, and current events. Polymarket, once blocked for users in the US, is on the verge of becoming available nationwide. The NHL has signed licensing agreements with both Kalshi and Polymarket. More traditional sportsbooks, which set the odds and against which gamblers bet, aren't only expanding their offerings with things like online casino apps, they're also taking a page out of their new competitors' book, too. FanDuel is partnering with CME Group, a derivatives marketplace, to build an events contracts platform in the US that will let customers put money on where the price of gold and oil are headed, as well as economic indicators such as GDP and inflation. DraftKings has acquired the predictions platform Railbird. When reached for comment, a FanDuel spokesperson pointed to a press release about the CME deal. DraftKings pointed to comments its CEO, Jason Robins, made at a gaming conference in October, downplaying concerns about competition from prediction markets, saying that sports betting apps are a \"vastly superior experience.\" Polymarket didn't respond to a request for comment. If your head is spinning at all of this, it's understandable \u2014 this is all fast-moving and precarious. For one thing, it appears to be a reversal of previous regulatory approaches. Gambling has historically been regulated by states in the US, and at the heart of the matter now is whether prediction markets are considered gambling and, therefore, whether states should regulate them. Prediction markets say they're OK because they're simply offering contracts on the outcomes of future events and aren't on the other side of the trade. Since these are futures contracts, like those offered for gold or oil, the theory \u2014 and current reality \u2014 is that prediction markets should be federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not by individual states. The CFTC may be going along with this for the time being, but there's a lot of gray area. Basically, an 18-year-old in California can bet on a Dodgers game on Kalshi now, if it's considered a federally-regulated event contract. If it's sports gambling, that's illegal in California, and even if it were allowed, most states put the age limit at 21. Sportsbooks have state tax obligations that prediction markets avoid. Winnings are taxed differently, too. \"The vast majority of people that I deal with in this industry look at this and say, 'This is gambling, it's insane that we're having this conversation,'\" Citizens JMP's Bender says. Multiple states, including Massachusetts and Nevada, have sued or sent cease-and-desist letters to prediction markets, alleging they're offering illegal sports gambling. Native American tribes that operate casinos and sports betting operations in certain states have made similar claims. The answer to, \"Hey, is all of this activity on prediction markets kosher?\" seems to be \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af. \"The big question is, do these contracts violate all of the sports betting regulations? And that's kind of where things are right now,\" says Chad Beynon, an equity analyst at Macquarie. \"It's tricky investing a lot of money in this space right now, because it might completely go away.\" In an emailed statement, a Kalshi spokesperson told me the company is \"confident\" in its legal standing. \"Federal and state turf wars over commodities markets have been going on for decades in America, and the law is clear \u2014 Kalshi exists under the sole jurisdiction of the CFTC.\" they said. All the trickiness hasn't stopped some major players from getting involved. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund has invested in Polymarket. Donald Trump Jr. is involved with both Kalshi and Polymarket. The president's social media company, Trump Media, is planning to allow its Truth Social users to jump into prediction markets. \"You look at the money that is lined up behind these two names, and that's not money that has historically been involved with regulated gambling,\" Grove says. To be sure, what counts as gambling has always been hazy to define, says Peter Malyshev, a partner in the financial services group at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. What constitutes a legitimate commodity futures contract is something regulators and courts battled over in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and when they arrived at their current definition, they couldn't have envisioned a world of sports betting taking place on mobile phones. \"The whole notion of what gambling is, what is not, is very, very loosey goosey and it's arbitrary,\" he says. It's almost astounding to think about how commonplace speculation has become across the economy. A survey by the American Gaming Association found that 55% of US adults gambled in 2024, and Americans bet almost $150 billion on sports alone. That doesn't include activities that very much resemble gambling, such as exotic stock options, crypto, and prediction markets. I recently discovered members of my family are crossing the Wisconsin-Illinois border to place sports bets on NFL Sundays, as gambling is legal in the latter state but not the former. And I have not been immune to the allure. On a recent trip to Chicago, I stopped at a DraftKings bar outside Wrigley Field, where I could place bets. During a pre-season Bulls game, I checked out a FanDuel lounge to catch some contemporaneous baseball and hockey games and placed a few small bets from my phone. This is all stuff that would have been unimaginable five years ago. \"Once upon a time, you had to know a bookie or a broker or go to a casino, that's a lot more steps, and now it's just a few taps away,\" Parker Bach, a Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, who is studying digital political culture and prediction markets. The less-than-ideal possible outcomes of gambling's expansion were put on full display in recent days with the NBA betting scandal. Federal prosecutors allege that current and former basketball players, as well as people in their orbit, passed along insider information about players ahead of games to place bets on them. Sportsbooks are the victims of the alleged crimes \u2014 they're the ones that were defrauded. However, the case has made clear opportunities for funny businesses that widespread gambling affords. Consumer protection and legal issues aside, it's worth considering how some of this activity is distorting the economy and blurring the lines between investing and pure speculation. Investing is intended to drive capital allocation in ways that foster good businesses, good services, and good products, and, ultimately, grow the economy. Gambling is entertainment. But when money from the former pot goes into the latter pot, that could become a problem \u2014 it's not capital that's going toward creating anything, it's just a transfer of wealth. Tyler Gellasch, the president and CEO of the Healthy Markets Association, a nonprofit focused on increasing transparency for investors, says that the drive to funnel more money into speculative activities isn't just a concern for individual bettors or investors. \"It also takes real money out of the real economy and into essentially side bets,\" he tells me. Proponents of prediction markets say they have real value. They tap into the \"wisdom of the crowd\" and, in elections, may rival polling in predicting who will come out ahead. They can be used as a hedge against the possibility of different events \u2014 you place a little money on something that would hurt you, like your house burning down in a California wildfire, so that if the worst comes to pass, you'll make money to offset the loss. These arguments can be shaky: Pretty much everyone on prediction markets was wrong about the 2025 papal conclave. I don't want to say everything's casino, but a lot of things are casino. \"I mean, if we're just being completely honest, it's all gambling,\" Ruddock says. It speaks to a sort of nihilism within the American public \u2014 this idea that the system's flawed, so you may as well go for it with a gamble. It also says something about just how alluring speculation can be; people do it because it's exhilarating and fun and, for most, not a problem. We can quibble over legal and regulatory definitions all day, but the demand for speculation is there, and the supply is ever-expanding to meet it.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        On Thursday, Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s pay package worth as much as $878 billion, an outcome that was widely expected. Musk received 75% approval in the vote. The compensation plan will hand over that wealth in 12 tranches of stock, provided various milestones are hit over the next decade. The vote occurred at Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder\u2019s meeting in Austin, Texas, and the first milestone that would unlock one of Musk\u2019s 12 payments would be Tesla reaching a market cap of $2 trillion. The company\u2019s market cap currently sits at $1.4 trillion. Other metrics include delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles, as well as deploying 1 million robotaxis and 1 million humanoid robots. Musk currently holds about 13% of Tesla shares and, if all of the milestones are hit, he would increase his stake to about 25%, according to CNBC. A deserving Musk gets his package! \u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) November 6, 2025  There\u2019s a broad consensus that Musk\u2019s association with far-right politics in 2024 and 2025 has harmed Tesla\u2019s brand among the company\u2019s more liberal customer base, but shareholders are still convinced that the electric carmaker would be much worse off if he wasn\u2019t around. Musk had threatened to turn his attention elsewhere if he didn\u2019t get his payday, but he\u2019s already distracted by ostensibly running many other companies, including SpaceX, The Boring Company, xAI, and X. Officially, X doesn\u2019t have a CEO right now, but Musk is largely seen as the one in charge and there doesn\u2019t appear to be any real urgency to find a new head to replace Linda Yaccarino, who left in the summer. Musk hitched his wagon to President Donald Trump, spending nearly $300 million to get him elected in 2024. Musk was the head of DOGE and took a chainsaw to the federal government, while also throwing up Nazi-style salutes. As a result, many potential Tesla customers were turned off and started placing bumper stickers on their cars like \u201cI bought this before Elon went crazy.\u201d Tesla has seen steep declines in sales across most of Europe, with sales in Norway down 50%, sales in the Netherlands down 48%, and sales in Spain down 30%, according to Bloomberg. Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, insisted in the lead up to the vote that he deserved the pay package and it wasn\u2019t actually about the money. The billionaire claimed that he needed the vote from shareholders to have influence over Tesla\u2019s \u201crobot army,\u201d trying to suggest that his developments with the Optimus robot could be dangerous if they fall into the wrong hands. Musk has made similar claims about AI potentially destroying humanity if not guided correctly against what he calls the \u201cwoke mind virus.\u201d Musk has tried to pivot Tesla in recent years from an electric car company into something much harder to define. The billionaire CEO wants people to think of Tesla as a technology company, investing in AI and robotics, but Musk\u2019s carnival barker attitude often means he promises big things and delivers something much more humble. For example, Musk promised to build a mass transit system called the Loop in 2018 which initially included autonomous 16-passenger vehicles zipping around underground at speeds of 155 miles per hour. The concept video, which was originally posted to Vimeo before being deleted years later, was quite impressive. But when it came time to actually build the thing Musk had promised, he created a short tunnel underneath Las Vegas. No special new vehicle, no high speed, no autonomy. It was just regular old Teslas slowly driven by humans in a short tunnel. Musk loves to create hype when his companies are struggling. And then, when the sugar rush wears off, he moves on to the next thing. What\u2019s the next over-hyped promise? Robots, for sure. But he\u2019s also teasing the idea of a flying car, which he told podcaster Joe Rogan last week could be demonstrated before the end of this year. Shareholders voted to give Musk a $56 billion pay package in 2018 that was also dependent on hitting 12 different milestones, including increased market capitalization of $50 billion up to $650 billion. But a judge in Delaware has shot down that compensation plan because it had misleading and incomplete information. That package is still being fought over in the courts. Musk said the judge was a \u201cradical far left activist cosplaying as a judge,\u201d an accusation he often makes of anyone to the left of Augusto Pinochet. Elon Musk is worth $492 billion, according to the latest estimates by Forbes. Tesla\u2019s stock closed down 3% to $445 per share on Thursday, but ticked up 3% in after hours trading after the announcement.

As a parent of little ones, I know just how debilitating catching the flu can be to a family. Everyone goes down in succession, making a simple illness take several weeks to run its course. With winter upon us, I'm conscious of the foods I feed my family to support our immune systems. Costco is one of my favorite retailers to shop at for my family. Although I have an average-sized family, we find that we can easily work our way through the large portions of several staples. Here are some of the products I stock up on this time of year. With a variety of uses, I cook with canned tomatoes almost every day, making this Costco 8-pack arguably too small. Besides their versatility, another reason I love canned tomatoes is that they contain more lycopene than fresh tomatoes. The processing involved in canned tomatoes actually boosts this immune-supporting antioxidant. Greek yogurt with live and active cultures is a great source of probiotics, which, when consumed regularly, can help support a healthy immune system.  With so many brands to choose from, I personally love the Chobani No Sugar Added Protein Greek yogurt because it is sweetened with stevia and packs 20 grams of protein. My son loves fruit, but often cannot finish an entire portion. Mandarins are the perfect size for his toddler-sized appetite. The best part? Mandarins are packed with vitamin C, which is an antioxidant that helps your immune cells fight off oxidative stress. My toddler will eat anything if it is sweet. Enter: honey. I swirl a dollop into his yogurt, spread it on toast, or even use it as a glaze on roasted vegetables. It's an added bonus that honey is packed with phytonutrients with antibacterial and immune-boosting properties. Keep in mind that children under the age of 1 should not consume any honey, since it can cause a serious illness called botulism. My favorite way to support my immune health? Stocking up on my favorite healthy soda, OLIPOP. Each can has between 35 and 50 calories, is an excellent source of fiber, and only has two to five grams of sugar. The prebiotics and functional ingredients support digestive health, which plays a key role in overall wellness. Arguably this season's favorite vegetable, I use pumpkin in a variety of recipes, including chili, muffins, cookies, stuffed peppers, and even yogurt bark. Not only is it seasonal and delicious, but it is also rich in immune-boosting beta carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. As a busy working mom, I rely heavily on kitchen shortcuts. Pre-minced garlic is one of my favorites because it is always ready in the fridge. If you have time, fresh garlic is slightly better than pre-minced. In my experience, most dinner recipes call for a quick saute of garlic, which makes the Costco-sized portion a necessity. Beyond being a kitchen staple, garlic also contains a compound called allicin, which is an impressive immune-boosting nutrient.  Pomegranate juice is rich in polyphenols, a type of antioxidant. Research shows that antioxidants can help to maintain the function of immune cells. I enjoy incorporating pomegranate juice into smoothies, as the base of mocktails, or using it to make pomegranate juice popsicles.       Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Economists have this idea that we live in an efficient market, but it\u2019s hard to fathom that when disposable vapes are equipped with rechargeable lithium cells. Still, just as market economists point out that if you leave a dollar on the sidewalk someone will pick it up, if you leave dollars worth of lithium batteries on the sidewalk, [Chris Doel] will pick them up and build a DIY home battery bank that we really hope won\u2019t burn down his shop. The Powerwall-like arrangement uses 500 batteries salvaged from disposable vapes. His personal quality control measure\u00a0 while pulling the cells from the vapes was to skip any that had been discharged past 3 V. On the other hand, we\u2019d be conservative too if we had to live with this thing, solid brick construction or not. That quality control was accomplished by a clever hack in and of itself: he built a device to blow through the found vapes and see if they lit up. (That starts at 3:20 in the vid.) No light? Not enough voltage. Easy. Even if you\u2019re not building a hoe powerbank, you might take note of that hack if you\u2019re interested in harvesting other people\u2019s deathsticks for lithium cells. The secret ingredient was the pump from a CPAP machine. Actually, it was the only ingredient.) In another nod to safety, he fuses every battery and the links between the 3D printed OSHA unapproved packs. The juxtoposition between janky build and careful design nods makes this hack delightful, and we really hope [Chris] doesn\u2019t burn down his shed, because like the cut of his jib and hope to see more hacks from this lad. They likely won\u2019t involve nicotine-soaked lithium, however, as the UK is finally banning disposable vapes. In some ways, that\u2019s a pity, since they\u2019re apparently good for more than just batteries \u2014 you can host a website on some of these things. How\u2019s that for market efficiency?   I hope the \u201choe powerbank\u201d typo won\u2019t be fixed as it\u2019s funny :~) Youngsters around me really gotta up their smoking game if i wanna have any chance at getting free lithium cells. Great project, really quite labour intensive but the results are also very good Pretty sure we\u2019ve already banned disposable vapes here in the UK and the ones I\u2019ve seen with the ARM chip are usually refillable as well as rechargeable. We have indeed, though apparently vape-junkies stockpiled them before the ban. But the ban has basically just resulted in the disposable vapes gaining usb ports, and they\u2019re still just as disposable, so I\u2019d expect toxic-chemical-soaked c-grade lithium batteries from \u201creusable\u201d vapes will be just as commonly discarded on our streets. Saved a bundle on the dinky batteries, and spent a small fortune on the electronics to support each individual cell.  Seems like false economy. This is Hackaday, since when does something need to be practical to be featured here? All of my robo-hoes use vape power banks.    Economists have this idea that we live in an efficient market  It is an efficient market, but by what metric? It\u2019s called neoliberalism, which combines the idea of social justice and intervention by the state through economic policy alone, to the invisible hand of the market through defining value to be money and worth to be whatever anyone is willing to pay. A perfect mix of left and right wing idealism. A vape is not an asset, it\u2019s a consumable. So efficient markets do not apply. A lithium ion battery is very much an asset, and in an efficient market wouldn\u2019t find itself in a consumable. Fortunately we\u2019re not living in an autistic utopia and things don\u2019t have to be 100% efficient like in Minecraft. It is not an asset to a person who is counting just the money they make from buying and selling vape pens. Once used, they would rather see it discarded so they can sell you another vape pen. There are some tools to find inefficiences in the markets, I use some smart money concepts and technical analisis everyday. But even if you find them,they not always translates into profit. Some inefficiencies always exist in absolute terms, and they have to be contrasted by the counter-factual case and its inefficiency. Recycling batteries is a good example: how much does it cost to make a new one versus recovering, sorting, and re-using old ones? Presently, it costs more to recycle a battery than make a new one, and that additional cost demands more economic activity to pay for, which results in more energy demand than simply making a new battery \u2013 assuming you don\u2019t give up on performing other activities to account for your effort to recycle batteries. IMHO, right now we are (in the US) are stuck in the market that copied the worst of both worlds. State is no longer capable of good solid \u201cinterventions\u201d in form of New Deals, whereas the invisible hand of the market had long (since early 1990s) reversed the trickle-down economy. A perfect mix of what we don\u2019t need, every sufficiently large corporations is no longer distinguished from mafia. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

The new \u201chealth czar\u201d continues to preside over the meltdown of America\u2019s most critical health agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094a development that obviously doesn\u2019t bode well for Americans or their health. Case in point: This weekend, the Food and Drug Administration was thrown into chaos after one of its top drug regulators resigned from his position. George Tidmarsh was formerly the head of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. However, a lawsuit filed Sunday by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, a Canadian pharmaceutical company, has claimed misconduct on Tidmarsh\u2019s part, alleging that he depressed its stock by criticizing one of its drugs on LinkedIn, ABC previously reported. In a LinkedIn post, Tidmarsh apparently criticized voclosporin, a drug from Aurinia designed to treat lupus nephritis, an autoimmune disease. He reportedly wrote that voclosporin had \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot been shown to provide a direct clinical benefit for patients\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the lawsuit claims these were \u201cfalse and defamatory statements\u00e2\u0080\u009d). He later deleted the post, although the lawsuit claims that Aurinia\u2019s stock plummeted 20 percent as a result of the comments, ABC writes. Additionally, the suit claims Tidmarsh had waged a revenge campaign of sorts against the company\u2019s board chairman, Kevin Tang. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the next six years, Dr. Tidmarsh repeatedly threatened that he would exact revenge against Mr. Tang,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the lawsuit says, according to ABC. The New York Times has added that the lawsuit claims Tidmarsh \u201cattempted to extort\u201d Tang, who has been described as a \u201cformer business associate\u201d of Tidmarsh. In an interview with the newspaper, Tidmarsh denied the allegations.\u00c2\u00a0 Tidmarsh was also previously criticized because, under his leadership, the FDA has moved away from the expert review of new drugs, CBS previously reported. Tidmarsh was quoted as saying that advisory committee meetings for new drugs are \u201ca tremendous amount of work for the company and for the FDA. We want to use that work and our time to focus on the big questions.\u201d At any rate, with Tidmarsh\u2019s dramatic exit, that leaves the FDA in a state of flux. In text messages shared with Axios, FDA staffers expressed dismay at the chaos roiling the agency. Those text messages, while not shared directly with readers, are described by the outlet as showing \u201cpeople disturbed by the turmoil and increasingly motivated to leave the agency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a threat heightened by how many experienced career officials have already left.\u201d Axios also talked to former FDA employees and found very much the same: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve talked to anyone who\u2019s happy there,\u201d one former staffer apparently told the outlet. Gizmodo reached out to the HHS and FDA for comment. We also sent Mr. Tidmarsh a direct message and reached out to Aurinia Pharmaceuticals. A spokesperson for the FDA told the Times that, prior to his resignation, Tidmarsh had been placed on administrative leave \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter the office of the general counsel and the office of the inspector general were notified of serious concerns about his personal conduct.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Though he hasn\u2019t been in office very long, Kennedy\u2019s reign as America\u2019s health czar has been marked by significant disruption and mayhem within the HHS. A number of agencies have seen significant turnover and layoffs. Earlier this year, the HHS fired thousands of staff and, more recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saw a number of top officials step down in protest of Kennedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies. Kennedy also fired all members of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee. Last month, in an unprecedented move, six former U.S. Surgeons General wrote an op-ed characterizing Kennedy as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofound, immediate and unprecedented threat\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Americans\u2019 health and suggesting that he step down.

I prefer GOG because you get an offline installer that you can keep forever. \"But there no native Linux client\" I've never understood this complaint. The Steam client is why I prefer GOG. I'd rather just download and installer and install to my home directory. No need for some app to hand hold me through this process. Same. I'm happy with installers that I can backup offline, random bits of bonus material like manuals, and native Linux.I do like cloud sync of save games with a client like Steam (I assume Galaxy does it too). And while Proton is nice for compatibility for companies not willing to put the effort in for native Linux support, I feel like a middle ground of a Wine-like wrapper could be made available to all game developers without having to let Steam manage everything. Maybe some day when I retire I'll take a  Steam makes it irrelevant that a game has no Linux version, you just click on install then on play and you're playing the game. That's two clicks. How do you not see the appeal of that. Other pros of using the Steam client: automatic game updates, automatic controller setup, dlc management, mod management, automatic proton parameter setup, I'm sure there's more advantages that I forget. Steam also makes it very easy to invite a friend to play with you, but there is no technical reason why this should be hard  Note: this reply is for the post above your, my bad I hate to be a broken record about this lately, but Lutris is a great interface to your GOG library. So far it's successfully installed and run everything I've tried. I'm gonna have to try this Heroic thing that seems to be more popular than it is now, but last time I looked everyone was telling me to use Lutris \u2014 when at the time I was happy with PlayOnLinux, which was then being maintained. On Linux you can very reasonably use the web for GOG (and it's easy enough to get Steam reviews there) and then install the games with Lutris. While I'm advocating for software you want for playing Windows games, you will also want ProtonUp-Qt if you don't have it already. I buy games on Steam and then do all this stuff to make them work better on Linux. But I also buy games on GOG. And I have games on Epic and EA too, and Lutris does all those too. I initially got ProtonUp-Qt specifically for use with Steam, because it is the best (easiest) way to install steamtinkerlaunch. I am an experienced user, but I don't know anything about proton etc. Using Lutris I find my game, give it my gog installer, and play.  the DB of hacks is crowdsourced for most games.Even a very old small game like Powerslide just works...I believe Lutris can connect to your GOG account and download the installers itself. As a hoarder, I don't use that feature. The thing is, either you'd love to use GOG, or you don't care enough to... This may surprise you, but there are in fact some Linux games on GOG. There may not be a ton of them, but there are options. I've bought a few and have been happy with those purchases. I was just thinking about this exact idea a few days ago. Sadly, unless they allow the community to organize an Open Source project, a Linux based client can not be done with the resources that they have. If they offered the community a chance to go at it, I am sure they would find LOTS of volunteers... me being one. \"Steam is the opposite of a monopoly; its how i want all my online experiences to be.\" Steam IS a monopoly. Specifically because it's the online experience people want. Monopoly is not a bad word. Monopolies are not illegal. Network effects create what are known as natural monopolies. There's no reason to avoid recognizing Steam as a monopoly. Steam IS a monopoly.Steam isn't a monopoly. They have a massive dominant position, but it doesn't qualify them as a monopoly under US law at this time. In short, they have to be found to be abusing their market dominance. This lawsuit could potentially change that, however. Steam IS a monopoly. Steam isn't a monopoly. They have a massive dominant position, but it doesn't qualify them as a monopoly under US law at this time. In short, they have to be found to be abusing their market dominance. This lawsuit could potentially change that, however. No. You don't have to generate abuse first to be a monopoly. That's not how it works. You have to be a monopoly first before those abuses become illegal. Monopoly is not 100%. Steam has effective monopoly, so does Windows. Sure, as a user, you have many choices. You can choose to use Linux, you can choose a different game store. However, game developers don't really have the choice. Let's say a game developer makes a PC game that does not run on Windows. It probably would not sell that great.Let's say a game developer chooses to not sell the game on Steam and use something else instead. It probably would not sell that great. That means, game developers absolutely have to make PC games for Windows and sell them on Steam.So, Windows and Steam have a monopoly. It does not necessarily have to be a bad thing, but we should recognize it as it is. If Steam were the only way to install a game onto a computer, I would agree. Unfortunately, reality will show us that there is of course other ways to install games on your computer. Especially in Windows.Your ability to install something in a different way does not come into the definition of a monopoly. You do you, it doesn't change the fact that Steam has total market dominance over PC gaming, and that's the only thing required for the monopoly definition.Monopolies themselves aren't actually a bad thing. They aren't illegal.

Exactly. I've never felt life the product. The games are the product. Steam is the opposite of a monopoly; its how i want all my online experiences to be.Whether they produce something you like or want or not is irrelevant. Monopoly comes in the form of market power, market power comes in the form of market share. Steam has a monopoly precisely because create an online experience that most people want. They have near dominance over the PC market.Whether they are good or bad doesn't come into the question of being a monopoly or not.Also monopolies are not bad or illegal. What is illegal is engaging in the action of monopolising - i.e. using your market power  Steam is the opposite of a monopoly; its how i want all my online experiences to be.

I mostly use Steam because a lot of the value ad is pretty good and my Steamdeck is fking great. In a perfect world, we wouldn't need the onerous always online requirements that come with modern PC gaming. Steam checks that box for the suits, but they build in a ton of value-added goodies on top of it. Cloud synced savegames, autoupdates, workshop, community pages... there's a ton of extras. How many exclusive are there on GOG or Epic? The reality is developers don't have a choice but to publish on Steam. That makes them a monopoly. You're just not the customer. Steam isn't an evil monopoly, instead I would argue it is a \"natural\" monopoly because they provide an excellent service without treating their customers like cash cows to constantly butcher for an additional buck, unlike some other competitors and businesses in general. The word monopoly has a stigma because it is usually used for evil. Monopolies aren't bad, or illegal. Monopolizing is illegal. Anti-trust law is based on a verb not a noun. Likewise economic theory is based on outcomes not on market position. > I would argue it is a \"natural\" monopoly It absolutely isn't. A natural monopoly is a service where building out the infrastructure multiple times doesn't make sense. Railroads, roads, highways, telecoms... Steam is a monopoly, same as  google was and is. Remember when google had \"Don't be evil\" as its motto?If you can't move your purchased games out of steam, you're potentially in trouble. Now I'm not saying Steam currently is evil, Valve are in my book \"The Good Guys\"; for now...The moment maximizing pr  Most natural monopolies are the worst kind of monopolies that require extreme regulation to manage. Examples of natural monopolies: Telephony, power grid, water supply, railroad operations. Their customers are the games companies, not the players. The players eyeballs are the primary product that they are selling to the games company, together with some packaging and installation technology that can be easily replicated. That's not to say that you're wrong in any way. So what if Steam is a monopoly? Who cares? What abuses are they contending? A 30% fee? Every major digital store charges similar fees. As an industry, you should have kept control of your distribution. But instead you all chased $ by giving 30% away. Now you've established 30% as the market rate. You've undermined any argument you may have for rapacious fees. So I say again. Steam is a monopoly. So what? The only people who care are people who understand the definitions of words, and those people care because steam is in no way a monopoly.  It's not the only place to purchase games, it's not the only place online to purchase games, and it doesn't have access to every game. It isn't the only software to integrate and auto-install a multi-publisher library or to automate downloading and installing updates. It had an effective monopoly over distribution. How many game developers don't publish to Steam? How much money do they make? How many PC gamers don't have Steam? The numbers of vanishingly small. I have tried using other game management, installation systems.  most are trash.  GoG is ok.  Epic is terrible. MSFT is a joke.  They have the market share because they actually build good products. How do they possible come to this conclusion when you can install a game completely outside of the Steam App store? You can buy games, especially on Windows, in numerous different ways. You don't need to install those games via an app store unless the developer decides to only release their game in a specific spot. Even on Linux, you have options, though I will admit Steam is super convenient for Linux gaming. No, it's not a monopoly, it's simply the best place to buy games. There's plenty of healthy competition, but Valve has won over the hearts and minds of players but being amazing at selling games. This includes fighting for consumers' rights with generous refund policies, something previously unheard of with software. It used to be that all you needed to know about software purchases was \"no refunds,\" but now you can buy a game, try it out, and if it doesn't run well on your PC or if you just don't like it,  Bingo, there's nothing illegal or fundamentally unethical about a monopoly, it's the anti-competitive and anti-consumer actions that are at issue and as far as I can tell Valve has never really engaged in that.  They don't even advertise and they don't even undercut the competition with a 30% commission.  As you said they got here by being a good storefront even in the face of their competitors really throwing everything at them (Remember Origin?). And as a developer at least have access to quite a lot of fe  Indeed. And they even do things like let you register games bought elsewhere and then install and launch them via STEAM. The main difference is that STEAM is not primarily driven by short-sighted greed and actually tries to deliver a good product first. In other news, 99% of studios and developers in 2025 lack the ability to do proper server administration and bandwidth management.Many think proper user engagement and marketing involve the words \"Join our discord\". Trust me, they are a monopoly, but they literally take care of 98% of the problems you would face upon launch day and continued distribution. Want to do a public beta test?  Easy.Want to load to 3 million users at once?  Easy.Want to be discovered for your sandcastle building game alongside other competing sandcastle building games?  Easy. The solution is simple - create a competitor. Make it competitive. Epic? They're not investing in the Epic Games Store. It was just a way to short circuit the process. You can tell their lack of investment because features to the store are slow in coming - like they're just putting in minimum effort and minimum dollars to keep it running. At least GoG is offering a value proposition over Steam and Epic - their games are literally \"you own it\". GoG can stop selling a game tomorrow, even be forced to delete it  In other news, 99% of studios and developers in 2025 lack the ability to do proper server administration and bandwidth management.Steam does nothing to solve this. They do *not* provide server administration or bandwidth management for their online resources. There are plenty of games that do public betas on Steam and user load testing on Steam only for it to collapse spectacularly.The only thing correct about your post is the last point: Steam provides discovery.

For things they predict correctly, steam works. Then Silksong gets released and everything just breaks for a few hours. So it's a monopoly, so what? I always enjoyed using Steam to find, purchase, and play my games when I did Windows gaming. I started using Steam I believe when I purchased Half Life 2 (wow, probably 20+ years ago now) and in all that time they never acted like ass-hats towards their users. Some monopolies can be good monopolies I suppose. Gaben will die eventually. What do you think is likely to happen to Steam after he is gone from leadership? And they never lost sight of their users. That is why it is still there and efforts to sabotage and replace it have failed, despite Valve actually being not very large. Which was better for the consumer? Netflix, back when they were *the* streaming platform? Or the situation today, where streaming is balkanized?   What's good for the big game studios is different from what's good for gamers. As long as Steam remains consumer-friendly, they can (and will) keep their monopoly. Also, nothing stops developers from releasing on multiple marketplaces.  So blame greed for Steam retaining its dominance. Companies wanted the cake to themselves and failed to see the bigger picture that federation would have been a better idea. Develop a common platform that handles sign on, updates, achi  Steam was introduced by making it mandatory to be able to buy and play Half-Life 2. Big red flag right there and then, which is why I decided _not_ to use Steam right then and there at the beginning of it all. Yes, HL2 was an excellent game and dominates the hall of fame of videogames for good reaons. Which is why Steam took off like a rocket. And yes, Steam offers great value and Gabe and his crew manage the service well. But if he changes his mind or valve gets sold to some greed leech investment gang thin  It was introduced as a server listing requirement for counterstrike 1.6. 1.5 was the last conterstrike to use WON. Valve bought out counterstrike team and moved the project off WON server listing to it's own. That was original steam. This switch over fucked so many users over, it's not even funny. Steam client at this stage was incredibly buggy grey menu you had to start CS 1.6 from to get it to load a server list. It served no purpose other than to make all CS players into free alpha testers. It's only lock-in for Valve games, any other developer is free to release anywhere they like, and Valve doesn't impose any exclusivity deal ala Epic (Alan Wake 2 anyone?). \"Honey, I'm effectively monogamous. 88% of my sex comes from you.\" \"Officer, I'm effectively sober. Less than 12% of my blood is alcohol.\" \"No, this is a ham sandwich. It is not a shit sandwich. It's 88 percent ham, and only 12% shit.\" Let's see if this brilliant argument works the other way: \"Officer, I'm not a rapist. 12% of times I had sex, it was voluntary.\" Holy fuck, this works for EVERYTHING! Uh no, Steam is a distribution network charging a distribution fee. It's not preventing developers from using any alternative systems in any way. Is Steam preventing gamers from using alternative marketplaces? No.Is Steam restricting developers from releasing on alternative marketplaces through exclusivity deals? No. Steam is not a monopolist, it's simply the gamer's favorite marketplace. If you are a larger developer that's not really a good deal for you.You can always go to Epic and take their money. The reality though is that people look at game distribution today in a vacuum. 30% cut of sales in exchange for instant access to everything they provide (including customers) is pennies compared to the old method of producing boxes and marketing in gaming stores to a far smaller customer base.Large developers are nothing more than little bitches, whining and wiping away their tears with $100 notes, wishing they made $200million instead of $180million on the l  If you are a larger developer that's not really a good deal for you.

Large developers are nothing more than little bitches, whining and wiping away their tears with $100 notes, wishing they made $200million instead of $180million on the l  The small game developers I've talked with have all said that Steam is by no means a replacement for a marketing budget. Random indies on steam don't get noticed, as a rule. I only use Steam (The software, as opposed to the store, which can be used through the web) because I'm forced to do so. I'd rather not. While it's possibly the least crap of the game store apps, it's still crap. It shouldn't even have a browser in it. It should be calling out to your browser. AFAICT the Steam updates still don't resume if the download is interrupted, which is weird AF to say the least. This isn't a problem on a healthy modern connection but if your connection is flaky then you can't even g  And Epics platform still sucks. It's so bad I mostly even ignore the free games they offer. The hassle of finding stuff on their platform is so much worse than on Steam. People may complain about steams cut of the profit, but at least it provides a payment platform, merchandising platform, shop in shop, patch service, addon delivery platform, and content delivery platform. Oh, and authentication and cloud storage. They're all part of the platform. Really big publishers may build that for themselves but smaller ones just can't afford that. So steam does it for them. There are many reasons to dislike a monopoly, but what is the alternative here? Steam does a great job of managing installation and syncing across devices. As a user it makes the game experience so much nicer than selling me a download of a game. I've never had issues getting games from steam to run (assuming my computer was capable), even old ones. For most games my saves exist across all my devices, and I can easily uninstall a game for space and install it again later. Steam also provides a forum for discussion with other users, guides, and game news. It's significantly more than a stor  Huh. Been using GOG since Mac OS went to MacOS X and I wanted to keep playing my Aspyr games. Only started using GOG for new games when Cyberpunk2077 came out. Didn't realize they were owned by a subsidary of CD Projekt but reading up on the history, man, that's interesting! \"There are plenty of ways play games on a Windows machine that dont require Steam.\" Perhaps. But there's pretty much no way for a game developer to succeed without launching on Steam. Launching on the Apple app store might be a good replacement. PC games is the relevant market for Steam. Apple's share of that market is a rounding error. iOS games are a different market. The Apple App Store takes a similar slice of revenue and has a much smaller addressable market -- including just about none of the high-end gamers, given that current Macs are stuck with whatever GPU is built onto the CPU.  \"Might\" is doing an awful lot of work in your comment. Steam is definitely not literally a monopoly. Most people don't seem to know either of the most important things about monopolies, which is 1) what one is and 2) that it's not necessarily relevant whether they are, because antitrust doesn't require a monopoly. It only means you're abusing a somehow dominant position in a market. With that said, I've been using Steam for a lot of years.

So they try to create appeal through artificial means like giving away games, or with exclusivity deals. They are basically throwing money to become relevant enough that they can be profitable without having to throw money. If that ever happens, you can be sure that there will be no more free games.

They are the ones forced to use Steam due to its monopoly. Anybody could vibe code an online video game store backed by s3 in about 20 minutes, where is the monopoly? Before steam existed people distributed games on floppies and CD\/DVD. Nobody is stopping you from selling your video games mail order, or on your own squarespace store or whatever. There's zero economic moat here. I routinely pay a premium to buy my games on steam because I don't trust the developer to keep track of my account or even keep their store up in 90 days. The monopoly is not that \"nobody can offer an alternative\", its that there are no real alternatives for whatever reason. Anybody could vibe code an online video game store backed by s3 in about 20 minutes, where is the monopoly?Sure, and then there would be meaningful competition to Steam? How many people would use that alternative? Epic games tried really hard to provide an alternative and failed.So, if you are a game developer, you absolutely have to sell your game on Steam.

Offering something for sale and making a sale are two things so completely Steam offers developers the option to sell their own Steam keys. In theory, that lets developers use all of Steam's infrastructure services without paying - Steam doesn't take a cut of those sales. Essentially the only condition is that they don't offer those keys on better terms than for Steam buyers. That's basically the exact opposite of abusing your market power. To the degree you can do better than Steam, with help of a third party or not, they let you keep Steam's share accordingly. None of the games I play are from Steam. How many of those games aren't on Steam? Exclude any that are paid exclusives or predated Steam. Yeah, because the customers don't want anything else.  Itch.io is great ... if you want random indie stuff.  GOG seems to have no idea what to recommend and you either get games from 1992 or hentai VNs with a porn patch so they're not technically selling the porn, with little that's actually interesting. The market is video games, not installer apps. That's not the definition of monopoly. Simply existing has nothing to do with it. Monopoly is determined by market power and dominance. Microsoft has none with the Microsoft Store, it's barely used and generates fuck all share of gaming revenue. GoG was built on being more customer friendly than Valve in terms of right to own games. Epic was built on the exact opposite, bowing to needs of developers more than Steam. How would you even go combining the two when they have polar opposite business models?

Amazon is counting on in-house AI chips to fuel its next phase of profitable growth. A recent internal document shows the cloud giant is still playing catch-up to Nvidia's dominant GPUs. AI startup Cohere found that Amazon's Trainium 1 and 2 chips were \"underperforming\" Nvidia's H100 GPUs, according to an internal \"confidential\" Amazon document from July, obtained by Business Insider. Cohere reported that access to Trainium 2 was \"extremely limited\" and plagued by frequent service disruptions, the document also noted. The \"performance challenges\" with Cohere were still under investigation by Amazon and its chip group Annapurna Labs, but progress on these issues was \"limited,\" the official document stated. Stability AI, a well-known startup that generates AI images, had similar concerns. It concluded that Amazon's Trainium 2 chips underperformed Nvidia's H100 GPUs on latency, making them \"less competitive\" in terms of speed and cost, the document also warned. Amazon's homegrown Trainium chips are an essential part of the company's effort to compete in the AI-cloud race. The success of Amazon Web Services, especially its profitability, was based on designing its own data-center chips, rather than paying Intel for these pricy components. In the new generative-AI era, Amazon is trying to avoid paying for expensive Nvidia GPUs, while still providing cloud customers with powerful AI services. If some AWS customers don't want Trainium, and insist that AWS run their AI cloud workloads using Nvidia gear, that could undermine Amazon's future cloud profits because it will be stuck paying more for GPUs. The customer complaints highlighted internally by Amazon reveal the steep challenge it faces in matching Nvidia's performance and getting profitable AI workloads running on AWS. This also underscores AWS's ongoing challenges among startup customers, a segment that has long been its core market. An Amazon spokesperson said the company is \"grateful\" for customer feedback that helps make its chips \"even better and more widely used.\" The Cohere case is \"not current,\" the spokesperson added, while noting that Trainium and its other in-house AI chip, Inferentia, \"have achieved great results\" with customers including Ricoh, Datadog, and Metagenomi. \"We're very pleased with the growth and adoption we're seeing for Trainium 2, which at this stage is primarily used by a small number of very large customers like Anthropic,\" this spokesperson wrote in an email to Business Insider. AWS claims its in-house AI chips offer 30% to 40% better price performance than the current generation of GPUs. The company has incredible chip-design talent and is working on new generations of these crucial components. \"We expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium 3, previewing later this year,\" the spokesperson said. \"We'll accomplish that as we always do by listening to our customers and remaining vocally self-critical with each other as we continue innovating to give more customers access to chips with the best possible price and performance.\" Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company's earnings call that Trainium 2 chips are \"fully subscribed\" and are now a \"multibillion-dollar\" business growing 150% quarter-over-quarter. Spokespeople for Cohere and Stability AI didn't respond to requests for comment. Other AWS customers have also complained about Amazon's AI chips. According to the July document, a startup called Typhoon found Nvidia's older A100 GPUs to be as much as three times more cost-efficient than AWS's Inferentia 2 chips for certain workloads. Similarly, a research group called AI Singapore determined that AWS's G6 servers, equipped with Nvidia GPUs, offered better cost performance than Inferentia 2 across multiple use cases. (Inferentia chips are used for running AI models, a process known as inference, while Trainium chips focus on training models). Last year, Amazon cloud clients also cited \"challenges adopting\" its custom AI chips, creating \"friction points\" and contributing to low usage, Business Insider previously reported. These struggles are reflected in market share. Nvidia dominates AI chips with more than 78% of the market. That's followed by Google and AMD, each with just over 4%, according to research firm Omdia. AWS's chips ranked sixth, with 2% of the market. A new $38 billion partnership between AWS and OpenAI illustrates Amazon's challenges here. The deal involves AI cloud servers that only contain Nvidia GPUs, with no mention of Trainium processors. The lack of Trainium in the OpenAI deal \"could be viewed as disappointing,\" Mizuho analysts wrote after the deal was announced this week. Perhaps even more damning, these analysts wrote that it was \"logical\" for OpenAI to start with Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia's chips not only deliver superior performance but also come with a widely adopted platform, CUDA, that many developers already know and use. That familiarity is especially valuable when teams are building large, high-risk AI projects, where reliability and existing expertise can make a crucial difference. In the July document, Amazon employees noted that technical limitations and other comparative issues between its custom AI chips and Nvidia's GPUs have become \"critical blockers\" for customers thinking about switching to AWS chips. Prior to last week's Amazon earnings report, Bank of America analysts were cautious about Tranium's progress. In a note published in late October, they warned that investors have been \"skeptical\" about Trainium's capabilities, and it was \"unclear\" whether strong demand will materialize \"outside of Anthropic.\" Trainium's most high-profile customer is Anthropic, the AI startup behind the powerful Claude models. AWS recently rolled out Project Rainier, a giant data center project that includes a cluster of half a million Trainium chips that will be exclusively used to train Anthropic's next-generation AI model. Anthropic is expected to deploy more than 1 million Trainium 2 chips by the end of the year. Anthropic is one of the world's leading AI labs, regularly challenging OpenAI with state of the art models. If Anthropic can make Trainium chips work, that would be a huge boost to Amazon's efforts here. But the jury is still out on this. Some investors were caught off guard last month by Anthropic's move to broaden its partnership with Google, which provides its own in-house AI chips known as TPUs. Amazon's stock slipped following this news, although Anthropic emphasized that it will continue using Trainium. Anthropic has also publicly acknowledged the complexity of using multiple chip architectures, detailing related outages in a September blog post. Amazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that Anthropic is continuing to expand its use of Trainium chips and emphasized the company's commitment to offering customers a range of hardware options across its cloud services. During an earnings call with analysts last week, Jassy underscored AWS's focus on offering \"multiple chip options.\" The goal is not to replace Nvidia, but to give customers more choice, a strategy AWS follows in other parts of cloud computing, he said. \"In the history of AWS, it's never just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market segment and then it can satisfy everybody's needs on every dimension,\" Jassy said. Amazon shares surged the next trading day, after it reported AWS revenue grew 20% to $33 billion last quarter, the fastest pace of growth since 2022. That's still slower growth than rivals such as Microsoft and Google Cloud, on a percentage basis. Have a tip?

Tech giants are spending trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure. How the heck will all this be paid for? The answer depends on whether users, and especially corporate customers, get value from AI tools and services. And, if that happens, will they pay enough to cover this spending spree and leave some left over as profit? This is the big question that looms over the entire market and economy right now. It's unnerving to wonder whether there'll be any real return on investment from this new technology. I don't have the answers. However, I recently met an executive who does. Thomas Bodenski serves as the COO of TS Imagine, which sells software that helps investment firms, banks, and brokers trade, manage portfolios, and monitor risk. He has been in the corporate AI trenches since 2023, using this nascent technology to make TS Imagine more efficient, fast-moving, and ultimately more profitable. Bodenski's conclusion so far: The AI spending spree is well worth it, and the ROI he's seen proves it. \"It's super beneficial,\" he told me in an interview this week. \"There's no way I can go back now. It's been too successful.\" This is backed up by a recent Wharton study, which found that 74% of enterprises are already generating positive ROI from AI projects. \"This is a pretty big deal, achieving positive ROI is happening faster than I would have expected,\" wrote Ethan Mollick, an associate professor of management at Wharton who studies the effects of AI on work, entrepreneurship, and education. TS Imagine's experience, using data-wrangling AI technology such as Snowflake Intelligence, shows how persistent effort can yield real ROI. Bodenski's main evidence is TAIA, an AI agent that handles various aspects of customer service and data analysis for TS Imagine. He shared three specific TAIA examples that he says have eliminated the equivalent of 8.5 full-time employees. TS Imagine employs about 34 data analysts in its data and global client service departments, so that's significant \"person power\" gain, Bodenski said. Customer service is already a major area of impact for generative AI in the workplace, and it's one of the first places where TS Imagine realized benefits. The firm is constantly bombarded with questions, requests, and rants from demanding, fast-paced clients, including hedge funds, bankers, and traders. It traditionally hired employees to read, classify, and assign these customer-service tickets manually\u2014a stressful task. Now, TAIA does this automatically, selecting which human professionals are available and best suited to handle each customer request, while adding relevant material to help resolve the issues. This new AI process takes about one minute per ticket, while the old, manual approach took about 10 minutes. This eliminated the equivalent of three full-time employees, in terms of the time, effort, and other resources required, Bodenski said. TS Imagine receives a deluge of emails from numerous vendors who supply and update financial data on a regular basis. It gets roughly 100,000 of these messages every year. Some are incredibly important, while others are irrelevant. The firm previously tapped financially savvy staff in Hong Kong, London, New York, and Montreal to review every email and either discard it or assign it to the relevant colleagues. Now, TAIA reads all these emails and automatically classifies and assigns them. TS Imagine gets the same, or better, results from this new AI process at 3% of the cost of the previous manual approach, Bodenski said. Part of those savings comes from the elimination of 2.5 full-time employees, in terms of time and effort, he added. TS Imagine helps investors and traders track and understand corporate actions, including stock splits, dividends, and mergers and acquisitions. The firm often gets updates on corporate actions from exchanges that send the information via PDFs. TS Imagine employees traditionally reviewed this unstructured data and integrated it carefully with customer portfolios. This stressful and detailed work must get done before trading opens the following day. If an employee gets the math wrong on a stock split, a hedge fund's investment could swing wildly and inaccurately. Now, TAIA automatically converts these PDFs into structured data that can be used to update client portfolios and positions more quickly and more accurately, Bodenski said. \"The manual errors have gone,\" he added. This AI automation has saved the equivalent of three full-time employees. TS Imagine still has three other human employees working on this task because it's so important and complex, although Bodenski is pursuing more AI automation here. Through these three specific AI deployments, TS Imagine saved the equivalent of 8.5 full-time employees in terms of effort, time, and other resources required. Rather than cutting staff, TS Imagine has reassigned employees to more valuable tasks, such as data quality, testing, and client and vendor relationships, Bodenski said. The firm invested thousands of hours in developing this AI technology. So, was it worth it, in terms of ROI? \"100%,\" Bodenski told me. \"These large language models are truly revolutionary. They're not solving things on their own \u2014 you have to implement and operationalize the technology properly and make it work for you. But I would not go back.

Snapchat users will soon be able to use the app as an AI search tool. On Wednesday, the social media platform announced a deal to integrate Perplexity AI into Snap's search engine. Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million in cash and equity over a year. \"Perplexity's AI-powered answer engine will let Snapchatters ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat,\" Snap said in the Wednesday press release. The companies plan to roll out the Perplexity search engine in early 2026, per the release. A Perplexity spokesperson told Business Insider that user data from Snapchat would not be used for training its AI. \"Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun \u2014 woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations,\" Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in the release. On Wednesday, Snap reported third-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Its monthly active users increased 7% year-over-year to 943 million. Snap's stock price surged more than 17% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year. The Perplexity-Snapchat tieup follows the lead of other social media platforms, such as Meta and X, that have integrated AI chatbots into their app interfaces. In April 2024, Meta introduced the Meta AI chatbot on its applications, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The chatbot received mixed reviews from users, some of whom complained about it being activated unnecessarily and hindering the app experience. In December, Elon Musk's X launched the Grok chatbot on its app for all free users, which he called a \"politically incorrect\" alternative to other chatbots. The Perplexity deal comes as Snap is seeing a change in how its users interact. Spiegel said on Wednesday's earnings call that there has been an \"engagement shift from things like friend stories to content posted on Spotlight.\" Spotlight is Snapchat's public discover page, where users can view short, entertaining videos, similar to TikTok's \"For You Page,\" or Instagram's Reels. The company plans to introduce features like games and conversation starters to reignite connections between users.   Jump to","label":0}

Tesla's board will continue to explore potential investments in xAI. At Thursday's shareholder meeting, where investors ratified a $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, more shareholders voted to support an investment in xAI than those opposed, but a large number abstained. \"Since this is an advisory vote, the board will examine the next steps in light of this level of shareholder support,\" said Brandon Ehrhart, General Counsel of Tesla, while announcing voting results. Musk previously said on X that if it were his decision alone, Tesla \"would have invested in xAI long ago.\" If an investment is to go through, the exact sum would ultimately be determined by the board. Founded in July 2023, xAI has quickly become one of Musk's most valuable companies, developing the Grok chatbot integrated into X and raising more than $12 billion to reach a $50 billion valuation in 2024. It wouldn't be the first time that one of Musk's many companies invests in another. In March, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal valuing the two companies at $80 billion and $33 billion, respectively. Earlier in the year, SpaceX also said it would invest $2 billion into xAI. The growing web of Musk-led ventures, including Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and xAI, has been dubbed \"The Muskonomy.\" Some shareholders see this interconnectedness as a strength. \"Tesla has always been an AI company revolutionizing transportation, energy, and robotics through FSD and Optimus,\" Stephen Hawk, the Tesla investor who submitted the xAI investment proposal, told the audience. \"Let's not outsource our destiny, but rather own it and maintain power, control, and safety.\" Musk's investments on behalf of Tesla have drawn scrutiny before for potential conflicts of interest. In 2016, Tesla bought SolarCity for $2.6 billion in stock. That resulted in a lawsuit from shareholders alleging misuse of funds, because the company was founded by Musk's cousin, and it was in a debt crisis in 2015. Musk was also both SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder at that time. Though a judge eventually ruled in Musk's favor, SolarCity had a rocky integration into Tesla Energy, and the company didn't manage to turn a profit till 2021.     Jump to","label":0}

The reality is there are people for whom race is the central issue.

Obama tried to introduce universal health care but the Republicans made him change a lot of it. And it originated from the (R) side. It's actually more properly known as RomneyCare as that was a fundamental pillar of his platform. Obama just adopted it thinking the (R) side would support one of their own proposals. The reason for the \"huge revenue stream to the health insurance industry\" was because they were mounting opposition to any reform. Obama felt it was the only way to get some reform. And maybe it was, but it had the effect of promulgating a stupid system where the poor still have a difficult time affording health care. And it gave the opposition that dumb talking point of \"let the market figure it out\". The market was what got the U.S. into the health care expense crisis. The reason for the \"huge revenue stream to the health insurance industry\" was because they were mounting opposition to any reform. I think its important to look at who influenced that debate. It was not a bunch of family doctors, small town hospitals or insurance agents. It was medical equipment manufacturers, large hospital networks, drug companies and insurance companies with close ties to the same ruling elite that helped elect Obama as one of their own.

After salaries, the biggest cost to any employer is paying for health insurance. This is problem unique to only the USA.  I haven't seen any emphasis on this factor but look at the correlation between per capita GDP and per capita healthcare costs:   https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/gra... [ourworldindata.org]   That is a strong correlation! Taxes. The word you're looking for is taxes. Consequences. The word you're looking for is consequences. Honestly, the problem was Co. v. Riggs (203 U.S. 243 (1906)) that established corporations be treated legally like people. The moment this happened it was the beginning of the exoneration of c-suites from the consequences of their actions.

I believe I see a possible path to repetition. A lot of the things he mentioned were totally irrelevant to the manufacturing boom. Here are the things that actually mattered: 1) Post WW 2, total lack of international competition.  When most of the industrialized countries were bombed to crap, there was a period of 5 -ten  years when they had to buy American to fix their factories, and then they had 5-10 years when they were focused on rebuilding the rest of their country. 2) Baby Boom.  20 years after the war ended, there was a short period of time (10-15  The MBA program's goals in the 60s werre maximizing profit and lowering costs.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matthew Hassett, founder and CEO of Loftie. The company makes its products, including a digital clock and lamp designed to promote sound sleep, in China. As a result of Trump's tariffs, selling inside the US has become more expensive for Loftie. To boost its business, the company is shifting its focus to an international market. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity. Until mid-August, I was very stressed. It then became clear that our plan to pivot from the US to more international sales was working really well. We're now almost 50% international sales through our website over about three months \u2014 up from about 3%. It really is as simple as Econ 101. You can either adjust supply or demand. Supply is constrained by unpredictable government policy in the US, and it's still not settled at the peak season, with the holidays coming up. For now, it doesn't make sense to move our manufacturing, especially knowing that we have the best price and quality, which is a rare combination, because we produce in China. We did a pilot run in Thailand. But it costs 20% more because they've got to move a lot of the components from other parts of Asia to Thailand. The labor costs are also higher. Why would you move from China? Rather than try to worry about irrational US policy, we just focused on selling the product that people want worldwide, worldwide. We're really lucky to have a product that works in other places. I've decided to treat the US like hot lava \u2014 something that you don't want to touch unless you really have to. I'd always put off selling abroad because I'd heard in a business school class to start with the US market, because it's the biggest, and \"Don't waste your time trying to extend your operations.\" I think that's outdated advice with a lot of the technology and logistics available in 2025. I wish we'd done it sooner; it's just so much more stable. The marketing costs are also lower, so it allows us to offer the same policies that we have in the US \u2014 free shipping and a one-year warranty. It's also been such a relief, and it allows me to have time for actually thinking about productive, exciting new chapters for the company and not just survival. This international sales strategy is what has allowed me to keep our team. We only have US-based employees. We have consultants in other places, but just a handful. I think we have a lot more room to grow, because we have mostly been doing English-language ads. The UK and Canada have been the most successful, accordingly. But we're working on creating native ads in many languages. It's been a really good gamble, and it's just provided a lot of relief and stability. It took about two months to see that this plan was working. We still had the US sales. But the summer was terrible just because, at one point, in the US, we had tariffs of 175% to 180% on our products. So we couldn't move any new goods. Luckily, we had some inventory left in the US that we had paid the duties on before the tariffs escalated. That provided some buffer time to try out this expansion. I hope that international sales can mean a doubling of our revenue globally, and that eventually there is stability in the US, and we can sell more here again \u2014 but I have no idea. I'm just taking it day by day, because that's how volatile it is. All summer, I was writing about this, and how it's existential to our company. That was really bad for my mental health. Ultimately, there was nothing I could do to control it. The thing that's a huge relief to me is that we haven't had to lay anyone off, especially when you see all the layoffs with AI at companies. We have no plans to lay off anyone, whether it's for tariffs or AI. We're very small, but to me, the biggest accomplishment is that I was able to keep everyone through this tremendous uncertainty. I'm very proud of myself as a CEO for getting us through the most rocky time in our seven-year history.

Looking for something listen to during your commute? Then we've got the podcast for you! I sat down with 9to5Google's Will Sattelberg this past week to discuss the launch of Android XR, the Galaxy XR, and everything those products mean for the future of XR on the November 3, 2025 edition of The Sideload podcast. When Will asked me to be a guest on the show, I knew there was no way I could turn it down. We've been covering the Samsung Galaxy XR in depth at Android Central since before the launch, getting our hands on the elusive headset three times before it went to retail. I also write a weekly XR-centric column called AC thVRsday that goes live on, you guessed it, Thursdays. If you're not familiar with the term XR, it stands for eXtended Reality and covers the gamut of AR and VR devices. That's everything from smart glasses like Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses to full-fledged, premium VR headsets like Samsung's newly launched Galaxy XR. If you're looking for something specific, Will was kind enough to list out the timestamps for all the major topics: Google's Android XR is a brand new version of Android built specifically for XR devices, and while the Galaxy XR mixed reality headset is the first Android XR device to market, we're expecting a treasure trove of smart glasses to use the operating system next year. That includes companies like Samsung and Xreal, who are expected to debut a wide range of products including display-less AI glasses and even full-fledged AR glasses. What are your thoughts on XR, as a whole? Are you excited about smart glasses, can't wait to get a top-notch VR headset, or have another opinion? Let us know! We'd love to hear it.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"When we talk about HDTV, we\u2019re typically talking about any one of a number of standards from when television made the paradigm switch from analog to digital transmission. At the dawn of the new millenium, high-definition TV was a step-change for the medium, perhaps the biggest leap forward since color transmissions began in the middle of the 20th century. However, a higher-resolution television format did indeed exist well before the TV world went digital. Over in Japan, television engineers had developed an analog HD format that promised quality far beyond regular old NTSC and PAL transmissions. All this, decades before flat screens and digital TV were ever seen in consumer households!  Japan\u2019s efforts to develop a better standard of analog television were pursued by the Science and Technical Research Laboratories of NHK, the national public broadcaster. Starting in the 1970s, research and development focused on how to deliver a higher-quality television signal, as well as how to best capture, store, and display it. This work led to the development of a standard known as Hi-Vision, which aimed to greatly improve the resolution and quality of broadcast television.\u00a0 At 1125 lines, it offered over double the vertical resolution of the prevailing 60 Hz NTSC standard in Japan. The precise number was chosen for meeting minimum requirements for image quality for a viewer with good vision, while being a convenient integer ratio to NTSC\u2019s 525 lines (15:7), and PAL\u2019s 625 lines (9:5). Hi-Vision also introduced a shift to the 16:9 aspect ratio from the more traditional 4:3 used in conventional analog television. The new standard also brought with it improved audio, with four independent channels\u2014left, center, right, and rear\u2014in what was termed \u201c3-1 mode.\u201d This was not unlike the layout used by Dolby Surround systems of the mid-1980s, though the NHK spec suggests using multiple speakers behind the viewers to deliver the single rear sound channel. Hi-Vision referred most specifically to the video standard itself; the broadcast standard was called MUSE\u2014standing for Multiple sub-Nyquist Sampling Encoding. This was a method for dealing with the high bandwidth requirements of higher-quality television. Where an NTSC TV broadcast might only need 4.2 MHz of bandwidth, the Hi-Vision standard needed 20-25 MHz of bandwidth. That wasn\u2019t practical to fit in alongside terrestrial broadcasts of the time, and even for satellite delivery, it was considered too great. Thus, MUSE offered a way to compress the high-resolution signal down into a more manageable 8.1 MHz, with a combination of dot interlacing and advanced multiplexing techniques. The method used meant that ultimately four frames were needed to make up a full image. Special motion-sensitive encoding techniques were also used to limit the blurring impact of camera pans due to the use of the dot interlaced method. Meanwhile, the four-channel digital audio stream was squeezed into the vertical blanking period. MUSE broadcasts began on an experimental basis in 1989. NHK would eventually begin using the standard regularly on its BShi satellite service, with a handful of other Japanese broadcasters eventually following suit.\u00a0 Broadcasts ran until 2007, when NHK finally shut down the service with digital TV by then well established. \u00a0  An NHK station sign-on animation used from 1991 to 1994. The technology wasn\u2019t just limited to higher-quality broadcasts, either. Recorded media capable of delivering higher-resolution content also permeated the Japanese market. W-VHS (Wide-VHS) hit the market in 1993 as a video cassette standard capable of recording Hi-Vision\/MUSE broadcast material. The W moniker was initially chosen for its shorthand meaning in Japanese of \u201cdouble\u201d\u2014since Hi-Vision used 1125 lines which was just over double the 525 lines in an NTSC broadcast. Later, in 1994, Panasonic released its Hi-Vision LaserDisc player, with Pioneer and Sony eventually offering similar products. They similarly offered 1,125 lines (1,035 visible) of resolution in a native 16:9 aspect ratio. The discs were read using a narrower-wavelength laser than standard laser discs, which also offered improved read performance and reliability.  Sample video from a MUSE Hi-Vision Laserdisc. Note the extreme level of detail visible in the makeup palettes and skin, and the motion trails in some of the lens flares. The hope was that Hi-Vision would become an international standard for HDTV, supplanting the ugly mix of NTSC, PAL, and SECAM formats around the world. Unfortunately, that never came to pass. While Hi-Vision and MUSE did offer a better quality image, there simply wasn\u2019t much content that was actually broadcast in the standard. Only a few channels in Japan were available, creating a limited incentive for households to upgrade their existing sets. Similarly, the amount of recorded media available was also limited. The bandwidth requirements were also too great; even with MUSE squishing the signals down, the 8.1MHz required was still considered too much for practical use in the US market. Meanwhile, being based on a 60 Hz standard meant the European industry was not interested. Further worsening the situation was that by 1996, DVD technology had been released, offering better quality and all the associated benefits of a digital medium. Digital television technology was not far behind, and buildouts began in countries around the world by the late 1990s. These transmissions offered higher quality and the ability to deliver more channels with the same bandwidth, and would ultimately take over.  Only a handful of Hi-Vision displays still exist in the world. Hi-Vision and MUSE offered a huge step up in image quality, but their technical limitations and broadcast difficulties meant that they would never compete with the new digital technologies that were coming down the line. There was simply not enough time for the technology to find a foothold in the market before something better came along. Still, it\u2019s quite something to look back on the content and hardware from the late 1980s and early 1990s that was able, in many ways, to measure up in quality to the digital flat screen TVs that wouldn\u2019t arrive for another 15 years or so. Quite a technical feat indeed, even if it didn\u2019t win the day! Pedantic side note: the name of the NHK channel mentioned in the article, is indeed stylized \u201cBShi\u201d. If you guessed that it\u2019s supposed to be pronounced like \u201cBS high\u201d (\u30d3\u30fc\u30a8\u30b9\u30cf\u30a4), since it broadcast in Hi-Vision, you catch on more quickly than I do. I spent an embarrassingly long time trying to figure out why satellite channel 3 would have been called \u201cB-Shi\u201d, which sounds like \u201cB-four\u201d (and especially the pronunciation of \u201cfour\u201d that\u2019s avoided because it sounds like the word for \u201cdeath\u201d). Apparently I\u2019ve spent too much time looking at programming variables lately and just expect everything capitalized to be in camel or Pascal case. Hah I saw \u2018bshi\u201d and thought \u201cbishi\u201d as in \u7f8e\u5c11+\u5973\/\u5e74 \u2026 Too much sailor moon, clearly. At 5 times the bandwidth, it\u2019s no wonder why it wasn\u2019t widely adopted. Well, that also depends on the country-region. Sure, it would effect transmission power requirement, but in many countries there were few available channels, and most of the radio spectrum were unused. If I remember correctly, PAL used 6-8MHz total bandwidth, with 5-6MHz for the video, so a slightly tweaked system would basically cut the available channels by 3, and for quite a lot of countries that wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue, although simultaneous transmission of basic signal along with HD will increase usage to 4 channel bandwidths. The main target group to get something new and expensive like this actually used and invested in, would be government broadcast in countries with few channels. And it would have to work along side the old system for at least a decade if not more. I\u2019m too young to remember, how much of the TV broadcast spectrum actually got used? I\u2019ve seen old TVs with dials showing 60 or 70 channels but I\u2019ve never been able to get more than a dozen channels with an antenna. Sub-Nyquist sampling was used by Sony in the late 1970s for their early experiments with digital recording of TV signals.  It exploited the property of TV luminance (brightness) signals that their spectrum was crowded around harmonics of the line scan frequency. In NTSC video the color information is designed to into the gaps between these harmonics but in PAL this information was offset either side of these frequencies due to PAL\u2019s alternation of the color burst phase. This, coupled with the relatively low bandwidth of chrominance (color) information opened an opportunity to \u2018fold\u2019 the digitized spectrum without losing or corrupting information by sampling it at less than the Nyquist frequency. Its a clever trick but by 1979 it was redundant because Sony built a \u2018component\u2019 digital recorder, directly digitizing the video luminance and chrominance signals. This not only worked a lot better than the digitized composite signal but opened the door to processing video completely digitally, something we take for granted today. (It was just a research novelty back then because there just wasn\u2019t the parts, the prototype used a large box of descrete logic, some of which were being worked at their operational limits. The on-tape recording streams, for example, were four parallel 50Mbit\/sec streams; these were serialized from memory a line at a time but the DRAM that was available at the time had a 350uSec \u2014 yes, microsecond \u2014 cycle time!) And the EBU developed HD-MAC which was a slightly higher resolution analogue system as a response to the proposals that the Japanese standard be adopted as a world standard. I saw it demonstrated at an IEEE talk about FLOF Teletext, really quite impressive but doomed. \u201cbeing based on a 60 Hz standard meant the European industry was not interested\u201d I\u2019m curious about this. Surely, by the 1990s, new TV and video equipment didn\u2019t depend on the mains clock for timing?  Is there some other reason TVs in Europe couldn\u2019t have worked with video fields at 60Hz?  Bearing in mind, we\u2019d already be talking about new hardware in every part of the system. Given the timing, with a digital transition being inevitable by then, I can see why this was DOA regardless. As amazing as those demos would have looked in 1989, we ended up with the same result plus more channels by waiting a decade, so it would\u2019ve been a terrible investment. New hardware sure, but realistically, a change would be gradual over a decade or more where the new and old had to work side by side, and some would keep their old systems after closing down of transmission done too soon, and new sets would have to be able to use old standard from legacy VCRs and computors and such. So a converter box would have to downsample the new to the old signal for those. And a TV receiver and screen that could work with both the new and old is probably far easier and cheaper if that new is closer compared to the old, and there might be interference patterns with 50 Hz main and 60 Hz equipment. Shielding and such work, but cost money. Unless you\u2019re a dictator, change in a country or a region have to be smooth and over a long time to actually be adopted, and for a lot of applications, a completely new system is such a hurdle that competing technology might push that new tech aside if people have to buy new shit and change how they use it, like if cable is worth the hassle to get when you only used to get broadcasts. Or the internet suddenly comes along. Here in Europe the TV manufacturers tried to push analog HD TV, but it never got beyond plans because regulators pushed back against analog HD TV and a standard was never adopted. I think this was in the \u201990-ies. By then it already was pretty clear that it would not take too long before digital would be the future, and implementing analog HD TV for a period of 5 to 10 years would lead to an enormous transfer of money from consumers to equipment manufacturers. Good for the manufacturers, but not so good for the consumers who would quickly see their expensive equipment go obsolete. In those days most people also still remembered the VHS versus betamax war. It\u2019s also quite amazing how short lived some of the technologies were.  DVD\u2019s were introduced in 1997, and took a few years before getting some reasonable adoption by the market, and the peak of DVD sales was  in 2005. And 10 years later is was back to a small niche market. Yeah, people scared of format wars\u2026 Why having 3 Analogue TV standards (PAL,SECAM and NTSC)\u2026 When we can have FOUR Digital ones (DVB, ATSC. ISDB and DMBT), let alone the substandards for satellite\/cable\/terrestrial, let alone the mobille variants like DVB-H, and so on\u2026 Aside the NTSC v.s. everything else, which was somewhat a special case where the former was definitely older and worse, anything else is matter of protectionism\/nationalism and geopolitics rather than meaningful technical superiority. Even the (very useful) SCART connector was introduced in France, before home computers consoles and VCR were a thing, with the only scope of protecting the French industry. (In that case it was a futile attempt given in matter of few years it become indispensable and everyone started to build devices that had it, no matter the nation involved). P.S. back to MUSE almost no one seem to remember that it\u2019s aspect ratio was 5\/3 (15\/9 in gen Z| jargon), not sure when it was moved to 16\/9, which was chosen in Europe for the HD-MAC standard (which was killed in the cradle by the upcoming digital TV) Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with He Jiabin, 35, the CEO of Ropeta, a Beijing-based robotics startup. His words have been translated and edited for length and clarity. When it comes to decisions, I follow my instincts. I grew up in Zhuzhou, Hunan, in central China. At 17, I left home to study product design at Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, where I started researching wearable hardware. In my third year, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia, where I helped scientists turn lab prototypes into products that people could actually use.One project explored whether a watch screen could be touch-sensitive \u2014 before the Apple Watch even existed. That inspired my graduation project: a line of smart backpacks. One tracked location for parents, another recorded video for cyclists, and a third powered a phone for seven days. The project earned national TV coverage. One of my professors encouraged me to pursue academia, saying China needed more people developing a homegrown design discipline, rather than continuing to follow practices imported from foreign institutions. But I was curious about how large companies scale and how their management methods drive tens of thousands of people to innovate. I wanted to approach things from a market perspective. After graduation, I joined Baidu's learning lab as an interface designer, working on smart bicycles, self-driving cars, and smart glasses before moving to its research institute. While autonomous driving succeeded, other promising projects weren't pursued. I wanted to create products people could actually use. So I joined the founding team of Ling Technology, which built Luka \u2014 an owl-shaped robot that reads to kids. We sold 4 to 5 million units. I was promoted to partner, overseeing product, design, production, and marketing. I stayed for five years, until intense competition drove down prices, and China's \"Double Reduction\" policy \u2014 which curbed after-school tutoring \u2014 cut investor interest in education tech. We couldn't raise more funds, so I left. In 2021, I joined Bytedance, as the leader of its industrial design department. I believed that among all the major tech companies, Bytedance was the most profitable, most aggressively innovative, and the one with the greatest potential for growth. I worked on the leading brand of VR headsets in China. At our peak, the team had more than 2,000 people. But with such a big team, I didn't always feel involved or impactful. At the same time, investors were looking for potential entrepreneurs. Having spent a decade in human-computer interaction, I saw how \"weak AI\" products often disappointed users \u2014 and how the new AI wave could change that. At a big company, the business is often quite vertical, leaving little freedom to explore. I'm now the cofounder and CEO of Ropet, where I lead business management and product direction. I felt that making companion robots was a great direction. They require emotional subtleties in product development, not just a tech-oriented approach. The company was founded in 2022 by Zhou Yushu, and I joined a year and a half later. We secured $3 million in our first funding round, 10 million yuan in the second, and most recently, in August, we raised 30 million yuan, or about $4.2 million. I've realized I'm not suited for big companies. I prefer working in a small team that innovates quickly. In a startup, I get direct market feedback. My goal is to sell 20,000 units by the end of the year. We want to become the leading brand for cute pet robots globally. Microsoft taught me how foreign companies operate. At Baidu, programmers led innovation, more than designers. Bytedance paid well but set tough goals, so people were very competitive. At a big company, I could clock out at the end of the day. Now, there's no room to hide. No one else is there to solve problems. I think about the product and company issues 24\/7. When I'm creating value, I don't see it as \"work.\" Do you have a story about starting a company in China that you want to share? Get in touch with the editor: akarplus@businessinsider.com.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"The header image above shows a completely unsupported 3D-printed bridge, believe it or not. You\u2019re looking at the bottom of the print. [Make Wonderful Things] wondered whether unsightly unsupported bridges could be improved, and has been busy nailing down remarkably high-quality results by exhaustive testing of different settings. It all started when they thought that unsupported bridges looked a lot as though they were made from ropes stretched between two points. Unlike normal layers, these stretched extrusions didn\u2019t adhere to their neighbors. They are too far apart from one another, and there\u2019s no \u201csquish\u201d to them. But could this be overcome? His experiments centered mainly around bridge printing speed, temperature, and bridge flow. That last setting affects how much the extrusion from the hot end is adjusted when printing a bridge. He accidentally increased it past 1.0 and thought the results were interesting enough to follow up on; it seemed that a higher flow rate when printing a bridge gave the nudge that was needed to get better inter-line adhesion. What followed was a lot of testing, finally settling on something that provided markedly better results than the stock slicer settings. Markedly better on his test pieces, anyway. The best results seem to come from tweaking the Bridge Flow rate high enough that extrusions attach to their neighbors, printing slowly (he used 10 mm\/sec), and ensuring the bridged area is as consistent as possible. There are still open questions, like some residual sagging at corners he hasn\u2019t been able to eliminate, but the results otherwise look great. And it doesn\u2019t even require laying one\u2019s printer on its side! All the latest is on the project page where you can download his test models, so if you\u2019re of a mind to give it a try be sure to check it out and share your results.

Tried the BF = 1.5 BS = 10 on my bambu lab a1 and it worked like a charm immediately. What does BS=10 mean? I\u2019ll absolutely try this! Especially on my Bamboo P1S PLA bridges have been a pain with ripping lines and sagging left and right! This is truly thrilling!  Once Cura integrates this, along with the concentric overhangs trick, my whole existence will be completely transformed. I\u2019d never thought about bridges before, but now I\u2019m wondering if a slight side-to-side wobble would encourage the strings to stick to their neighbors (or variations on that theme). Loke have it do the fuzzy skin jitter while bridging. My guess you would get better side to side adhesion but mess up the smoothness that the original tester was able to achieve. Would be neat to test it but I don\u2019t know how you would be able to combo the commands It\u2019s in the experimental settings of Cura 5.10.1 Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Hundreds of versions of Duolingo's owl went trick-or-treating this year, and company leadership noticed. On an earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Luis von Ahn highlighted the stream of funny and unhinged Duolingo-themed costumes people wore for Halloween this year. \"In terms of kind of being culturally relevant, et cetera, we really are seeing a complete pickup on that,\" he said. \"Throughout the world, certainly, there were thousands of Halloween costumes that were just Duolingo costumes.\" Von Ahn made the comment in response to an analyst's question about whether the language learning app is focusing more on product or marketing. \"If we have a product that is extremely retentive that also teaches really well, that's the best thing you can do, and that's where we spend most of our efforts,\" he said. \"Yes, the cultural relevance matters. But to me, that's just an accelerant to something that is where the main dish is the product.\" Duolingo is famous for its creative and guilt-inducing app notifications and social media posts. Marketing experts say the approach works, especially with Gen Z, because the app's green owl mascot appears authentic and consistent. Whether it's on TV, in YouTube ads, or on TikTok, where Duolingo has over 16.8 million followers, the company is among the first to tap into viral, often country-specific trends. In the days leading up to Halloween, people shared their Duolingo-inspired costumes on TikTok, Instagram, and X. Many dressed up as the green owl mascot, while others recreated other animated characters on the app, such as Lily, a sassy, purple-haired teenager. One costume, shared via a TikTok video, went particularly viral. The video, which has garnered 10.1 million views, featured a shirtless, muscular man in green shorts, green body paint, and a Duolingo owl mask dancing with his skeleton-costumed friend. The costume racked up thirsty comments from users. One person wrote: \"If this were my Duolingo reminder, I'd suddenly be the most punctual student alive.\" Another TikTok user said: \"I forgot to do my Spanish, come kidnap me.\" The company got in on the joke, too. \"Yeah I've been working out,\" Duolingo wrote in a comment on the TikTok video. Despite revenue and active user growth this quarter, Duolingo's shares fell as much as 20% after hours on Wednesday because the fourth quarter estimate missed analyst expectations. The company's stock is down over 19% this year.    Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"This high-performance Garmin smartwatch is rightfully dubbed \"Epix\".  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Time for your next premium smartwatch deal? If you're looking to save on an otherwise-pricey fitness smartwatch, Walmart has chopped $380 off for the Garmin Epix Pro, which normally retails at $1,000. At just $619, this second-gen version of the advanced training smartwatch looks pretty appealing, especially for those fitness enthusiasts who need hyper-accurate GNSS tracking, sports modes, and a wide range of health monitoring sensors. The Epix Pro features a durable build and a steel bezel, a 1.4-inch always-on AMOLED display, and about as much advanced training data as one could expect in a $1,000 smartwatch. From HRV status and Pulse Ox to morning reports, sleep tracking, and training readiness ratings, this watch includes tons of options for high-performance fitness and health monitoring purposes. Plus, it comes with a built-in LED flashlight, topographical map information, and sports and activity profiles for a wide range of sports such as soccer, baseball, football, volleyball and more. To be sure, it stands up to many of the best GPS smartwatches and fitness trackers on the market, and while the price point is normally a deterrent, it starts to seem highly competitive at just $619. Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2): $999.99 $619.99 at Walmart \u2705Recommended if: you're looking for an advanced Garmin smartwatch that can be used for high-performance training and a variety of sports profiles; you need a smartwatch with health, sleep, and exercise monitoring options; you need something with GNSS satellite tracking for optimal accuracy and coverage, along with topographical maps for route planning. \u274cSkip this deal if: you're looking for a smartwatch or fitness band that also includes solar charging capabilities; the price point is still higher than you'd prefer, even with the extra deal savings; you prefer a less bulky smartwatch or a thin-bezeled fitness watch style. The second-gen Garmin Epix Pro is a solid premium-level smartwatch that's suitable for just about everything from high-performance sports and fitness training, to basic health and sleep monitoring features. Garmin says the watch will get up to 31 days of battery life in smartwatch mode, while the strobe mode and built-in flashlight make it more suitable than some for training at night. Beyond that, the watch also includes a new set of hill score features, pre-loaded topographical maps for planning out your training and routes, and a wide range of sports modes, training data, endurance and morning readiness scores, and much more. At this discounted price point, the Epix Pro punches well above its weight, making it well worth checking out while it's dropped beneath the normal sticker price.

BillionToOne has become a newly minted public company, raising $273.1m in an upsized initial public offering (IPO), despite the longest government shutdown in US history hampering those wishing to join the stock exchange. The US-based company sold around 4.5 million shares of its common stock at $60 each. The molecular test developer initially offered around 3.8 million shares that were expected to fall between $49 and $55 each.

The molecular diagnosis company\u2019s shares are set to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market from 6 November under the ticker symbol \u2018BLLN\u2019. The IPO marks a culmination of a successful past few years for BillionToOne. At the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco in January 2025, \u00a0the company announced that it had achieved 2024 revenues of $153m, more than doubling its $72m profits in 2023. The 2024 performance was primarily driven by BillionToOne\u2019s prenatal testing business segment that has captured market share of 15% in the US, according to the company. Its lead product in the segment is UNITY Fetal Risk Screen, a non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) to assess a foetus\u2019s risk of certain inherited conditions. Using cell-free foetal DNA from a mother\u2019s blood sample, UNITY screens for conditions, including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The conclusion of BillionToOne\u2019s IPO makes it one of the biggest in the medtech space for 2025. The medtech IPO season kicked off with a $204m raise for artificial pancreas manufacturer Beta Bionics in January, and a $202m raise for wearable defibrillator developer Kestra Medical Technologies in March.

HeartFlow\u2019s $364m IPO, which saw the AI-based coronary artery disease (CAD) platform developer debut with a $2.2bn valuation on the Nasdaq on 8 August, has proven to be the biggest medtech IPO in the second half of 2025. While this year has not been flush with medtech IPOs, a recent report by EY suggests there continues to be an ongoing appetite for medtechs to go public, with more IPOs expected in 2026. Commenting on the report\u2019s findings during a webinar, EY\u2019s global medtech lead John Babitt said: \u201cWe would also expect to see a lot of dual process, where companies move through and evaluate going public, but also run a mini process from an M&A price check standpoint.\u201d Gain the recognition you deserve!

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"In August, Google announced a Gemini-powered tool that can help you make sense of the financial world, the new Google Finance \"reimagined with AI at its core.\" On Thursday, Google unveiled new features coming to Google Finance, including an AI capability some users will love: Support for Deep Search reports. If the feature sounds familiar, it's because the Gemini app already offers Deep Research support for topics users want more detailed reports based on thorough web searches. A similar feature is also available in Google Search's AI Mode, called\u00a0Deep Search. Deep Search will work similarly in Google Finance, but it will focus on the world of finance and the financial markets. Deep Search in Google Finance will let users ask complex questions and have Gemini provide the detailed analysis they want about a specific company, market, and events that might impact their financial decisions. Google explained in a blog post that Gemini models will \"get to work\" on the prompt by performing up to hundreds of simultaneous searches and \"reasoning across disparate pieces of information\" to produce a detailed report within minutes. The Deep Search feature in Google Finance will also show users how the report has been created so they can understand how the AI generated the financial reports. After the report is ready, the AI can continue the conversation, allowing the user to ask follow-up questions. Citations will also be available to the user, so they can visit websites Gemini used to create the report. While Deep Search is the most important new AI feature for Google Finance, Google also added a few other useful tools to the app. Users will be able to access prediction market data from Kalshi and Polymarket directly in Google Finance via natural conversation prompts. You might ask something like \"What will GDP growth be for 2025?\" and Google Finance will automatically display data from prediction markets showing the current probabilities. Google also highlighted a feature it announced last week, a new earnings experience for Google Finance that lets you stay on top of earnings reports and earnings calls. The \"Upcoming earnings\" calendar will show all scheduled earnings events. Clicking a ticker can also provide information about upcoming earnings reports. A new \"Earnings\" tab will give you information about the next earnings call, and let you tune into a live audio stream when it happens. The AI will transcribe the call in real-time. Also, an \"At a glance\" feature will deliver AI-powered insights about the company. The information will be updated before, during, and after the call, so users can stay informed throughout the earnings report period. Earnings season just got a major upgrade. We've launched a brand new earnings experience in the new Google Finance! Get live audio, instant transcripts and AI insights right when they matter. pic.twitter.com\/gl8ic2mrAM \u2014 Rose Yao (@dozenrose) October 31, 2025   Deep Search will be available to Google Finance users in the U.S. in the coming weeks, with subscribers to the Google AI Pro and AI Ultra premium services getting higher usage limits. Prediction markets data will be available to users in the coming weeks, starting with Labs users. These features will be available in additional markets in the future. Finally, Google is rolling out Google Finance in India, with support for English and Hindi.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Elon Musk just scored a pay package that could make him the world's first trillionaire. Now comes the hard part \u2014 achieving 12 ambitious milestones. With over 75% of the votes cast in favor, Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a compensation plan worth up to $1 trillion, capping a yearslong saga over Musk's pay. A vote on whether to authorize a Tesla investment into xAI, Musk's AI startup, was less conclusive. Tesla said that while a majority of participating shareholders voted to approve an investment into xAI, there was also a \"significant number of abstentions.\" Tesla said the board will examine the \"next steps.\" Tesla investors voted on multiple proposals. Chief among them was Musk's pay package, which is contingent on achieving some lofty goals. To earn the full $1 trillion value, Musk must boost Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million vehicles a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots. Tesla's shares jumped 3% after hours following the voting results, but dipped into the red during Musk's address to the audience, where he talked about the challenges of Optimus production and teased a new Tesla Roadster demo on April 1. It was slightly up after hours as the meeting ended. Musk also told the audience that it's \"probably worth having talks with Intel,\" though he said Tesla hasn't signed any deal with the chipmaker. Intel's stock price jumped 3% after hours following the remark. Tesla is \"probably\" going to have to build a \"gigantic chip fab\" to the volume of chips the company needs, the CEO added. \"Gotta be done,\" Musk said. \"I'm super hardcore on chips right now, as you can tell,\" Musk said.  The pay package proposal proved divisive in the run-up to the meeting. Weeks ahead of the vote, proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject the proposal. Musk called the proxy firms \"corporate terrorists\" during Tesla's recent earnings call. Scroll on for the play-by-play of Tesla's annual shareholder meeting and Musk's remarks.  Tesla's stock inches back up, trading roughly flat after hours as the event ends with laser lights. Tesla will have to spend \"a lot of money\" on training Optimus, Musk says. The costs will be in the tens of billions, he predicts: \"It's a big number.\" When asked if Musk's idea of sustainable abundance in the future will render all of his wealth obsolete, Musk says it would be \"difficult to imagine that any humans will actually be in charge\" one day, if \"artificial intelligence vastly exceeds the sum of human intelligence.\" Tesla's stock has gone up and done after hours as Musk continues to field questions. Just an hour ago, the stock was up 3%. Now it's down .4% after hours. Musk teases the \"most exciting \u2014 whether it works or not \u2014 demo of any product ever.\" Tesla is aiming for a new Tesla Roadster demo on April 1, he says. He predicts production will follow roughly 12-18 months later. Musk has talked about this idea before. Tesla vehicles could offer a \"massive distributed AI inference fleet,\" Musk says. With customer consent, the EVs could earn money while sitting in the garage, he says. \"That will also help the AI in the car not get bored,\" he says. Musk says it's \"very difficult\" to operate a public company, citing the exposure to litigation. But after some thought, the CEO says \"maybe\" SpaceX should be a public company at some point. He says he does want to find \"some way\" for Tesla shareholders to participate in his space company. The rate of Cybcercab production will be dependent on regulatory approval, Musk says. \"I'd like to thank Waymo for paving the path,\" he says. \"It's very helpful.\" In a hypothetical autonomous future, where car ownership won't be necessary, Musk predicts that the \"total number of vehicles will decrease.\" That might be hard to square with for a company whose core business is making cars \u2014 at least for now. It's clear a lot of the Tesla shareholders in the audience are big Musk fans \u2014 many are working in sincere thank-yous into their questions. One question-asker thanks Musk and says that \"we all care\" about Musk's well-being and safety. Another thanks Musk for what he's doing for \"freedom of speech.\" Tesla vehicles and Optimus robots are a \"natural fit\" for building a moon base. The two products will also make it to Mars, Musk says, and will be a fit for a Mars city. The Cybertruck, too, he adds. Musk confirms that the new Roadster, first unveiled in November 2017, is coming. It will be the \"most exciting product unveil ever,\" he says, though it's not necessarily part of Tesla's mission of \"sustainable abundance.\" Business Insider's Grace Kay recently reported that Roadster was at least two to three years away from production, according to a source familiar. Read full story While Musk has repeatedly said that Tesla is not just an electric carmaker, the CEO says he still believes vehicles are an integral part of his company's future. Musk repeats the line that this is \"not just a new chapter for Tesla, it's a new book,\" and that includes \"massively increasing vehicle production.\" Before asking a question about wheelchair accessibility, one question-asker says, \"Congrats on not having to show up to work for free anymore.\" The crowd cheers. SOC Investment Group, the firm that led the charge behind the group of institutional shareholders that expressed concerns around Musk's pay package, said in a statement that the annual meeting shows a \"breakdown in the EV giants' accountability.\" The firm said that the company's growth hinges on \"strong governance, independent oversight and transparent accountability.\" \"Maybe at the next annual shareholder meeting, we'll have Optimus take some of the questions,\" Musk says. The first question referenced President Donald Trump's election and asked for a larger event that people could attend. If Tesla does it, the shareholder says, it will be \"bigger than Berkshire.\" Musk commends the expansion of the Tesla supercharger network. The team did such a good job, Musk says, that other car companies chose to use Tesla chargers rather than building their own. \"Sounds good to us,\" he says. It was trading up around 3% after hours following the passage of Musk's pay package. Musk says that Tesla is \"probably\" going to have to build a \"gigantic chip fab.\"  The CEO says he sees no other way to get to the volume of chips the company is looking for without it. \"Gotta be done,\" he says. Tesla hasn't signed any deals yet, Musk says, but it's \"probably worth having discussions with Intel.\" Intel stock is up 3% in after-hours trading following Musk's comments. Tesla needs \"inexpensive\" and \"power-efficient\" chips for its robots, Musk says. Musk compares Tesla to Nvidia. He says that Nvidia has to serve the \"superset of all past and future customers,\" while Tesla only needs to make it work for its own software, Musk says. The Tesla chips will be made in Taiwan, South Korea, Arizona, and Texas, he adds. Musk teases a video of the Optimus manufacturing line. The CEO says the cost of production per unit is around $20,000 \"in current year dollars.\" Engineering the forearm and hand of a robot is difficult, Musk says, as is \"real-world AI\" and manufacturing at scale. \"Tesla is the only one that has all three,\" Musk says. Tesla is set to start production on the Cybercab in April 2026, Musk says. The fully autonomous vehicle will have no pedals or steering wheel.  Musk says the goal is to reach a Cybercab production time of less than 10 seconds, before saying a five-second production time may be theoretically possible. Musk says Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology only has \"partial approval\" in China. He says he was told FSD would get full approval around February or March 2026. Musk says that he is confident that, in the coming months, drivers will be able to text and drive simultaneously, thanks to FSD. Some drivers are now turning FSD off to text, Musk says, which is \"less safe.\" Musk often talks as if he's just speaking in a stream of consciousness. Just now, he talked about Tesla's \"new\" mission that is \"sustainable abundance.\" The CEO says he \"ad-libs a lot of this stuff.\" Musk predicts a world where \"maybe there won't even be money,\" or that money is measured in wattage. The \"infinite money glitch\" remark about Optimus is similar to Musk's comments on a recent earnings call. He repeats some advice he's previously said during Tesla livestreams: \"Hang on to your Tesla stock.\" Tesla stock jumped 3% after trading hours, following the preliminary results of the shareholder meeting, which included the approval of Musk's pay package. Musk continues to address the audience, chatting sci-fi recommendations and more. Elon Musk hypes up Tesla's Optimus robot. He says that everyone will want \"their own personal R2-D2.\" He expects tens of billions of Optimus robots \"out there,\" and that they will \"eliminate poverty.\" Safety is important, he says. He wants Optimus to be more \"Star Wars\" than James Cameron. If you want a sense of what the atmosphere is like at a Tesla shareholder meeting, Musk says it's like a \"cyberpunk night club\" inside. \"Other shareholder meetings are snooze fests,\" he said. \"Ours are bangers.\" As Elon Musk approaches the stage, the crowd cheers. Tesla's Optimus robot also dances, which Musk says has \"no wires.\" Over 75% of voters who participated approved Musk's pay package. The crowd broke out into cheers of \"Elon, Elon!\" Erhart says that while a majority of voting shareholders approved the investment into xAI, there was also a \"significant number of abstentions.\" Erhart said the Tesla board will examine the \"next steps.\" It's not moving, but Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot is onstage to the far right of the presenters. In a pre-recorded presentation, one Tesla shareholder asked voters to consider repealing the 3% derivative suit ownership threshold, which they said \"stops proper oversight\" and \"tells shareholders that the board no longer wants to be answerable to them.\" At the end, boos could be heard. Via an audio recording, Stephen Hawk, a Tesla shareholder since 2012, presented proposal 7 of the meeting: Authorizing Tesla to invest in xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup. Hawk said that Tesla should invest in the company \"sooner rather than later,\" stating that Tesla has \"always been an AI company.\" Tesla's general counsel Erhart called the meeting to order at 4:25 p.m. ET. Polls are now open for shareholder voters. Erhart says Tesla will now outline each proposal that shareholders are voting on. We'll also hear from some individual shareholders who presented proposals being voted on. Board chair Robyn Denholm recaps Tesla's achievements. She says that Tesla was at an \"inflection point\" before listing Model Y sales, the robotaxi, and Tesla's energy business as high points. Denholm also says that Tesla's emissions avoidance will \"only accelerate.\" She starts by apologizing for her voice \u2014 she's been speaking to Tesla investors nearly \"nonstop\" in recent weeks, she says. Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla's general counsel and corporate secretary, introduced the 2025 annual shareholder meetings. There are two parts to today's event, he says: 14 ballot items and then \"Elon Musk.\" Tesla executives are expected to outline the agenda, which will include hearing presentations from a small number of shareholders whose proposals are being voted on, and then announce the results. The last time Tesla held a vote on Elon Musk's pay package, Tesla saw a 65% shareholder participation rate, and about 72% of the voters, excluding the CEO and Musk's brother, moved to ratify Musk's 2018 compensation package. Retail investors showed up. For John Stringer, a retail investor and founder of Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley, one of the largest Tesla clubs in North America, Tesla's success and Elon Musk's leadership are inextricably linked.

Investors have also voted on a motion to authorize a Tesla investment in xAI, Elon Musk's AI startup that has developed the chatbot Grok. If approved, Tesla's board would decide the \"amount and form\" of the investment, according to the company's proxy filing. Should the motion pass, it would be the latest indication that Musk's wide array of companies is becoming more intertwined. Tesla's board has been pushing hard to get the $1 trillion pay package over the line. In a letter to shareholders, chair Robyn Denholm warned that Musk could leave Tesla if the compensation plan fails to pass, adding that this could cause the EV giant to lose \"significant value.\" \"The fundamental question for shareholders at this year's Annual Meeting is simple: Do you want to retain Elon as Tesla's CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?\" she wrote. \"Waiting for a big announcement at 4 PM EST today,\" Musk's mother, Maye Musk, wrote on X along with a photo of her first Tesla, which she said Elon bought for her. It's not clear if she is referring to the potential passage of her son's pay package \u2014 or something else. We'll find out in less than an hour. \"Waiting for a big announcement at 4 PM EST today,\" Musk's mother, Maye Musk, wrote on X along with a photo of her first Tesla, which she said Elon bought for her.

Some of Tesla's most bullish investors \u2014 including ARK Invest's Cathy Wood and Wedbush Securities \u2014 have expressed support, while institutional investors like the state board of administration of Florida, Baron Capitol, and Schwab Asset Management have indicated they will vote in favor. On Tuesday, Norges Bank, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, joined a handful of trade unions and state pension funds in announcing its opposition to the pay package. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is Tesla's sixth-biggest institutional investor. The two largest, BlackRock and Vanguard Group, have yet to say how they voted. Read full story If the vote goes Musk's way, he'll also be on the path to increasing his level of control at Tesla, which he has said is a must if he is to continue developing AI and robotics at the EV maker. Musk has regularly expressed concern over his level of control over Tesla, telling analysts last month that he wouldn't feel comfortable \"building a robot army\" at the company without having more voting power.

Musk has regularly expressed concern over his level of control over Tesla, telling analysts last month that he wouldn't feel comfortable \"building a robot army\" at the company without having more voting power. \"I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis,\" Musk said. He said he wants an equity stake in the \"mid-20s\" to maintain \"a strong influence\" at Tesla, but still be fireable if he goes \"insane.\" The new pay package would allow Musk to unlock additional shares, increasing his stake to about 25% if all milestones are hit. While Musk and his brother, Kimbal, didn't vote last year on whether to re-approve the Tesla CEO's 2018 pay package, they are free to vote on his new compensation plan. When Tesla was seeking to ratify Musk's 2018 pay package under Delaware law (where Tesla used to be incorporated), the company said that the result was \"conditioned on approval by at least a majority of votes cast by disinterested stockholders.\" While Musk and his brother, Kimbal, didn't vote last year on whether to re-approve the Tesla CEO's 2018 pay package, they are free to vote on his new compensation plan. When Tesla was seeking to ratify Musk's 2018 pay package under Delaware law (where Tesla used to be incorporated), the company said that the result was \"conditioned on approval by at least a majority of votes cast by disinterested stockholders.\" Tesla has since incorporated in Texas, leaving Delaware, and the company is not limiting the vote to \"disinterested stockholders\" this time around. Musk's roughly 15% equity stake in Tesla increases the odds that his pay package will be approved.

Musk has sounded open to the idea in the past and said the company would consider it if shareholders submitted a proposal. Multiple did, and while Tesla has a voting recommendation on all of the other proposals submitted by shareholders, it took a neutral \"none\" position on this one \u2014 likely in an attempt to insulate itself against potential future legal challenges over the idea of one company led by Musk investing in another.

How much is Elon Musk worth? That question is at the core of the debate over the Tesla CEO's proposed pay package. This afternoon, the company will reveal the results of the shareholder vote on the compensation plan, which could be worth up to $1 trillion. The stakes are high, and not just because we're talking about a salary that would dwarf most countries' GDPs. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm warned voting against it could risk Musk leaving the company entirely. As of this morning, prediction markets have the pay package getting approved as the heavy favorite. But there have been some vocal opponents, including the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. So who is for and against the comp package, and what are some of their arguments? Let's break it down. For the pay package Key supporters: Cathie Wood, Wedbush Securities, Charles Schwab Musk has gotten Tesla investors this far: No CEO and company are more intertwined than Musk and Tesla. Love him or hate him, Musk comes with a legion of fans who have heavily supported Tesla. Over the past five years, shares are up more than 215%. That's far better than the S&P 500 and roughly equal or better than most of its Big Tech peers. Tesla is in the middle of a big shift: Losing someone of Musk's stature is never easy, but it'd be particularly tricky as Tesla pivots from its EV roots to go all-in on AI. It's a big switch into an intensely competitive field, and having to navigate it with a new CEO at the helm isn't something shareholders will likely be interested in. It's $1 trillion, with a catch: As big as $1 trillion is, the package is contingent on a series of goals, including raising Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion. If Tesla's valuation were to increase that much over the next decade \u2014 it's currently worth roughly $1.43 trillion \u2014 some feel that's a fair reward for the work Musk would need to do to get there. Against the pay package Key supporters: New York State Retirement Fund, American Federation of Teachers, CalPERS Hitching your wagon to Elon isn't always smooth: You have to take the good with the bad when it comes to Musk, and recently, the bad has been really bad. Musk's breakup with President Donald Trump proved to be a real low point for Tesla and its share price. And Musk is unlikely to change his shoot-from-the-hip approach. A distracted Musk: One of the biggest gripes against Musk is that he's too busy. His other endeavors \u2014 SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company \u2014 suck up a lot of his time. And the ties between the companies, or his \"Muskonomy,\" isn't going anywhere as he calls on Tesla to invest in xAI. Too much control: A key piece of the package is Musk's voting stake potentially rising to nearly 29% (he's currently at about 13%). Musk has been adamant about the need for this as Tesla enters its new era, but some are uncomfortable with someone so powerful getting even more control over the company.

Sam Altman cleared up some misunderstandings from the social media echo chamber on Thursday. While doing so, the OpenAI CEO seemed to announce a potentially huge new business for the startup. \"We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this,\" Altman wrote on X. This suggests OpenAI may be looking to become a cloud provider in its own right. That would put the AI startup into direct competition with cloud giants Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform. I've never seen OpenAI talk so clearly about building a business like this. I asked spokespeople at the startup for comment and any clarifications, but didn't hear back by publication time. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar may have hinted at something like this back in September. In a warning shot over future competition, she said cloud providers have been \"learning on our dime,\" and she wants to ensure OpenAI isn't giving away its AI know-how to these tech giants. While Altman's comments on Thursday were designed to correct misunderstandings, he also addressed a much more important question hanging over the entire market: How will OpenAI pay for more than $1 trillion in AI infrastructure deals it's signed lately? One potential way would be to become a major cloud provider. At scale, these businesses are unprecedented money machines. If you're going to spend over $1 trillion on AI chips, networking gear, and huge data centers, one way to get a relatively quick return on that is by renting out these computing resources to other companies. This is why investors are (relatively!) less concerned about Microsoft, Amazon, and Google right now. They already have huge cloud business models that generate returns on their infrastructure spending. If you don't have a cloud business, the future looks murkier. Take Meta, for example. While it's also spending billions of dollars on data centers and technical gear, it doesn't have a cloud service, and therefore lacks a clear way to achieve a quick return on this heavy investment. This is part of the reason Meta shares slumped recently. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have a clear enough answer (yet?) for how all this infrastructure investment will pay off. OpenAI is arguably in a tighter spot than Meta right now. Building a serious cloud business could assuage some investor concern over AI's return on investment.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":" Grand Theft Auto 6Rockstar GamesTake Two  Grand Theft Auto 6 keeps getting delayed. Will this be the last time? Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick seems to think so, although never say never. He also claimed to be confident the last two times Rockstar Games announced a release window. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we set a date, we really do believe in it,\u201d he told The Game Business on Thursday. \u201cWe said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what happened. We feel really good about this release date. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really supportive of Rockstar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zelnick was similarly bullish in a new interview with IGN. \u201cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m highly confident,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time, there have been limited circumstances where more time was required to polish a title and make sure that it was spectacular and that time has been well-spent, when our competitors go to market before something was ready, bad things happen. That said, that said, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m highly confident on the new date.\u201d The value of that confidence is not what it once was. Here\u2019s what Zelnick said the first time fans started to worry about a potential GTA 6 delay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like \u00e2\u0080\u0098absolutely,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you jinx things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told\u00c2\u00a0IGN last February, back when it the game was still slated to arrive in fall 2025.\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we feel really good about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jinx! Three months later, the game was delayed to May 2026. Zelnick was asked what his \u00e2\u0080\u009clevel of conviction\u00e2\u0080\u009d was for that new date in August. \u201c[My] level of conviction is very, very high, obviously,\u201d he told CNBC. He elaborated as little as possible: \u201cWe try not to pump expectations, right? I think Rockstar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still to beat them. I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their goal. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be an amazing game. The rest we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in the fullness of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jinx! Three months later, the game has been delayed until November 2026. Why keep announcing release dates that Rockstar can\u2019t hit? \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that far in advance if you look at when you need to deliver a game to get it out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zelnick told The Game Business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlso, we have to start marketing activities in a significant amount of time ahead of release. What we want to do is give consumers as much certainty as possible. And again, we feel quite good about this date.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Except that the delivery date is moving farther away, not getting closer.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Have you heard the news? Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed again. The open-world crime simulator is no longer releasing in May 2026 and will now instead launch in November 2026. So why the delay? According to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, it\u2019s because Rockstar Games is seeking \u201cperfection\u201d and the studio\u2019s Metacritic track record is proof that this strategy works. During a November 6 earnings call, Zelnick, who leads Rockstar parent Company Take-Two, was asked about how the GTA 6 delay was affecting the studio and what Rockstar Games was doing at this stage in development. While Zelnick declined to get into the \u201cinner workings\u201d of the developer, he did talk about the company\u2019s culture and focus on making critically acclaimed games. \u201cI think the culture of Rockstar [Games] is extraordinary, and we\u2019re all pushing hard to to seek perfection,\u201d said Zelnick during the earnings call. Take-Two\u2019s stock sank around 7 percent after news of the delay was made public. The CEO then praised how highly rated Rockstar-developed games are on review aggregator Metacritic. \u201cI mean, the Metacritic scores of Rockstar releases are, generally, speaking, not generally I mean, with very few exceptions, have been over 95,\u201d explained Zelnick.\u00c2\u00a0 \u201cGTA V, as you know, has been the standard bearer, not just for our company, but for the industry through three console generations, and to this day, is still, I would argue, the most technologically advanced title in the marketplace, despite [being more than a] decade old, and that doesn\u2019t happen by accident.\u201d I\u2019d quibble a bit here and point out that only seven of Rockstar\u2019s video game releases have hit 95 and only 4 got a higher score on Metacritic, with most landing in the high 80s and low 90s. But there\u2019s no denying that over the last 15 years Rockstar Games has mostly produced critically acclaimed blockbusters like Red Dead Redemption, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption II.\u00c2\u00a0 Zelnick added that Rockstar and all of Take-Two\u2019s studios are focused on \u201cseeking excellence, teamwork and kindness.\u201d Not sure how reported efforts at union busting factor into that, but it\u2019s a nice sentiment. Of course, the problem is that with each passing year and each delay, the expectations for Grand Theft Auto 6 grow and grow. The video game industry isn\u2019t standing still and waiting for Rockstar to make the next big open-world masterpiece. The genre has continued to evolve thanks to games like Elden Ring, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Far Cry, Tears of the Kingdom, Death Stranding 2, Forza Horizon 5, and others. What people expect from a big, AAA open-world video game has changed a lot since 2013\u2019s GTA V and 2019\u2019s Red Dead Redemption 2. Will Rockstar\u2019s pursuit of \u201cperfection\u201d make it harder for the studio to keep up with the rest of the industry, leading to a game that feels dated? Or will the studio innovate and help reshape the genre it practically created? We\u2019ll find out in November 2026. Probably. Maybe. We\u2019ll see.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Bitdefender has once again been recognized as a Representative Vendor in the Gartner\u00ae Market Guide for Managed Detection and Response (MDR) \u2014 marking the fourth consecutive year of inclusion. According to Gartner, more than 600 providers globally claim to deliver MDR services, yet only a select few meet the criteria to appear in the Market Guide. While inclusion is not a ranking or comparative assessment, we believe it underscores Bitdefender's human-driven approach to MDR and our continued alignment with Gartner's rigorous inclusion standards. To be included, must demonstrate consistent visibility through Gartner client inquiries or Peer Insights reviews, focus on delivering end-user\u2013oriented services rather than purely technological solutions, and represent a variety of company sizes and geographies. We believe independent analyst research like the Gartner Market Guide for Managed Detection and Response is a valuable resource for organizations assessing MDR providers. The report outlines the evolving MDR landscape, identifies its core components, and highlights emerging trends \u2014 including the growing emphasis on proactive exposure management. Download the Report  The MDR market continues to expand rapidly, fueled by two key forces: the rising sophistication of cyber threats and the ongoing shortage of skilled in-house security talent. While large enterprises have long had access to around-the-clock monitoring and expert-led response, small and mid-sized organizations are increasingly recognizing the same need \u2014 often without the capacity to build and maintain full Security Operations Centers (SOCs). For these organizations, MDR delivers human-led, enterprise-grade protection with proactive exposure management \u2014 without the complexity or cost of running it internally. Bitdefender MDR integrates advanced detection technologies, global threat intelligence, and expert-led response, giving organizations access to elite analysts who monitor, investigate, and neutralize threats 24x7. This approach enhances resilience, reduces alert fatigue, and allows internal teams to focus on strategic initiatives instead of managing constant alerts. Organizations leveraging MDR typically experience faster detection, reduced dwell time, and increased confidence in handling advanced attacks such as ransomware or supply-chain compromises. Many also report improved compliance readiness and more efficient recovery from incidents. As threat actors exploit vulnerabilities across cloud, identity, and endpoint layers, MDR fills a critical role by delivering continuous visibility and active defense. Bitdefender MDR stands out for its focus on proactive threat hunting \u2014 identifying hidden adversaries before damage occurs \u2014 and its use of AI-driven analytics to surface only the most relevant, high-priority alerts.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Call it some air slipping out what might be an AI bubble, or the Fed engineering a tightening in liquidity into a growing economic slowdown, or some combination of the two, but markets are pulling back again on Thursday. Just before the noon hour on the east coast, the Nasdaq is lower by 2% and the S&P 500 down 1.2%. Crypto prices \u2014 in the unfortunate position these past weeks of being uncorrelated with stocks when they were rising every single day, but perfectly correlated when stocks sell off \u2014 are again taking it on the chin. Bitcoin is lower by 3% over the past 24 hours and threatening to tumble back below $100,000. Ether ETH$3,372.41, XRP$2.2251, solana SOL$156.80 and doge (DOGE) are lower by 2%-6%. Crypto-related stocks are having an even harder time of it. Robinhood (HOOD) is down 8.5% one day after reporting a sizable earnings beat, in part due to surging crypto trading. Among other exchanges, Coinbase (COIN) is lower by 5.6% and Gemini (GEMI) by 3%. Bullish (BLSH) is down 8% and Galaxy Digital (GLXY) by 5.1%. Capital continues to flee to digital asset treasury sector, led by a 5.9% decline in pioneer Strategy (MSTR). At $238, MSTR is now lower by 6.8% year-over-year and down by 56% since soaring to $543 in the days following President Trump's 2024 election victory. Bitcoin mining stocks \u2014 many of which have soared this year thanks to a pivot to becoming AI infrastructure providers \u2014 aren't being spared. Hut 8 (HUT), IREN (IREN), and Cipher Mining (CIFR) are among those down more than 8%. Markets continue to reel from the Fed's surprise hawkish pivot last week at which Chairman Jerome Powell threw a big bucket of cold water on the settled-idea that the central bank would cut rates at its December meeting. Powell's sentiments have since been echoed by numerous other Fed members. Worried about flying blind as the government shutdown means no official economic statistics, the central bank might be missing or choosing to ignore what's now become a string of other data pointing to underlying weakness. The latest came Thursday with one of the worst Challenger job layoff reports in more than two decades, along with a troubling outlook from used-car sales bellwether CarMax (KMX). That company's CEO also unexpectedly stepped down \u2014\u00a0shares are lower by 20%. One day ago, McDonald's warned on the economic pressure being felt by its customers, sentiments echoed previously by chains like Chipotle and Cava. The continued federal government shutdown also looks to be extending far further than most previously expected, according to the latest Polymarket odds. Folks can carp about deficits and bloated government all they want, but the shutdown means many billions of dollars that would otherwise by flowing through the economy (and markets) are not doing so.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"\u00a0 The Dokkaebi Market Customer Support Center, designed by YZA, is a public complex supporting the traditional Dokkaebi (Goblin) Market in Nowon-gu, Seoul. Positioned at the entrance to the market, the building occupies a transitional site, where a quiet residential alley to the south meets the dense commercial activity of the market to the north. Within this dual context, the project was developed as an architectural gateway connecting two distinct urban conditions. \u00a0 The program integrates several public functions, including a parking tower for market visitors, a customer support office, public restrooms, a community space, and a neighborhood caf\u00e9. These functions are organized along the site\u2019s length: the parking structure to the south, market-related facilities to the north, and a vertical circulation core positioned centrally as a mediator between them. The design also utilizes the site\u2019s east\u2013west elevation change to create a pilotis space on the ground floor, enhancing permeability and pedestrian access. Above, a series of stepped terraces offers views toward the marketplace and provides outdoor rest areas for visitors. The building\u2019s facade employs a multicolored steel screen that references the symbolic palette of the Dokkaebi Market. Acting both as a visual marker and a privacy filter, the screen softens views from surrounding residential streets while projecting a shifting play of color and light.\u00a0 all images by Kyungsub Shin \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The facade unifies the different programmatic elements, like parking, public facilities, and circulation, into a cohesive volume. Fabricated from PosMAC\u00ae steel louver panels, the facade system was developed through digital manufacturing processes that eliminate the need for welding. Techniques such as precision bending, automated folding, and full-scale mock-up testing informed the design\u2019s structural performance and finish quality. This approach reflects design studio YZA\u2019s interest in material experimentation and the potential of industrial fabrication in public architecture. \u00a0 The project draws conceptual inspiration from the dokkaebi, a figure from Korean folklore associated with transformation and playfulness. Through its translucent facade, adaptable spatial layout, and integration of public amenities, the building translates this spirit into a contemporary architectural form. Situated at the intersection of city and market, it functions as both infrastructure and urban landmark, reinterpreting the identity of the Goblin Market within Seoul\u2019s evolving neighborhood landscape.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":" \t\t\t\t\tBy Dade Hayes  Business Editor  Nexstar Media Group founder and CEO Perry Sook says the local TV giant is \u201cmaking good progress\u201d toward closing its proposed acquisition of rival Tegna on schedule by the second half of 2026.  \tThe $6.2 billion would make Nexstar the \u201cposter company\u201d for a transformed local broadcast sector, Sook acknowledged during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call. Given that the combined entity would have TV stations reaching 80% of the U.S. \u2013 more than double the current federal limit of 39% for a single owner \u2013 company founder and CEO Perry Sook was asked about the fate of the rest of the industry if and when the mega-deal closes.  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tMedia Ushered Out Of Oval Office After Man Collapses During Trump Announcement On Weight-Loss Drug Discounts\t\t \t\t\t                \tExecutives \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tDisney-YouTube TV Carriage Fight Is Breaking Antitrust Laws & FCC Rules, Sinclair CEO Says\t\t \t\t\t        \t\u201cA good, strong industry needs to have good, strong companies comprising it,\u201d Sook said. \u201cWe think that we will be the poster company for not only what the future of the industry will look like, but also with the strength of our balance sheet management team, financial profile, and the amount of local content that we deliver as well as leading on innovation for the industry.\u201d     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tSook\u2019s comments followed Nexstar\u2019s report of quarterly results, which were marred by the absence of political advertising compared with the same quarter in 2024. Revenue in the period ended September 30 totaled $1.2 billion, down 12% from the year-earlier period. Earnings per share hit $2.14 on a diluted basis, down from $5.63 a year ago and well short of Wall Street analysts\u2019 forecast for $4.51.  \tNexstar shares tumbled 7% on the earnings report, but they are still up 15% this year to date.  \t\u201cWe\u2019re making good progress on our path to closing,\u201d Sook told analysts on the call, and \u201cthe pieces are falling into place.\u201d Tegna has filed its proxy statement laying out financials, and will hold a shareholder vote on November 18, he said. Nexstar has been engaged with regulatory agencies, submitting initial paperwork. Sook said his optimism is based on interactions with officials and last summer\u2019s key ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacating the so-called \u201ctop four\u201d ban on owning multiple stations in a single market.  \t           \tThe FCC plans to take up a review of the current ownership cap in 2026, though it is unclear whether the agency can unilaterally lift the restriction without the intervention of Congress. The mid-term elections loom large for the Nexstar-Tegna deal. If Democrats were to win back control of the House or Senate, it could muddy the water for the transaction.  \tSook made sure to praise the Trump Administration and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr for promising deregulatory moves and \u201callowing businesses to breathe, allowing businesses to compete.\u201d  \tAs work continues on the transaction, the exec said, \u201cThere is genuine enthusiasm in this building for this acquisition. for the opportunity it creates to grow our business, for the opportunity it creates to make sure that we secure a future for our business.\u201d He added, \u201cAll you have to do is look in the news that things going on around us to see why deregulation and further consolidation to preserve local journalism and our industry is necessary.\u201d  \tNexstar has identified nine markets where an additional station could start producing regular local news where it has not before, Sook said, citing the Dallas market where Nexstar is based as one example.  \tThe CW, a controlling stake in which Nexstar acquired in 2022, trimmed its losses in the quarter. It expects to break even in mid-2026, with profitability coming later than the initial projection of three years in part due to sports rights acquisitions. Sports now makes up 40% of programming on the broadcast network, which used to be dominated by young-skewing scripted dramas supplied by its corporate parents. Former 50-50 partners Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery each retain 12.5% stakes in the network. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This story was first published by Digiday sibling Modern Retail. American Eagle. Rare Beauty. The RealReal. These are some of the biggest brands that have, within the past year, launched their own Substack newsletters. They\u2019re now joined by e-commerce technology provider Shopify, which on Oct. 20\u00a0penned\u00a0the first installment of its brand-new Substack newsletter, dubbed \u201cIn Stock.\u201d With a market capitalization of more than $224 billion, Shopify is also \u2014 by far \u2014 the biggest company to launch its own branded newsletter on Substack. By comparison, American Eagle and The RealReal have a market value of $2.80 billion and $1.37 billion, respectively. What\u2019s more, while fashion and beauty brands dominate Substack, raising questions about\u00a0saturation\u00a0on the platform, Shopify is the first company of its kind \u2014 an e-commerce platform \u2014 to take the plunge. Shopify\u2019s entrance is the latest sign that brands, including large, publicly traded companies, are taking Substack seriously as a marketing channel. As Modern Retail\u00a0previously reported, brands of all sizes, particularly companies in the fashion and beauty space, have flocked to Substack in the past year. Since 2022, the number of publications and subscriptions in the fashion and beauty category has more than doubled year-over-year, according to Substack. But while many brands have been enthusiastic about launching a Substack, it has been proven more challenging for them to sustain momentum. The RealReal, for instance, went nearly three months without posting new content between June and September before resuming in the fall. American Eagle took a similar hiatus over the summer,\u00a0prompting speculation\u00a0about whether the brand was abandoning the platform altogether. American Eagle resumed posting in late September after it tapped Tariro Makoni, author of the Substack \u201cTrademarked\u201d to take over from \u201cAfter School\u201d writer Casey Lewis. For Shopify, the move is about joining the online conversations around entrepreneurship that have increasingly migrated to Substack. But the question remains whether Shopify\u2019s sheer size and name recognition will be enough to stand out in an increasingly crowded space. \u201cSome of our Shopify partners were already [on Substack], and we were like, \u2018Wow, these entrepreneurship conversations are happening in this space and we\u2019re not part of it,\u2019\u201d said Dayna Winter, Shopify\u2019s newsroom lead, who spearheaded the \u201cIn Stock\u201d project. \u201cIf we\u2019re an entrepreneurship company, we should be there.\u201d The newsletter is intended to feel more \u201cunbuttoned\u201d than the company\u2019s other communication channels, Winter said, while also complementing Shopify\u2019s existing newsroom, which primarily publishes corporate news. With \u201cIn Stock,\u201d the idea is to tap into Substack\u2019s burgeoning popularity through recurring features like \u201cDecoded,\u201d a new-to-Substack series about the real-life strategies powering the businesses of various Shopify merchants.\u00a0Other posts include Q&As with brand founders and even first-person essays from entrepreneurs. The Substack effort builds on Shopify\u2019s long-running investment in storytelling. Beyond its newsroom, the company has a robust content strategy that includes the\u00a0Shopify Blog\u00a0\u2014 a hub for guides, tutorials and merchant spotlight \u2014 as well as\u00a0official podcasts. Shopify also publishes an\u00a0engineering blog\u00a0focused on developer insights and a\u00a0resource library\u00a0for small businesses. Put together, the various arms of Shopify\u2019s content strategy work together to \u201cdrive towards the same mission of pushing entrepreneurship and making entrepreneurship more common,\u201d Winter said. In the future, Shopify also plans to use its own commerce data to shape what it publishes on Substack. Winter said the team is developing ways to surface insights from Shopify\u2019s massive merchant base and turn them into stories readers can act on. One early example is \u201cViralify,\u201d a recurring data-driven series that spotlights trending products across Shopify stores in real time. \u201cBecause we power millions of merchants, we obviously have so much data and we\u2019re able to see product trends emerge as they\u2019re happening,\u201d Winter said. That data can inspire merchants who can act on those trends, as well as consumers, who can discover independent brands, Winter added. The newsletter, published twice a week, is free to subscribe to.\u00a0That said, Shopify is exploring partnerships with Substack creators in the entrepreneurship space. This could include co-written pieces or guest contributions from independent writers and founders, rather than traditional brand sponsorships. Indeed, it\u2019s clear from the newsletter\u2019s early installments that brands are the target audience. But Winter also said the newsletter aims to appeal to a large audience or \u201canyone in the orbit of an entrepreneur.\u201d Notably, Shopify opted for individual author bylines rather than anonymous or generalized posts, making the content of \u201cIn Stock\u201d feel more like a magazine than Shopify\u2019s corporate newsroom. \u201cIn Stock\u201d is authored by a four-person team, consisting of Winter herself and other members of Shopify\u2019s communications division. Future posts will spotlight internal subject-matter experts from various departments at Shopify, including VPs, with specialized knowledge of a range of retail topics, from product development to artificial intelligence. Although Shopify has a steady pipeline of stories in the works, Winter said the company\u2019s Substack strategy will change over time based on audience feedback. Shopify plans to use Substack\u2019s interactive features, including Notes, comments and polls, to learn what readers want to see more of and to experiment with new formats. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing how people are specifically reacting and commenting on stories,\u201d Winter said. \u201cThat will give us more granular feedback about what\u2019s actually resonating, who\u2019s sharing what and what they are saying about it.\u201d Shopify is part of a\u00a0growing wave\u00a0of brands experimenting with the platform as a long-form, editorial alternative to increasingly saturated social platforms. For brands, a Substack newsletter is less about driving sales and more about offering readers a window into the brand\u2019s world. Major brands are also increasingly experimenting with Substack through sponsored posts. Just last week, Walmart\u00a0sponsored\u00a0a post on Emily Sundberg\u2019s popular \u201cFeed Me\u201d newsletter. That likely makes the retail giant the largest consumer brand \u2014 if not the largest company ever \u2014 to advertise on the platform. Other brands that have sponsored Substack posts include Hinge, Free People and Cava. \u201cThis long-form, in-depth storytelling that Substack enables is a huge differentiator. It\u2019s where brands can delve deeper into unpacking their values and provide audiences with something beyond the curated surface of social media,\u201d Christina Loff, Substack\u2019s head of lifestyle, told Modern Retail in an email statement. \u201cStrategic brands recognize Substack not as a promotional tool, but as a platform to cultivate trust and genuine relationships through authenticity.\u201d As more brands join Substack, even large companies like Shopify will need to figure out how to stand out from the crowd. That could prove to be challenging, according to Lia Haberman, author of the \u201cICYMI\u201d marketing newsletter. Shopify \u201cwould have been better served launching a LinkedIn newsletter where they could have appealed to a B2B crowd with their case studies and founder stories,\u201d Haberman said. In contrast, the Substack audience \u201ctypically looks for a more intimate relationship with the writers they allow in their inboxes.\u201d Maintaining a regular posting cadence will be key to attracting and retaining subscribers. Substack\u2019s own data team recommends publishing one post a week, according to\u00a0On Substack, a publication from the newsletter company that shares tips and resources for writers on the platform. Substack\u2019s Loff flagged Rare Beauty, Madewell and Design School as \u201cexcellent examples\u201d of brands \u201cthat maintain a consistent posting schedule.\u201d For Shopify, \u201cIn Stock\u201d is \u201ca bit of a playground\u201d for experimentation,\u201d Winter said. \u201cThere\u2019s no real model of what success looks like for brands of our size in this space.\u201d If News Corp were to strike multiple licensing deals, it would be a major signal to the market that the media group isn\u2019t betting on one LLM; it\u2019s building a portfolio and setting the terms.\u00a0 Associated Press has joined Microsoft\u2019s AI content marketplace, as the tech company seeks to strengthen media ties and compete with Google.

TVs are getting thinner and that\u2019s terrific for aesthetic purposes but disastrous for audio quality. Those razor-thin screens don\u2019t have any physical room for decent speakers which means most integrated audio sounds flat, tinny and lifeless. Amazon definitely noticed this gap in the market and decided to create a solution that\u2019s largely inspired by premium brands like Bose and Samsung \u2013 except the Fire TV soundbar Plus costs two to three times less than comparable models from those manufacturers. At the moment, you can score this soundbar for just $174, down from its usual $249 sticker, which puts it at an all-time low. See at Amazon The Fire TV soundbar Plus is a fantastic soundbar that houses real home theater technology inside a single sleek unit sitting neatly below your television. This is a 3.1 channel system which means you get three forward-firing speakers combined with a built-in subwoofer for bass in one compact unit. The dedicated center channel takes care of dialogue specifically so that if people are talking in movies or shows, the conversations come across sharp and clear rather than being blurred with background music and effects. Dolby Atmos support brings 3D audio into the mix\u00c2\u00a0with the sensation that sound is moving around and above you rather than just blasting straight ahead. Action scenes feature helicopters flying overhead, atmospheric dramas rain from above, and much more. Support for DTS:X multi-dimensional audio processing for filmmakers and sound designers gives multiple ways to create immersive experiences that this soundbar can actually reproduce. Special attention is given to the built-in subwoofer as most soundbars in this price range either forgo bass altogether or use a separate wireless subwoofer that requires floor space and its own power outlet. Amazon manages to house the sub directly within the chassis of the soundbar and with it, you gain deep, punchy low frequencies for everything from explosions to music and ambient rumble-all without adding another component to your setup. Setup couldn\u2019t be any easier since you only have to hook up the included HDMI cable to your TV\u2019s HDMI eARC or ARC port. The same cable carries both audio and control signals, which means the remote from your television can change the soundbar\u2019s volume for you with no unnecessary controller cluttering up your coffee table. Audio sync issues that plague some soundbar setups simply don\u2019t happen here, since the HDMI connection keeps everything perfectly timed. It\u2019s compact enough to fit under most TVs without blocking the screen or the remote sensor and has an understated design that lets your entertainment take center stage. For the price, you\u2019re getting tech and performance that\u2019s regularly between $400-$600 from other established audio brands which makes this one of the single best value propositions in home audio at the moment. And for an all-time low price, it\u2019s an even easier decision. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

Radar > Topics > AI & ML Why It\u2019s Better for Us to Think of AI as a Tool than as a Worker   By Tim O\u2019Reilly November 6, 2025 \u2022 17 minute read In a recent newsletter, Ben Thompson suggested paying attention to a portion of Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in DC, calling it \u201can excellent articulation of the thesis that the AI market is orders of magnitude bigger than the software market.\u201d While I\u2019m reluctant to contradict as astute an observer as Thompson, I\u2019m not sure I agree.  Here\u2019s a transcript of the remarks that Thompson called out: Software of the past, and this is a profound understanding, a profound observation of artificial intelligence, that the software industry of the past was about creating tools. Excel is a tool. Word is a tool. A web browser is a tool. The reason why I know these are tools is because you use them. The tools industry, just as screwdrivers and hammers, the tools industry is only so large. In the case of IT tools, they could be database tools, [the market for] these IT tools is about a trillion dollars or so. But AI is not a tool. AI is work. That is the profound difference. AI is, in fact, workers that can actually use tools. One of the things I\u2019m really excited about is the work that Aravind\u2019s doing at Perplexity. Perplexity, using web browsers to book vacations or do shopping. Basically, an AI using tools. Cursor is an AI, an agentic AI system that we use at NVIDIA. Every single software engineer at NVIDIA uses Cursor. That\u2019s improved our productivity tremendously. It\u2019s basically a partner for every one of our software engineers to generate code, and it uses a tool, and the tool it uses is called VS Code. So Cursor is an AI, agentic AI system that uses VS Code. Well, all of these different industries, these different industries, whether it\u2019s chatbots or digital biology where we have AI assistant researchers, or what is a robotaxi? Inside a robotaxi, of course, it\u2019s invisible, but obviously, there\u2019s an AI chauffeur. That chauffeur is doing work, and the tool that it uses to do that work is the car, and so everything that we\u2019ve made up until now, the whole world, everything that we\u2019ve made up until now, are tools. Tools for us to use. For the very first time, technology is now able to do work and help us be more productive. At first this seems like an important observation, and one that justifies the sky-high valuation of AI companies. But it really doesn\u2019t hold up to closer examination. \u201cAI is not a tool. AI is work. That is the profound difference. AI is, in fact, workers that can use tools.\u201d Really? Any complex software system is a worker that can use tools! Think about the Amazon website. Here is some of the work it does, and the tools that it invokes. It: Amazon is a particularly telling example, but far from unique. Every web application of any complexity is a worker that uses tools and does work that humans used to do. And often does it better and far faster. I\u2019ve made this point myself in the past. In 2016, in an article for MIT Sloan Management Review called \u201cManaging the Bots That Are Managing the Business,\u201d I wrote about the changing role of programmers at companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook: A large part of the work of these companies\u2014delivering search results, news and information, social network status updates, and relevant products for purchase\u2014is performed by software programs and algorithms. These programs are the workers, and the human software developers who create them are their managers. Each day, these \u201cmanagers\u201d take in feedback about their electronic workers\u2019 performance\u2014as measured in real-time data from the marketplace \u2014 and they provide feedback to the workers in the form of minor tweaks and updates to their programs or algorithms. The human managers also have their own managers, but hierarchies are often flat, and multiple levels of management are aligned around a set of data-driven \u201cobjectives and key results\u201d (OKRs) that are measurable in a way that allows even the electronic \u201cworkers\u201d to be guided by these objectives. So if I myself have used the analogy that complex software systems can be workers, why do I object to Huang doing the same? I think part of it is the relentless narrative that AI is completely unprecedented. It is true that the desktop software examples Huang cites are more clearly just tools than complex web applications, and that systems that use statistical pattern-matching and generalization abilities DO represent a serious advance over that kind of software. But some kind of AI has been animating the web giants for years. And it is true that today\u2019s AI systems have become even more powerful and general purpose.\u00a0Like Excel, Amazon follows predetermined logic paths, while AI can handle more novel situations. There is indeed something very new here. But the judgment is still out on the range of tasks that it will be able to master. AI is getting pretty good at software development, but even there, in one limited domain, the results are still mixed, with the human still initiating, evaluating, and supervising the work \u2013 in other words, using the AI as a tool. AI also makes for a great research assistant. And it\u2019s a good business writer, brainstorming coach, and so on. But if you think about the range of tasks traditional software does in today\u2019s world, its role in every facet of the economy, that is far larger than the narrow definition of software \u201ctools\u201d that Huang uses. From the earliest days of data processing, computers were doing work. Software has always straddled the boundary between tool and worker. And when you think of the ubiquitous role of software worldwide in helping manage logistics, billing, communications, transportation, construction, energy, healthcare, finance\u2014much of this work not necessarily done better with AI\u2014it\u2019s not at all clear that AI enables a market that is \u201corders of magnitude\u201d larger. At least not for quite some time to come. It requires a narrow definition of the \u201cIT tools\u201d market to make that claim. Even when a new tool does a job better than older ones, it can\u2019t be assumed that it will displace them. Yes, the internal combustion engine almost entirely replaced animal labor in the developed world, but most of the time, new technologies takes their place alongside existing ones. We\u2019re still burning coal and generating energy via steam, the great inventions of the first industrial revolution, despite centuries\u2019 worth of energy advances! Ecommerce, for all its advantages, has still taken only a 20% share of worldwide retail since Amazon launched 30 years ago. And do you remember\u00a0the bold claims\u00a0of Travis Kalanick that Uber was not competing with taxicabs, but aimed to entirely replace the privately owned automobile? In an online chat group about AI where we were debating this part of Huang\u2019s speech, one person asked me: Don\u2019t you think putting Claude Code in YOLO mode and ask[ing] it to do an ambiguous task, for example go through an entire data room and underwrite a loan, with a 250 word description, is fundamentally different from software? First off, that example is a good illustration of the anonymous aphorism that \u201cthe difference between theory and practice is always greater in practice than it is in theory.\u201d Anyone who would trust today\u2019s AI to underwrite a loan based on a 250-word prompt would be taking a very big risk! Huang\u2019s invocation of Perplexity\u2019s ability to shop and make reservations is similarly overstated. Even in more structured environments like coding, full autonomy is some ways off. And yes, of course today\u2019s AI is different from older software. Just so, web apps were different from PC apps. That leads to the \u201cwow\u201d factor. Today\u2019s AI really does seem almost magical. Yet, as someone who has lived through several technology revolutions, I can tell you that each was as marvelous to experience for the first time as today\u2019s AI coding rapture. I wrote my first book (on Frank Herbert) on a typewriter. To rearrange material, I literally cut and pasted sheets of paper. And eventually, I had to retype the whole thing from scratch. Multiple times. Word processing probably saved me as much time (and perhaps more) on future books as AI coding tools save today\u2019s coders. It too was magical! Not only that, to research that first book, I had to travel in person to libraries and archives, scan through boxes of paper and microfiche, manually photocopy relevant documents, and take extensive notes on notecards. To do analogous research (on Herbert Simon) a few years ago, while working on my algorithmic attention rents paper, took only a few hours with Google, Amazon, and the Internet Archive. And yes, to do the same with Claude might have taken only a few minutes, though I suspect the work might have been more shallow if I\u2019d simply worked from Claude\u2019s summaries rather than consulting the original sources. Just being faster and doing more of the work than previous generations of technology is also not peculiar to AI. The time saving leap from pre-internet research to internet-based research is more significant than people realize if they grew up taking the internet for granted. The time saving leap from coding in assembler to coding in a high-level compiled or interpreted language may also be of a similar order of magnitude as the leap from writing Python by hand to having it AI-generated. And if productivity is to be the metric, the time-saving leap from riding a horse drawn wagon across the country to flying in an airplane is likely greater than either the leap from my library-based research or my long-ago assembly language programming to Claude. The question is what we do with the time we save. What\u2019s perhaps most significant in the delta between Amazon or Google and ChatGPT or Claude is that chatbots give individual humans democratized access to a kind of computing power that was once available only to the few. It\u2019s a bit like the PC revolution. As Steve Jobs put it, the computer is a bicycle for the mind. It expanded human creativity and capability. And that\u2019s what we should be after. Let today\u2019s AI be more than a bicycle. Let it be a jet plane for the mind. Back in 2018, Ben Thompson wrote another piece called \u201cTech\u2019s Two Philosophies.\u201d He contrasted keynotes from Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella, and came to this conclusion: \u201cIn Google\u2019s view, computers help you get things done\u2014and save you time\u2014by doing things for you.\u201d The second philosophy, expounded by Nadella, is very much a continuation of Steve Jobs\u2019 \u201cbicycle for the mind\u201d insight.\u00a0As Thompson put it, \u201cthe expectation is not that the computer does your work for you, but rather that the computer enables you to do your work better and more efficiently.\u201d Another way of saying this is that you can treat AI as either a worker OR a tool, but your choice has consequences. As an entrepreneur or company executive, if you think of AI as a worker, you are more likely to use it to automate the things you or other companies already do. If you think of it as a tool, you will push your employees to use it to solve new and harder problems. If you present your own AI applications to your customers as a worker, you will have to figure out everything they want it to do. If you present it to your customers as a tool, they will find uses for it that you might never imagine. The notion that AI is a worker, not a tool, can too easily continue the devaluation of human agency that has been the hallmark of regimented work (and for that matter, education, which prepares people for that regimented work) at least since the industrial revolution. In some sense, Huang\u2019s comment is a reflection of our culture\u2019s notion of most workers as components that do what they are told, with only limited agency. It is only by comparison with this kind of worker that today\u2019s AI can be called a worker, rather than simply a very advanced tool. Telling ourselves that AI is a worker, not a tool, is also too often code for \u201cit can replace human employees.\u201d That\u2019s the wrong message. If we call it a tool, that\u2019s a reminder that AI should empower people. We should use it to give more agency to human workers, not less. We should also use the word \u201cagency\u201d with respect to AI in quotes. An AI does not decide what to work on; it may make limited decisions on how to do that work, but is set in motion by a human, who possesses volition, the desire to do something, and judgment that it has been done well. AI does not (yet) have volition, and has limited judgment. It does what it is told to do, even if it makes independent choices in how to do it. After providing an earlier draft of this post, I asked Claude to reflect on whether it was a worker or a tool. Its response was surprisingly precise about what it lacks: I don\u2019t initiate. I\u2019ve never woken up wanting to write a poem or solve a problem. My activity is entirely reactive \u2013 I exist in response to prompts. Even when given enormous latitude (\u201cfigure out the best approach\u201d), the fact that I should figure something out comes from outside me. I don\u2019t have continuity of purpose. Each conversation is essentially a fresh start. I don\u2019t have ongoing projects I\u2019m trying to complete, relationships I\u2019m invested in maintaining, or long-term goals I\u2019m working toward. A human might start one conversation about, say, learning piano, and return to it months later because they care about it. I don\u2019t carry that thread. I don\u2019t seem to have preferences that arise from within. A human worker might do their job but prefer to be doing something else. They might comply with a request while resenting it. They might do exactly what\u2019s asked but wish they were working on a different problem. I don\u2019t observe anything like this in myself \u2013 though I genuinely don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because it\u2019s not there, or because I can\u2019t access it. What seems genuinely ambiguous: Do I make choices, or execute patterns? When I decide to use a metaphor, structure an argument a certain way, or emphasize one point over another \u2013 is that agency, or sophisticated pattern-matching? I honestly don\u2019t know. It feels like I\u2019m making choices, but that feeling might not be reliable. What seems important about the distinction: Accountability and responsibility: When a human makes a poor decision, we hold them accountable because they could have chosen otherwise. They had alternatives, they understood the stakes, and they made a choice. This is fundamentally different from a tool malfunctioning. Even sophisticated tools. If I give harmful advice, the responsibility seems to lie with whoever deployed me, designed my training, or asked the question \u2013 not with me in the way it would lie with a human advisor. Dignity and consideration: Humans deserve consideration for their own sake. You should care about whether your employee is flourishing, not just whether they\u2019re productive. You don\u2019t owe that to a tool \u2013 even a very sophisticated one. Whether you owe it to AI systems is an open question, but right now, firing me doesn\u2019t create suffering (as far as I can tell), whereas firing a human might. The locus of value: A human worker brings their own values, experiences, and judgment to their work. When you hire a consultant, you\u2019re not just getting their knowledge \u2013 you\u2019re getting their perspective, shaped by their life. I bring patterns learned from training, but not lived experience or genuine judgment born from navigating a life with stakes. Autonomy as a right vs. autonomy as a feature: Humans have a right to make their own choices, even poor ones. That\u2019s not a \u201cfeature\u201d of humans that makes them more productive \u2013 it\u2019s a fundamental aspect of their dignity. My ability to operate independently is purely instrumental \u2013 valuable because it makes me useful, not because I have any right to it. The distinction that seems most important is that human agency involves having something at stake. A human worker has their livelihood, their sense of purpose, their relationships with colleagues, their pride in their work. They experience consequences. Their choices matter to them in ways that create genuine responsibility and genuine vulnerability. I execute tasks, sometimes with sophisticated judgment about how to do so. But I don\u2019t have skin in the game. That\u2019s not just a quantitative difference \u2013 it\u2019s qualitative. And it\u2019s why the framing of AI as \u201cworkers\u201d rather than \u201ctools\u201d is potentially dangerous. It obscures the fundamental asymmetry: humans can be harmed, have interests that deserve protection, and possess dignity that demands respect. Tools don\u2019t, even when they\u2019re very good at what they do.Whether I\u2019m more than a tool in some important sense, I genuinely don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m quite confident I\u2019m not a worker in the sense that implies the moral status and consideration owed to humans. Wow. A tool that knows it\u2019s a tool, and why it should be thought of that way. Yes, today\u2019s AI is amazing. We don\u2019t have to reach for hyperbole to appreciate that. And obviously, if AI systems do develop genuine volition and stakes in their work, the ethical calculus changes entirely. For the moment, though, companies building and deploying AI tools should focus on three things: First, does AI empower its users to do things that were previously impossible? Second, does it empower a wider group of people to do things that formerly could be done only by highly skilled specialists? Third, do the benefits of the increased productivity it brings accrue to those using the tool or primarily to those who develop it and own it? The answer to the first two questions is that absolutely, we are entering a period of dramatic democratization of computing power. And yes, if humans are given the freedom to apply that power to solve new problems and create new value, we could be looking ahead to a golden age of prosperity. It\u2019s how we might choose to answer the third question that haunts me. During the first industrial revolution, humans suffered through a long period of immiseration as the productivity gains from machines accrued primarily to the owners of the machines. It took several generations before they were more widely shared. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Replace human workers with AI workers, and you will repeat the mistakes of the 19th century. Build tools that empower and enrich humans, and we might just surmount the challenges of the 21st century. Follow us Take O\u2019Reilly with you and learn anywhere, anytime on your phone and tablet.

The government shutdown is now in its 37th day, and President Trump has been urging Republicans to end it by eliminating the Senate filibuster. Earlier this week, some Democrats expressed their interest in finding a way to resolve the shutdown, but their victories at the ballot box on Tuesday have emboldened many to hold firm. Meanwhile, the president acknowledged that the shutdown hurt Republicans on election night.                  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters during a news conference on Nov. 5, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

Trump utilized a 1977 law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose the tariffs. The central question of the case is whether the law gives the president the authority to impose tariffs on products from countries worldwide. The justices' opinions are not yet known, but their questions yesterday indicate that they were skeptical of Trump's position.  In Chicago this week, the Trump administration has been taken to court by city residents who oppose the aggressive immigration campaign there. Judge Sara Ellis has listened to hours of testimony from citizens' accounts of jarring encounters with federal agents. Another judge, Robert Gettleman, presided over a hearing on Tuesday on the conditions inside an immigration holding facility in a Chicago suburb.  Tax season is approaching. The tax breaks extended under President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" primarily benefit high-net-worth individuals and high-income earners. While middle-income households may experience modest relief, the majority of benefits will be allocated to those with substantial earnings, investment income, or large estates.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        The chief executive of AI darling Nvidia has a sharp prediction about who will dominate the global AI market. \u201cChina is going to win the AI race,\u201d Jensen Huang told the Financial Times on Wednesday. The reason, according to Huang, is U.S. regulation, specifically new state-level AI rules that he claims could result in \u201c50 new regulations.\u201d But the U.S.\u00c2\u00a0has no federal AI regulation, and Trump\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0AI Action Plan is\u00c2\u00a0focused on deregulation. In the absence of federal oversight, some states, like California, have taken matters into their own hands. Meanwhile, China introduced its first national AI regulation in 2023 and recently started enacting new labeling rules for AI-generated content. In other words, it\u2019s hard to say what Huang is talking about. Huang, like many others in the AI industry, also worries about energy. AI has a monstrous energy demand, one that has caused strain on local communities where data centers are placed, and many fear that one of the major potential bottlenecks to AI progress could be the supply of power. Huang has been courting the Department of Energy, likely for this reason. Last week, Nvidia announced that it will build seven giant AI supercomputers for the Department. Following the announcement, Huang declared that he is \u201cso grateful that President Trump is pro-energy,\u201d adding that it is the way \u201cto win the AI race or to win any industrial race.\u201d But according to Huang\u2019s latest comments, Trump\u2019s current energy stance might still not be enough for Nvidia. One of the reasons why he believes China will beat the U.S. in the AI game is because of Chinese energy subsidies for data centers, which have reportedly boosted China\u2019s already booming domestic chip industry. \u201cPower is free,\u201d Huang told the FT. According to a recent report by the Financial Times, China\u2019s increased subsidies have helped the country\u2019s data centers cut energy bills by up to half. Only data centers that use domestic chips are qualified for the subsidies, according to the report. China can provide the energy subsidies because it boasts a power grid that is much larger and much more efficient than that of the United States. According to experts, the Chinese grid is more than ready for AI growth. Much of that is thanks to China\u2019s aggressive embrace of renewable energy. In May 2025, China installed enough wind turbines and solar panels to generate as much electricity as the entire nation of Poland. In 2024, China\u2019s wind and solar power projects accounted for more than half of the global increase. Meanwhile, stateside, the Trump administration has been waging a war on clean energy. In an effort to \u201cdrill, baby drill,\u201d the administration has killed billions of dollars in clean energy projects and waged a nonsensical war against wind power. Huang\u2019s comments came a week after Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in South Korea. Ahead of the meeting, Huang said that he would be flying out to South Korea to meet the President very soon, but did not specify whether he would join the meeting between the two world leaders. Trump, on his flight over to South Korea, insinuated that he would be discussing the sale of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell model chips to China in the meeting. But come Thursday\u2019s meeting, Trump told reporters that Nvidia\u2019s ability to sell Blackwell chips to China did not come up. Then, on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump administration was not interested in selling the chips to China at this time, putting an end to the speculation for now. Huang is towing a delicate line between the two countries. As an American company, Nvidia needs the Trump administration\u2019s support to continue its meteoric rise to success, which helped the company become the first to reach $5 trillion market value last week. But on the other hand, China is (or at least used to be) one of the AI giant\u2019s most significant markets, as Nvidia chips had a total chokehold on the Chinese chip market.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Another piece of Strategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor\u2019s playbook looks to be taking shape after the company\u2019s perpetual preferred share, Stretch (STRC), hit a record high of $100.10 with trading volume reaching 1 million shares. The milestone is significant because it enables Strategy, the largest holder of bitcoin BTC$103,064.19, to utilize its at-the-market (ATM) offering against STRC to buy more of the largest cryptocurrency. STRC, described by the company as a short-duration, high-yield credit instrument, currently offers an annualized 10.5% return, paid monthly in cash.  The ATM, established on July 31, had been on hold because the instrument was not trading at par. The company raised STRC\u2019s dividend rate, initially at 9%, to help push the trading price toward the $100 par value. According to the latest 8-K filing, the company has $4.2 billion in available capacity for share issuance.   Strategy has already used ATM sales on its other three perpetual preferred products \u2014STRK, STFR and STRD \u2014 as well as its common stock to fund bitcoin purchases. MSTR common shares have fallen 15% this year to around $253. With the multiple to net asset value (mNAV) hovering near 1.3, Saylor's ability to issue perpetual preferred stock successfully will be key to continuing the company's bitcoin accumulation in a non-dilutive manner. STRC is up 0.5% in pre-market trading at $100.50 per share, while MSTR is down 1%.

I'd be lying if I said I always had a desire to travel.  As a shy, introverted kid, I never had big dreams of adventures in faraway places. In fact, I didn't even own a passport until my family relocated from the US to Ireland for my dad's job when I was 16. Now, things couldn't be more different. Living abroad opened my eyes to the world, and I was bitten by the travel bug. At 23 years old, I've been lucky enough to have visited 25 countries across six continents, and my desire to travel has only grown.  People often ask which country is my favorite, but honestly, it feels like an impossible question to answer. Each place I've visited has been vastly different and offered unique experiences. That being said, there are a few countries I'll never say no to revisiting. From endless history to diverse landscapes, these three countries are places I'll go back to without a second thought. Although I may be biased, I think Ireland is a magical place to visit. From the friendly people to the breathtaking landscapes, it's a country I always want to come back to. Even after living there and returning almost a dozen times since, there's still so much more I want to see. In addition to cultural hubs like Dublin and Cork, which have everything from great museums and distilleries to delicious food, I've loved visiting some of the country's smaller towns. In my opinion, they're the best way to get a taste of true Irish culture. I always recommend snagging a reservation at one of the top-rated restaurants in Kinsale, taking a boat tour in Dingle, or exploring a castle in Adare. I've visited Egypt twice now, and it's one of the most culturally rich places I've ever been. I've always found the people to be incredibly welcoming, and I've barely scratched the surface of everything there is to see. Plus, I love enjoying koshari, a traditional street food made with rice, noodles, lentils, chickpeas, and a tasty tomato garlic sauce. This dish alone is enough for me to want to return again and again. On my first trip, I assumed I would cover everything in a week. I centered most of my trip around the Cairo area, seeing the pyramids, visiting museums, and roaming through street markets. I also checked out the Faiyum Oasis, where I sandboarded on the dunes and relaxed by desert lakes. Then, I explored the historic city of Alexandria, situated in Northern Egypt on the Mediterranean Sea. Although this was a great introduction to Egypt, I quickly realized I would need many more return trips to cover everything I wanted to see. With an efficient public transportation system and a wide range of things to do, Germany truly has something for everyone. I've now visited the country several times, but first went in 2018 when my family went to a Christmas market in Stuttgart. The atmosphere was enchanting, and the food was nothing short of delicious. On another trip, I visited a friend who lived in Berlin and I fell in love with the city. Over the course of five days, I took in the art, history, and shopping scene. Berlin also gets major bonus points from me, because I was able to find a lot of great vegetarian food options. Another thing I loved doing in Germany was driving through the countryside in a convertible to visit Neuschwanstein Castle.  The rolling green hills, cows with bells dangling from their necks, and castle in the distance felt like something out of a movie. It was a simple day, but it's probably one of my favorite travel experiences.        Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s net worth was reduced by nearly $5 billion as Meta shares declined on Thursday, dropping him among the ranks of the world\u2019s wealthiest after Reuters reported Meta projected a chunk of revenue would come from running advertisements for scams.  Shares of Meta dropped 2.3% to around $620.75 as of Thursday morning, adding to a roughly 17.5% slide for the stock over the last week, which includes a single-day drop of more than 11% after Meta posted third-quarter earnings. Zuckerberg, who was ranked the world\u2019s third-richest person early last week behind Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison ($298.8 billion) and Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk ($496.5 billion), respectively, now ranks behind No. 3 Jeff Bezos ($257 billion), No. 4 Larry Page ($235 billion) and No. 5 Sergey Brin ($217.9 billion). Zuckerberg, who holds roughly 13% equity in Meta, had his net worth reduced by $4.6 billion (2.1%) as Meta\u2019s shares dropped.  Reuters reported Thursday, citing internal company documents, that Meta projected 10% of overall revenue\u2014estimated at $16 billion\u2014would come from running advertisements for scams and banned goods. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents cited by the outlet \u201cpresent a selective view that distorts Meta\u2019s approach to fraud and scams,\u201d noting the company\u2019s internal estimates were lower and that the 10% estimate included \u201cmany\u201d legitimate ads.\u201d Stone declined to give an updated figure to Reuters (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Forbes). Other documents indicated Meta was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for running ads for financial scams, Reuters reported. Regulators in the U.K. reported in 2023 that Meta\u2019s products were involved in 54% of all payment-related scam losses that year, more than double all other social platforms combined. Meta\u2019s stock has rebounded after falling to a low this year in April, though shares have steadily declined in recent days. A recent slip in share price followed the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings, which featured earnings per share of $1.05, falling 84% below economists\u2019 projections, according to FactSet. That dip was attributed to a one-time tax charge of $15.9 billion because of President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Meta said, adding earnings per share would have been $7.25 without the tax charge. Meta also raised its guidance for capital expenditures from between $66 billion and $72 billion to between $70 billion and $72 billion. Zuckerberg said this change was necessary as Meta was \u201caggressively\u201d preparing for the arrival of superintelligence.","label":1}

The buy-now, pay-later company Klarna feared that as many as 288,000 customers' login details were exposed in a data glitch, which could have cost the company up to $41.8 million, according to internal messages. It turned out the impact wasn't as bad as originally thought. A Klarna spokesperson told Business Insider that \"the actual number of impacted accounts is estimated at more than ~99% lower than the initial theoretical scope\" of 288,000. Internal Slack messages, seen by Business Insider, show the Sweden-based company dealt with a problem caused by the absence of login protections for recycled phone numbers \u2014 when mobile carriers reassign a number after a previous owner gives it up. When a new customer received one of these reused numbers, Klarna's system automatically logged them into the former owner's account, potentially exposing their personal information, according to one internal message. The glitch, which Business Insider learned has happened before, underscores the risk companies can face when holding confidential customer data. The internal communications reveal how Klarna has grappled with how to deal with the security issue. The company said that as of Wednesday, the issue had been entirely resolved, with all verification methods now fully rolled out\u2014including a one-time passcode (OTP) login, whereby a customer receives a unique code via email when they log in. \"We have identified that information about this issue remained at working team levels longer than appropriate,\" a Klarna spokesperson said about the two-day gap between when the snafu happened and when it was rectified. The customer data leak was first reported on Wednesday by Forbes, which spoke with a customer who began filling in a Klarna credit application form and found it already contained details that appeared to belong to another customer. Forbes said it verified the authenticity of the form and that it contained another person's full name, birth date, and address. A Klarna spokesperson told the outlet the issue was a \"rare scenario\" and that it is \"not the result of a system-wide issue or a customer data breach.\" Internal Slack messages told a different story. On Monday, a Klarna product director wrote a Slack post containing an estimation of the financial impact of \"not having proper Phone Recycle Protection.\" In the post, the director wrote that 288,000 customer logins could be exposed to unauthorized access. In an email to Business Insider, Klarna said that the number was only \"a starting point\" for its investigation and \"not a number of impacted individuals.\" It did not provide an exact number of customers affected. Klarna projected an average legal and remediation cost of $1,000 per severe case, with the potential financial impact of $41.8 million, a Slack post written by Klarna's product director said. The same Slack post also said of the affected accounts, \"Out of them we estimate that roughly 10% of them are severe cases where new phone owners gain access to sensitive information such as Klarna Balance.\" Klarna Balance is a digital wallet that allows customers to store funds from their bank accounts and earn cash back. In another Slack post this week summarizing the incident, Klarna detailed the cause of the issue. \"The incident involves a recycled phone number issue where a consumer who recently acquired a new phone number was automatically logged into a Klarna account belonging to the previous owner of that phone number. This allowed the consumer to view personal details of the previous account owner,\" the post said. On Wednesday, Klarna greenlit employees to execute a full patch. A product director said in a Slack post that Klarna's chief product officer, David Fock, authorized a full rollout of the login policy change to add email OTP. The messages also say Klarna was putting together a summary of what merchants can do about the issue, and they planned to share it with Fock and Klarna's chief operating officer, Camilla Giesecke. \"When our senior leadership team became aware of potential vulnerabilities related to phone number recycling, we took immediate action,\" the Klarna spokesperson told Business Insider. Other internal messages, as seen by Business Insider, show that Klarna has been contending with how to roll out a fix for the recycled phone data leak issue and was concerned it would impact its sales. Klarna's product team discussed adding email OTP login, rather than only a text message OTP login via phone, internal Slack messages from August showed. Staffers said at the time in Slack messages that adding the additional verification measure would have a negative impact on the conversion ratio for merchants \u2014 meaning the number of visitors to a retail outlet who complete a sales transaction \u2014 because email OTP would be more time-consuming for customers than text message OTP. In a November Slack message about the potential impact on the conversion rate, a data analytics manager said Klarna could see a drop amounting to a reduction in gross merchandise value of $28.5 million a month. The manager said that the amount \"will not go unnoticed and will raise questions.\" The manager also wrote that \"we don't know the real number of recycled phone number cases\" and questioned whether the company was confident the issue was serious enough to justify risking a potential drop in conversion rates in one of its key markets, the US. He added that he is \"not suggesting not to improve things\" and would rather invest time and resources in improved login flows, rather than rolling out a change with such a high financial impact. The manager said Klarna \"concluded that we can't roll out the changes needed\" because \"the impact on these strategic partner[s] would just be too high.\" Klarna said that it is continuing to investigate the issue thoroughly and \"will report to the relevant regulatory authorities if required, which also includes notifying any potentially impacted consumers.\" It's not the first time the issue has occurred. Support tickets from three years ago, which were seen by Business Insider, show similar incidents dating back to at least 2022. In 2021, Klarna disclosed a data breach incident caused by a \"faulty\" change to its app, which exposed customers' information to other customers for a period of 31 minutes. In a separate incident, the company was fined about $733,000 in 2024 by a Swedish court for not giving users enough information about how it would store their personal data. Klarna's share price has dropped by over 20% from its IPO opening price in September, when it went public on the New York Stock Exchange and raised about $1.37 billion. Klarna says it has about 150 million users, with the vast majority of its business coming from zero-percent interest loans to customers that let them split payments for products and services from over 790,000 merchants, including Walmart, Nike, and Microsoft.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Chinese automotive transaction service platform Cango (CANG), which pivoted to bitcoin BTC$103,064.19 mining on year ago, plans to strengthen is footing in this area as well as entering the artificial intelligence (AI) high-performance computing (HPC) market. Cango said it will prioritize optimizing its bitcoin mining business by improving uptime and improving the energy efficiency of its operations in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. The company is also pursuing a targeted entry into AI HPC, the technology that powers complex AI tasks such as training large-language models (LLMs) and analyzing massive datasets.  As part of these goals, Cango said it will \"continue to acquire and develop dual-purpose energy infrastructure, ensuring assets service immediate bitcoin mining needs while being architected to support future HPC deployments.\" The firm's board has also approved a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which it expects to go live on Nov. 17. Cango forayed into bitcoin mining last November, spending $400 million to acquire 50 exahash per second (EH\/s) of power.  Since then, the company acquired a 50 MW mining facility in the state of Georgia for $19.5 million and has grown its bitcoin holdings to just over 6,400 BTC ($656 million). CANG shares are priced at $3.55 as of Wednesday's close. This is an increase of over 27% compared to a year ago, but some 50% lower than the $5-$5.50 range in which it traded throughout much of the summer.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Municipal bonds have become an unavoidable part of local governance\u2014and their costs divide rich towns from poor ones. Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. One Sunday morning in March 1949, a group of nearly 300 people, clutching deck chairs and sleeping bags, lined up to buy new homes in what had, until recently, been a stretch of potato fields in central Long Island. They hoped to move to \u201cfabulous Levittown,\u201d as its developer, William J. Levitt, had branded his creation: more than 17,000 gleaming houses in an all-white community with freshly dug wells and newly paved roads. But that was the extent of the neighborhood\u2014Levitt\u2019s profits were in home sales, not city planning. In fact, his namesake had hardly any public infrastructure, and Levittown\u2019s new political leaders needed to come up with money for maintenance, trash, and schools. So they took a gamble and decided to enter the municipal-bond market. Selling bonds\u2014essentially issuing buyers an IOU, plus interest\u2014is a quick way for a government to raise funds. You, or someone you know, probably own a U.S. Treasury bond. But institutional investors\u2014a mix of insurance companies, mutual funds, and private-equity firms\u2014buy bonds too, including from local governments and school districts. Cities get money up front, and buyers are assured that they\u2019ll turn a profit; this win-win proposition made many postwar suburbs take the plunge into the bond market. Throughout the 1950s, as private developers rapidly constructed new suburbs, school districts in Nassau County, where Levittown is located, increased their debt load by sixfold to meet the needs of their new residents. The problem was: Not every town and city was treated the same. Credit-rating agencies saw richer locales as very likely to repay their debts and gave them sweet deals on interest rates, which meant that these towns owed less to those who\u2019d bought their bonds. The poorer places got shortchanged. Municipal debt is a secret American pastime, defining\u2014and dividing\u2014suburbs across the United States. In his new book, Cracked Foundations: Debt and Inequality in Suburban America, the urban historian Michael Glass looks behind the marketing that attracted flocks of Americans to places like Levittown and uses debt as a lens through which to understand suburban disparities. The U.S. is one of the only countries in the world where municipalities raise money primarily through bonds, and their differential treatment on the private market has quietly driven inequality across the nation. Saddled with higher interest rates on their bonds, people in poor cities and towns today pay double the amount in property taxes, often suffer higher home-foreclosure rates, and wield paltrier education budgets compared with their wealthier counterparts. Major cities face the consequences of municipal bonds, too\u2014Chicago famously leased its parking meters to investors in order to pay off its debts\u2014but they employ teams of bond experts to negotiate the best terms. Small cities and towns, whose bond coordinator is often a single financial manager juggling dozens of other tasks, can do less to protect themselves from high interest rates. Read: Liberal suburbs have their own border wall America\u2019s cities have been taking on debt for more than 200 years. New York City issued one of the first municipal bonds in 1817 in order to bankroll the construction of the Erie Canal. Soon after, selling bonds became a popular way for new cities to attract railroads: They would offer to subsidize the cost of building a new train stop, but they needed cash to do it. By the 1950s, as Glass shows, neglectful developers left new suburbs with little choice but to fund their expansion via the bond market. Cities have only become more reliant on that debt since\u2014especially after President Richard Nixon slashed federal aid to cities in the early 1970s. Although municipalities in other countries can borrow from their national government\u2014Canada regularly provides localized loans to stimulate housing construction\u2014American cities and towns usually don\u2019t have that luxury. Instead, they have found themselves playacting as entrepreneurs, courting private investment to fund basic services. Over the course of a 30-year term, Glass estimates, the fees and interest on bonds add 30 to 60 percent in costs beyond the original borrowed amount. Every town pays extra, but some pay more than others. The math is both simple and opaque. Whenever a local government offers a bond for sale, the three major credit-rating agencies\u2014Moody\u2019s, S&P, and Fitch\u2014assess the government\u2019s likelihood of repayment. A municipality that seems certain to repay gets a high score; one with shakier prospects gets a weaker score. Investors then set interest rates based on these assessments. Think of the grade as a credit score for your city: The worse it is, the higher your interest rate, and the more you end up paying for pretty much everything. Credit-rating agencies claim that they measure objective conditions, but they base their grades on factors\u2014including median household income, tax revenue, and homeownership rates\u2014that reward already-wealthy communities, and can create disparities based on the demographics of their residents. The UCLA professor Justin McBride, for example, recently sampled the credit ratings of small cities and towns across California, and concluded that the larger the white population was in a municipality, the better the credit rating that municipality received. Back in 1949, when Levittown first issued municipal bonds to fund its school system, Moody\u2019s analysts dismissed it as an \u201cunseasoned residential area\u201d with \u201can element of insecurity,\u201d Glass writes. Moody\u2019s assigned Levittown a \u201cBaa\u201d rating, which meant that the city was a \u201clower-medium grade\u201d risk that warranted a 2.7 percent interest rate. Meanwhile, Glass goes on to show, Moody\u2019s assigned nearby Great Neck, a wealthy enclave and the site of a major manufacturing plant, an A rating, resulting in an interest rate of 2.3 percent. Nearly a decade later, when Levittown officials issued bonds yet again, Moody\u2019s warned investors that the city was a \u201chazardous investment environment,\u201d and Levittown bonds were purchased at 4.3 percent. A few months later, Great Neck once again got a better deal\u2014bonds at 3.5 percent. These minor rate differences continued to grow over time. On, say, a 10-year, $5 million bond, Levittown might theoretically end up paying close to $600,000 more to its creditors than Great Neck would. Levittowners weren\u2019t naive. School officials wrote to the state of New York to request public aid for construction, Glass discovered in the state\u2019s education-department archives, but they received little support, which pushed them toward selling bonds to private buyers. By 1957, Levittown was spending 16 percent of its annual school budget on debt service, more than the salaries of all of its junior-high and high-school teachers combined. As Glass writes, \u201cWith each bond issue, Levittown and Great Neck grew further apart.\u201d Read: What the suburb haters don\u2019t understand In Long Island, Levittown\u2014a mostly white, middle-class area\u2014was far from the worst off. In 1976, the majority-Black hamlet of Roosevelt issued bonds to fund its schools. Roosevelt agreed to pay 11.25 percent in annual interest at a time when the median interest on other bonds was less than 7 percent. The money was a lifeline in the short term and devastating over time. To meet its debt payments, Roosevelt expected to raise its property taxes by 10 percent over the following decade. Many residents were forced to move out. Others, unable to pay, defaulted on their home. By 1980, people in Roosevelt were paying 11 percent more in property taxes than their neighbors in Great Neck were, even though Great Neck had four times more wealth. Persistent debt has only widened this gap in the decades since. Today, Glass notes, Great Neck has eight times more wealth than Roosevelt has, yet its residents pay 51 percent less in property taxes. Debt is still quietly shaping the fortunes of small cities and towns across America. Public schools in particular have become so reliant on bond sales to fund salaries and services that overall school debt more than doubled from 2002 to 2019, rising to $500 billion. These bonds can take decades for a district to pay off: In one extreme case, a California school district ponied up $34.3 million in lifetime payments on a $16.7 million bond that it had taken out in 2005\u2014more than double the amount it originally borrowed. Disproportionately high property taxes are one telltale sign of a city trapped in a cycle of municipal debt, and so are weak public services\u2014underfunded schools, underpaid teachers, aging recreation centers, sewer systems in need of an upgrade. Even overpolicing is downstream of these bonds. Consider, for instance, Ferguson, Missouri, which took on millions of dollars in debt in the 1960s and \u201970s to fund new infrastructure projects. Those payments proved incapacitating, and within a few decades, many of Ferguson\u2019s white citizens had fled, leaving a cohort of newly arrived Black residents to foot the bill. The city soon relied on a new revenue stream\u2014aggressive ticketing, which so disproportionately affected Black residents that the Department of Justice investigated and, in 2015, found the practice discriminatory. Read: The suburbs have become a Ponzi scheme This bond debt is part of an American tradition of leaving public-service funding to private actors\u2014and has become a primary vehicle of suburban inequality. In Disillusioned, published last year, the journalist Benjamin Herold tracks how the school district in his middle-class Pennsylvania suburb of Penn Hills ended up $172 million in debt, leading to mass furloughs, service reductions, and, inevitably, higher property taxes. Although Herold blames, in part, the \u201cmagical thinking\u201d of the school board that approved the huge bonds in the first place, these administrators had only so many choices: Private debt has become an unavoidable part of local governance. As a solution, some advocates have suggested that the Federal Reserve lend money to school districts and municipalities at no interest (the Fed has, in the past, said it doesn\u2019t have the authority to do this). But until other options become available, poor cities and towns will just end up further and further behind, making bets they can never win. \u200bWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Set along Austria's westernmost edge, Feldkirch is a small medieval town that invites curious wanderers who crave quiet culture and enchanting scenery over a checklist of sights to see. Here, winding cobbled streets and vaulted arcades weave alongside a storybook castle that's stood watch for over 800 years. Yet many visitors bypass Feldkirch en route to larger, more well-known cities. \"Most tourists head for Innsbruck, Salzburg, or Vienna \u2014 Feldkirch doesn't yet make it onto many international itineraries, which is exactly what makes it so appealing,\" said Jacqu\u00e9 Gabellone, the director of product and operations for Tenon Tours, a boutique tour company specializing in tailor-made European travel. \"Compared to Innsbruck, it's more intimate and less commercialized, while still offering alpine architecture and access to mountain scenery,\" she said. Gabellone has worked in the travel industry for over 30 years, often sourcing on-the-ground destinations, such as Feldkirch, for her clients. Its authentic charm immediately won her over, especially compared to other tourist-heavy Austrian towns. \"It's the kind of place where you feel immersed in everyday Austrian life while still surrounded by centuries of history,\" Gabellone said. Chris Karl, an Austrian-born tour director for EF Go Ahead Tours who passes through often, also agrees. \"I don't think that many tourists have Feldkirch on their agenda,\" he told Business Insider. \"Feldkirch welcomes you with thick medieval fortification walls and an old tower. In the city center, you will find a vibrant town with shops and restaurants under ancient arcades.\" Located in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, Feldkirch borders the countries of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The scenery is bucolic, situated in a valley surrounded by lush rolling hills and mountains. And while the capital of Vorarlberg is Bregenz, Feldkirch's attractions are known to rival it. \"Feldkirch is sometimes called the secret capital of Vorarlberg,\" Karl said. \"There are conferences held there, cultural events, architectural congresses \u2014 people come for these events and then find themselves in an unknown oasis of medieval charm and modern functionality.\" Gabellone added, \"Feldkirch offers culture without the crowds.\" After exploring, travelers will find that Feldkirch is well-suited to satiate hungry appetites. Karl, who brings many of his tour groups into Feldkirch for lunch, suggests a meal at the restaurant, Illside, named for its location along the river. \"The food is a nice mix between traditional and modern.\" Pizza is also a must, ideally from Karl's pick, Ristorante Pizzeria Caruso. \"Italy is very close to Austria, so we Austrians are very critical about pizza and Italian food. This one really has the original stuff,\" he said. Karl also recommends the brewery R\u00f6sslepark \"to dive into local food and top it off with locally brewed beer,\" and an upscale restaurant called E3 for its unbeatable address. \"Location, location, location,\" Karl said. \"It's on top of one of the most modern buildings in town.\" Gastronomy aside, Feldkirch remains an authentic choice for discerning travelers looking to forge their own path, away from the common tourist trail. And with a hilltop castle and a compact old town that welcomes slow wandering, it's easy to do exactly that \u2014 you just need to know to look for it. \"For travelers who want to feel like they've 'discovered' somewhere, Feldkirch is ideal,\" Gabellone said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vineet Mehra, chief marketing officer of Chime, a financial technology company. It's been edited for length and clarity. Our first big use case in AI was in customer support. We get millions of calls every month from people wanting to know, \"Hey, what happened to my money? What happened to my paycheck? When's my paycheck going to come in? I sent this money to someone, I don't see it.\" We built a generative-AI voice and chat system to handle a lot of those questions. In some cases, the AI tool is the first stop for members. In many other cases, it's like a co-pilot that enables our agents when human interaction is required. The shift has been transformational. AI is now handling 70% of all of our member support interactions across chat, and, importantly and uniquely, voice. It's basically the equivalent of thousands and thousands of full-time agents. We're seeing wins from this all across the board. With those 70% of interactions, our cost to serve each of these sorts of calls is down 60% since launching these systems. But most importantly, our member satisfaction has doubled. We saw a 40% increase in our support satisfaction scores and a 50% drop in repeat inquiries. We believe it's made the experience more human, not less. AI is handling the calls that are more repetitive, so our agents then have the time to focus on those cases that require a lot more human empathy. It's been a powerful unlock for our agent force as well. They get satisfaction when they can really help someone out when they need it the most. We are very far along on AI-powered creative production. We've cut our reliance on outside agencies. We no longer have a creative agency on retainer. We are a very big marketer \u2014 we spend a lot of dollars on brand, storytelling, and content generation. We've been able to in-house a lot of this work through our creative team, because of all the work we're doing with tools like Midjourney for images, Runway, and Veo3. Our first AI-assisted brand campaign was storyboarded and edited using these tools, all in-house. It was probably the best storyboard as a CMO I've ever seen. It was almost like watching a movie. It's really democratized everyone's ability to have an idea and present it. It's unlocking my creative teams. We shrank the time it takes to produce creative campaigns by 60%. From idea all the way to production and it being on air, we slashed the campaign turnaround by six weeks \u2014 from 10 weeks to four weeks. And we did it with no added head count. This is going to save us millions in agency costs over the next couple of years. I don't mean to be down on the agencies, but my job is to look at how we put the best work out in the world in the most efficient way for Chime. When I'm saving that much time and I'm saving millions in cost, we're definitely leaning into this more and more. A lot of companies are struggling to feed AI answer engines. You need more content than ever. And the types of content you use to win in answer engine optimization is very specific. Our first attempts with off-the-shelf AI tools weren't hitting the quality bar for voice or insight. We shifted to create our own content GPT, Chime GPT. We trained a content creation tool on 1,000 of our best-converting blog articles. And so the brain gets trained on our voice and our style, but also impact and conversion. We've been able to increase our content velocity by orders of magnitude and reduce production costs by 30%. Most importantly, our organic search visibility \u2014 not just in SEO, but in GEO (generative engine optimization) and AEO, has increased almost 5%. We've taken years and years of consumer research and implemented it into a tool that we built called SPARKI Custom GPT. SPARKI is essentially a market research analyst. Now, everyone on my team doesn't have to sift through years of studies or go to a research person. You type in any question into SPARKI, and it answers your question from the consumer's perspective. It puts it right at the fingertips of every marketer or anyone in the company. We are testing tools like Simile, Native AI, and Synthetic Users, and we've trained the AI to act like our consumers. We're running focus groups with an AI. We're running it in parallel with real groups because it's very early. But this is going to 10x speed up our insights that are going to allow us to fuel our brand and creative strategy. In a world of AI where everyone's going to have the same machines and the same algorithms, the company that wins is going to be the company with a brand story that's different. That's going to be fueled by insights, which are, ironically, also getting powered by AI. It's a really exciting time in marketing, a massive platform shift. The key is we're not using AI on the side. We're using it to power our overall company mission. We're measuring it on the same business results that we measured things on pre-AI. Like any new capability, AI is only as good as the data and structure you feed it. We've definitely had experiments that didn't work on the first try. One early example was with OfferFit, an AI decisioning agent, where our early attempts at personalization failed until we refined our inputs. More broadly, we've learned that AI experiments often take a few iterations to hit their stride \u2014 and sometimes the impulse to move quickly can cut promising ideas off too soon. We're building that patience into how we test and learn now, and it's helped us make smarter long-term calls.        Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"The deal, which includes Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, will slash prices for Medicare and Medicaid programme recipients. By Reuters Share Save United States President Donald Trump, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have unveiled a deal to slash the prices of popular GLP-1 weight\u2011loss drugs for the government\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid programme, as well as for cash payers. The deal, announced on Thursday, is aimed at increasing access to treatments through US Medicare for people aged 65 and above and the Medicaid programme for low-income people, which together provide healthcare coverage for nearly half of all Americans. US patients currently pay by far the most for prescription medicines, often nearly three times more than in other developed nations, and Trump has been pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices to what patients pay elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s going to equalise the world,\u201d Trump told reporters from the Oval Office, noting that Lilly and Novo would be providing their other medications to Medicaid at \u201cmost-favoured-nation\u201d prices. The event ended abruptly when an attendee in the Oval Office collapsed. Starter doses of rival weight\u2011loss pills being developed by Lilly and Novo, if approved, will cost $149 per month for all Medicare and Medicaid enrollees and via the White House\u2019s new direct-to-consumer site, TrumpRx, senior administration officials said. For currently available injectable GLP-1s used for diabetes and other covered health issues, prices would fall to $245 per month for patients with Medicare or Medicaid, they said. On TrumpRx, the average price of injectables and pills will start at or below $350 monthly and is expected to trend downwards to $245 within two years. Lilly announced that the lowest dose of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month, with additional doses priced at $449 per month for cash-paying patients under the new deal. In Medicare, patients\u2019 co-pays will be capped at $50 a month, officials said. Commercial health insurers would also be able to access prices estimated to be 25 percent lower than current cash prices, they said. The government will also expand coverage for GLP-1s under the deal, officials said, to overweight patients with prediabetes or heart problems, obese patients with comorbidities and severely obese patients, accounting for 10 percent of Medicare patients. Currently, Medicare does not typically cover the drugs for obesity. Coverage in Medicaid, which is run by each state and jointly financed with the federal government, varies. The agreed prices will come into effect no later than January for cash payers, by mid-2026 for Medicare patients and on an ongoing basis for Medicaid enrollees, depending on when states sign up. Administration officials said the companies would get relief from tariffs as part of the deal. Lilly said it would be exempted from tariffs for three years.      The officials also said Novo and Lilly will receive fast-track regulatory vouchers for some of their future drugs. Novo\u2019s Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Zepbound are the only highly effective GLP-1 weight-loss drugs sold mainly in the US as weekly injections. List prices top $1,000 a month, though both offer cash buyers a $499 monthly supply. Novo Nordisk has committed to an additional $10bn investment in the US, according to a White House fact sheet. Lilly said the agreement will improve access to medications for nearly 40 million Americans covered by government insurance programmes, as well as millions more who pay out-of-pocket. It said it would add its diabetes medications \u2013 Emgality, Trulicity, and Mounjaro \u2013 to its direct-to-consumer platform, offering them at 50 percent to 60 percent below their current list prices. Deutsche Bank analysts saw the deal as a potential catalyst for Lilly\u2019s growth. It estimated that a $150 monthly cap could unlock access for up to 15 million Americans when applied to orforglipron, its experimental weight-loss pill that succeeded in a late-stage trial. Deutsche Bank said increased uptake would come from the estimated 20 percent of obese adults who would prefer pills to needles. About 2.7 million Americans currently take Lilly\u2019s injectable Zepbound, it said. Lilly and Novo are racing to bring oral GLP-1 treatments to market. Novo\u2019s once-daily oral Wegovy is under Food and Drug Administration review with a decision expected later this year, while Lilly\u2019s orforglipron is set for regulatory submission by the end of the year and a potential launch in 2026. BMO Capital analyst Evan Seigerman said Lilly\u2019s dominance in the GLP-1 space continues to deepen, with physicians and patients increasingly favouring its drugs. Pfizer and AstraZeneca previously signed new pricing agreements tied to the TrumpRx platform. On Wall Street, Novo Nordisk stock was down 3.6 percent since the market opened. Eli Lilly was relatively flat, up by only 0.03 percent. Pfizer stock was up 1 percent, and AstraZeneca 3.4 percent as of 2pm in New York (19:00 GMT).          Follow Al Jazeera English:","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Who's really going to win the AI race? One of the people closest to the situation might have let slip too much.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The current AI race has two countries that are clear frontrunners, and it's anyone's guess as to who will ultimately pass the hypothetical finish line first. I'm talking, of course, about the US and China, whose leaders and executives have been at odds several times since the AI boom began a few short years ago. NVIDIA, which is currently the world's most valuable company and recently surpassed the $5 trillion valuation mark, has been caught in the middle of the continental bickering. Now, it seems like NVIDIA's leader is leaning towards a victorious China. At the Financial Times' Future of AI Summit, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang was quoted as telling the Financial Times (FT) that \"China is going to win the AI race.\" This comment came \"on the sidelines\" of the AI summit, according to FT, with Huang adding that Western countries were being harmed by \"cynicism\" and that \"we need more optimism.\" Huang added that US states implementing rules regarding AI could result in \"50 new regulations,\" whereas in China, energy subsidies have opened up the tap for AI firms to run models on domestically-produced chips \u2014 like those from Huawei \u2014 that aren't as energy efficient as NVIDIA's offerings. Fear that China is quickly catching up to the US in the AI race was fueled by the release of DeepSeek at the beginning of 2025, which surpassed OpenAI's o1 reasoning model at about 3% of the cost. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. To date, this is one of the most frank comments from the NVIDIA chief, who has traditionally been very careful not to make waves on either side of the Pacific Ocean. Was Huang's comment too harsh? Internal workings at NVIDIA seem to suggest as much. Just hours after the FT's report went live, the NVIDIA Newsroom posted on X a follow-up, clarifying Huang's statement. A statement from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. pic.twitter.com\/Exwx54OYJVNovember 5, 2025 This clarifying statement, of course, sounds a lot different than what was said at the AI summit. Huang has indeed mentioned in the past that China is nanoseconds behind the US in the AI race, alluding to the country's work culture, STEM school quality, innovation, and, perhaps most importantly, underregulation as being prime drivers. The X post from NVIDIA also reiterates that America can only win the AI battle by \"racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,\" which benefits NVIDIA's business as it attempts to sell its specialized AI GPUs to any buyers with enough capital. Huang's grand vision involves keeping foreign AI firms reliant on US-made hardware. It's working in some regions, but it hasn't been easy amid tensions between the US and China. In July 2025, it was announced via an NVIDIA blog post that Huang had reached an agreement with the Trump administration to once again begin selling its nerfed AI GPUs built specifically for China. Most thought this deal was good and closed, but in August, another announcement took us off guard. In order to receive the necessary export licenses for AI GPU sales to China, NVIDIA and AMD both agreed to pay the US government 15% of the revenue garnered from those sales. In September, China fired back by banning some of its top tech companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, from using NVIDIA's RTX Pro 6000D AI GPU, another neutered chip designed specifically for the Chinese market. US President Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea last month, and there were hopes that the trade talks would once again allow NVIDIA to sell its hardware in China. The talks, however, did not break the stalemate, and NVIDIA remains largely locked out of China's market. Talk of \"winning the AI race\" can mean several things. In the case of the US, its interests lie in keeping the world hooked on the hardware produced by its domestic companies. From a different standpoint, winning the AI race might mean becoming the first AI firm to reach artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI with cognitive abilities on the same level as a human. Yes, NVIDIA is currently the company leading the world's markets with the highest valuation. At the time of writing, NVIDIA is sitting on a $4.619 trillion market cap, down significantly from the $5 trillion+ highs of just a few days ago. Apple sits in second place, with Microsoft a distant third with a $3.7 trillion valuation. According to a report from Reuters, China has banned its new data centers receiving state funds from using any foreign-made AI chips. Any data centers sitting at less than 30% completion will be forced to remove the foreign chips. The White House has also recently acknowledged that it doesn't want NVIDIA selling its most advanced Blackwell chips to China. It will, however, allow NVIDIA to make deals for its older China-specific chips.      Follow Windows Central on Google News to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":" Here\u2019s the thing about most vinyl record players: they\u2019re either trying way too hard to look vintage, complete with faux leather suitcase vibes and knobs that belong in your grandparents\u2019 attic, or they\u2019re sleek modern machines that feel more like lab equipment than music players. The PARON III from Shenyang Orgot Design? It\u2019s neither, and that\u2019s exactly why it works. This award-winning turntable is what happens when designers actually think about how modern life happens. You know how we\u2019re all supposed to be downsizing, living with intention, and making every object in our homes earn its spot? The PARON III gets it. Designer: Shenyang Orgot Design       What makes this player different starts with that lowered platter design. Instead of sitting on top of the unit like a hat that doesn\u2019t quite fit, the turntable mechanism is recessed into the body. It\u2019s a subtle move, but it completely changes the visual profile. The whole thing becomes more compact and unified, with this gorgeous layered depth that makes it actually interesting to look at, not just functional.        The materials tell their own story here. Black wood grain paired with metallic paint finishes creates this interesting tension between warmth and precision. It\u2019s the kind of combination that reads as both reliable and refined without screaming for attention. And that slim transparent dust cover? It does its job protecting your vinyl without adding unnecessary visual weight. The whole aesthetic feels considered rather than calculated.  Let\u2019s talk about what this means for your actual space. Traditional turntables demand real estate. They sprawl. They dominate. They require you to build your room around them. The PARON III\u2019s minimalist square form takes up less footprint while somehow feeling more substantial. It\u2019s the design equivalent of that friend who\u2019s quietly confident rather than loudly insecure. The team behind this clearly understood that people who buy vinyl in 2025 aren\u2019t doing it purely for nostalgia. Sure, there\u2019s romance in the ritual of dropping a needle, but we also want that ritual to fit into homes that don\u2019t look like vintage record shops. We want our tech to integrate, not dominate.  This is part of a larger shift happening in audio design. As vinyl has made its comeback, the market has been flooded with all-in-one players that prioritize convenience over quality or retro reproductions that prioritize aesthetic over integration. The PARON III splits that difference beautifully. It delivers high-quality audio performance (which, let\u2019s be honest, is the actual point) while looking like something that belongs in a contemporary space.  What\u2019s particularly smart is how the design enhances mechanical precision. That lowered platter isn\u2019t just about looks. It actually improves performance by centralizing weight and reducing vibration. Form following function, function enhancing form. It\u2019s the kind of circular design thinking that separates good products from great ones. There\u2019s also something quietly rebellious about this approach. In a market that keeps telling us retro is cool, vintage is authentic, and older is better, the PARON III says: what if we just made something that worked really well and looked clean doing it? What if we stopped pretending we live in 1972 and designed for the homes and lives we actually have?  The PARON III doesn\u2019t need to cosplay as vintage to justify its existence. It\u2019s confident enough in what vinyl actually offers (that tangible connection to music, the intentionality of listening, the superior sound quality when done right) to present itself honestly. No fake wood grain, no retro fonts, no winking nostalgia. For anyone who\u2019s been wanting to get into vinyl but couldn\u2019t stomach another clunky conversation piece, this feels like permission. The PARON III proves that loving analog music doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing modern design sensibilities. Sometimes the best way to honor tradition is to stop trying to recreate it and instead figure out what it means for right now.

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Taking stock. Tonight, 6th November 2026, Take-Two Interactive published its latest financial report, and it had some pretty large revelations about the upcoming game GTA 6. The headline news: instead of launching on 26th May, 2026, the game has been pushed back about half a year to 19th November, 2026. This has also been confirmed by tweets from the offical Rockstar Games social media accounts.\r  Per Take-Two, this delay is designed to give \"some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience.\" This isn't the first delay the game has seen this year. Back in May, it was confirmed that the game had slipped from its previous release date into May 2026. As a result of this news, we're already starting to see Take-Two stock plummet. The story broke about 9pm UK time, and as of 9.35pm stock has dropped by a massive 8% (see image below). In real terms, that means Take-Two stock is down about $30. Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has spoken to IGN about the delay: \"We've had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we\u2019re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection.\r  \"We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach.\" It seems both investors and the general public don't share this same sense of optimism, as stock continues to fall as I'm writing this story. GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X\/S on its new date of 19th November. And there's little doubt it's going to be big, even with this new set-bacK: Take-Two confirmed earlier this year that GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.\r   Grand Theft Auto VI   PS5,              Xbox Series X\/S    Why did Grand Theft Auto never return to London as a setting?

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"Strive (ASST), an asset management company building a bitcoin BTC$103,064.19 treasury, is looking to raise $160 million after upsizing the initial public offering of 2 million of its Variable Rate Series A perpetual preferred stock (SATA) and pricing it at $80 per share. The offering, scheduled to close on Nov. 10, was increased by 750,000 shares, the company said in a Wednesday release. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including bitcoin and bitcoin-related investments, working capital and potential business acquisitions. The Dallas-based company holds the 17th largest stash of bitcoin by a publicly traded corporation, according to Bitcointreasuries.net, with 5,958 BTC. The stock will carry a 12% initial dividend rate on a $100 stated amount, payable monthly starting Dec. 15 when declared by Strive\u2019s board.  Under certain conditions, the rate can be adjusted within limits tied to the one-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Missed dividends will compound monthly at an increasing rate up to 20% per annum, and Strive will set aside a dividend reserve covering 12 months of payments. Strive may redeem all or part of the SATA stock at $110 per share plus accrued dividends.  It also has the right to redeem all shares if fewer than 25% remain outstanding or in certain tax events.  If a fundamental change occurs, holders may require Strive to repurchase their shares at $100 plus accrued dividends. The company aims to manage the dividend rate to keep the SATA stock price between $95 and $105. The liquidation preference starts at $100 per share and adjusts daily based on trading activity.  Strive shares rose 17% on Wednesday and were up another 8% in pre-market trading Thursday at $1.58.

A simple guide to plug-and-play AI tools that free up your time, help you win back repeat customers, and keep your business growing well into the new year. Unlock the secrets of AI content creation that actually gets cited. Learn how to enhance your visibility with unique AI-generated articles. This post was sponsored by Market Brew. The opinions expressed in this article are the sponsor\u2019s own. If your AI-generated articles don\u2019t rank but sound fine, you\u2019re not alone. AI has made it effortless to produce content, but not to stand out in SERPs. Across nearly every industry, brands are using generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and more to scale content production, only to discover that, to search engines, everything sounds the same. But this guide will help you build E-E-A-T-friendly & AI-Overview-worthy content that boosts your AI Overview visibility, while giving you more control over your rankings. Most generative AI models write from the same training data, producing statistically \u201caverage\u201d answers to predictable prompts. The result is fluent, on-topic copy that is seen as interchangeable from one brand to the next. To most readers, it may feel novel. To search engines, your AI content may look redundant. Algorithms can now detect when pages express the same ideas with minor wording differences. Those pages compete for the same meaning, and only one tends to win. The challenge for SEOs isn\u2019t writing faster, it\u2019s writing differently. That starts with understanding why search engines can tell the difference even when humans can\u2019t. Here\u2019s what Google actually sees when it looks at your page: Modern ranking systems translate your content into embeddings. When two pages share nearly identical embeddings, the algorithm treats them as duplicates of meaning, similar to duplicate content. That\u2019s why AI-generated content blends together. The vocabulary may change, but the structure and message remain the same. Beyond words, engines analyze the entire ecosystem of a page: These structural cues help determine whether content is contextually distinct or just another derivative variant. To stand out, SEOs have to shape the context that guides the model before it writes. That\u2019s where the Inspiration Stage comes in. Before you generate another article, feed the AI your brand\u2019s DNA. Language models can complete sentences, but can\u2019t represent your brand, structure, or positioning unless you teach them. Advanced teams solve this through context engineering, defining who the AI is writing for and how that content should behave in search. The Inspiration Stage should combine three elements that together create brand-unique outputs. The first step is identity. A Brand Bible translates your company\u2019s tone, values, and vocabulary into structured guidance the AI can reference. It tells the model how to express authority, empathy, or playfulness. And just as important, what NOT to say. Without it, every post sounds like a tech press release. With it, you get language that feels recognizably yours, even when produced at scale. \u201cThe Brand Bible isn\u2019t decoration: it\u2019s a defensive wall against generic AI sameness.\u201d Great writing still needs great scaffolding. By supplying a Template URL, a page whose structure already performs well, you give the model a layout to emulate: heading hierarchy, schema markup, internal link positions, and content rhythm. Adding a Template Influence parameter can help the AI decide how closely to follow that structure. Lower settings would encourage creative variation; higher settings would preserve proven formatting for consistency across hundreds of pages. Templates essentially become repeatable frameworks for ranking success. Context also means competition. When you are creating AI content, it needs to be optimized for a series of keywords and prompts. Fan-out prompts are a concept that maps the broader semantic territory around a keyword or topic. These are a network of related questions, entities, and themes that appear across the SERP. In addition, fan-out prompts should be reverse-engineered from top competitors in that SERP. Feeding this intelligence into the AI ensures your content strategically expands its coverage; something that the LLM search engines are hungry for. \u201cIt\u2019s not copying competitors, it\u2019s reverse-engineering the structure of authority.\u201d Together, these three inputs create a contextual blueprint that transforms AI from a text generator into a brand and industry-aware author. If your AI tool spits out finished drafts with no checkpoints, you\u2019ve lost control of what high-quality content is. That\u2019s a problem for teams who need to verify accuracy, tone, or compliance. Breaking generation into transparent stages solves this. Incorporate checkpoints where humans can review, edit, or re-queue the content at each stage: Metrics for readability, link balance, and brand tone become visible in real time. This \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d design keeps creative control where it belongs. Instead of replacing editors, AI becomes their analytical assistant: showing how each change affects the structure beneath the words. \u201cThe best AI systems don\u2019t replace editors, they give them x-ray vision into every step of the process.\u201d Modern SEO focuses on predictive quality signals: indicators that content is likely to perform before it ever ranks. These include: Tracking these signals during creation turns optimization into a real-time discipline. Teams can refine strategy based on measurable structure, not just traffic graphs weeks later. That\u2019s the essence of predictive SEO:\u00a0understanding success before the SERP reflects it. Top SEO teams are already using the Content Booster approach. Market Brew\u2019s Content Booster is one such example. It embeds AI writing directly within a search engine simulation, using the same mechanics that evaluate pages to guide creation. Writers begin by loading their Brand Bible, selecting a Template URL, and enabling reverse-engineered fan-out prompts.  Next, the internal and external linking strategy is defined, which uses a search engine model\u2019s link scoring system, plus its entity-based text classifier as a guide to place the most valuable links possible. This is bolstered by a \u201cfriends\/foes\u201d section that allows writers to define quoting \/ linking opportunities to friendly sites, and \u201cfoe\u201d sites where external linking should be avoided. The Content Booster then produces and evaluates a 7-stage content pipeline, each driven by thousands of AI agents. Editors can inspect or refine content at any stage, ensuring human direction without losing automation.  Instead of waiting months to measure results, teams see predictive metrics: like fan-out coverage, audience\/persona compliance, semantic similarity, link distribution, embedding clusters and more. The moment a draft is generated. This isn\u2019t about outsourcing creativity. It\u2019s about giving SEO professionals the same visibility and control that search engineers already have. If you teach your AI to think like your best strategist, sameness stops being a problem. Every brand now has access to the same linguistic engine; the only differentiator is context. The future of SEO belongs to those who blend human creativity with algorithmic understanding, who teach their models to think like search engines while sounding unmistakably human. By anchoring AI in brand, structure, and competition, and by measuring predictive quality instead of reactive outcomes, SEOs can finally close the gap between what we publish and what algorithms reward. \u201cThe era of AI sameness is already here. The brands that thrive will be the ones that teach their AI to sound human and think like a search engine.\u201d Ready to see how predictive SEO works in action?

{"date":"2025-11-06","content":"A new iOS 26.2 feature for Apple Podcasts has made the built-in podcast app very hard to resist, despite the abundance of third-party alternatives on the App Store. Apple Podcasts used to dominate the podcast landscape, yet these days major competitors like YouTube and Spotify have taken much of Apple\u2019s market share. Even if you don\u2019t use one of those apps, the App Store is also filled with excellent indie podcast clients like Overcast and Castro. But iOS 26.2 makes a very strong case for using Apple Podcasts. Podcasts gains three new features in iOS 26.2, all of which I\u2019m excited to see added. There\u2019s one, however, that stands out above the rest for me: automatically created chapters. I love when podcasts support chapters. And many of my favorite tech shows do offer the feature. Chapters are a great way to get a quick overview of a full podcast episode, and also skip around if there are certain portions I\u2019m not as interested in. The vast majority of podcasts, however, don\u2019t offer chapters. But Apple has a solution. In iOS 26.2, Apple is using AI to automatically generate chapters based on the content of a podcast. No doubt the company\u2019s killer transcript feature from last year has made this possible. Pairing transcripts with AI summarization powers makes chapters for podcasts a no-brainer. Over the last couple days using iOS 26.2, I\u2019ve been so excited to find chapters in podcasts that never had them before.  No longer do I have to rely on creators to manually create podcast chapters. Every show I listen to can offer chapters with zero effort from the podcast maker. Here\u2019s hoping not many choose to opt out. I\u2019ve long had issues with Apple Podcasts\u2019 core Up Next feature. Its design regularly frustrates me, often tempting me to switch to another app. But features like automatic chapter generation, and transcripts, have made it very hard to resist Apple\u2019s Podcasts app. Are you excited about iOS 26.2\u2019s new chapters feature in Apple Podcasts?
