{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"Full disclosure. If you want a lathe capable of turning metal stock, you probably should just buy one. But what fun is that? You can do like [kachurovskiy] and build one with your 3D printer. If you are chuckling, thinking you can\u2019t make 3D printed parts sturdy enough, you aren\u2019t exactly wrong. [Kachurovskiy\u2019s] trick is to 3D print forms and then cast the solid parts in concrete. The result looks great, and we don\u2019t doubt his claim that it \u201ccan surpass many comparable lathes in rigidity and features.\u201d Even he admits that this is a \u201c\u2026 hard, long, and expensive project\u2026\u201d But all good projects are. There\u2019s a GitHub page with more details and informative videos below. The action shots are in the last video just before the six-minute mark. Around the seven-minute mark, you can see the machine cut a conical thread. Color us impressed!  The idea of casting concrete with inserts in it is giving us a number of ideas. We haven\u2019t done it before, but it looks like a good skill to learn. You can 3D print concrete, too. Concrete lathes are, surprisingly, not a new idea, but much harder to do without 3D-printed forms.       we don\u2019t doubt his claim that it \u201ccan surpass many comparable lathes in rigidity and features.\u201d  The elastic modulus of concrete is between 20-40 GPa which is much bendier than aluminum. It\u2019s pretty much \u201ccheese\u201d compared to metals \u2013 casting the frame out of plain tin would make it more rigid.  You can expect twice the amount of flex compared to aluminum, but you can easily compensate for the lack of rigidity simply by making the load bearing sections twice as wide in the direction of bending or compression. This however does mean the whole structure will weigh about twice as much as an equivalent aluminum frame. As for the cracking problem, there was a recent Practical Engineering video about concrete structures. The video pointed out that typical concrete reaches about 75% of its nominal strength in 7 days and 90% in 28 days. If you try to clamp it down right after pouring, it will just crumble like that. Concrete structures seem really rigid and strong to the casual observer, but they\u2019re really not \u2013 it\u2019s just because the typical structures are so massive that the flex becomes basically invisible to the naked eye. If you made the structure small and light enough to bend by human force, to experience the bending yourself, it\u2019d likely just break. This lack of rigidity however isn\u2019t a negative point for concrete: it can tolerate and conform to deformation, like ground shifting underneath a building. And looking at the scale of that concrete casting it probably is stiffer than most similarly sized lathes, at least in the bed, slightly less convinced around the spindle and wonder how good those linear rails really are (as that will have a huge impact). But as being heavier for a machine tool is only ever a good thing \u2013 you put an excentric mass like a cam being machined on your lathe and if it isn\u2019t really really heavy or bolted to something that is it will move on you, potentially quite fast! Might not make any difference to the machining quality if the machine is stiff but a bit light, but it will move. As I know quite well from my little watch makers lathe \u2013 its a really stiff machine for its size anyway, and even with a rather chunky cast baseplate it will happily try to walk spinning an off balance mass. So it really doesn\u2019t matter how much material you end up using and how massive it is, the cost, ease of production and suitability for the use environment. And there is no doubting that cast concrete is both suitable and much easier for most folks to do, especially with a 3d printed formwork than the foundry work to cast in even the usually softer lower point melting metals. For myself I can\u2019t see why you\u2019d make a cast concrete machine in most places in the world, as restoring an old iron machine is likely just as much of an adventure and almost certainly gets you a better end result as those old iron machines are the product of many years of evolution to a good machine and no doubt have thousands of handy accessories made to fit so you don\u2019t have to re-invent the wheel all the time (but obviously can if you want to). And if you really need to make your own for some reason fabricated metal structure with epoxy granite infill type concepts seems rather more flexible, likely quicker and will give a good result. But still I like this project, its interesting making use of off the shelf stuff like the linear rails etc.    looking at the scale of that concrete casting it probably is stiffer than most similarly sized lathes  That would be because most \u201csimilarly sized lathes\u201d would be made of mostly hollow extrusions. Less material, less cross-section area, less rigidity. If you made the same frame out of solid aluminum, it could be half as thick or even less \u2013 if so desired. However, the concrete has an advantage over aluminum in the fact that it\u2019s not a homogeneous material. It has density differences between the cement and the gravel and sand, so it absorbs vibrations orders of magnitude better. Weight and size does matter though. Just moving them around becomes a problem, and your machine table has to support the weight. The point of making a cast concrete lathe is that you don\u2019t need much machining to do it. You don\u2019t need any welding or milling or other fine metal shaping. If you can nail a few boards or glues some plastic together, you can make the forms, so it\u2019s much more accessible to your average garage maker, and if done right it will be superior to your average hardware store or kit built  lathe.    at least in the bed, slightly less convinced around the spindle  I have the opposite take. The spindle bearings have plenty of material around them in the chunky tower, which distributes the load and keeps it rigid, whereas the bed is a long thin piece that would be more susceptible to flex. It all goes down to leverage \u2013 twice the distance doubles the bending stresses. If you\u2019re turning a longer piece, pushing the cutting tool against the work is more likely to bend the bed than the spindle tower simply by how far away it is, but also because the tower is so much thicker in the direction of bending. It is mostly the vertical direction on the spindle and it being concrete that makes me a little dubious \u2013 that top part is not very thick, more inline with a metal casting above the bearings, and honestly not that vast around the sides either \u2013 being square its got more mass than the usually more form fitting metal casting, but those corner part just are not all that structurally relevant, that is all on the thinnest point on the walls where the bearing go though.. Where that bed is really really massive compared to a metal bed casting. Leverage matters but so does so many other factors from how direct the force paths can be, and how much of the material is involved in dealing with any particular load. So as this is a solid brick of concrete that is huge compared to the usually quite hollow metal casting where each rail of the bed is only joined by a handful of webs. I don\u2019t think this is a bad machine by any stretch, but when comparing to a more normal lathe the spindle mounts walls are pretty thin at the thinnest points, so considering its made in a comparatively poor material that is the point it likely doesn\u2019t stand up so well in comparison. Where the bed is much more substantial all round than the normal metal castings being practically a solid brick of significantly thicker dimensions all round than the similar length and bed spaced metal one \u2013 so assuming the linear rails and their mounting is up to it the bed should perform really well, I\u2019d not be shocked if its able to perform rather better than the majority of metal castings despite the less capable material choice as its huge! The only complaint about the build itself that I have: The motor mounting bracket will creep as the motor gets warm. It\u2019s too flimsy. This is an easy fix by bending it out of aluminum instead. Make note that he used metal threaded inserts at the ends of the plastic inserts inside the concrete. This is very good \u2013 this anchors the screws to the concrete. Other youtubers doing concrete frames have omitted this feature. Ideally you would use a metal bar with threaded holes to give it more surface area to grab hold of the concrete and spread the load to give it more rigidity, but this is still much better than plain plastic inserts or plastic inserts with metal inserts pressed in \u2013 because again, plastic will creep and the threads or the inserts would pull out. You need the plastic around the hole to act as \u201cgrouting\u201d to prevent the concrete from cracking, but the metal insert is what keeps the tension \u2013 the plastic won\u2019t. What I don\u2019t know about concrete, would fill a book (called \u201cHow to use concrete\u201d). But I DO watch YouTube videos. And those typically have \u2013 rebar. One, about pre stressed concrete, had washers on wires and the wire was stretched during casting. Judging by all the comments, adding steel (or even aluminum) to the cast should improve rigidity.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"The Trump administration faced mounting criticism on the economy and cost of living in a new poll, and most respondents said they want Democrats to take control Congress after the midterm elections next year. In a survey from NBC News released Nov. 9, two-thirds of registered voters said the Trump administration has not lived up to their expectations on addressing inflation and the cost of living. Many Americans are also unhappy with the way the administration has affected the middle class, with 65% saying President Donald Trump has not lived up to their hopes. Trump's approval rating in the poll was 43%, a 4-point decrease since the outlet's March survey, while 55% said they disapprove of his job performance. The numbers align with several recent surveys: The president's average rating is 42% approval and 55% disapproval, according to a New York Times calculation. RealClearPolitics' Nov. 9 average is similar, 43% approval and 54% disapproval. The survey is the latest to show voters souring on the administration's handling of the economy. Democrats seized on that frustration in last week's Nov. 4 election, when the party won key races across the country. Respondents in the NBC News survey said they preferred Democrats over Republicans to lead the new Congress in 2027 by 8 points, with 50% saying they prefer Democratic control over 42% wanting a GOP-led legislature. It's the largest lead for either party on the congressional ballot in the NBC poll since the 2018 midterms \u2013 and a 7-point jump in Democrats' lead since March. When it comes to the ongoing shutdown, 49% said either Republicans in Congress or Trump are at fault, and 42% said Democrats in Congress are to blame. However, the survey found it's not an entirely rosy picture for the Democrats. Just 28% of respondents viewed the party positively, compared to Republicans' 37%. On the issues of crime and immigration, Republicans were seen as more capable, while Democrats outranked them on health care and democracy. And though a majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with Republicans over the economy, they still held a one-point advantage over Democrats in the poll. More broadly, 61% of survey respondents said the country was moving in the wrong direction, marking a 7-point increase since the pollsters last asked the question in March. The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28. The margin of error is \u00b1 3.1 percentage points. Kathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"                 Reading time 2 minutes        During hurricane season, meteorologists rely on a variety of different forecast models. As this season comes to an end, experts are taking stock of which ones performed well and which ones didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rookie model has left them absolutely gobsmacked. Though Google DeepMind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Weather Lab only began releasing forecasts in June, it was by far the best model for predicting hurricane track and intensity this season, according to a preliminary analysis by Brian McNoldy, a meteorologist and senior researcher at the University of Miami. Meanwhile, America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship weather model\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Global Forecast System\u00e2\u0080\u0094was the worst performing. The National Hurricane Center will release official data on each model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance in a few months, but this initial assessment foreshadows a turning point in hurricane forecasting. With the incredible superiority of AI-based models becoming blatantly apparent, it may be time to start phasing out traditional, physics-based models. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing forward, it is safe to say that we will rely heavily on Google and other AI weather models, which are likely to improve in the coming years, as they are relatively new and have room for improvement,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Houston-based meteorologist and space reporter Eric Berger wrote for Ars Technica. McNoldy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis includes two charts: one comparing track forecast accuracy for all 13 named storms in the Atlantic Basin this season, and one comparing the intensity forecast accuracy for all 13 storms. The different colored lines represent different forecast models, denoted by the legend on the right-hand margin. The lower a line is, the better that model performed. The GFS\u00e2\u0080\u0094referred to as AVNI in this instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094is displayed in orange all the way up at the top of the charts. NOAA developed this model in the early 1980s, and the National Weather Service still uses an updated version as its primary forecast system today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe GFS was especially awful in its forecast for Melissa, with an average 5-day track error ballooning to over 500 miles [800 kilometers], insisting on a turn out to sea that never transpired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miami-based meteorologist and hurricane specialist Michael Lowry wrote in a recent blog post. Unlike Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast model, the GFS is based on traditional physics and advanced supercomputers. The difference between them clearly stands out on these charts. Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s model is all the way at the bottom, indicating superior performance to all other evaluated models\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially the GFS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beauty of DeepMind and other similar data-driven, AI-based weather models is how much more quickly they produce a forecast compared to their traditional physics-based counterparts that require some of the most expensive and advanced supercomputers in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lowry wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeyond that, these \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart\u00e2\u0080\u009d models with their neural network architectures have the ability to learn from their mistakes and correct on-the-fly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hurricane Melissa\u00e2\u0080\u0094which ravaged the Caribbean last week\u00e2\u0080\u0094is just one example of how rising sea surface temperatures are supercharging storms. As climate change causes hurricanes to become deadlier and more damaging, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential that forecasters have the best possible tools to predict their paths and intensities. AI-based models could help forecasters adapt to a warming world. DeepMind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stunning debut has certainly caught their attention and may mark the beginning of a new era in hurricane prediction.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"Premium smartphones are getting more expensive as we dive into new features like advanced cameras, integrated AI, and even foldable designs. But you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to get a quality Android phone. There are many high-quality Android smartphones that users swear by for offering premium features without causing sticker shock. Most of the top brands like Samsung and Google have tiered offerings with a \"good,\" \"better,\" \"best\" option in their respective line-ups. There are other brands worth considering, too, that offer affordable phones to rival the bigger names, like Motorola and OnePlus. We even called the OnePlus 13 a \"flagship killer.\" There are indeed cheap Android phones you should steer clear of. But if you want to get a fantastic Android phone that won't cost you thousands of dollars, offering great bang for your buck, there are several options to consider. In some cases, it might mean making concessions when it comes to features, cameras, or durability. In others, it's simply a matter of opting for an older but still relevant model. Google Pixel \"a\" series phones are step-down models. While the Google Pixel 9a is technically from last generation's series since Google recently announced Pixel 10 series phones, it's still got a lot of life and value left. Introduced in March 2025, the phone affords access to Google Gemini AI features and boasts impressive specs. The Google Pixel 9a, arguably the brand's most overlooked Android phone, has the powerful Google Tensor G4 chip, a bright 6.3-inch Actua display, and a great camera system including a 48MP main and 13MP ultra-wide camera. It has all the same cool AI-powered photo editing and capture features in higher-end models, like Add Me for adding yourself to a group photo, Best Take for taking the best expression from each person in a photo, Magic Eraser for removing distracting elements, and more. As with all new Google Pixel phones, it's supported with software and security updates for seven years. So, it's not anywhere close to being outdated. The Pixel 9a has received glowing reviews from top tech sites and Amazon customers give it a solid 4.4 stars. The best part? You can get it for under $500. With an impressive 4.5-star rating from Amazon customers, the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2025) is praised alongside other Motorola devices for offering a clean stock Android experience, free of bloatware from the manufacturer. Available for under $400, it has a massive 6.7-inch screen and expectedly comes with a built-in stylus for navigating, taking notes, and sketching. Tech reviewers love that it incorporates AI features and offers impressive battery life along with fast charging, something power users will appreciate. The Moto G Stylus (2025) might not yield photos that are as impressive as you'd get with more premium devices. But for the price, it's a solid investment that will last for years. Motorola promises two years of major OS updates and three years of security, which means you're good through 2027\/2028. By that time, you might want to upgrade anyway. For the low price of entry, use it to familiarize yourself with Motorola phones and decide if you want to get something more advanced for your next device, or this price point will suffice. When it comes to a value-priced phone that acts like a higher-end one, you can't go wrong with either of these options.","label":0}

At the Davos conference in January, Marc Benioff asked a crowd of luminaries whether AI was a basic human right. Here is another question: Can it make him money? He gushed about AI agents last year, enthusiasm that helped drive the company's stock to an all-time high in early December. This year, though, Salesforce isn't in the AI darling club. Its shares are down roughly 28%. Business Insider's Ashley Stewart has been reporting on the company's \"Agentforce\" project, which represents Salesforce's big bet on AI agents. \"Inside the company, some current and former employees say there's been constant struggle for the teams scrambling to deliver on Benioff's public promises of what their AI products can do,\" she wrote. Her in-depth piece showed how hard this evolution can be, even at companies all in on it. \"It's very, very difficult \u2014 even for people working on the products \u2014 to know the difference between what we say in a demo, what's on a road map, and what's actually in production,\" one senior employee told Ashley. \"It's a full-time job just figuring that out.\" Meanwhile, my LinkedIn post on the story generated a pointed discussion.

Once subscribers do, the credit will be applied to their next bill. \"We remain committed to working with Disney to bring their content back to YouTube TV,\" the company said. YouTube TV's small peace offering to subscribers comes as contract negotiations between its parent company, Google, and Disney show few public signs of progress. The two companies have been unable to agree on a new licensing deal, so Disney pulled ESPN, ABC, National Geographic, FX, and Freeform from YouTube TV on October 30. Subscribers also lost access to recordings from those channels in their libraries. YouTube wrote in an October blog that Disney \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers. They're now following through on that threat, suspending their content on YouTube TV.\" A Disney spokesperson previously told Business Insider that Google is refusing to pay fair rates. \"With a $3 trillion market cap, Google is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. YouTube has become a major player in the media space. A Nielsen report published in July said YouTube is the top media distributor, surpassing both Disney and Netflix.     Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"I hoped the answer was \"yes\", but it's more complicated than that  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Freepik started life as a stock photo image website - alongside the likes of Pexels, Unsplash, and even Adobe Stock, it became one of the go-to sites for businesses who wanted safe imagery fit for websites and promotional materials. But nigh on ten years is a long time in tech. Since then, the company has added AI image and video generators, upscaling tools, and most recently Freepik Spaces - a cloud-based, node-based collaboration platform. So, does all this AI herald the end of stock asset sites as we know them? At this year's Freepik Upscale Conf in Malaga, I asked Joaqu\u00edn Cuenca, the company's CEO and co-founder, whether the emergence of AI image generation has killed off the stock images for good (and seeing the state of some of the overexposed images and the ultra-bright white smiles of impossibly good-looking models, I was somewhat hopeful for a simple \"Yes\"). \"You started as a stock image site,\" I asked. \"Do you think AI has effectively killed stock asset market, or is there still a space for it?\" Cuenca shook his head. \"No, there's still a space for it,\" he told me. \"That's something that, you know, this thing that says that in the short term, we overestimate the impact, and we underestimate in the long term. Well, with existing platforms, there is a tendency to believe that they are going to disappear very quickly when there is a new technology. But very often they stay stable. Maybe they grow less or they stop growing. But there are a group of people that just like to create a certain way. And that's perfectly fine.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Has Freepik seen a drop in stock image use as it continues adding new AI tools? \"Stock, for us, has not decreased. It's absolutely stable or growing. It's a nice business, and it's been our business for many years. We're very proud of it. We've helped many, many people thanks to stock.\" Will there be, I wonder, an increased convergence of stock, AI, and photo editing software? \"We have done a bit of that. We have made it easy for people to use stock, combine it with AI, and many people have done that. There's a group of people that just have to use stock, and that's ok.\" There are areas, too, where stock simply can't be displaced by AI image generation, Cuenca explained. \"It's like, for trade, for travel purposes, like you want a photo of Malaga, it would be disingenuous to make up something. You just need to go there and just do it, take a photo. It has its own use cases that are not displaced by AI. And it is very complicated, impossible to foresee the future. But the reality today is that it stays,\" he said firmly. \u27a1\ufe0f Read our full guide to the best photo editors1. Best overall:Adobe Photoshop2. Best Adobe alternative:Affinity3.

Elon Musk could soon be a trillion-dollar man. On Thursday, 75% of Tesla shareholders voted to approve his proposed $1 trillion pay package as the company's CEO, contingent on a set of performance metrics he would need to meet over the next decade. And based on the standing ovation and exuberant cheering Musk received at the shareholder meeting, Tesla superfans in attendance seemed to love it. \"Howdy, Elon,\" said one attendee during the Q&A portion of the meeting. \"Congrats on not having to show up to work for free anymore.\" The massive compensation package is in hopes that Musk could increase Tesla's market cap by more than sixfold and create a million robots. For comparison, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, is expected to receive about $49.9 million in pay in 2025. Ian Keas, managing director of Gallagher's executive compensation consultancy team, told Business Insider that it's rare for a pay package to carry such high stakes. \"Moon shoot incentives have been, for some time, pretty rare,\" said Keas. \"You don't normally see these types of pay packages in US publicly traded companies.\" Musk's pay plan is contingent on Musk achieving several challenging goals. To earn the full $1 trillion, Musk must boost Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million vehicles a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots. Jesse Fried, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider that the decision makes sense due to the \"huge upside to keeping Musk hyper-focused on Tesla.\" \"It was approved by unaffiliated shareholders, who are the parties most affected by the arrangement,\" said Fried. \"I don't believe any other public company has ever voluntarily put CEO pay to a shareholder vote.\" Keas said that when dealing with an executive pay above market rate, there is no significant accountability issue as long as the pay is \"tightly linked\" to \"clear and rigorous\" performance goals with no gray areas. \"When there's an award that's been designed by a board of directors and approved by a shareholder vote, that kind of contract is binding,\" said Keas. \"If the future of the company is successful through proper incentives for a CEO that result in shareholder value appreciation over time, then I don't think shareholders have too much to worry about.\" The new compensation plan follows a Delaware judge's decision that voided Musk's $56 billion compensation deal from 2018, ruling that Tesla's board was unduly influenced by Musk when they agreed to his pay. Tesla relocated its incorporation to Texas and has continued to appeal the decision; it is unclear whether its success or failure would impact Musk's new pay package. Even though Tesla's shares have recovered from the blows they received earlier in the year, their sales face an uncertain future after the end of the EV tax credit. Meanwhile, robotaxis have thus far remained with safety drivers while operating. Some investors and industry watchdogs are alarmed by Musk's record-setting pay package. Shua Sanchez, national campaign director at Safe Autonomous Vehicles Everywhere, told Business Insider in a statement that he is concerned that nothing in Musk's performance metric incentivizes autonomous vehicle safety. \"This pay plan creates a dangerous financial incentive to rush partially-autonomous vehicles and robotaxis onto public roads before they're proven safe,\" said Sanchez. Tejal Patel, Executive Director of the SOC Investment Group, which holds Tesla shares, told Business Insider that Musk's \"outsized influence\" over Tesla has spilled over in voting results. Starting from September, Tesla ran ads across Facebook, Instagram, X, and Google that told shareholders they \"must retain and incentivize Elon\" and that \"transformative growth\" starts with \"aligning CEO pay with shareholder value.\" The board also aired an ad on Paramount+ urging shareholders to vote in alignment with the board's recommendations, concluding with \"the future of Tesla is in your hands.\" \"From paid social media campaigns and TV advertisements to hiring a consultant to conduct proxy solicitations, Tesla took extraordinary measures to set up this vote in Musk's favor,\" said Patel. Weeks ahead of the vote, proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis both urged shareholders to reject the proposal. On Tuesday, Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, also said it had voted against the pay package over concerns that the company may become overly reliant on one individual, that being Musk. The fund is Tesla's sixth-largest institutional shareholder and the world's largest wealth fund. Musk called the proxy firms \"corporate terrorists\" in a recent earnings call, and Tesla's chair warned shareholders in a letter in October that Musk could walk away from the company if his compensation wasn't approved. Patel said that it would be hard to deduce how independent shareholders actually feel about the pay package without a full vote breakdown. \"In order to improve sales and stabilize Tesla's earnings, true innovation and growth at the company must be guided by strong governance, independent oversight, and transparent accountability,\" Patel added, \"Not by throwing money at the problem and concentrating more power in the hands of a single executive.\" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        The government has been shutdown for a record 39 days, and many aspects of everyday life that hinge on government funding are feeling the pinch. One of the industries hit the hardest is air travel. Due to the shutdown, travelers around the country are facing mounting lines at security checkpoints and thousands of flight delays and cancellations as air travel tries to operate in a restricted capacity. As of 4 p.m. ET on Sunday, there were already more than 7,500 total delays within, into or out of the U.S., according to FlightAware data. Delta Airlines, which has already canceled more than 450 flights today told NBC News that more cancellations were expected. Saturday counted 7,531 delays and 1,566 cancellations, and Friday had 7,017 delays and 1,025 cancellations. For comparison, there were only 202 flight cancellations on Thursday, a day before the Federal Aviation Agency\u2019s decision to reduce flights went into effect. The flight cancellations are roughly at the level you would see in a light snow storm, according to United Airlines. But the delays and cancellations are only set to grow from here as the shutdown continues, and they might get even worse than expected due to an actual\u00c2\u00a0winter storm forming in the Midwest. \u201cDangerous to impossible travel conditions will develop\u201d in some parts of Illinois on the night bridging Sunday to Monday due to the snow expected from the storm, according to the latest advisories. In the event of a government shutdown, many federal employees lose their jobs. But some that are considered essential to the protection of life and property, like air traffic controllers and TSA agents, are required to work without pay or additional support staff. In the absence of their paycheck, many of these employees resort to additional work to make up for the loss. In many cases, the air traffic controllers\u00e2\u0080\u0094who were already working mandatory overtime six days a week\u00e2\u0080\u0094call in sick. As many as 20-40% of controllers are not showing up for work, according to FAA administrator Bryan Bedford\u2019s estimates from earlier this week. \u201cWe had 81 staffing triggers throughout the national airspace yesterday, that means controllers weren\u2019t coming to work,\u201d secretary of transportation Sean Duffy said Sunday on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d Air traffic controllers are the backbone of safe air travel, and when they take off of work in droves, that puts pressure on an already fragile system. Duffy and the FAA\u2019s solution to that has been flight reductions at 40 major airports around the country. The reductions started at 4% on Friday, and if the shutdown continues, will inch up to 6% by Tuesday, Nov. 11, 8% by Nov. 13 and 10% by Nov. 14. The order only requires a reduction in domestic flights, but carriers can choose which flights to cancel on their own. Duffy warned that the reductions could hike up to 20% if the shutdown continues, despite holiday travel looming in the horizon with Thanksgiving later this month. \u201cI look to the two weeks before Thanksgiving, you\u2019re going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,\u201d Duffy said on CNN. The secretary had also warned of \u201cmass chaos\u201d at a press conference earlier this week. The measures are certainly unprecedented. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a situation where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking these kinds of measures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bedford said at a press conference this week. The end could be near. According to CNN, Senate majority leader John Thune indicated that there might be an initial vote on Sunday for a working plan to reopen the government. The plan does not include an extension to the Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats have been negotiating for, but it reportedly guarantees a future Senate vote on them. Not every one is on board with just a promise though. \u201cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that the House Democratic Caucus is prepared to support a promise, a wink and a prayer from folks who have been devastating the health care of the American people for years,\u201d House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told NBC on Sunday.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"This will be the last software patch for Google Pixel Watch.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Google's original 2022 Pixel Watch is receiving its final update, a modest patch, BW1A.251005.003.W1, which preserves its software status on Wear OS 5.1, signalling the end of guaranteed major support for the smartwatch. The official release notes are brief, mentioning only \u201cSecurity updates and bug fixes\" (via 9to5Google). This makes it clear that the original Pixel Watch won\u2019t be moving up to Wear OS 6, a privilege reserved for newer smartwatch models. Launched back in October 2022, the first-gen Pixel Watch was Google\u2019s re-entry into the smartwatch market, built on a Samsung Exynos 9110 chip and running Wear OS 3.5 at launch.      Over the past three years, it received multiple updates that improved performance and battery management, as well as two major version upgrades \u2014 from Wear OS 3.5 to Wear OS 4, and then to 5.1. With this latest patch, Google is effectively closing the book on major system updates for the device. That said, Google isn\u2019t abandoning the watch entirely. Users will still receive app and service updates through the Play Store, ensuring that essential functions remain usable for a while longer. But when it comes to full Wear OS upgrades and long-term improvements, this is the finish line. If you\u2019re still wearing the first-gen Pixel Watch, it\u2019s recommended to install the October patch once it hits your device. You can check for it manually by heading to Settings \u2192 System \u2192 System Updates on your watch. It\u2019s a relatively small update, but an important one for maintaining stability and security. And while it\u2019s bittersweet to see support end, the Pixel Watch has had a solid run: three years of updates and consistent improvements. From here on out, it\u2019ll continue to work fine, but without the major Wear OS upgrades that the newer Pixel Watch lineup will enjoy.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"The mother-in-law told the pre-teen that she doesn\u2019t have the academic \u2018ability\u2019 to attend a university Getty  A mom is furious after finding out that her mother-in-law told her 11-year-old daughter that college isn\u2019t a \u201crealistic\u201d goal.   The woman explained on the community forum Mumsnet that her daughter was \u201cupset\u201d after\u00a0recently spending a weekend with her grandparents.   She said that her daughter proceeded to tell her that she had told her grandmother that she wanted to be an occupational therapist some day.

Growing up, I never even really wanted to visit the United Kingdom. Naturally, I've ended up living here for years. I'm an American who has made the capital of Wales my home for the past two decades, and I'm not sorry I did.  Cardiff is a vibrant, eclectic, and welcoming place. And it's relatively affordable compared to some other major cities in the UK.  With all its charm, the city doesn't pretend to be something it's not. Cardiff lures you in with its cheery, unassuming character and leaves you asking how anyone could've ever overlooked it. Here are a few more reasons it deserves a spot on your travel list. Wales has more than 400 castles still standing or in ruins \u2014 more per square mile than any other country in Europe. One of them is in the center of Cardiff. Cardiff Castle, once the site of a Roman fort, has a history that spans about 2,000 years (the remnants of its Roman origins are still visible within its walls). Every summer, you can go to gigs headlined by some of music's biggest artists or watch movies on an open-air screen in the impressive castle gardens.  Just bring a waterproof jacket, because the weather in Wales is nothing if not changeable. If you're into sports, Cardiff also has a 70,000-seater stadium in its center, unusual for a European city. The energy in the area on a match day is astonishing. So, you can cheer on the Wales rugby team and then pick any number of the neighboring bars and clubs to fuel the rest of your evening out.  Don't call it a night without a visit to Caroline Street, a pedestrian area also nicknamed \"Chippy Lane,\" for an early-hours feast. It has tons of great spots for grabbing late-night takeout (including fish and chips).  With a population of about just under 400,000, Cardiff has enough people to give you that buzzy, energetic feel, but not so many that it makes being in town when the summer tourists arrive unbearable. It's not too big, at under 60 square miles, so you can cover all of the city center's highlights and nearby Cardiff Bay on foot over a weekend.  If you have time, it's definitely worth exploring the outer neighborhoods of Roath, Pontcanna, and Canton, where there are loads of independent shops, caf\u00e9s, pubs, restaurants, and an excellent arts center. You also won't need to navigate a complicated subway system, because we don't have one. There is, however, a water taxi, city-center train stations, and a decent bus network. No matter where you are in the city, you're not far from a picnic space.  Cardiff has more than 330 parks and gardens, the largest of which is the 130-acre Bute Park, known as the \"Green Heart of the City\"  It backs onto Cardiff Castle, and, on a sunny day, it's where you'll find me having a stroll, lying on the grass, reading, or sharing drinks with my mates. Like Cardiff Castle, it also hosts some of the biggest names in music at outdoor gigs during the summer months.  Cardiff has seven Victorian and Edwardian arcades, more than any other city in the UK. These arcades are glass-covered passageways featuring stunning architectural details that are still intact. They house dozens of different bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and shops (most of them independent), including Spillers, which is considered to be the oldest record store in the world. There's also Cardiff Market, a two-floor Victorian indoor market with stalls selling goods like fresh seafood, flowers, wigs, records, bao buns, and Welsh cakes (flat, griddle-cooked cakes that usually contain dried fruit). In fact, to use a term used by South Walians, locals are \"lush\" (short for \"luscious,\" but it means \"great\" and can be used to describe pretty much anything). As a tourist, you'll likely be on the receiving end of what I've heard called a \"warm Welsh welcome.\" People here like a chat, especially if pints are involved.  That said, you probably won't find them saying \"hi\" to strangers in the street, but I'm working on it.      Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from TP-Link Systems, a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link\u2019s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box. A TP-Link WiFi 6 AX1800 Smart WiFi Router (Archer AX20). The Washington Post recently reported that more than a half-dozen federal departments and agencies were backing a proposed ban on future sales of TP-Link devices in the United States. The story said U.S. Department of Commerce officials concluded TP-Link Systems products pose a risk because the U.S.-based company\u2019s products handle sensitive American data and because the officials believe it remains subject to jurisdiction or influence by the Chinese government. TP-Link Systems denies that, saying that it fully split from the Chinese TP-Link Technologies over the past three years, and that its critics have vastly overstated the company\u2019s market share (TP-Link puts it at around 30 percent). TP-Link says it has headquarters in California, with a branch in Singapore, and that it manufactures in Vietnam. The company says it researches, designs, develops and manufactures everything except its chipsets in-house. TP-Link Systems told The Post it has sole ownership of some engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities in China that were once part of China-based TP-Link Technologies, and that it operates them without Chinese government supervision. \u201cTP-Link vigorously disputes any allegation that its products present national security risks to the United States,\u201d Ricca Silverio, a spokeswoman for TP-Link Systems, said in a statement. \u201cTP-Link is a U.S. company committed to supplying high-quality and secure products to the U.S. market and beyond.\u201d Cost is a big reason TP-Link devices are so prevalent in the consumer and small business market: As this February 2025 story from Wired observed regarding the proposed ban, TP-Link has long had a reputation for flooding the market with devices that are considerably cheaper than comparable models from other vendors. That price point (and consistently excellent performance ratings) has made TP-Link a favorite among Internet service providers (ISPs) that provide routers to their customers. In August 2024, the chairman and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party called for an investigation into TP-Link devices, which they said were found on U.S. military bases and for sale at exchanges that sell them to members of the military and their families. \u201cTP-Link\u2019s unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with PRC law are in and of themselves disconcerting,\u201d the House lawmakers warned in a letter (PDF) to the director of the Commerce Department. \u201cWhen combined with the PRC government\u2019s common use of SOHO [small office\/home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.\u201d The letter cited a May 2023 blog post by Check Point Research about a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group dubbed \u201cCamaro Dragon\u201d that used a malicious firmware implant for some TP-Link routers to carry out a sequence of targeted cyberattacks against European foreign affairs entities. Check Point said while it only found the malicious firmware on TP-Link devices, \u201cthe firmware-agnostic nature of the implanted components indicates that a wide range of devices and vendors may be at risk.\u201d In a report published in October 2024, Microsoft said it was tracking a network of compromised TP-Link small office and home office routers that has been abused by multiple distinct Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups since 2021. Microsoft found the hacker groups were leveraging the compromised TP-Link systems to conduct \u201cpassword spraying\u201d attacks against Microsoft accounts. Password spraying involves rapidly attempting to access a large number of accounts (usernames\/email addresses) with a relatively small number of commonly used passwords. TP-Link rightly points out that most of its competitors likewise source components from China. The company also correctly notes that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from China and other nations have leveraged vulnerabilities in products from their competitors, such as Cisco and Netgear. But that may be cold comfort for TP-Link customers who are now wondering if it\u2019s smart to continue using these products, or whether it makes sense to buy more costly networking gear that might only be marginally less vulnerable to compromise. Almost without exception, the hardware and software that ships with most consumer-grade routers includes a number of default settings that need to be changed before the devices can be safely connected to the Internet. For example, bring a new router online without changing the default username and password and chances are it will only take a few minutes before it is probed and possibly compromised by some type of Internet-of-Things botnet. Also, it is incredibly common for the firmware in a brand new router to be dangerously out of date by the time it is purchased and unboxed. Until quite recently, the idea that router manufacturers should make it easier for their customers to use these products safely was something of anathema to this industry. Consumers were largely left to figure that out on their own, with predictably disastrous results. But over the past few years, many manufacturers of popular consumer routers have begun forcing users to perform basic hygiene \u2014 such as changing the default password and updating the internal firmware \u2014 before the devices can be used as a router. For example, most brands of \u201cmesh\u201d wireless routers \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s Eero, Netgear\u2019s Orbi series, or Asus\u2019s ZenWifi \u2014 require online registration that automates these critical steps going forward (or at least through their stated support lifecycle). For better or worse, less expensive, traditional consumer routers like those from Belkin and Linksys also now automate this setup by heavily steering customers toward installing a mobile app to complete the installation (this often comes as a shock to people more accustomed to manually configuring a router). Still, these products tend to put the onus on users to check for and install available updates periodically. Also, they\u2019re often powered by underwhelming or else bloated firmware, and a dearth of configurable options. Of course, not everyone wants to fiddle with mobile apps or is comfortable with registering their router so that it can be managed or monitored remotely in the cloud. For those hands-on folks \u2014 and for power users seeking more advanced router features like VPNs, ad blockers and network monitoring \u2014 the best advice is to check if your router\u2019s stock firmware can be replaced with open-source alternatives, such as OpenWrt\u00a0or DD-WRT. These open-source firmware options are compatible with a wide range of devices, and they generally offer more features and configurability. Open-source firmware can even help extend the life of routers years after the vendor stops supporting the underlying hardware, but it still requires users to manually check for and install any available updates. Happily, TP-Link users spooked by the proposed ban may have an alternative to outright junking these devices, as many TP-Link routers also support open-source firmware options like OpenWRT. While this approach may not eliminate any potential hardware-specific security flaws, it could serve as an effective hedge against more common vendor-specific vulnerabilities, such as undocumented user accounts, hard-coded credentials, and weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass authentication. Regardless of the brand, if your router is more than four or five years old it may be worth upgrading for performance reasons alone \u2014 particularly if your home or office is primarily accessing the Internet through WiFi. NB: The Post\u2019s story notes that a substantial portion of TP-Link routers and those of its competitors are purchased or leased through ISPs. In these cases, the devices are typically managed and updated remotely by your ISP, and equipped with custom profiles responsible for authenticating your device to the ISP\u2019s network. If this describes your setup, please do not attempt to modify or replace these devices without first consulting with your Internet provider. \r          This entry was posted on Sunday 9th of November 2025 01:14 PM \r           I have found TP-Link products to be feature-rich ( I particularly appreciate the VPN support in their routers), and good value. I\u2019m not surprised that they have a good market share, nor am I surprised that there is lobbying against them, pdrehaps as a result. As for vulnerabilities, is there ANY major nation state that\u2019s trustworthy? Another example of how US propaganda against China leads to morons panicking and seeking \u201cCommies under every bed.\u201d It is the US itself which is the major threat to world peace, not China or Russia or Iran. Anyone who believes otherwise is a moron completely ignorant of the negative impact of US geopolitical behavior since WWII (if not before.) \u201cIt is the US itself which is the major threat to world peace, not China or Russia or Iran.\u201d Nope. The major threat to world peace are the enablers of authoritarian government \u2013 oligarchs. Their interests are driven by avarice and cruelty. All other priorities are secondary. The major threat to world peace is people who overuse \u201cmoron.\u201d This proposed ban on TP-Link seems overly broad and could hurt consumers. It\u2019s essential to balance security concerns with access to affordable technology. I hope there\u2019s a thorough discussion before any final decisions are made. \u201cby heavily steering customers toward installing a mobile app to complete the installation (this often comes as a shock to people more accustomed to manually configuring a router).\u201d Count me as one of those people. I hate having to install an app on my phone or tablet to anything (I wonder how long it will be before I have to use an app to flush a toilet?). The big reason for app hatred is then I have to check the app to see what information I am giving away on the app. Even if I bothered to understand all the permissions and actually read the privacy policy (even reading it doesn\u2019t mean I understand it). Plus having all these app means I have to manage my screens on my phone and wonder about which apps are chewing up memory and bandwidth. And then the update gods MUST be appeased. I just finished reading a physical book. I didn\u2019t have to charge it, update it, reboot it, worry about my privacy, or having it get hacked. I\u2019m glad I updated all my networking equipment this year, which included TP-Link equipment. Sigh, more yellow-peril scaremongering.  The claims against TP-Link apply just as readily to pretty much every other manufacturer out there, including US ones.  They\u2019ve all got vulns, they\u2019ve all been integrated into botnets at one time or another via those vulns, and app-based setup is an annoying creeping death that\u2019s taking over more and more systems.  So the only thing this move will do is (a) make things more expensive for almost everyone and (b) keep up the yellow-peril drumbeat coming from the US. Such issues have long been of concern.  For several generations we have been well served by Apple Airport routers. AFAIK , they were the first to allow configuration, updates only by an app, and featured Apple proprietary code written in a language used by nasa (FWIW). They were rock solid performers which needed little care. They \u201cjust worked\u201d.  Sadly Apple pulled the plug on Airports some years back. They subsequently stopped s\/w updates a couple of years ago, and already\/soon will not support Time Machine backups to Airport Time Capsule units. It is ironic that with Apple\u2019s efforts to facilitate the growth of smart homes, their emphasis on privacy and security, and ease of operation and maintenance, they abandoned a product segment that underpins all of these objectives.  If Apple relaunched Airport line, I would be in line to buy an Airport. I have sold thousands of these TP-Link device and have yet to come across any foul play. They are easy to setup and use! The US Goverment needs to take of business and stay out of the public sector and go back to work. I unmentioned resource about router security is routersecurity [ . ] org, hosted by Michael Horowitz. It is a remarkable compilation about the topic (his interest) with some specific thoughts about securing consumer routers along with other recommendations. We really need more info on which tp-link routers are vulnerable, what the vulnerabilities are, and whether anything can be done (e.g., changing passwords) that will make them safer.  If this is just a matter of anything made in China is bad, then half of the things in my house are a threat.  If Commerce wants us to care about this in needs to divulge more info and prove it to us.

Self-driving robotaxis and delivery robots are already on America's streets. Scaling them up, however, will require a significant amount of money. Investors got a reminder of that this week when Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash reported quarterly earnings. A common topic was each company's plans for autonomous vehicles \u2014 and, to varying degrees, how much they'll need to invest to make them common sights across the US. The most notable example came when delivery company DoorDash reported results on Wednesday. It said it plans to spend \"several hundred million dollars more\" than previously planned on key initiatives, including its autonomous delivery technology, in 2026. DoorDash's autonomous delivery efforts include Dot, a stroller-sized robot launched this year that can navigate itself across bike lanes and sidewalks to make deliveries. \"This is not something that's going to happen overnight,\" CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call Wednesday. \"It does require making investments upfront.\" DoorDash's stock fell 17% on Thursday \u2014 the biggest one-day drop in its history \u2014 after the company unveiled its spending plan. The CEOs of the major ride-hailing services also said that they need to invest more in robotaxis to expand those operations and make money from them. Lyft, which has a partnership with Waymo, for instance, is planning to build a depot in Nashville to charge, service, and store cars available to Lyft riders there. The depot is expected to cost between $10 million and $15 million to build, CFO Erin Brewer said on Lyft's earnings call on Wednesday. The upfront cost is necessary for the self-driving cars to operate smoothly, CEO David Risher said on the call. \"You've got to invest in some physical infrastructure, but we like the unit economics there a lot,\" he said. Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, said on an earnings call Tuesday that self-driving cars are a money-losing venture for the company right now. However, over time, Uber plans to invest in expanding the availability of driverless cars for its users, aiming to increase demand from riders, he said. It's the same model Uber has used in the past and plans to use in several areas of growth, from robotaxis to Moto, which offers trips on motorbikes in some foreign markets, Khosrowshahi said. \"We can turn those products profitable if we want it tomorrow, but it's about the balance of investing in profitability and growth,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"In this era of cheap lithium pouch cells, it might seem mildly anachronistic to build AA batteries into a project. There are enough valid reasons to do so, however, and enough legacy hardware that still takes AAs, that it\u2019s worth spending some time deciding which batteries to use. Luckily for us, [Lumencraft] over on YouTube has done the legwork in the video embedded below, and even produced a handy-dandy spreadsheet. Each battery in the test underwent three separate tests. There was the \u201cleave it in a flashlight \u2019til it dies\u201d test for real-world usage, but also discharge curves logged at 250mA and 2A. The curves for each are embedded in the spreadsheet so you can see what to expect, along with the calculated capacity at each discharge rate. 2A seems like a fairly brutal load for AAs, but it\u2019s great to see how these cells react to extremes. The spreadsheet also includes the cell\u2019s cost to create a value ranking, which will be of great use to our readers in the USA, where it appears [Lumencraft] is buying batteries. The world market is likely to have the same batteries available, but prices may vary by region, so it\u2019s worth double-checking. In the video, [Lumencraft] also takes the time to explain the four battery types commonly found in AA format, and the strengths and weaknesses of each chemistry that might cause you to prefer one over another for specific use cases, rather than going by his value rankings. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s virtually no reason other than cost to go for alkaline batteries in 2025. However, lithium-ion batteries in AA form don\u2019t really outperform NiMH enough to make the added cost worthwhile in all applications, which is why the overall \u201cbest battery\u201d is a \u201cPowerOwl\u201d NiMH. Li-ion\u2019s unspectacular performance is likely in part due to the inefficiencies introduced by a built-in buck converter and safety circuitry. On the other hand, some people might really appreciate that extra safety compared to bare 18650 cells. The results here aren\u2019t too dissimilar to what we saw earlier this year, but we really appreciate [Lumencraft] publishing his results as a spreadsheet for easy reference. The only caveat is that he\u2019s taking manufacturers at their word as to how many cycles the batteries will last. Oh, and just to be 100% clear \u2014 we are talking about double-A batteries, not Anti-Aircraft batteries. If anyone has an anti-aircraft battery hack (especially if that hack includes double-A batteries powering the AA batteries), please send in a tip.\u00a0   I would gladly buy alkalines with even a little lower capacity, if I could be sure they won\u2019t leak and destroy my devices. Duracells seem to be the worst, many times I have seen leaking Duracells in shop, still in their plastic bubble packs, with many years until best before date. I\u2019ve quit RayOVacs for the very same reason. Hoping my good luck with Home Depot\u2019s HDX batteries last. Agreed. Duracells have ruined more things than I can remember.   I quit buying them years ago.  Byer beware. Several battery companies in the 1960\u2019s had slogans like: \u201cIf this battery leaks and damages your flashlight, we will send you a new one.\u201d \u201cShould any device be damaged due to a battery defect, we will repair or replace it at our option.\u201d However, I never heard any testimonials from users who exercised those \u201cguarantees\u201d. An image of the Duracell Copper-Top packaging on Amazon (2021) still has this guarantee printed on the battery packaging. http:\/\/a.co\/d\/bA8FKKa I have never had problems with Energizer Industrial AAs.  They are my go to vs. Duracell Yeah, we used thousands and thousands of aaa\u2019s in my former job, and these and Varta was the only ones we trusted. Just a heads up to all. A brand new set of Ni-MH batteries requires 3 charge\/discharge cycles to reach maximum storage capacity I\u2019ve had good NiMH results with a tenergy charger.  I\u2019ve also had some chargers that \u2018boiled\u2019 the battery til it looked like a hot dog (the heat shrank the wrapper til it split). I\u2019m probably overly cautious, but I only use chargers with a settable charge current and almost always charge AA NiMH at 200 mA so the cells stay cool.  It takes longer but I rotate through multiple sets so I always have a fully charged set ready and it doesn\u2019t matter that it takes a day to recharge. Are there any keywords to find a low and slow NiMH charger? The lowest setting on mine is 500mA. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have good way to search for that since the listings usually don\u2019t state the minimum charge current.  The last time I was shopping for one I constructed a list of chargers with the features I wanted and then tried to find the minimum charge current for each one.  Sometimes I had to look at the specs. in the product pictures and other times I looked through the user manuals.  I ended up buying this unit with different branding:  https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MaximalPower-Universal-Battery-Rechargeable-Batteries\/dp\/B0DSCJFBSK Annoyingly, it defaults to 500 mA so I change the current each time I insert a cell.  I\u2019ve also been very happy with my La Crosse BC-900 that defaults to 200 mA, but it\u2019s long discontinued. The Panasonic BQ-CC17 that comes with Eneloops is pretty slow and reliable. It\u2019s got to be a bit of a minefield with lithium AA: the same form factor can give you 1.7 V (LiFeS), 1.5 V (work-alike alkaline with built-in buck converter, sudden death at end of charge, and bonus RF noise generator), or the native 3.7 V Li-ion voltage ones, which Lumencraft chose not to mention. The 14500 native 3.7 V cells are fantastic, but woe betide joe average consumer who puts it in his device expecting a 1.5 V cell. I prefer the LiFePO4 14500 cells.  For devices that take 2 AA cells, one of these and a blank work great. Yeah, they have nice characteristics, but have half the energy capacity of a \u2018normal\u2019 lithium-ions.  Somewhat lower peak output current too, but that\u2019s not usually a significant limitation. A really nice application for them is 4 in series to make a near-perfect replacement for a 12 V lead-acid cell, at a small fraction of the weight.  Other lithium-ions make an awkward 3-cell (10.2-12.4 V) or 4-cell (13.6-16.8 V) voltage that don\u2019t match up well with devices expecting lead-acid voltages. I love the AA\/AAA battery standard. Easily replaceable, cheap, found everywhere, etc. Having to recharge a freaking computer mouse weekly\/monthly instead of just popping in a new alkaline AA after 12-18 months is just dumb. No, I don\u2019t use \u201cgaming gear\u201d in case someone was wondering. Long live the AA\/AAA! Im good with AA\/AAA but for some reason I keep finding myself adding to a growing collection of devices that want those ridiculous AAAA batteries. This is such a stupid argument I can\u2019t even \u2026. What about eg. C and B cells? How did it look 20 or 30 years ago? When(!) did AA\/AAA become a \u201cstandard\u201d? What if that \u201cstandard\u201d just gets replaced with a similar sized Li* standard? It could even be designed in such a way that the device holding the cell knows the exact chemistry or even more (like SPD data from RAM modules). We went from rs232 + DB9 to USB. From charging via mini-USB through \u00b5USB and now USB-C. Change is possible in in theses cases often quite good in the \u201clong\u201d run. Look at https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/?q=nokia+battery+bl-5c \u2013 it\u2019s a quasi standard today used in tiny wireless keyboards, radios (FM\/AM\/DAB\/whatnot), etc. There\u2019s no reason whatsoever wireless keyboards, mice, headphones, mobile phones, cameras and so much more couldn\u2019t use batteries from the same standard (a small set of specified cell sizes etc.). Conventions become standards, there is no official process. We like AA\/AAA, so it stays. Welcome to earth!    I love the AA\/AAA battery standard. Easily replaceable, cheap, found everywhere, etc.  You could have stopped there.  Everything else you said just discredits that. I genuinely wonder if the writer of this article has any idea about Alkaline cells. They blow lithium out of the water in terms of self discharge and have no safety issues regarding over-discharging. Maybe next time ask Chatgpt for the utility of Alkaline before writing the article? I\u2019m not sure if it was meant to be, but that last line in your comment comes off as deeply insulting. In any case, alkaline batteries aren\u2019t as good for self-discharge as they used to be\u2013 last time I bought a pack of Duracell some of them had actually self-discharged to the point of leaking, and no, it wasn\u2019t some bizarrely old-stock; they weren\u2019t even expired. Note that [Lumencraft]\u2019s suggestion is that we use a specific NiMH battery, not anything lithium. Lithium does indeed have its issues. As said in the article, you need to know your use case. ..and that\u2019s not even touching the disposal convenience.  I really dislike having to save up my old non-alkaline batteries for proper disposal.   Spent Alkaline batteries being able to safely go right into the trashcan is a big selling point for me.    Spent Alkaline batteries being able to safely go right into the trashcan is a big selling point for me.  You sure? Seem to me like your deluding yourself for conveniences sake. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Alkaline_battery&useskin=vector#Disposal    corrosive chemicals in all batteries (new and old), still present problems for disposal\u2014especially in landfills.  If potassium hydroxide (alkaline battery juice) posed a disposal hazard in the quantities typically encountered when throwing away a few AAs, nobody would be able to burn wood at all (ashes contain far more KOH than a handful of batteries). That wikipedia article is simply wrong. I would think rechargables like the famous 18650 would have killed the disposable battery market, I agree with other posters about those awful alkaline batteries with Duracell being the worst at leaking and ruining electronics 18650 didn\u2019t \u201ckill\u201d the disposable battery market, but it DID make it noticeably worst. Meaning, companies no longer feel a burning need to invest into R&D nor use the best technologies available, and prefer to crank out shoddy low-investment products for about the same price (relatively speaking) they were keeping inflated in the 1990s and early 2000s. As a side note, pretty much ALL watch batteries are now seem to be (or quickly moving) into the category of \u201cmail order only\u201d with the well-known risks of getting bad batteries resold by all kinds of shady hoarders of bulk. Where I live (north Delaware) none are available at any stores, large or small, period. Radio Shack, we dearly need you back to fill the widening void the size of Solar System. i hate them all.  the alkalines all leak.  all of them.  i wonder if maybe the cheapest ones don\u2019t leak??  the super expensive ones they have at the drug store all leak. the lithiums are even more expensive (though the alkalines are now so expensive that the difference is almost irrelevant) and they don\u2019t leak but they have a QC problem\u2026i\u2019ve been throwing them away left and right simply for not delivering enough voltage fresh out of the pack.  i understand a range between 1.0V and 2.0V but these are delivering oddball and sometimes negative voltages, like the buck converter is defective.  sadly, threw away a perfectly fine flashlight before i figured out the batteries were going south on their own. nimh is fine if you don\u2019t mind a dodgy charger and abysmal capacity but they top out at 1.2V so they are only useful for a few things. these days i buy flashlights with integrated lipo.  i feel pretty good about it because i don\u2019t use flashlights enough to wear them out but i got a perfect flashlight and used its magnet to put it on my bike frame so i could see what i was doing, and then forgot it there until it fell off in the street :( i keep throwing lithium AAs in my livingroom clock\u2026the irony of putting a $4 battery in a $4 clock.  oh well.  at least it only needs a new one about every other year. i\u2019d like to say my fluke meter is about the only other thing using AAs but i always seem to be buying new ones somehow. i don\u2019t need the best capacity or highest current, i have the idea i might even prefer prehistoric dry cells to what\u2019s available today. NiMH have much more capacity than alkaline. Maybe the problem is your dodgy charger. I have a good quality charger, and it preserves the life of the batteries. Now if we\u2019re talking about selling a consumer device, you definitely can\u2019t trust the average person to have a good charger. NiMH hold their voltage longer than alkaline. So although they start at 1.2, they stay above 1V longer than alkaline. They also have lower internal resistance, so they maintain their voltage under load better than alkaline. Sort of, but not actually accurate.  NiMH do NOT have higher stored energy than alkalines, and their self-discharge limits their applications. NiMH\u2019s lower internal resistance makes it better for high-drain, repeated use.  But in low-drain applications, alkalines shine: they have higher energy content and lower self-discharge. You wouldn\u2019t use alkalines in a flashlight or handheld games, but NiMH are a poor choice for thermostats, clocks, and even remote controls. Too bad you can no longer get the Li-ion AA cells with the built in buck converters from EBL.  They completely disappeared all their product listings on Amazon.  Which is odd as they just announced a new line of them (their fourth itteration).  What happened? maybe they also don\u2019t like amazon, like me. :) EBL is based in the US but manufactures their cells in China.  Trump tariffs destroyed the cost analysis? Depending on the desired form factor D Cell batteries may be better than all of the ones he tested.  They usually cost the almost the same as AA in bulk.  Also see 26650 and 21700 cells.  Protected pouch cells are of course a thing, but are incredibly difficult to shop for if you have very specific dimensions in mind. I like disposable lithium cells for their ability to be drop-in replacements for alkalines without the worry of leaking in devices like remote weather sensors.  I also don\u2019t need to worry my wife or kids replacing discharged cells in something I don\u2019t closely control will accidently throw out perfectly good rechargeable cells. Target\u2026 AA\u2026 Flak Any thoughts on Project Farm\u2019s video on NiMH batteries from a few years ago?  I went with the Harbor Freight brand based on that analysis and haven\u2019t been let down so far. Why no XTAR 4150mWh 1.5v lithium?

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"                 Reading time 8 minutes        I feel no compunction telling you the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite gaming headset wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t made for most of the people reading this review. How premium is it? It costs $600. It comes with a special GameHub that will hook up to three consoles or PCs at once to let you seamlessly swap between all your devices. It also costs $600. It has some of the best premium audio I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard from a gaming headset all year. It will ask you to fork over $600 for the privilege. The Arctis Nova Elite chock-full of small amenities, which combines with all the other features to make the gaming headset so simple to operate. All, for $600. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily the most expensive headset I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used, which makes it that much more annoying when I admit I enjoyed it as much as I did. SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite There are few gaming headsets as feature rich or as expensive as the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite.  Pros Cons The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing anything we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen before, even when its price tag is one of the highest we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen. The $400 Logitech G Astro A50 X used a large base for video passthrough to hook up all your devices to one place. The more recent $180 Astro A20 X does something similar to the Arctis Nova Elite, though with only two instead of three outputs for different consoles on a miniature station.\u00c2\u00a0 SteelSeries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ultra-premium device isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the first to use a miniature OLED screen to display your headset settings, either. The $400 Razer Kraken V4 Pro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base station lacks the extra console and PC outputs, but its metal frame feels more premium when it\u2019s sitting on your desk than SteelSeries\u2019 plastic. SteelSeries was adamant this is the first \u00e2\u0080\u009cHi-Res\u00e2\u0080\u009d gaming headset, mostly due to it receiving certification from the Japan Audio Society. But there are other companies promising their gaming headsets can offer players the audiophile experience. Gizmodo Senior Writer James Pero recently reviewed the $360 VZR Model One MK II hi-fi headest. My ears are still begging me to return to the brilliant tones of the Sony Inzone H9 II, which used the same audio drivers as the class-leading Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones. So, no, this is not the first gaming headset with any variety of audiophile-level sound. Instead, the Arctis Nova Elite is the first gaming headset I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used that has everything (and like an everything bagel, that certainly won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t please everyone). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sporting some quality active noise cancellation (ANC), though not the best in its class. Its audio capabilities are certainly top tier (though I may still prefer the Sony Inzone H9 II for pure gaming audio bliss). The headset makes connecting to every one of my devices seamless, and it supports four separate streams of simultaneous audio (though it will require downloading the Arctis app to your phone and the GG app to your computer to adjust equalization options for each device individually). The Arctis Nova Elite is built for the dedicated gamer, the one who has one spot in their home where they play. In that very specific case, this is one of the best headsets I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no getting around it. The Arctis Nova Elite alone costs more than a PlayStation 5 console even after price hikes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used enough SteelSeries headsets to know its typical design ethos. In effect, the Arctis Nova Elite is an upgraded version of the Nova Pro Wireless, with metallic frames and a metallic volume wheel. This gaming headset looks especially good with its cream and gold colorway. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if anything about the it desgin reads that it\u2019s worth so much money. The sound is where things matter, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the Arctis Nova Elite has got going for it. The twin carbon fiber drivers offer a clean audio presence at its baseline. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capable of lossless 24-bit, 96kHz wireless audio, though consoles like the Xbox Series X and PS5 are limited to 48k\/16-bit. It may take a few hours of listening, but eventually I came to recognize the Arctis Nova Elite\u2019s true potential once I put it through its paces in various titles of various styles. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so used to shoving your AirPods in your ears every morning commute, hearing quality audio from a dedicated hi-fi headset can honestly leave you in tears. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start to identify subtleties placed by careful hands in the songs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a million times before. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason some people become obsessed with audio quality. Once you reach the top of the mountain, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that much more difficult to crawl back down and live among the rocks and weeds. Once I connected the Arctis Nova Elite to my phone, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forced to disconnect from PC or consoles. It makes living your life inside the headset easier. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand it for too long, though. While the memory foam cups are plush with a pillow-like softness surrounding my ears, the headset wants to hug my head tighter than others to get that perfect seal. There was a growing pressure between my eyes as I used it, forcing me to take intermittent breaks. The Arctis Nova Elite could easily be my one and only gaming headset. That being said, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know many people who bother with more than one. SteelSeries suggested it could be your audio buddy even when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not near your couch or desk. The gaming headset comes with a soft felt-lined pouch that snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic clasp. If you want something more protective like a hard case, you\u2019ll have to buy it separately. The thing is, the best headphones are designed so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look look like an alien when wearing them. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look classy with your head shoved between these cans like you do with your AirPods Max. These are designed to wear for hours and hours. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand them for that long. Maybe somebody with a thinner cranium would enjoy them for longer. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into the app to adjust the EQ profile to fit the game, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end up with a much worse experience overall. SteelSeries has a ludicrous number of game-specific profiles for some of the most popular games around and even more you would not expect the company to bother with (there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a preset for Doki Doki Literature Club!, for goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake). So if you load up into your Cyberpunk 2077 save, and enter without the preset bass profile, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anywhere near the levels you want to make your machine gun fire truly pop. This requires you to manually change their settings from game to game if you want the best experience. Inevitably, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come across a game that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too new for it to have an EQ profile. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been playing The Outer Worlds 2, which has a soundtrack that\u2019s equal parts mystery and nostalgia. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sound bad by any margin with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cflat\u00e2\u0080\u009d preset in the Arctis app. I just know deep in my soul the game could sound better with a few knobs twisted. If you scroll through all the preset EQ options, you can find one or two that will sound better to your ears. For instance, I played Gears of War: Reloaded with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 preset and it sounded much better than with the stock standard profile. At least, the GameHub lets you swap and adjust the volume mixing between the first and second USB inputs. Swapping between Bluetooth and the 2.4GHz connection doesn\u2019t require much input. Still, if you want to take a call in the headphones, you\u2019ll need to hit the Bluetooth button on the right earpad. SteelSeries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cflat\u00e2\u0080\u009d profile is fine for most listening experiences, including music or when talking on video calls. When I got on with some of my coworkers, they told me I sounded extremely clear, nearly\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not quite\u00e2\u0080\u0094podcast levels of clarity. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impressive considering the telescoping mic wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even wearing a pop filter. The mic offers 16-bit 32kHz recordings, and listening to myself back I can confirm it\u2019s of good quality. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an additional mute button the left earcup if you need to avoid any back chatter when gaming with friends or even chatting with workmates. Again, it could be my everything headset when at home I could stand wearing it for too long. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of positive qualities to this design. I could walk 30 feet away from the GameHub with a wall in between me and my desktop, and still hear my game as clear as if I was standing next to it. Only when I put multiple walls between me and the device did the sound start to waver. The ANC is good enough I would repeatedly miss what my colleagues were saying even if they were talking right next to me. With the ANC on, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear the blast of the loud fans from the Acer Predator Triton 14 gaming laptop I recently reviewed. Still, I could occasionally hear ambient noise, like the distant pop of a fire truck siren or a loud bang on a conversation my boss was having on the other side of the room. The Arctis Nova Elite is more than enough for your gaming den when you want to hole up like a happy otter and ignore the rushing river waters around you. It just won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer anything close to the sensory deprivation chamber sensation of some high-end ANC wireless headphones like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen). If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing missing from the Arctis Nova Elite, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a battery life equal to its $600 price tag. SteelSeries promises you can get 60 hours of active listening, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only when you make use of two separate batteries. The GameHub comes with a small compartment that accepts one of two cells that come in the box. The magnetized cap on the right-hand earcup comes off to reveal the battery. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not technically hot-swappable, as removing the battery will turn off the sound. Swapping in a fresh battery will immediately turn the headset on and return you back to your various connections. By comparison, a $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless can go for 250 hours before you need to plug it in. I keep bringing up other headsets that cost less just to explain where we are with the current landscape of gaming cans. Nothing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried has even came close to SteelSeries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 price point. There are other gaming headsets that promise hi-fi audio or let you connect all your consoles. The Arctis Nova Elite is the only pair that I know of that provides both in one package. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of any other headset I would want more if I have all my gaming devices in one spot. I also know I personally couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drop $600 on any headset. Even if I did opt for the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite, I would have to consider if I could accept Bluetooth more often than the 2.4GHz connection. Even though I own a PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2, and get to test a rotating cast of PCs, I spend more time gaming on a handheld than anything else. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly a few folks out there who are glued to their gaming chairs and want a headset for every single device they own. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of anything better than the Arctis Nova Elite.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"It's the body's superhighway that carries information from your brain to your major organs. You might not have a clue it exists - let alone that you might need to train it. But a quick scroll through my social media and there's a whole array of tips on the vagus nerve - how to heal it, stimulate it, even reset it - all to apparently reduce stress and anxiety levels. Poking your ear with what looks like a rubber toothbrush, moving your eyes from side to side, tapping your body or gargling water while wearing a weighted vest - these are just some of the techniques being recommended to train that nerve and improve your wellbeing. With our stress levels sky-high, and burnout on the rise among under-35s, it's no wonder many of the posts on socials have gone viral with millions of hits. Some of these methods might seem a bit absurd. But is it really possible to train your mighty internal messenger, and could that actually bring quick relief to life's stresses? I decided to find out by coming to small candle-lit studio in Stockport town centre - where I find myself in a small group, humming loudly. Humming, I am told, can help stimulate our vagus nerve and slow down our heart rate. And I do start to feel a bit more relaxed. I can feel the low hum vibrating in my body and my brain seems a bit less busy. At this somatics class, yoga therapist Eirian Collinge guides us through a session of gentle moves combining deep breathing, rocking and swaying. While she doesn't buy into all the techniques on socials, Eirian says there are parts of her practice that use breathwork, eye movements and tapping. But, she says, \"it's a process\" and there's no quick fix. It is rooted in a theory that suggests we can calm down our nervous system by connecting with our bodies. Some scientists say this is an over-simplification of our complex internal systems. But others say it can be effective in helping us find a snippet of calm in a busy, intense world. Sarah, who is lying down just a few mats away from me,  started coming to this class about a year ago. She says the practice has been life-changing. \"I actually cried after the first session,\" she says. \"It felt like the first time my brain has ever switched off.\" The 35-year-old, who struggles with her mental health, says it feels like she is \"flossing her brain\". Sarah's partner, Xander, agrees. It's made him more aware of his feelings. \"As a man,\" he explains, \"We are not really programmed to do that. \"I've struggled with depression for most of my adult life, but now, instead of trying to fix my thoughts I can sit with my emotions and accept them. \"If things get a bit much for me I can peel back a little from work. Go for a run, get out in the hills, for example. \"Understanding my nervous system is a huge part of that.\" The vagus - Latin for \"wandering\" - starts in the brain as two main branches - left and right - that connect to every major organ, constantly relaying vital information back and forth. It's part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls things we don't think about, like breathing, heart rate and digestion.  The system, in part, is made up of: If one of these is out of sync we start to see problems. But can we really reset the balance ourselves, by attempting to activate the vagus nerve? Consultant psychiatrist Prof Hamish McAllister-Williams is sceptical.  \"We have good evidence vagus nerve stimulation can help with neurological disorders like epilepsy and mental illnesses like treatment-resistant depression,\" he says, \"but that comes from a device that is fitted in the body - a bit like a pacemaker which sends pulses of electrical energy to the vagus nerve.\" That device sends mild electrical stimulations through the vagus nerve to the brain, sparking a release of chemicals like serotonin and dopamine which help us regulate our mood. While vagus nerve stimulation inside the body requires invasive surgery and is available for a small cohort of patients on the NHS, there is now a growing market for wearable - non-invasive - technology.  These devices, which cost anything from \u00a3200 to more than \u00a31,000, tend to be clipped on the ear, worn round the neck or placed on the chest. \"The are some credible studies that suggest these external stimulators can potentially impact on brain activity,\" Prof McAllister-Williams explains. \"But there is a lot less evidence than for the internal devices.\" With external devices, the electrical impulses need to travel through skin, tissue, muscle and fat so it's not as simple and direct as a stimulator in the body. After she experienced burnout, Lucy Lambert says such non-invasive vagus nerve stimulators helped her. The mother-of-three left her job as a primary school teacher because she was so completely \"stressed, tired and anxious\". \"I had been running on empty for so long - I didn't realise,\" Lucy says. \"Then it hit. The to-do list of life became too much. \"The mental load was so huge I couldn't get out of bed.\" After exhausting various medical routes and feeling like she was getting nowhere, Lisa's brother recommended one of these devices which vibrates, claiming to send low-level electrical pulses to the vagus nerve, often through the skin in the neck or ear area. \"I noticed that when I started to feel overwhelmed, I would get a headache first. \"I would then wear a device for 10 minutes twice a day; the pain from the headache would go, and my whole body would calm down. \"The vibrations, they really do something.\" She says the devices didn't fix burnout but they helped her create \"conditions where real healing can happen\". Dr Chris Barker, who works in pain management, says this area of medicine is still developing. He says there is a growing understanding of the importance of the vagus nerve, but while there is \"clear evidence\" around the impact an unbalanced nervous system can have on everything from our mental health to our heart rate and our ability to digest food, it does not mean we have the all the answers - yet - on how to correct the problems. \"It's really rational to focus on something that's problematic - and try to fix it. \"Our bodies are, of course, really complex, and sometimes the problem we see may be part of an imbalance in a wider system.\" It's not about going to extremes, he says. It's \"about figuring out what works for you\" - and that can often take time. It's worth noting if you have underlying heart or respiratory conditions you should seek medical advice before trying to rebalance or stimulate your nervous system. Now, several years after experiencing burnout, Lucy, 47, is launching her own business helping others to build emotional resilience and confidence. She still uses her devices daily, meditates, and regularly checks in with how she is feeling. \"The devices make me rest and switch off.\" But she agrees it is difficult to know whether it's the devices making the difference or the fact she is taking some much-needed time out. There is a lack of robust scientific evidence behind these devices but for Lucy, they've played an important part in her recovery. Understanding her nervous system and the importance of the vagus nerve has empowered her, she says. \"It's helped me take ownership of my own mental health and wellbeing, and that's massive.\" Four months after a young woman died in a mental health unit, another patient tried to harm herself in similar circumstances, leaked documents show. Robert Edwards says boxing and asking for help turned his life around after mental health struggles. In her first UK interview Megan Garcia speaks to Laura Kuenssberg about the death of her teenage son. The comedian contacted Geraint John after his wife Deb died and has helped him while he grieves.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"For years, South Korea was the global heartbeat of crypto speculation. It became the place where digital coins traded at a premium, and where retail investors moved markets overnight. The \u201cKimchi Premium\u201d became shorthand for a national obsession: Rampant and frenetic trading activity unrivaled by any region across the globe. But by late 2025, the story has reversed. The same traders who once hunted for the next altcoin gem on Upbit are now glued to Korean stock exchange tickers, swapping meme tokens for memory chips and high-bandwidth semiconductors. The crypto charts have gone quiet \u2014 and a new speculative engine has taken their place. Upbit, once the undisputed hub of Korean crypto mania, now trades at a fraction of its former pace. Average daily volumes have dropped nearly 80% from a year ago, slipping from roughly $9 billion in late 2024 to just $1.8 billion by November 2025. Bithumb, Korea\u2019s second-largest exchange, has suffered a similar fate, losing more than two-thirds of its liquidity over the same period, according to reporting from Wu Blockchain. What was once a nightly national pastime, the endless churn of small-cap coins and chatroom rumors, has evaporated. Even volatility itself has collapsed. Where daily volumes once swung wildly between $5 billion and $27 billion, 2025\u2019s trading bands have flattened to a muted $2 to $4 billion range. Data from analytics provider Dune shows that the drop in activity is compounded when compared to 2018, when at the mania's peak Korean exchanges facilitated 280,000 deposits per day; the daily figure hasn\u2019t exceeded 50,000 since 2021. The vacuum left by crypto didn\u2019t last long. Retail investors simply migrated to a different table \u2014 the Korean stock market, which has staged one of the most explosive rallies in its history. The KOSPI index has surged more than 70% year-to-date, setting a number of record highs. In October alone, it posted its strongest monthly gain since 2001, climbing 21% and logging 17 new intraday records. The frenzy has been led by AI-linked giants like Samsung Electronics and SK hynix, whose combined daily turnover now makes up more than a quarter of the entire exchange. In a country that once traded crypto as a kind of collective hobby, the psychology feels familiar. The same spirit of retail speculation has resurfaced, only this time it\u2019s wearing a suit of semiconductor stocks.Data reported by the Korea Times showed the amount of active trading accounts in the nation jumped from 86.57 million at the turn of the year to 95.33 million as of Oct. 31. Unlike the meme-driven altcoin rallies of old, Korea\u2019s equity boom has a more tangible backbone. AI is the global growth narrative of the decade, and Korea happens to control one of its most critical supply chains. As Nvidia and AMD fuel much of the world\u2019s demand for AI hardware, Korean firms like SK hynix and Samsung have become indispensable. Their dominance in high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a key component for AI training, has turned them into national champions. Add to that a government keen on revitalizing domestic markets, and you get what some analysts call a \u201cpolicy-backed bull run.\u201d President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s administration has pushed reforms to reduce the long-standing \u201cKorea Discount,\u201d encouraging higher dividends, tighter governance and incentives for retail and institutional investment at home. Speculation in the Korean crypto community was never about restraint; it was about rhythm and speed. That hasn\u2019t changed. Margin lending is booming again, leveraged ETFs are flying off the shelves and retail participation has doubled in just a year. According to Bloomberg data, leveraged retail positions now make up nearly 30% of total holdings, with younger traders leading the charge. In other words, the migration from crypto to equities isn\u2019t a retreat, it\u2019s a reallocation of risk appetite. Koreans haven\u2019t abandoned speculation; they\u2019ve just found a venue where the leverage feels legitimate and the upside patriotic. But this shift has consequences. Without Korean retail as a liquidity anchor, global crypto markets have lost one of their most consistent buyers. Memecoin rallies that once lit up Korean chatrooms now fizzle faster. And the wider market in general is in need of a spark; bitcoin currently trades around $100,000 despite recording an all-time high one month ago, while several altcoins lost upwards of 20% over the past month. Crypto\u2019s \u201cKimchi traders\u201d may have stepped away, but history suggests they won\u2019t be gone forever. When the AI trade cools, which analysts are suggesting may be on the near horizon, or when the next major crypto narrative arrives, the same traders could come roaring back, armed with new capital and sharper reflexes. For now, Korea\u2019s retail traders have swapped blockchains for circuit boards, chasing the same rush in a different arena.

To offer a wide-range of traditional cable networks on its live TV streaming service, YouTube TV frequently enters negotiations with legacy media companies. Google successfully negotiated public bouts with NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Fox this year, but its ongoing battle with Disney appears to be different. Disney's 21 channels have been unavailable on YouTube TV since Oct. 31 as the talks drag on into their second week. Both sides have took to their various channels and platforms to advocate for a \"fair\" deal. The situation escalated Friday, Nov. 7 when an internal Disney memo leaked to the press \u2014 penned by Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN's chairman, and Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, the co-chairs of Disney Entertainment. The Athletic's Andrew Marchand obtained the document, which accused YouTube TV as demanding special treatment: Rather than compete on a level playing field, Google\u2019s YouTube TV has approached these negotiations as if it were the only player in the game...It goes without saying that the reason so many consumers value our programming above others is because we invest in the best talent, creators and content in the world, and we cannot allow anyone to undercut our ability to do so. YouTube TV responded with a strong statement alleging Disney intentionally leaked the memo to The Athletic. \"Once again, Disney is resorting to their old tactics like leaking documents to the press, negotiating in public through their paid talent and misrepresenting the facts including from the deals they\u2019ve offered and taking credit for our product proposals,\" YouTube TV told Marchand, according to a post on X (formerly Twitter). \"Our team stands ready to make a fair agreement in line with their deals with other distributors and we encourage Disney to come to the table and do what's best for our mutual customers.\" YouTube response: \u201cOnce again, Disney is resorting to their old tactics like leaking documents to the press, negotiating in public through their paid talent and misrepresenting the facts including from the deals they\u2019ve offered and taking credit for our product proposals. Our\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/ArfTLyEeuvNovember 7, 2025 The statement also criticized Disney's use of its on-air talent, including major personalities like Stephen A. Smith, to try and sway public interest in the company's favor. Pat McAfee, a sports personality who appears on-air for ESPN in multiple capacities, similarly criticized the strategy (via Awful Announcing): We need each other. A lot of people saying \u2018greedy corporations,\u2019 it\u2019s like, yeah. We need each other, especially with where sports are right now.

I don\u2019t want to do that, so stop \u2026 all you\u2019re doing is pissing everybody off even more. So it\u2019s like, let\u2019s just not do that. In the leaked internal memo, Disney also expressed an unwillingness to budge from its stance on the ongoing content negotiations. \"YouTube TV continues to insist on receiving preferential terms that are below market and has made few concessions,\" the memo reads.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":" Dubai\u2019s getting another jaw-dropping addition to its skyline, and this one\u2019s a real showstopper. Sobha Realty just unveiled Sobha SkyParks, a massive 109-story tower that\u2019ll stretch 450 meters into the sky. \u200c\u202a\u202c When it\u2019s done, this giant will rank among the UAE\u2019s five tallest buildings\u2014quite a feat for any developer. The project comprises 684 luxury apartments across 109 floors, each offering incredible views of the city sprawling below. \u200c\u202a\u202c For Sobha Realty, this isn\u2019t just another project\u2014it\u2019s their tallest development yet, pushing them into entirely new territory in Dubai\u2019s competitive luxury market. The tower\u2019s landing on Sheikh Zayed Road in Business Bay which is about as prime as real estate gets in Dubai. This stretch of road has become synonymous with luxury living, and Sobha SkyParks fits right into that narrative. \u200c\u202a\u202c Business Bay\u2019s infrastructure is already well-established, and being so close to Downtown Dubai doesn\u2019t hurt either. The location practically sells itself\u2014residents get easy access to business districts, shopping, and transport links throughout the city. \u200c\u202a\u202c Sheikh Zayed Road has this way of making every building along it feel important, and Sobha SkyParks certainly won\u2019t be an exception to that rule. Designer: Sobha Realty        Here\u2019s where things get interesting, though. Instead of just building another tall glass tower, Sobha\u2019s doing something different with four themed sky gardens scattered throughout the building\u2019s height. \u200c\u202a\u202c Think about it\u2014actual parks floating hundreds of meters above the street. It\u2019s not just a cool concept; it tackles that age-old problem of urban living where green space feels like a luxury. These aren\u2019t tiny balcony gardens either; we\u2019re talking about proper outdoor spaces that bring nature up to where people actually live. The whole multilevel garden approach is getting attention from architecture circles as a fresh take on sustainable urban development. \u200c\u202a\u202c The building\u2019s crown jewel has to be the sky-high infinity pool. Picture swimming laps while looking out over all of Dubai\u2014it\u2019s the kind of amenity that sounds almost too good to be true. \u200c\u202a\u202c Francis Alfred from Sobha Realty puts it well, saying they\u2019re trying to \u201cblend art, engineering, and lifestyle into a single masterpiece.\u201d \u200c\u202a\u202c That\u2019s not just marketing speak, either. When you combine the elevated parks with amenities like that infinity pool, you\u2019re looking at something that goes way beyond typical luxury housing. It\u2019s more like they\u2019re building a vertical neighborhood where everything you need is stacked up instead of spread out.       The real estate crowd is already buzzing about what this could mean for Dubai\u2019s market. \u200c\u202a\u202c Sobha\u2019s built a solid reputation over the years, so when they go big like this, people pay attention. The project\u2019s been making rounds on social media and industry forums, with everyone from investors to architecture enthusiasts weighing in on what it means for the city\u2019s future. \u200c\u202a\u202c Dubai keeps attracting international buyers looking for something special, and Sobha SkyParks seems designed exactly for that market. It\u2019s not just about having a nice apartment anymore\u2014people want experiences, views, and bragging rights that come with living somewhere truly unique. Construction\u2019s underway, and this project represents something bigger for Sobha Realty. \u200c\u202a\u202c They\u2019re clearly making a statement about where they want to position themselves in Dubai\u2019s ultra-luxury segment. By the time this tower\u2019s finished, it won\u2019t just be another address\u2014it\u2019ll be a landmark that changes how people think about living vertically in one of the world\u2019s most ambitious cities. Dubai\u2019s always been about pushing boundaries, and Sobha SkyParks fits perfectly into that story. The combination of record-breaking height, innovative design, and those sky-high amenities should set new expectations for what luxury living can look like when you\u2019re willing to think outside the box.  Look, I\u2019ve seen enough \u201ceco-friendly\u201d product launches to fill a landfill, which is precisely the irony we\u2019re dealing with here.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":" Large, long-term crypto and Bitcoin investors continue to sell into the market, keeping asset prices from hitting a blow-off top.  Crypto whales and long-term holders are cashing out, exerting constant selling pressure on markets, and keeping crypto prices suppressed, similar to market dynamics following the 2000s dot-com stock market crash, according to analyst Jordi Visser. Visser said the current price action in the crypto market is reminiscent of the period following the 2000 dot-com stock market bubble, which crashed stocks by up to 80%, followed by 16 years of consolidation before they regained their previous highs. This meant that venture capitalists, who invested in tech during the crash, were forced to hold their investments due to mandated lock-up periods as they treaded water and then desperately sold into the markets as soon as they were able to, Visser said. He added: Visser clarified that it would not take 16 years for crypto prices to rebound, but was using the 2000s dot-com aftermath to illustrate the sell-side pressure dynamics at play, and said crypto is nearing the end of this consolidation phase, with a maximum of 1 year left. The analysis came amid fears that a crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) bear market kicked off in October, causing several analysts and investment firms to revise their most bullish price predictions by lowering their forecasts.Related: $100B in old Bitcoin moved, raising \u2018OG\u2019 versus \u2018trader\u2019 debate The price of BTC shows signs of bottoming out around $100,000, according to some analysts, but others fear a potential drop to $92,000 if selling pressure continues to mount. Whales and long-term holders typically cash in at all-time highs, and whale selling is not a problem in and of itself, CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno said. The sell-side pressure from whales and long-term holders only suppresses asset prices if new demand is not there to soak up the BTC supply being dumped on the markets.\u201cSince October, long-term holder selling has increased; nothing new here, but demand is contracting, unable to absorb long-term holder supply at a higher price,\u201d Moreno said.

Today we take a look at 7\u00a0personal finance goals for your 30s. While many of the goals you should set\u00a0during this decade of your life are simply a continuation of those you hopefully started on in the previous one, your thirties\u00a0bring some unique personal finance challenges that didn\u2019t exist when you were a relatively carefree 20-something. As a friend once put it, \u201cIn your 30s, you\u2019re just running.\u201d You\u2019re likely married, have small children, and your career is starting to take off \u2014 everything\u2019s launching and\/or accelerating at once. And with these new responsibilities\u00a0come new personal finance goals. As you read the suggested personal finance goals for your 30s, keep in mind that everyone is in a different place, so naturally everyone is going to have different objectives. But if you\u2019re feeling confused and overwhelmed about money, it\u2019s sometimes helpful to see suggestions for milestones to hit at certain points in your life. You can then take those broad suggestions and refine them so they fit your personal circumstances. (In your 40s? We also have a guide to finance goals for that decade of life.) Hopefully by now you\u2019ve started an emergency fund. In your 20s, the goal was to get at least $1,000 in your savings account before you started paying off your debt. This provided a small cushion to prevent your financial life from derailing in the face of unforeseen expenses. In your 30s, you likely have more on the line than you did in your 20s \u2014 like a wife and kids to take care of and a mortgage. While having $1,000 in savings will certainly help, you\u2019ll want even more security than that in the event you lose your job due to a layoff or injury. To that end, make it a goal to save at least six months of income in your emergency fund while in your 30s. Why six months? Studies have shown that after you lose a job, it takes around that amount of time to get a new one. Having six months\u2019 worth of income in your savings account will ensure that you can continue to support your family while you\u2019re hitting the pavement looking for a job. And besides protecting you from negative events, having six months of cash in the bank gives you a bit of freedom to take some risks. Maybe you finally want to start that business you\u2019ve been dreaming about or perhaps an opportunity comes up to travel for three months. Your emergency fund can help you take advantage of those opportunities. In short, six months of cash in the bank is one very effective way of becoming more\u00a0antifragile. For extra personal finance points, try to save one year\u2019s worth of income by the time you\u00a0turn 40. In your 20s, you paid off all your credit card debt and started a\u00a0debt repayment plan for your student loans. In your 30s, the goal is to stick to that plan \u2014 keeping credit card debt at bay and paying off all your non-mortgage debt. Be aggressive with it. Slash your expenses with frugal living,\u00a0earn extra money through side hustles, and divert as much of your savings and income as possible towards eliminating\u00a0your student loans and any other debt. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to pay off\u00a0your debt while trying to support a family with an average income job, just read the experiences of folks who followed Dave Ramsey\u2019s Total Money Makeover program. You\u2019ll find several examples of families of five or six, where the husband was the sole full-time income earner,\u00a0who still managed to pay down\u00a0down six-figures of debt in just a few years. It just takes dedication and sacrifice. Hopefully by now you have some sort of retirement account set up and are making regular contributions to it; you won\u2019t be one of the 40%(!) of Baby Boomers who have nothing saved for their golden years. As you pay off more of your debt, start shifting some of the money that\u2019s no longer going to loans to your retirement\u00a0account. Most personal finance experts agree that in your 30s you should be saving at least 15% of your income for retirement. If you want to make sure you have plenty, aim for 20%. Don\u2019t know what to invest in? Check out our post on index funds \u2014 the best stock market investment option for just about everyone. You\u2019re going to die someday. Could be in 50 years or it could be tomorrow. Whenever it happens, your estate will have to be set in order and distributed to your survivors.\u00a0If you want to control how your stuff gets doled out when you\u2019re gone and make the process as hassle and conflict-free as possible for your loved ones, you\u2019ll need to have a will or a trust in place. Wills and trusts are particularly important if you have children. If you and your wife both die, who do you want to take care of them? How do you want the money in your accounts spent to raise them? In addition to a will or trust, your estate plan should have documents like an advance directive and durable power of attorney. Instead of your family arguing about whether to pull the plug on you when you\u2019re in a coma, make that decision yourself with a living will and a health care surrogate designation (the person who gets to call the shots when you\u2019re incapable of doing so). For more information, see our article on estate planning. When you\u2019re in your 30s, you\u2019re starting to build up a financial foundation that permits you to give your family comfort and security. But what would happen if you died tomorrow? Would your family still be able to live comfortably or would they be scrambling to figure out how to make ends meet because you\u2019re no longer around to provide for them? Take a step to ensure your family is taken care of by purchasing term life insurance. It\u2019s key that you make sure the life insurance policy you get is term life insurance. There\u2019s another type of life insurance out there called\u00a0cash value or whole life policies\u00a0that are much more expensive and confusing; it lasts for your entire life, and you have to pay into it until you die. With term life insurance, on the other hand, you pay a monthly premium for a set term (could be 10, 20, or 30 years). If you die within the term, the insurance company will pay out a specified amount to your beneficiaries. So for example, if you bought a $500,000, 20-year term life insurance policy, if you kicked the bucket 10 years after purchasing the policy, your wife (or whoever you set as the beneficiary) will get $500,000 from the insurance company. Most people don\u2019t buy life insurance because they think it costs too much. But as financial planner Jeff Rose wrote in a previous post: Not true! A healthy 35-year-old man can get $500,000 of term insurance for 20 years for the price of 6 Double-Doubles per month at In-N-Out Burger. While you won\u2019t get the same immediate gratification when making the payment, you can rest assured that your family is taken care of. And what if you outlive the term of the policy? Well, congratulations! You\u2019re still alive. That\u2019s great news. Hopefully, you\u2019ve been saving enough during that time that you\u2019ll have so much\u00a0money\u00a0that you won\u2019t need another insurance policy to take care of your loved ones after you die of old age. I don\u2019t know what the future of higher education is going to be. Perhaps in the next 15 years, people will be able to get a college education for free online, or maybe college tuition will keep increasing at a rate of 5% each year. I\u2019m hoping for the former, but banking \u2014 quite literally \u2014 on the latter. As soon as each of my kids were born, I set up a 529 college savings account for them to which I\u00a0now make regular monthly contributions.\u00a0While you can\u2019t write off the amount you contribute to a 529 on your taxes, the interest the account generates is tax free. So if Junior\u2019s plan earns $10,000 in interest, you don\u2019t have to pay taxes on that $10,000 when he starts withdrawing money to pay for\u00a0school. If your child decides not to go to college, you can re-assign the account to another child and pass along\u00a0the tax-free earnings. If that\u2019s not an option, you can cash the account out but pay\u00a0a 10% penalty on the earnings accrued. When you were in your 20s, your finances were probably rather simple. You may have had just a checking and a savings account and maybe a few bills. When you get into your 30s, your finances start getting more complex \u2014 mortgages, homeowners insurance, multiple retirement accounts, college savings plans, maybe even a side-hustle business. All these additions to your financial picture will definitely make taxes more complicated. While you can use software to guide you through the process, a certified personal accountant can make sure you\u2019re not paying more in taxes than you should be and will save you a ton of time \u2014 especially if your finances are a little more complex than the average joe\u2019s. Up until a few years ago, I did my own taxes with TurboTax. With expanding business and financial complexities, taxes took me forever, and I was definitely leaving money on the table. So I decided to hire an accountant, and it is easily one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. She quickly found places where I was overpaying on taxes. Best of all, I hardly spend any time on my taxes myself. Just a few minutes gathering forms for her and then reviewing them before I send them in.

The EU is demanding that Belgium basically hands over those frozen Russian funds to Zelensky. Belgium is saying that when the Russians come for their money all lawyered-up, that Belgium alone will be on the hook for all that money. In addition, Euroclear will be destroyed as no country in the world will trust them to hold their money anymore and the Belgium economy will blow up and impoverish the whole country. This being the case, Belgium is demanding that every member State of the EU sign a legal document saying that they will be on the hook for that money as well and no, they will not accept EU promises to have Belgium\u2019s back. The EU is saying \u2018Hey, let\u2019s not get crazy here. You can trust us, bro. We will absolutely be there for you so just give Zelensky all that money and everything will work out.\u2019 Belgium thought about it for a moment and said \u2018Nope!\u2019 And that is where we are. Do I understand it coreectly that the Belgians are all for stealing the money, they just don\u2019t want to steal them alone? At the firat quick glance I was disturbed by the idea that there may be rational European politicians taking their country\u2019s best into account. Thar would be out of line. At second reading it seems that we may all be calm. The Belgians are mad too. They just want to take it with some dignity, not end up looking like petty thieves. Strength in numbers, man. Too late for that. If I\u2019m understanding this correctly, those \u201cRussian assets\u201d are held (in custody) at Euroclear, one of the world\u2019s largest securities custodial and clearing houses. Allowing these assets to be looted would destroy EC\u2019s reputation. Euro clear and its parent company are domiciled in Belgium, subjecting them to liability in the form of international trade disputes involving Euroclear. From Euroclear\u2019s Our Group structure here are the main strengths\/selling points EC points to, The advantages of this structure are: high levels of market interoperability, linking domestic markets with the international market and vice versa integrated platforms and processes for seamless transitions between settlement, financing and collateral management services reduced systemic risk In my day job, I\u2019ve dealt with Euroclear and they are a very cautious and pragmatic outfit, seeing themselves as a utility and self-regulating to fend off any criticism or political takeover. I can well imagine that their compliance function and likely all the lawyers will walk out the door if this theft goes forward. Thank you. I\u2019m in a similar position and agree. I think that you got it exactly. It gets even worse though. If they swipe those Russian assets, how many countries will be happy to have their financial assets in the EU anymore. I was reading the other day that financial investments in Europe is way down so it has already started. Have you seen the latest reports coming out that Norway is set to guarantee the loans, e,g, from le Monde, EU considers Norwegian solution to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s \u2018reparations loan\u2019 : \u201cThe European Commission wants to use frozen Russian assets to lend \u20ac140 billion to Kyiv. A majority of Norway\u2019s political parties back the idea that the country and its vast sovereign wealth fund could act as guarantor.\u201d Any Norwegians in the commentariat ? How do you feel, as a citizen of a country of less than 6 million, about underwriting a debt that would work out at something like $25,000 for every man, woman, and child in Norway ? It\u2019s not for nothing they put the useful idiot Jens Stoltenberg in the position of finance minister. I\u2019m sure they can write it off as defense spending, as mandated in the big, beautiful NATO consensus. Obviously they think it\u2019s a better option for their obese national wealth fund than AI data centres. Might be cheaper just to offer russian\/chinese language courses to them all. It is beyond stunning that Russia left liquid assets in the EU that could be seized and was oblivious to the fact that this could occur. This could be attributable to a few factors: 1) The SMO decision was relatively spur-of-the-moment, despite the rapidly increasing tensions in February 2022; 2) The SMO decision was closely guarded and not communicated to their equivalent to the Treasury Department, and  3) Putin had absolutely no grasp on the white hot, violent hatred of Russia among Western TPTB \/ Neocons. Alternate view, Russia thought the Eu was sane. Imagine expecting the west to honor agreements! Agree. I don\u2019t think Putin expected the West was crazy enough to blow up the Nordstream pipeline either.  For years, the criticism of Crimean annexation and Russia\u2019s behavior in Georgia was to do a better job financially integrating so that the autocratic reflect wasn\u2019t necessary. Use politics and diplomacy to get what you want. But there are no negotiating partners for Putin anywhere in the EU or the US or NATO. I don\u2019t think that was quite so clear prior to the SMO. The Russians, slightly agape, are sitting there watching the West saw off the limb it\u2019s sitting on. For a long while I expect they\u2019ve been asking themselves \u201cis there something else going on here? Can they really be that stupid?\u201d Consensus is tentatively forming around \u201cyup\u2026\u201d The seizure of Venezuela\u2019s gold should have dispelled any illusions of Western financial sanity. Or maybe Russia knew that they could seize European assets in Russia that were worth more then the pool kept at Euroclear to facilitate international trade. The Russian assets were frozen on the second banking day from the invasion, so there really was no chance to transfer to safety in time. And the military operation was supposed to be over rather quickly, in a month or three \u2013 as it almost was. And then, of course, all the international laws, regulations and agreements, that the \u201crules based order\u201d was pretending to follow, as ilsm points out. \u201cRussia?\u201d As I understand it, it was governor of the Central Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina, the West\u2019s favorite central banker.  But this does reflect back to Putin who chooses to keep her there even though she favors Russia caving to the West. She was preparing to leave Russia at the beginning of the SMO but Putin persuaded her not to. Big mistake. The bear left a honeypot, with a poison pill inside. A temptation that the greedy beast won\u2019t be able to resist. So sweet for a moment, and a diabetes as a bonus. It\u2019s a bait. It\u2019s a trap. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ThJcHjCI9j4 https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=piVnArp9ZE0 In for a penny, in for a pound.  They already gave the go ahead to Trump\u2019s Venezuelan war plans by giving the Nobel War Prize to Maria \u201cThe Joker\u201d Machado.  Directly sponsoring a big war closer to home is just putting more skin in the game. As a Norwegian I\u2019d say go for it. I don\u2019t expect the broader public to be given any choice, similar to the decision to bomb Libya (Stoltenberg, then prime minister, and a few others decided it by SMS messaging). It is clearly ludicrous, however Ukrainian and European elites seem to stop at nothing until every drop of (Ukrainian) blood and every (European) penny has been spent. When the plan backfires we may finally get rid of the Oil fund, Stoltenberg and European war mongers such as von der Leyen, Kallas, Starmer and Macron. And, perhaps, return to some kind of reason On a more factual note: major pushes come from the Danes, such as editor of the newspaper Politiken, Christian Jensen, former NATO general secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and prime minister Mette Frederiksen. They\u2019ve been obsessing with this for years, arguing that the oil fund should be spent on Ukraine, this seems like the latest iteration of their campaign Obviously the Norwegians should have pissed their North Sea oil earnings away like the British. It\u2019s only fair that they alone, without any support from the rest of unified and indomitable NATO Europe, should underwrite a loan worth near to 30 percent of their annual GDP. (\/sarc if it\u2019s not already obvious) And to top it off, it\u2019s all completely pointless paper shuffling. It\u2019s not like there is \u201cfrozen\u201d stock of 10\u2019000 tanks and 20M shells lying somewhere in EU and owned by Russia that will be magically unlocked for Ukraine when they finally seal the steal. Nor are there idle munition factories, waiting to spring into action. It\u2019s just PR exercise in pretending that the material burden of war will not be carried by the western population, but by Russia. I wouldn\u2019t call it entirely useless paper shuffling. Ukraine, with its forecast budget deficit of $50 billion for 2026, would at the very least be able to pay salaries for another year or two. They are running low on cannon fodder, more so than shells.

I\u2019ve been listening to \u2018Enjoy Every Sandwich\u2019 a lot lately, I suspect there\u2019s a place for a current-events-adapted \u2018Studebaker\u2019 in the near future. I had the great pleasure of seeing him perform back in \u201982. He opened with Johnny Strikes Up The Band. In the wake of Mamdani\u2019s victory some billionaires have began to admit that \u201ccapitalism\u201d such as it is ain\u2019t working for the young\u2019uns and that\u2019s why they are turning to \u201csocialism,\u201d per notable consumer of young people\u2019s blood Peter Thiel. Unsurprisingly, the Twitterati have taken to blaming the Boomers living on Social Security and Medicare in their paid-off houses. Because surely trying to set-off intergenerational conflict will fix what ails society and \u201ccapitalism\u201d \ud83d\ude44 Any certified holder of a trump or melania coin should be given rights of civil forfeiture against property owning \u2018leftists\u2019* Redistrict Amerika! *anyone they don\u2019t like. Boomer here. Lambert didn\u2019t like generational generalizations but I think my cohort should get some blame if blame is appropriate. Alternately Gen Z is simply on the wrong part of history\u2019s wheel. Nikki Haley\u2019s son blames H1-B and immigrants for the fact that his expensively educated friends can\u2019t get jobs. But it could be that Thiel and his pals are coming for all of us\u2013boomers and immigrants too. They are and my decision to get out of Dodge looks better and better. Still, that\u2019s the selfish part of me saying that. The other parts are mad as hell for the people, native born and immigrants alike. In all seriousness there are many boomers who could do more to help their millennial children. Strong families are a necessary ingredient of a strong society.  I know of some boomers who travel three months a year to visit grandchildren and help provide care. I know of others who prioritize going to the casino and to the beach. One day they\u2019ll sign away their life savings to an old age home owned by private equity. That\u2019s a fair point, however Social Security and Medicare have nothing to do with it. The emphasis on those earned benefits tell me all I need to know about the motivations of these aholes \u2013 they want to get their hands on the money and destroy the programs, much like they destroy everything else that they touch. The Boomers allowed Social Security to go from a \u201cpay as you go\u201d social welfare program to a \u201cgotta get mine since I paid into it\u201d retirement savings program.  They also allowed the rich to be exempt from paying into it beyond a low threshold.   Definitely agree that the current talk of Social Security \u201creform\u201d is about one last loot of the public coffers, but the Boomers are definitely the group most responsible for letting it happen.  In any case, they seem happy to sell out their kids and grandkids if they\u2019re taken care until death. WE did that?  All of us?  I thought it was Reagan and O\u2019Neill and later Clinton, (thank you, Monica), then Bush, then Obama, etc. You know, the Wall St. boys.  \/ ;) Right on.  Getting fed up with all this \u201cOK Boomer\u201d bullshit.  Look at the individual villains, not an age group construct designed to muddy any real critical thinking about how the disaster happened and who is responsible.  Oh, and throw in the usual divide and rule generational cohort definitions.  Weak. Divide and conquer. But why?  I can only guess that the large numbers of kids born during and after WWII until the early 60\u2019s frightened old money and Wall St.  What if these kids  came together to demand better pay when they grew up, like their grandparents and parents had done in the 30\u2019s,40\u2019s, and 50\u2019s?  What if they aligned with their parents and grandparents on financial matters? Holy horrors, Batman! Got to find a way to break up that possibility and keep it broken. \/my 2 cents Right on. Right on. The OK Boomer line is funny. Especially because so many of the boomers still in the work force refuse to change or adapt and yet are highly compensated. Chuck Schumer isn\u2019t the only oldster who\u2019s outlived their time in an organization they have been in for a long time. Still, the other comments in this thread are accurate too. Whatever benefits being born early may have yielded, we\u2019re all stuck dealing with the current load of crap. It doesn\u2019t get easier if you\u2019re older. The Powell Memo brought home the Dulles boys Miesian vision of a globalist Western Oligarchy to supplant the British Empire. Unless you were watching all the spooks abroad and their creeping encroaching at home (Reagan Bush Campaign Chair Bill Casey \u201cOur work will be done when everything Americans believe is a lie\u201d), you\u2019ve been a democracy tourist watching the show The Mighty Wurlitzer put on. Well funded and systematically conceived, I\u2019ve been called a CT my whole adult life for pointing out this is happening. It wasn\u2019t the hippies, baby boomers or immigrants, it was, is and with the brief intermission of Marriener Eccles term at FDRs Fed always has been the Oligarchs. Oh yeah, VP Bush was a retired, if that ever really happens, CIA Director. Too, Casey also, I meant to say So what? Did the Boomers go on general strike against the oligarchs?  Did they form strong organizations to oppose the destruction of the New Deal and Great Society programs?   Saying CIA or deep state doesn\u2019t absolve their cohort of the responsibility for what they did and did not do. Yep. You are right.  The the stock markets are looking wobbly and could really, really use a fresh source of \u201cinvestments.\u201d  \/ ;) I am a boomer. I have child I have tried to help. That child insisted on moving to NYC and staying where rent ate most of the income that the child earned or finagled. I helped bail that child out of credit card doom loops several times only to find out later that no lessons had been learned. That child got into drugs and burned through tens of thousands of dollars received in various windfalls, some of them of questionable legality. I was often sending two or three thousand dollars per month to bail that child out of financial problems. That child has been an adult for over a decade but cannot\/will not balance a check book. That child has a gift for picking up parking and driving tickets, penalty fees, bank charges, credit card rate extortion and burning through whatever money I have sent trying to help.  One of my nieces ripped my brother off for $15 grand. A nephew, her brother, wasted $11 grand of help my brother sent [from his home in another state] to pay for a training school to enable him to qualify for a trucker\u2019s driver\u2019s license \u2026 two months in, he dropped out of the four month program because he would not use a nearby tram to ride to the school when his car died. That same nephew was offered two chances to get into the electrician\u2019s union. All he had to do was review his math before taking the licensing test. Instead he preferred to smoke marijuana and sleep alternately on his sister\u2019s or mother\u2019s floor.  I recently moved to a new home. I talked to a neighbor across the street. She and her elderly husband allowed their son to move in with his wife after that son lost his job and was unable to get another job, unable for odd reasons that sounded similar to my child\u2019s mixed efforts at finding employment. Meanwhile, that neighbor and her husband had been pushed into bedroom at the rear of the house as their son and his wife nudged and pushed them out of the rest of their house.  I know times are harder and will become much much harder but the young people do not seem to have grasped the present situation and have no sense of what is coming. Until they do, I feel like the help I have given my own young is like spitting into the wind. I am not sure this a generational thing so much as a failure of today\u2019s Society. Another data point for the \u201cKids These Days\u201d folder: The post-secondary institution that I retired from a couple of years ago took another bite out of its instructional time by designating a week-long mid-semester break starting Monday, which brackets the existing Canadian statutory holiday of Nov. 11th.  (Due to calendar quirks, this amounts to a couple less teaching days than last year.  But it comes after losing another teaching day with the 2021 designation of the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation which was recognized as a statutory holiday in most provinces.) As a blissful retiree, this came as news to me, so I queried a couple of former colleagues about the rationale for this change. One explained that the timing was based on when the kids appeared to \u201crun out of steam\u201d.  Another was evidently less convinced and suggested:  \u201cWe also should have a crisis centre for students who are asked to do more than 20 minutes of homework per course.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to wonder whether this is a response to the cumulative neurological damage that young people have suffered from repeat COVID infections.  I haven\u2019t had time to find out if other schools have instituted something similar. Your post comes off like you\u2019re whining about a few vacation days in what is typically a 16-week semester \u2014 Blissful retirement indeed.  I myself am teaching in a University. There are indeed some things that bother me, but the fact that there are a few days off is not among them. If the semester was 16 weeks, I wouldn\u2019t be concerned.  Except that it\u2019s now down to about 12 1\/2 weeks at that institution. We\u2019ve gone from a 13-week term to a 12-week term. We lost one day due to a gas leak where Hydro-Quebec had to turn off power to a chunk of downtown and another two days to a student strike. We\u2019re now having to go remote on Zoom because of a transit strike for 1-3 weeks. Not a whole lot of time for teaching. Jeremy, I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, I hope that your child, niece, and nephew find their way. I can see why your perspective is different, as in these cases (different from my own experience) it\u2019s not clear if nominal help does more harm than good. Well Jeremy, I have had similar problems and I don\u2019t think there is a solution. Just try to be happy with the life you have been given. People who are determined to destroy themselves will find a way. My oldest son drank himself to death and another has similar issues as your son. You can lead a horse to water but it won\u2019t float on its back. I was talking to a grandson about William Faulkner this summer and that is an author he despises due to being assigned to read The Sound and The Fury in high school or college. I have just started it and can understand his frustration trying to read a \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d book narrated by an idiot. The title is from (Wiki) Sheakpeare\u2019s Macbeth, where life is described as a \u201ctale \/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, \/ Signifying nothing\u201d. In William Faulkner\u2019s novel, this phrase suggests the futility and chaos of modern life and the Compson family\u2019s decline, explored through the chaotic, subjective perspectives of the family members. The title reflects the novel\u2019s themes of decay, guilt, and the modern experience of a life lacking meaning and purpose. I read a Jim Thompson book years ago titled A Hell of a Woman where the protagonist looses his mind by the end of the novel. His alternate personality chimes in at the end of the book in italics relating a completely different story. It was very disconcerting to say the least and after reading it I felt a bit ill. I thought for some time there had been an error in the printing but after a couple of weeks went back to City Lights to find another title by Thompson. Eventually read them all I think. Good luck in finding any meaning out of life. Yes, but the Boomers have only themselves to blame for going along with decades of tax cuts and deregulation for the rich and letting the college education, healthcare and home costs balloon.  All that illusory real estate wealth will get eaten up by predatory private equity nursing homes. It\u2019s hard to feel bad them, after decades of hearing well off Boomers and older tell youngsters that they just need to bootstrap and lay off the avocado toast.   We can also talk about Boomer\u2019s vastly higher levels of support for regressive politicians, Israel, cops, etc.  It\u2019s damn hard to have solidarity for people who, as a collective, have no solidarity for anybody else. Humbly report sir, er madam\u2026 Generation Jones reporting for duty. Yeah, we\u2019re Boomers but late bloomers whose introduction to ire was that 70\u2019s inflation & gas lines just as we became newly minted hellions of wheels. You missed out on Vietnam. I was on the tail end of that and escaped via college deferment. Which of course was an early example of Boomer middle class self privilege. Isn\u2019t it interesting how many of our Boomer war mongers in DC didn\u2019t serve in the military? Sorry, Gen-Xers (in my mind includes the late Boomers born after 1960) I know are mostly just mad that they pre-sold out but didn\u2019t get an much as their old Boomer siblings.  I say this as a Gen-Xer.  We suck too, there are just a lot fewer of us around.  We still enjoyed far cheaper college education, cheaper starter home buy-in, better lifetime professional career prospects, and a blissfully Internet free childhood compared to the kids who came after us. US population by age, for reference.  I don\u2019t know what the advertising agencies names are for the various cohorts.  Wish they\u2019d just say \u201cpeople born between years x and y\u201d.  I guess giving names implies \u2018teams\u2019, aka my team vs your team. \/ ;) https:\/\/www.neilsberg.com\/insights\/united-states-population-by-age\/ The Baby Boomer cohort is about 30 percent bigger than the Gen-Xer cohort in the average year in that cohort.  Your chart minimizes the difference since deaths from old age is attrition on older cohort and the effects of emigrating into the US is not quantified.  It\u2019s really throwing me an orange when I was talking about apples.  As for the rest.  I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think I could have a productive conversation with someone who regularly post links to Matt Taibbi\/ Walter Kirn content.   Kind regards. Litmus test much? Now that\u2019s coalition building! (Taibbi said some useful things a while back) I only have so much time and patience.  2025 Taibbi supporters miss the cut. Blessings. Per your previous comment \u201cBoomers have only themselves to blame for going along with decades of tax cuts and deregulation for the rich and letting the college education, healthcare and home costs balloon.\u201d If you really think that the hoi polloi had much choice over government decisions back then, then I guess we can blame you and your generation for Donald. USA hasn\u2019t been a democracy for a long time, and I\u2019d suggest that the point of inflection was the formation of CIA to undermine pushback to the status quo. I agree that the US hasn\u2019t been a democracy for a long time.  What have the Boomers done about it as a cohort?  Manipulated or not, Boomers supported decades of tax cuts and war against the New Deal.  They didn\u2019t have general strikes over it.  They didn\u2019t find and support third parties and civil organizations that might oppose it.  They voted for it en mass and didn\u2019t want to share. You can cry CIA all you want.  Every country in the West controlled world is infiltrated by secret police, media control, and lawfare.  Plenty of them still break free in spite of all that.  Maybe the millennials and the Zoomers will do it for this country.  All I know is that the vast majority of Boomers and X-ers didn\u2019t even try. Yes, I do blame the entire American public for voting for either of the genocide parties, going back decades.  And for not building alternatives to the corrupt existing power structure.  But most of the Boomers and Gen-Xers I know are happy to cling onto their material privileges and turn a blind eye on Gaza and US imperialism, and only complain when something directly impacts them. This selfishness is reflected in poll after poll. With respect, you can\u2019t \u201cagree that the US hasn\u2019t been a democracy for a long time\u201d and then blame the voters. No democracy means that the we the people don\u2019t have agency to, say, stop assisting the Gaza genocide. I became politically active as a teen during high school. It was the Vietnam War era. There were few Charlie Kirk types in HS or college. I pulled a #60 draft lottery, but was 1F because of an eye injury. Living in Buffalo, I\u2019d have gone to Canada if called. Went to university for 3 semesters and quit. Worked at the railroad as a unionized worker and met my wife there. We both lost our jobs due to Carter\u2019s deregulation. Went back to school and got an MS in statistics. Nothing but shit jobs in the 80s and 90s until self employment. I have never, never once lost my ideas for socialism and anti-imperialism in those 55 years. Sure, there are many in EVERY age cohort that buys into Morning in America. How do exactly you propose change? How exactly do you differentiate the political awareness of any of these artificial age groupings? I don\u2019t see differences above age 30 or so. The point was, is and will always be class, which is age and race blind. \u201ca blissfully Internet free childhood compared to the kids who came after us\u201d Not having such a heavily surveilled youth helped in an environment of diminishing opportunities. Boomers, like so many other \u2018identity politiked groups\u2019, and hardly a monolith.  The power peeps find that divide and conquer is an old tried and true way of keeping the power, the powder, and all the marbles.  I recall a recent intergenerational tirade from my 39 year old don who has lived throgh his share of recessions and has in fact, like many others, \u2018lost years\u2019 of earning due to doldrums broght on by Wall Street and the powers that be- global powers that be. I reminded him that I , too, went through and suffered every economic hiccup he had, plus three more.  The lighbulb went off\u2026  the missing WE in the US. Boomers now make up around 16% of the US population. The 18-64 years-olds make up around 61% of the US population. But sure, keep blaming the boomers.  It\u2019s easy to do.  And it feels righteous.  And why not, we voted in Bill Clinton who talked New Deal and Bridge to the 21st century. He \u2018felt our pain\u2019, he said. (Lots of jokes made about that claim.)  He said all the right things we wanted to hear.  And then\u2026. and then,,,,, we got NAFTA (and massive off-shoring of manufacturing jobs that had good wages and benefits); we got financial deregulation which led to the GFC in 2008.  Basically,  we got Reagan, again.  But he said all the right things, don\u2019t\u2019cha know.  He was the man from Hope.  And we hoped.   Here\u2019s a 2014 essay by Matt Stoller in the Atlantic Magazine: Politics How Democrats Killed Their Populist Soul In the 1970s, a new wave of post-Watergate liberals stopped fighting monopoly power. The result is an increasingly dangerous political system. By Matt Stoller (Opening para) It was January 1975, and the Watergate Babies had arrived in Washington looking for blood. The Watergate Babies\u2014as the recently elected Democratic congressmen were known\u2014were young, idealistic liberals who had been swept into office on a promise to clean up government, end the war in Vietnam, and rid the nation\u2019s capital of the kind of corruption and dirty politics the Nixon White House had wrought. Richard Nixon himself had resigned just a few months earlier in August. But the Watergate Babies didn\u2019t just campaign against Nixon; they took on the Democratic establishment, too. Newly elected Representative George Miller of California, then just 29 years old, announced, \u201cWe came here to take the Bastille.\u201d https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2016\/10\/how-democrats-killed-their-populist-soul\/504710\/ \u2014 And now?  Now Nixon would be to the left of both parties. We lived in FDR political world for almost 50 years until Reagan was elected.  We\u2019ve been living in the Reagan world for 50 years. Obama said he greatly admired Reagan, etc. I hope the younger generations are smarter than we were about politicians and their propensity to play on emotions and even lie to get elected.    \/ ;) Hearing well off people of any generation telling others to pull themselves up by their bootstraps is both obnoxious and also inevitable. The well off always think their prosperity is all due to their wonderfulness and outsized agency. Maybe the boomers should blame the \u201cgreatest generation\u201d and silents for allowing the rollback of the New Deal to get underway almost from the moment FDR died, for letting McCarthyism make anyone leftish borderline criminal, and turning capitalism into the national religion rather than a development that could be vigorously debated (as in the years between WWI and WWII). The trouble is that the majority of any generation (including the supposedly radical boomers) are conformists who can be led around by the nose by those with money, clout and media control. It takes desperate circumstances and bottom-up organization to get enough people on board for effectively challenging that. People in the US are still too comfortable, despite the 50+ year degradation of their economic prospects. And the bounds of discourse have been narrowed to the point that no one can even say how things could change for the better. Instead they\u2019re stuck in finding someone to blame and to punish for the present state of affairs, and we have lots of false prophets pointing fingers at one group or another so nothing realistic gets accomplished. Except that \u201cthe\u201d boomers are not a frigging entity. Might as well say \u201cthe\u201d blondes or \u201cthe\u201d short people. Well\u2026. maybe. But tarring everyone of a certain age with attitudes is a bit of a stretch, isnt it? I did get a tertiary education. Because of scholarship. First of my family. Voted against conservative parties. Was a union member for years. Supporting children wherever we can to get into housing. Not a lot, but it helps them. Not a supporter of cops who beat up demonstrators. Grudging respect for Putin. Nothing but contempt for Bibi. So, does that make me Gen X? If it drops a few years off my age and I lose a few ailments, happy to join up!! \u201cInter\u201d generational? Wouldn\u2019t that imply there is conflict between multiple generations? Rather than all the other generations blaming the boomers?  The size of the \u2018me\u2019 generation, coupled with it\u2019s outsized wealth, certainly has people wondering whether this is a cohort we\u2019re concerned with sacrificing our lives for over the next decade or so.  I mean, I\u2019m not about intergenerational conflict either. But, the resentment is understandable. When boomers were in their teens and 20s the going saying was \u201cdon\u2019t trust anyone over 30.\u201d I\u2019ve often wondered why.  People over 30 might be people who had fought for unions, picketed for civil rights, people over 30 might have experiences and stories that would be good to hear about\u2026. unless you didn\u2019t want the new generation to know that history.  Did Wall St. formulate the \u201cdon\u2019t trust anyone over 30\u201d saying?  \/ ;) And,  \u201cthe ME\u201d generation was an advertising contruct aimed at the parents of the boomers, painting their kids as selfish and ungrateful. And then, they dreamed up \u201cthe generation gap\u201d in advertising. Shameless. \/ ;) Don\u2019t know how old you are Flora but back in the late 60\u2019s those over 30 broadly supported the Vietnam war and were blind to racial injustice. Our parents fought WW2 and were of the mind that the government knew best. They believed the domino theory and were ready to send us off to determine the government of another countries people. Anyone born in the first ten years after WW2 heard plenty of stories of the depression and the war that followed. On the west coast, at least, the introduction of LSD was pretty differentiating between the generations. It was like those who had glimpsed behind the veil and those who weren\u2019t about to. We envisioned a new age. By the time the 80\u2019s rolled around it was evident that was not going to happen. We blamed that on our parent\u2019s generation who controlled the strings of power and the pocketbook. Well that can is down the road and the upcoming generations are blaming the boomers. They certainly don\u2019t want to hear my cautionary tails. \u201cOn the west coast, at least, the introduction of LSD was pretty differentiating between the generations. It was like those who had glimpsed behind the veil and those who weren\u2019t about to. We envisioned a new age.\u201d Again, sounds like the experience of a subset of youth and adults.  Not the wide-ranging variety of experiences happening across the country. I would say my first paragraph covers anyone who\u2019s parents survived WW2 and that\u2019s global. Every new generation seeks to differentiate themselves from their parents. I would wager that is the main issue driving language drift. That is an attribute of human kind, not a marketing scheme. LSD was introduced by the CIA in its secret, illegal, MKUltra mind control program.  I sometimes wonder how much of the \u201cage of aquarious\u201d came from the CIA. I\u2019m not saying people who took it knew where it came from. My parents were of  the WWII generation. Voted for Nixon, supported the Vietnam War, etc. Then Kent State happened and they woke up. The fact is that no generation as a whole is responsible for today\u2019s, or yesterday\u2019s, or tomorrow\u2019s, overall situations.  It\u2019s the Powers That Be, and their greed. I know that sounds simplistic. What I\u2019m trying to say is that it\u2019s the 1% of all these generations since the late 1960\u2019s, not the general public of any generation. As my parents said at the dinner table after being informed of the mass, hidden, bombing of Cambodia and Kent State, \u201cWe were brought up to believe in our leaders and trust our government.\u201d They taught me a lesson that night that I\u2019ve never forgotten. Unfortunately too many still believe, and trust. It\u2019s a BS saying and it\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s been tough to change things.  Most people\u2019s adult lives happen OVER age 30. All of these categeories are marketing constructs. People basing their ire on what I call the NY Times Millennials or Boomers, etc.  The ones the advertisers like to see featured in lifestyle articles. \u201cit\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s been tough to change things.\u201d To make clear\u2026not much is going to be changed if a wedge is made between between people over and under 30. Goes back a bit to what I say about student only movements: they are most controllable because they have an academic lifespan. Real change has to include a mix of ages and walks of life. We\u2019ll, Jerry Rubin, the guy who said it, did end up working on Wall Street. To emphasize the point: \u201cSometime in the mid-1970s, Rubin reinvented himself as a businessman. Friend and fellow Yippie Stew Albert claimed Rubin\u2019s new ambition was giving capitalists a social consciousness. In 1980 he began a new career on Wall Street as stockbroker with the brokerage firm John Muir & Co. \u201cI know that I can be more effective today wearing a suit and tie and working on Wall Street than I can be dancing outside the walls of power,\u201d[8] he said. In the 1980s, he became known for his promotion of business networking, having created Business Networking Salons, Inc., a company that organized parties at the Studio 54 and Palladium nightclubs in Manhattan, where thousands of young professionals and entrepreneurs met and shared ideas. Near the end of his life, Rubin became interested in the science of life extension and was heavily involved in multi-level marketing of health foods and nutritional supplements.[48] \u201cIn 1991, he and his family moved to Los Angeles,\u201d according to an Observer.com profile of him,[49] \u201cwhere he became a successful independent marketer for a Dallas-based firm that sold a nutritional drink called Wow!, made with kelp, ginseng, and bee pollen. Ironically, Bobby Seale became one of his salesmen.\u201d I guess that could be called creating a model that so many young, alleged \u201cinnovators\u201d are following. Ummm \u2026 ??? I\u2019m not going to say this isn\u2019t true. But: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Me_generation  Tom Wolfe was a Madison Ave. guy? There are now quite a few starting to blame genX. Re: Ukraine That article from iPaper, an outfit I\u2019ve never heard of before, starts out reasonably, but devolves into pro-Ukrainian cope and standard tropes about massive Russian casualties with no citations to credible sources. The author manages to contradict herself within two paragraphs in sequence.  Compare: \u201cThis tactic has been used quite a lot recently, and at least in official sources and some blogger sources from the Russian side, they\u2019re saying Russia has changed its approach to not do any frontal assaults in cities because it\u2019s costing too many human lives or too many soldiers.\u201d With the following bit: The Russian approach has leveraged its superior manpower over Ukraine, sending in wave after wave of troops with little concern for the high rates of casualties, to overrun and exhaust Ukraine\u2019s defences. It goes downhill from there, quoting the execrable Institute for the Study of War, a neo-con think tank, and then ending with an outright false and misleading statement that Russia hasn\u2019t captured any territory since 2022: Since November 2022, the territory held by each side has remained broadly the same. The source for this seems to be the BBC maps, which do show Russia regaining territory in Kursk, although they rely on the ISW again which is in a state of denial on Pokrovsk. I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised as the entire piece seems to have come out of Britain, which is the HQ for anti-Russia propaganda it seems. Since the war broke out I have stayed away from Western media to get the real picture in Ukraine, favoring Simplicius, Dima from Military Summary Channel, and the gang at the Duran.  The latest from Dima is that 2000 Ukrainian troops are surrounded in Myrnograd, which is a city just east of Pokrovsk. The \u201cPutin\u2019s tactics\u201d is a giveaway. Just about every article, post, or comment that starts off with \u201cPutin\u2019s [anything]\u201d turns out to be propaganda about the mad dictator who\u2019s singlehandedly out to restore the Soviet Union. With few exceptions it\u2019s safest to just ignore them. Yep, and \u201cPutin\u2019s tactics\u201d is one of the dumbest. Putin doesn\u2019t do tactics, because he\u2019s at the top of the hierarchy. Micromanaging units is something done in video games and, probably, by NATO generals because they can\u2019t do strategy. \u2018Hope and frustration \u2013 debate on EU enlargement intensifies\u201d \u2018The sharpest focus was on the possible accession of Ukraine, which continues to be blocked by the Hungarian government in the European Council.\u2019 That\u2019s not entirely true. Lots of EU countries don\u2019t want the Ukraine in the EU either but are being threatened if the speak out. So they lend quite support to Hungary who is taking the lead here. Having the Ukraine in the EU would literally destroy the EU as there is not enough money in the entire EU to rehabilitate the Ukraine.

If the US could not marshal the forces to land in Yemen to end their missile\/drone attacks \u2013 a country of 42 million people in 455,503 square kilometers (175,871 square miles)  \u2013 then what makes him think he could do it in Nigeria with its 237 million people in its 923,769 square kilometers (356,669 square miles). I guess his idea is to go in, solve their problems, and then have their oilfields as payment for his services. \u2026what would the Jolly Rajah flag design look like? Skull and Bones, naturally. How hard can it be? Much of this is like someone flinching to see who jumps.  And countries and other entities keep prioritizing weapons and surveillance. Have to keep the demind high especially when there is competition. Just takes a social media post and shuffling around a few military assets already deployed. They already have some alliances within Nigeria for other things. I feel like, unlike Yemen, there might be sizable portions of Nigeria that don\u2019t mind or even want Uncle Sam\u2019s intervention. Even looking it up just now, I keep seeing that different groups in the country have \u2018mixed reactions\u2019. To me, albeit on the outside, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much strong national love so that everyone is at least against foreign interventions inspite of internal disagreements. Rather, separate groups all seem out to one up the other, potentially without any regard for long-term consequences, just like the US likes it. Trump\u2019s new Syrian ally al Jolani (can\u2019t remember his new nom de guerre) is going to give up a few of his ISIS brethren in Lagos so Trump can drone assassinate a few like he does fishermen in the Caribbean \u2026\u2026.

Big time! Oh. This is going to get interesting. The radar on those ships will be able to give a lot of coverage of the region and if the US tried to launch a salvo of missiles at Venezuela, those ships would be able to shoot down those missiles as well. The military attack on Venezuela is now effectively over before it even started. With the war in the Ukraine winding down, the Russian Federation is going to show the US that there is a price that will have to be paid for causing the Ukraine war over the past decade or more and causing so many Russian deaths. The best part? The Russians can say that they are only there on a goodwill mission though there won\u2019t be much goodwill in DC. And the Chinese might even say that they are ready to send reinforcements. Reinforcements of goodwill, that is. Another \u201cGulf of America\u201d plot twist. The Russians have brought Oreshniks  to the table. What would one of those do to the USS Ford incoming at Mach 15? What do I know about what\u2019s real, but that video has obvious made up BS.   (sometimes the missiles are coming out of the bow, sometimes out of the stern, one of the shots shows a single ship with three identical superstructures \u2026 the single ship wasn\u2019t long enough for them?, one of the shots shows a bow unloading ramp with blue water where half of the front of the ship would need to be\u2026   amateur stuff really, they\u2019re obviously not intended to fool anyone who didn\u2019t want to be fooled.) Look down the coast to the south\u2026 Guyana \u2026. Thank goodness it is not al abut oil this time! \u201cStranded\u201d hardly seems like the correct description for the condition of the Chinese crew, does it? More like sitting on the tee on the windmill hole at mini golf? Re Trump and his vanity Trump\u2019s golf courses and hotels have long carried his name, and during his second term, the president and his supporters have pushed to name other structures for him. This summer, lawmakers introduced a bill to rename the Kennedy Center as the Donald J. Trump Center for Performing Arts. The source with knowledge of the stadium deal said that if Trump insists on the stadium bearing his name, \u201che has plenty of leverage\u201d to make it happen, no matter which government body will ultimately decide. \u201cHe has cards to play. He can make it very difficult, through government environmental approvals and other things, to make sure everyone who wants this stadium to be built will join to put his name on it,\u201d the source said. \u201cTrump has plenty of cards to play to get his way.\u201d Make it stop. In ancient Egypt when the bad Pharaoh died they would behead his statues and chisel away his cartouche. Doubtless we will have to do the same with the increasingly ubiquitous DJT cognomen as well as name back the Gulf of Mexico. Here\u2019s hoping Don doesn\u2019t start building a pyramid. All the tacky gold and marble monuments impress me as fitting and appropriate to the gods and spirit guiding this dying Empire. He probably won\u2019t care what happens after he dies. APR\u00c8S MOI LE D\u00c9LUGE! In May 2024, SFGATE reported that a few Bay Area Safeway stores had removed their self-checkout sections due to theft issues. The Target at 789 Mission St. in SF also removed self-checkout in 2023, SFGATE reported. The 298 King St. Safeway store no longer has self-checkout, although it is unclear when it was removed.  Daniel Conway, the vice president of government relations for the California Grocers Association, told SFGATE in 2023 that these measures were part of a growing national trend of \u201cdefensive retailing.\u201d I guess we can now call what they were doing before (making the customer the worker) offensive retailing. An aside, Air force base dollar stores struggling after snap snafu proves that these people in the upper crust are soooo committed to not paying people, and anyone who says they should pay ought to be deported to gaza. It\u2019s pathetic really. And this misallocation of resources to useless eaters in the equity game has made people of average intellect above average dollars and it has indeed gone to their heads making their own self regard to be above average and their fantasies mimic reality. For instance, the ru dough in the eu oven\u2026Thought experiment, say ru decides to make up for the insult of stealing assets they send say 150 billion in weapons to venezuela. Anyone with reading comprehension and a laptop can tell you ru\u2019s weapons are better than ours which are pure hype but the psuedo genius\u2019 slumming in the tattoo parlor with hegseth chattering that if they FA they\u2019ll FO are going to have it handed to them. And despite assurances, our \u201cAI\u201d isn\u2019t much better than our weapons. It\u2019s a real chocolate mess. When you\u2019re departing Wal*Mart, there\u2019s an \u2018Exiter\u2019 who checks your receipt, often with only a cursory glance at your gotten gains. \u2026a shoplifter dissuader Seems to me that supermarkets are the easiest to steal from of all the stores, I know of no supermarkets here in Godzone with security guards. You wonder when they all go to the Wal*Mart\/Costco model? When I lived in CA my local Wal Mart had an exiter. Every single time. At my new non-CA zip code wal mart they have the employee on duty there and he or she has never one time asked to look at my receipt. Fry\u2019s Electronics used to have a checker, but you can ignore. Only club stores like Costco and Sams can mandate being checked as part of membership. The irony for Fry\u2019s was that they were hurt by stealing from within. https:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/business\/frys-electronics-executive-accused-of-embezzling-65-million\/ I\u2019ve had arguments with \u201cExiters\u201d at Tower Records (NY) and Gilbert Joseph (Paris) who didn\u2019t know how to read their own receipts (I switched to Fnac\u2026.) I think that may be hard. Here in NYC a store worker was killed trying to stop a shoplifter a few weeks ago. He wasn\u2019t security, from the reports I saw there wasn\u2019t any. The thing is most shoplifters are not going to be dangerous, but you never know what you are going to get. In smaller operations than Walmart or Costco they may not have resources for adequate security. Those poor checkers may not even pretend to do cursory checks because the consequences may be too dire at some point. Angry people may not care that the guy in their way is trying just as hard to survive as they are. And yes I know that the reason it was covered as much as it was was to fuel the fears of Mamdani. Walmart went over the top with self check, realized the public were stealing them blind, and now greatly limit the number of diy checkouts that are open. They also now have staffers watching the self checkers like a hawk and monitoring their purchases via cell phone.  Walmart added back some cashiers but enough that you aren\u2019t standing in line to use them. I think the automation was always about \u201cflow management\u201d meaning that being Walmart they don\u2019t want cashiers standing around doing nothing during slow periods\u2013the same for grocery stores which never stopped having the machines. Aldi added self checkout and I go there a lot more often now that I can buy three things and check myself out. Don\u2019t feel guilty about this. I went into a gas station to buy a 12 pack of beer. There was one checkout open. One lady standing beside it. I waited in line for 5 minutes while everyone in front of me did their checkouts. We had to scan our stuff, pay the bill, and bag it. While she stood there watching. I scanned my beer, it didn\u2019t work. She said \u201cdo you have an ID?\u201d No, didn\u2019t think I needed one, I\u2019m 70 years old. No ID \u2013 no beer. Fine. You don\u2019t look too busy so you can put it away. Walked out. I guess that\u2019s being an ass, but screw them. I\u2019ll never go back Where I live the 7-11 cards everybody who buys alcohol. The local supermarket doesn\u2019t but since I use the discount program there they may have my age anyway. Some legal requirement maybe? It is a small chain and I heard they got busted for selling to a minor. I get all that, but jeez Louise, a little common sense goes a long way. Wegmans, an upscale grocer, has a self checkout corral that has a maze-like entry and exit. The ceiling and kiosks are covered with cameras. This is in a prosperous PMC area.  I guess stuff happens. They even have self-scanning shopping carts. Generally that have enough staffed checkouts that are faster. Aldi has a corral also and eliminated self checkout at some store. Costco got rid of self checkout. Home depot has everything locked up now. Trump proposes radical healthcare shake-up that would bypass insurers and hand cash directly to millions of Americans \u2013 Daily Mail I\u2019m skeptical.  The Trump administration could just see a way of pressuring a group \u2013 health insurance companies- still giving too much support for their taste to the Democrats.   Could somebody remind ALL of these officials that nutrition is the first step to good health? The Democrats dared a group to starve people that they know doesn\u2019t mind starving people. And the admin is flipping it to shine the light on Democrats holding out for money to insurance companies in the age of Luigi. And I know health insurance companies donate to Republicans too. So emphasizing that I said it\u2019s concern about the support given to Democrats. The administration wants a Democratic party small enough to drown in a kitchen sink. And the Dems keep on making it easier for them. As usual. Health hath no fury like an electorate scorned It\u2019s another symptom of the 12 year old minds of the Trump administration that they don\u2019t understand how insurance works. Throw a couple grand at the plebs but when that $200,000 bill for cancer treatments comes due, they\u2019ll have issues.  Obviously not saying that the current insurance setup is actually working though. Sounds like it would in essence be a new iteration or variation of Health Savings Accounts, the Shrub-era reform idea to solve the problem of high-deductible junk insurance. A return to the golden years of American healthcare, 2003 through 2008. I have an idea. How about creating a state-run insurance company? And that takes me down memory lane: https:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/media\/tv\/countdown-unfairly-mocks-gop-candidate-sue-lowdens-chickens-for-healthcare\/ Countdown Unfairly Mocks GOP Candidate Sue Lowden\u2019s \u2018Chickens for Healthcare\u2019 This article is a more balanced mocking.\ud83d\ude02 \u201cI\u2019m only half-kidding about O\u2019Donnell and Reid being unfair to Lowden, because while her reference to chickens might be irresistibly comical, anyone who watches the clip can see that\u2019s not what she\u2019s saying, and it distracts from the true stupidity and hypocrisy of what she is saying.\u201d \u201cWhy camera-equipped smart glasses are already a privacy disaster\u201d I saw this video and should have saved the link. A guy was going through a college campus and had on a set of these type of glasses and they were hooked up to AI servers. So as a test example, he went up to a middle-aged woman who the glasses videoed.Through facial recognition they found a perfect match which linked to her social media accounts which he could read on his glasses. The net result that he was able to ask her question about her interests and the like as if he knew here from there. And as he was walking through campus, it was trying to facially recognize everybody that he was passing. Anybody see a problem with all this? US law states explicitly that in a public place you have no legitimate expectation nor right to not be recognized or photographed under any reasonable definition of privacy. It\u2019s been tried and lost or just plain been thrown out of court numerous times in the last half-century and especially the last quarter-century, IRRC.   Seriously, how would that even work either in practical reality or legal theory? Not exactly true as it is much more complicated than that. If it was this simple, why do so many shows have to blur out faces in certain situations when filming in public? And you forgot the laws are very different for minors.

China has launched drone firefighting technology that helps in extinguishing fires and conducting aerial rescues in high-rise buildings.     \u2014 Science girl (@sciencegirl) November 8, 2025 Those red quadcopters are so advanced that the laws of physics no longer apply to them. :) I thought about what if you put a pressure restrictor at the copter so that most of the force is used to raise the hose.  The copter, then doesn\u2019t have to lift it.  The remaining pressure can be a jet aimed at the fire. Just a thought. Other wise, yeah that water weighs too much. That was my immediate thought too. Hundreds of Kg of water in a hose fighting a fire at the 15th floor. Also, drones with cylinder extinguishers hanging out their arses? Give me a break\u2026 Doable, up to a certain point, but very inefficient. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vbf59avm4yo LOL it fooled me. I suppose it is possible, assuming that you can actually get the system to a stable position. The drone would have to supply a horizontal force in the direction of the wall equal to the force of water hitting the wall which means it would need a big fan on the back of it.  Height would not be a problem as you could choose the flow rate so that the force of water on the 90degree bend offsets the weight and tension in the pipe. I expect in the real world a large flow rate would be needed to get to the right height and that the fan needed would be too large and heavy to be practical. The Infrastructure of Planetary Sapiens article:   \u2018The climate crisis this apparatus has unveiled is a window into the realization that we are neither above nor apart from nature, but part and parcel of one interdependent organism comprised of multiple intelligences striving for sustainable equilibrium\u2019 why are AI-generated Earth models to prove any more efficient than already existing climate models in informing collective action and change?

Just asking for a friend (the Earth) I know this sounds wrong but I\u2019m looking forward to reading this site\u2019s takedown of Trump\u2019s idea of the 50 year mortgage. Full retard (see amortization table, and one stretch of missed payments wipes out equity\u2014see 2009 USA). \u2026. whether it\u2019s Trump or a 35-year aide who posted it with, at, Trump\u2019s direction.    (is it ok to use the R-word for Trump, PC police?) For starters the first years payments would be something like $1500 per month against the interest and $1.50 against the principle I did a loan amortization for a $410,000 home (approximate median value 2025) with $5000 down, %5.75 interest rates \u2013 no points. After 50 years you will pay over $800k in interest, and a little over $1.2 million for the house. Of course that is 50 years of inflated dollars.

Instead, affluent homeowners are more likely to employ long-term mortgages as an estate-planning tool to reduce inheritance taxes. \u201cWhy Nikki Haley\u2019s son went radical\u201d Not hard to work out. Her son is growing up in a world that people like his mother specifically created. Yeah, it\u2019s the economy stupid. Nikki was born in the early 70s and grew up in a different world than her son has to grow up in. Her money protects her from the consequences of the things that she was voting for. Her son is not so lucky- \u2018Nikki Haley supported legal, merit-based immigration as part of a pro-business platform. Her son wants to close the border entirely. Nikki Haley believes \u201cit is not that Israel needs America \u2014 America needs Israel.\u201d Her son thinks \u201cIsrael is just another country, and if they want to have a better relationship with the United States, they need to stop interfering in our politics.\u201d Nikki Haley believes in an expansive foreign policy. Her son wants to end all foreign aid \u201cas long as we have unemployment, people below the poverty line, medical debt, and bad schools.\u201d These domestic ills aren\u2019t abstractions to him. \u201cMy friend group from high school, all graduated, great degrees from great schools,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job \u2014 not one. So I\u2019m angry at that, because I\u2019m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately \u2014 not just after graduating college, but out of high school.\u201d \u2018 So her son\u2019s votes and that of his friends are up for grabs and there will be no loyalty to either the Republicans or the Democrats. Much of the Unherd link about Nalin Haley impresses me as weird. However, I was most struck by the statement: \u201cGen-Z men like Haley are shifting to the Right, and even the very hard Right.\u201d This statement was made in a confusing context that included immigration. Is no one else struck by how strange it is that immigration control has become an issue that belongs to the Republican party while more immigration and immigrant tolerance has become a Democratic party issue? Immigrants were used to hold down labor\u2019s power when the railroads were built. Immigrants were brought in to hold down labor power when the Chicago slaughter houses and meat packing mills were constructed. Immigrants sometimes foreign, sometimes from an outside area were used to hold down the power of labor to command higher wages and better living conditions. I will someone else recall the race colored measures the u.s. South used to hold down labor and breed conflict. Today labor has no champions.  Recalling more recent history, who believes any generation of Americans that had a particularly easy time finding and holding a job? Are conditions worse for today\u2019s young people \u2026 perhaps \u2026 or are there just more broken promises, more wealth extraction by schools and rents et al., and false guidance to becoming a wage slave? Young people cannot find good jobs, but how many older people who had good jobs are being shunted to the pavement as the Imperial Elites work to completely subjugate labor and replace as much labor as possible with robots and computer software? Instead of joining in the ongoing efforts to entice us all to conflicts with each other I believe it would be well to realize the Imperial Elites are working to make the Populace \u201credundant\u201d, \u201csurplus\u201d, \u201copen to new opportunities\u201d, \u2026 as the euphemisms characterize matters. \u201c\u2026there will be no loyalty to either the Republicans or the Democrats\u201d. A concept that the Democrats have great difficulty grasping. I doubt that NYers cared which party Mamdani had on his ticket. However, I bet that the voters noticed and took heed of the Omniparty\u2019s attacks on him as a candidate. > China\u2019s Stranded Astronauts Show the Dangers of Space Junk Scientific American A TV show from 1970 was all about the dangers of space junk. It was called Conflict and was episode 4 of Sylvia and Gerry Anderson\u2019s U.F.O. You can watch it on YouTube. Alien invaders use space junk to conceal their space craft in Earth orbit. Gawd was that awful, it was so bad, well, it wasn\u2019t even good. I did kinda like the ladies purple hair. I watched the whole thing (in time segments).

There are many traits that a species can have to ensure their survival and here you are talking about things like speed, camouflage, endurance, claws as weapons, etc. But can the ability to make a suite of specialized tools be one of them? About 2.75 million we didn\u2019t have much going for us but were tools something that gave us the edge needed to survive? About 2.75 million we didn\u2019t have much going for us but were tools something that gave us the edge needed to survive? We had gotten that far, but the tools (spear tips, cutting edges) probably got us an ability to kill and butcher animals for the protein that would have boosted our energy demanding then to be expanding brains. There was a link in the piece to another on Neanderthals and modern humans that was quite interesting. I always find the search for understanding how we got here to be fascinating. Yes. Because then we learn who and what we really are. I do not know, though presume, that before we could effectively hunt animals (something not considered in the link) that we were only gatherers. 2.7 million years pushes that frame back, from what was previously understood. But\u2026there was a ramp up to that development, how long or brief was it. We then became predators, still omnivores. And the long ramp up to today, the mind must expand greatly to comprehend such matters. My mind is lagging. The development of tools here was a massive development. It let us cut up meat into portions that could be carried, cut animal skins so that they could be processed back at camp, cut up hardy plants so that we could use the calories within and those are just the uses off the top of my head. Those tools enabled our ancestors to be able to access a far wider range of foods and materials which they could have never done before. Teeth will only take you so far. And we not only became predators but persistence predators. Our ancestors would split animals from a pack and began to pursue them for hours if not days. We never stopped, we never quit, we had no mercy, we were the terminators. And though that animal was faster, it would eventually collapse of exhaustion and would be finished off being helpless even though it was larger and more powerful than our ancestors. It seemed too that our ancestors lost all that excess hair through this to be replaced by sweating to cool off our bodies in their pursuit. It\u2019s a fascinating topic. Seems like all the Tools in Charge are assuring our extirpation? Re: Daily Beast and the costly coffees. The Beast article omits Trump\u2019s most obvious problem: He\u2019s stupid. Some say ignorant because despite his being eighty an eight year old has a better education. As if that were some kind of excuse. But that doesn\u2019t cover all the dump truck loads of crap that pour out of his mouth that even an eight year old would know is wrong, even ridiculous. Trump is a dumbass. The coffee. I have lived and traveled all over Central America and Colombia.(In fact I started reading here at NC when I was living in Nicaragua, around 2008\/2009.) The best coffee in my experience is from a mountainous area in northern Nicaragua called Nueva Segovia. I spent a few nights in the village of Wiwili on the Rio Coco and had coffee each morning in an abuela\u2019s living room converted into a tiny, two table restaurant. I asked to see the beans she used. They were smaller than the beans from Colombia and Costa Rica. I chewed one, fresh from the fry pan where she roasted them, and it tasted like chocolate. My coffee was made with unpasteurized cow\u2019s milk. No sugar. Just excellent\u2026it cost 30 cents. When I make coffee I grind the beans and use a small cheap filter machine. Perhaps 1 minute for setup if I\u2019m groggy. The proportions matter, but very shortly later there\u2019s a great coffee drink with negligable cleaning and trivial cost. A performance\/time tradeoff that suits moi. The plongeurs are good too, but cleaning is more of a pain.  Never understood the Starbucks appeal. Look at Trump\u2019s eyes. The lights aren\u2019t on and he is not home. I know several people with eyes like that. If you ask these people \u201cHow many square feet in a 10\u2032 x 14\u2032 room, they can\u2019t provide an answer, even with use of a calculator. These are the kind of people that are in the 30% of Americans that barely read at a third grade level. These people that I know all somehow graduated high school. This is perhaps one of the reasons that nearly all of the born-in-America trades (plumber, framer etc) that I have met are older, from when the 3 Rs were taught. NEW LEFT REVIEW on New Marxism mini-debate Material Interests \u2013 On the new Marxism Dylan Riley 29 October 2025 https:\/\/newleftreview.org\/sidecar\/posts\/material-interests \u201c(\u2026) Marxism must not forget that \u2018members\u2019 of classes are people, and people live toward their future as they understand and imagine it. It is thus a fundamental error to base one\u2019s politics on an appeal to a given status \u2013 a present state of social being \u2013 and the interests supposed to flow from that. For an anthropologically well-grounded politics entails the attempt to mobilize groups and classes around a project to realize a future that is possible for them under a given set of determinant historical circumstances. Interests are \u2018material\u2019 to the extent that they emerge from those objective circumstances; they are \u2018interests\u2019 to the degree that they are oriented toward a horizon. Marxism thus cannot be, in Labriola\u2019s wonderful phrase, \u2018una filosofia del ventre\u2019 (a philosophy of the stomach). (\u2026) In a sense this is the other side of another characteristic tendency of Anglo-American analytic Marxism: its attempt to develop a critique of capitalism by listing its \u2018harms\u2019 \u2013 the negative counterpart to interests. But \u2018harms\u2019 are only politically relevant if they are linked to historical alternatives. (\u2026)\u201d reply  Alternative Horizons \u2013 A reply to Dylan Riley Jeremy Gilbert & Alex Williams 07 November 2025 https:\/\/newleftreview.org\/sidecar\/posts\/alternative-horizons \u201c(\u2026) This is why, in our view, the utopian impulse to abstraction can never be fully exorcised from radical politics. We agree with Riley that interests only take on reality in the process of struggle \u2013 when they achieve, in our terms, the status of demands. But part of the role of radical agitation, of political speculation and of utopian art and culture is to gesture towards the alternative worlds and ways of being beyond the ambit of immediate need. Such visions have the potential to evolve our collective sense of what the future might be. This is precisely why it is important not to conceptualise material interests as transhistorical categories existing outside of specific social conjunctures. Interests \u2013 human capacities, in our terms \u2013 change as historical circumstances change. Yet the process that brings new circumstances into being is itself constituted by the organised pursuit of realisable interests. This touches on one of the central debates in Marxist and post-Marxist theories of history: are historical outcomes determined primarily by class struggle, or by the level of the \u2018productive forces\u2019? Our answer is that this is a false dichotomy and that neither factor is independently \u2018primary\u2019: technological change is at once produced by, and gives rise to, dynamics of class struggle. That we have been led back to such a perennial issue demonstrates how fundamental Riley\u2019s question is.

Re; At this SF grocery store, you can\u2019t leave unless you buy something SFgate In seattle, the Safeway stores have been like this for years.  Safeway megacorp loves to spend your grocery money on this b.s. as opposed to lowering prices in a food crisis or finding new and interesting food companies to invest in.

Liz348 I suspected something was wrong about that article since H.E.B. grocery stores in TX stops people from leaving the grocery with a cart if you dont have a receipt in hand\/bag and there are NO hunk-like boulders at the exit. I once ate at their BBQ restaurant and threw my receipt away with my meal receipt.  I had to get an employee to break the circuit. At first when this happens you don\u2019t know what is wrong. I am very sure that there has to be a permissionless way to exit due to fire laws. I received a text on Friday that, per the judge\u2019s ruling, my EBT would come in today, as normal.

First, I am truly sorry to hear you\u2019re going through this sort of thing.  I hope that the confusing maze of court rulings and maneuvers by the executive branch ends with your benefits restored tomorrow. Second, I find a silent rage building up inside me, even though the biggest inconvenience I might personally experience in the near term is having a flight canceled in 10 days.  You\u2019re but one example of how real people\u2019s lives are being turned upside down, all over a shutdown that as far as I can tell is about nothing.   Our politicians have allowed real people to be treated like they are pawns on a game board.  Air traffic controllers are working without pay, in one of the most stressful jobs out there.  Every day I expect to read a headline about an air disaster killing hundreds, due to the system being over stressed. Meanwhile, Taco has spit in the face of MAGA, spending all his time meeting with foreign gladhandlers and moochers.  The latest being an Al-Qaeda headchopper who calls himself the ruler of Syria, although he only controls a small part of the former territory of Syria.   This clown has sullied and tarnished the White House.  A whore house in a bad part of town has more honor. But I reserve my greatest fury for the despicable weasel Mike Johnson.  A speaker so weak he can\u2019t even be bothered to call the House into session.  May the fires of Hell await him. Indeed, may they all burn in the deepest levels of hell. We\u2019ve sunk beneath banana republic level. Such kind thoughts, thank you, I will be ok (for now). I had qualified for SNAP for a dozen years but never took it. I didn\u2019t want to take anything from the general fund. By earlier this year things had gotten tougher and I was at best only breaking-even at the end of the month, so I took it. After that I managed to save a little bit. Now, I had had a growing serious leak in the cold water tap of my kitchen sink which last week I tried to fix myself. When I did it broke, so I had to shut it off with the dilapidated shut off valve below (it\u2019s growing a leak). That was my only source of drinking water, the bathroom only has a working hot water feed, the cold is shot, I don\u2019t turn on the hot water heater. I shower every once in a while at the senior center. I turn the kitchen cold on and store up a weeks worth, then shut it off. That valve will not take many cycles. I will have to call a plumber and hope I can cover it. That\u2019s how we live. I didn\u2019t mean to overshare, but carrying on, I just replaced my two year old+ violin strings (six months is bad) with a two month old set I had stashed and I\u2019m happy. Material conditions and all. :-) I don\u2019t mean to intrude but it sounds as is that might be an old place and you could be in luck it the faucet is from the \u201980\u2019s or earlier. Older faucets had rubber washers at the back held on by a screw that cost pennies to replace and newer ones have plastic cylinders that cost about $15-20. The rubber washers actually come in a bag of assorted sizes and would cost you about $5. With an old style first put a cloth over the drain so you don\u2019t loose parts down the drain. With the water valve down below turned off, you can remove the handle (a screw). If it is old style, the large faucet assembly (1+ inch?) will unscrew (lefty loosie, righty tightie) with an adjustable crescent wrench. The whole thing will come out easily and a rubber washer will be on the back held on by a machine screw. If it is newer faucet style there will not be a large narrow hex head under the valve stem. A newer faucet style will likely be a snug fit that sealed by an O ring on the cylinder assembly and has to be pushed in and pulled out. This can be difficult if it has been years and you may be better off with a plumber or friend. I guess one way to get it out would be to turn on the water (A JOKE! Do not try!) If you do get it out you can take it to a hardware store for a matching part. Good luck. I don\u2019t understand why the air traffic controllers don\u2019t just walk out. They aren\u2019t getting paid. Why are they working?  If the government tried to force them to work, well slavery is illegal last time I checked. If they all walked Trump and company could not replace them with scabs as they have a shortage of controllers they way it is. Trump would have to find a way to pay them or end the shutdown pronto because the airlines and the flying public would be all over his fat butt. Some are calling in and saying that they don\u2019t have the money to put gas in their cars to drive to work or pay carers to mind their children. Will they be arrested? We are about to find out whether there is a single state governor with the political and moral courage to publicly commit to feeding their people, no matter what Trump does to manipulate the crisis.

That pseudo shrink does have flair though. The MAHA-Fueled Rise of Natural Family Planning (NY Times via archive.ph) Samantha Kopy logged onto a video call at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday to teach the secret language of the menstrual cycle. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a crystal ball. We can\u2019t know exactly when we are going to ovulate,\u201d Mrs. Kopy said to the young, Christian couples on her computer screen. \u201cSo we go off the signs and symptoms of our body.\u201d Six people stared back at Mrs. Kopy from living rooms across America \u2014 ready to learn how to prevent pregnancy without using birth control. The women in the group had a few different options, Mrs. Kopy explained. They could test their urine for a particular hormone, or take their temperature each morning as soon as they woke up. The most diligent among them might consider their cervical mucus, Mrs. Kopy added, advising them to \u201clift it up between your pointer and your thumb.\u201d If it\u2019s clear and slippery, she said, that\u2019s a sign of fertility. Probably a night to abstain. Or the dudes could use condoms? Meanwhile, in Obamacare land Skyrocketing ACA premiums force enrollees to make tough decisions (CNN)  Late last month, Elizabeth Wick got the email she had been dreading. Her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, told her that the monthly premiums for her Affordable Care Act policy would soar to $1,380 next year, up from $862. Wick, 57, currently gets $400 in federal premium subsidies, which makes the monthly cost of her health insurance more manageable. But the Arlington, Texas, resident is not counting on that assistance for next year since she also received a letter from the federal Obamacare exchange saying she likely won\u2019t be eligible for any help in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at year\u2019s end.  Obamacare didn\u2019t staunch medical bankruptcies. It\u2019s been mostly a debacle that nuked any discussion of health care as a human right for a generation or more, thanks Obama! And during an ongoing Pandemic! I have a young(er) friend (late fifties) who is quite distressed for her own outcome.

Sam Altman Says That in a Few Years, a Whole Company Could Be Run by AI, Including the CEO Futurism Glad to hear the idea that upper management could be replaced by AI is finally peeking over the horizon. I would think, given the low calibre of corporate officers we\u2019ve been seeing for the last 50 years, that C-suite personnel are extremely amenable to automation. LLVMs, which do their best to produce output that is in line with something that some human has produced before (and are inherently incapable of anything novel), seem like the perfect thing to run a modern company. It will be interesting to see the immediate, vehement denials that a machine can do the same work as a human being in corporate leadership roles.  \u201cLeading a company is far too nuanced, requires too much imagination and problem solving ability, and requires reliability even in new circumstances.\u201d  These rationales pretty much write themselves, but will have a plethora of new adherents now that high-paying jobs are at stake. Certainly, the rate of return for automating CEOs will be beyond debate. Automating Elon Musk will save Tesla a trillion dollars right out of the gate. How long are they going to keep trying to sell the screenplay for The Matrix as a business plan? I was wondering if the markets will get over tech CEO\u2019s competing with Azimov. Even more funny, when will Huang recognize that Altman would go off GPU\u2019s, if OpenAI survives, given tech trends in models and lower power chips. Work being done to make gigawatt centers obsolete. As if Moore\u2019s law were rescinded. This one is getting so over the top that the press may finally stop treating ceo tech puffery as the latest word of God. But one doubts it.

The Dangerous Stalemate Over Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program (NY Times via archive.ph) With no negotiations, no oversight and no clarity about Iran\u2019s stock of nuclear material, many in the region fear another war with Israel is inevitable. Sure, why not, given regime change is the goal?  President Trump insists that U.S. strikes \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program this summer, but regional officials and analysts have become less convinced in the months since, and they warn another outbreak of war between Israel and Iran is only a matter of time.  lol, it was quite a fireworks show I bet though, and little Trump got Big. The Fatwa against building nukes is still in place, as far as I know (good for them), but that isn\u2019t taken into consideration by these warmongers. Their mission is regime change, but why?

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"In a sign that things are definitely going well for his second term, Donald Trump is promising to send cash to every American. Tucked away in a series of posts on Truth Social that railed against recent setbacks for his tariff scheme, Trump promised a tariff dividend for every American worth several thousand dollars. \u201cPeople that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k\u2019s are Highest EVER. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\u201d Related Trump championed several stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump branded the payments, which totaled $814 billion, with his name. The influx of cash was not enough to overcome the general sentiment about his first term and handling of the pandemic. He lost to President Joe Biden, who issued one more stimulus payment. The Supreme Court is weighing whether Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on many of the United States\u2019 trading partners was done legally. In oral arguments earlier this week, the justices seemed skeptical of the Trump administration\u2019s defense and openly worried about whether Trump was usurping power from Congress. The promise of a payout could be seen as an effort to make ending the tariffs politically unpopular. In another post, Trump fumed about the Court\u2019s expected decision. \u2018The President of the United States is allowed (and fully approved by Congress!) to stop ALL TRADE with a Foreign Country (Which is far more onerous than a Tariff!), and LICENSE a Foreign Country, but is not allowed to put a simple Tariff on a Foreign Country, even for purposes of NATIONAL SECURITY,\u201d he wrote.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"The OnePlus 13 beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra last year \u2014 could this time be different?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.        Coming soon The Galaxy S26 Ultra will soon become Samsung's top flagship, and it might be worth waiting for. A privacy-focused display, Qi2 charging support, and Qualcomm's latest and greatest processor highlight the list of rumored improvements for the upcoming smartphone.        A strong contender The OnePlus 15 lacks some features that gave its predecessor a leg up over Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra. Still, the phone is well-positioned to challenge the upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra. It will offer significantly-longer battery life while achieving similar, if not better, overall performance.  OnePlus and Samsung have dominated the flagship Android phone market for the past few years. They've each traded blows, with the OnePlus 13 earning a rare five-star rating from Android Central, besting the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Now, both brands are prepping to release their new models for 2026 and beyond. Can Samsung reclaim the top spot in our list of best Android phones, or will OnePlus hold the line? We already know everything about the OnePlus 15 following its launch in China, but the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is shrouded in secrecy. It's still at least a few months out from a public reveal, so we only have rumors and leaks to go on. If you're craving an early preview, here's a speculative comparison between the OnePlus 15 and the Galaxy S26 Ultra.      OnePlus debuted the OnePlus 15 in China in October 2025, but as is typical, global users need to wait a bit longer. The company announced the OnePlus 15 will launch globally on November 15, which is actually earlier than expected. Pricing and availability details specific to North American and global markets are currently unknown. We do know there will be 12GB and 16GB RAM configurations, plus 256GB or 512GB storage options. Launch rumors for Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra have been contradictory of late, with multiple predictions stating the phone has been delayed. It'll now likely release in either February 2026 or March 2026, with one rumor claiming the official date is February 25, 2026. As for pricing, the latest leaks predict the Galaxy S26 Ultra could see a price hike compared to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.      Samsung is rumored to refresh the Galaxy S26 Ultra's design to feature more rounded corners, matching the base and Plus models. Previously, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's corners were sharper, causing ergonomics to be iffy. Samsung will rectify this issue with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and make the phone more comfortable to hold, according to leaked CAD renders. There may be minor adjustments to the phone's dimensions, but rumors suggest that the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will maintain a similar form factor, featuring a 6.9-inch display. The display itself will be a QHD+ panel with 120Hz resolution, and it's tipped to add a Privacy Display feature. Previewed at MWC 2024 as the Flex Magic Panel OLED, this feature would eliminate the need for a dedicated privacy screen protector to fend off prying eyes. S Pen fans will be happy to learn that the Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to keep the internally housed stylus, for now. The S Pen is unlikely to gain new features, but it will be redesigned to match the smartphone's curvier look. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android      OnePlus resisted the industry trend toward flat sides and rectangular chassis for years, but the OnePlus 15 finally gives in to it. In fact, the OnePlus 15 ends up looking more like the Galaxy S25 Ultra (and upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra) than ever before. It sports a flat back with a squircle camera bump, housing three rear cameras and a flash. It's 8.2mm thick, measuring 161.42 x 76.67 mm, and weighing either 211 or 215 grams, depending on the chosen color. Notably, the OnePlus 15 has an enhanced IP69 rating that protects against high-pressure and high-temperature water jets, while the Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to keep its IP68 rating.      The OnePlus 15 ditches a QHD+ display for a 1.5K resolution panel, adding a 165Hz refresh rate instead. This allows the smartphone to provide smoother visuals and an improved gaming experience at the expense of raw clarity. OnePlus says 165Hz refresh rates can't be achieved with a QHD+ display, hence the downgrade. If you prefer smoother refresh rates, opt for the OnePlus 15. For crispness, go with the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra when it's available.      From a hardware perspective, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra and the OnePlus 15 should have a lot in common. Both phones will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, an impressive chipset suited for AI and gaming tasks. Each one will have 12GB or 16GB or memory to pair with that processor, depending on your storage configuration. Samsung might use a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy variant for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but OnePlus has custom tweaks of its own too. It has a \"Gaming Core\" that optimizes at the processor level for improved performance and efficiency. According to OnePlus, \"the OP Gaming Core will deliver industry-leading per-frame power consumption control while maintaining a consistently stable 120 FPS experience in popular games with minimal frame rate fluctuations.\" Category Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra (rumored\/expected) OnePlus 15 Display 6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate, Privacy Display 6.78-inch 1.5K AMOLED, 165Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 RAM 12GB \/ 16GB 12GB \/ 16GB Storage Up to 1TB UFS 4.0 (or UFS 4.1) Up to 512GB UFS 4.1 Rear Camera 1 200 MP, f\/1.7, 24mm (wide) 50MP, f\/1.8, 24mm Rear Camera 2 10 MP, f\/2.4, 67mm (telephoto) N\/A Rear Camera 3 50 MP, f\/3.4 (periscope telephoto) 50MP, f\/2.8, 80mm (periscope telephoto) Rear Camera 4 50 MP, f\/1.9 (ultrawide) 50MP, f\/2.0,  16mm (ultrawide) Front Camera 12 MP, f\/2.2 32MP, f\/2.4 Ingress Protection IP68\/ IP69 IP69 Connectivity 5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 6.0 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0 Battery 5,000mAh 7,300mAh Charging 60W, Qi 2.2 Magnetic Compatibility w\/ 25W wireless speeds 120W wired, 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless, 5W reverse wired Dimensions 163.4 x 77.9 x 7.8 mm 161.4 x 76.7 x 8.1 mm Weight Unknown 211g or 215g OS One UI 8.5 w\/ Android 16 OxygenOS 16 w\/ Android 16 In the camera department, we expect the Galaxy S26 Ultra to have an edge over the OnePlus 15. It will have two telephoto cameras, capable of multiple zoom lengths, compared to the OnePlus 15's single 50MP zoom lens. Samsung's flagship should have a 200MP primary camera, whereas OnePlus' contender has a 50MP primary shooter. Each phone will also have an ultrawide lens, with the OnePlus 15's version being a 50MP camera. OnePlus will win the selfie camera showdown if Samsung doesn't make an unexpected upgrade. The OnePlus 15 has a 32MP front-facing camera, and Samsung is expected to stick with the same 12MP offering.      The OnePlus 13 was so outstanding that even with a few downgrades, the OnePlus 15 has the chops to compete with Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra. Key reasons to choose the OnePlus 15 will be battery life and overall performance. The larger 7,300mAh battery capacity enables multi-day battery life for some users, and the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is fine-tuned for gaming. However, there are reasons to pick the Galaxy S26 Ultra, such as magnetic Qi2 charging, S Pen support, and a QHD+ display panel. Ultimately, we won't know what the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will look like until the official launch gets closer. If you're on the fence, it makes sense to wait and see what Samsung will come out with in 2026.       Worth waiting for You might eventually decide the OnePlus 15 is the better choice for you, but it's worth holding out for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra. There are rumored features, like a QHD+ display and privacy mode, that you won't find on the OnePlus 15.        A gaming powerhouse OnePlus rebuilt the OnePlus 15 from the ground up to maximize overall performance, and specifically gaming. There's a fast chip, a 165Hz display, and a 7,300mAh battery to power your mobile gaming sessions. If you're a big gamer, the OnePlus 15 might suit your needs better than the Galaxy S26 Ultra.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"\"I've lost my appetite for launching games.\" Like many independent developers, Falconeer and Bulwark creator Tomas Sala faces a problem: how does he get recognition for his games in an overcrowded market that prefers, paradoxically, hits? His old answer used to be 'to make new games and hope'. To beaver away on something for a few years and then release it, doing everything he could - crossing every finger and toe - in the hope his game would find a way to stick, and capture an audience and succeed. And he has had some success this way. Birdy aerial combat game The Falconeer was well-timed with the release of Xbox Series S\/X, such that it became an unlikely launch title, earning it a lot of exposure as well as \"an inhuman amount of expectation\", Sala tells me in a video call. Feedback was fierce, both positively and negatively. The launch of chill sea-town building game Bulwark last year went more smoothly, but again Sala divided the audience. Some people told him \"I've never played anything like this - it makes me reconnect with a how game like this could be\", whereas other people said, \"this makes me relearn everything; I fucking hate it,\" Sala reflects. Suffice to say, he didn't enjoy the launch of either game very much. But moreso, in the 10 years he's been making his own games, the market has changed in dramatic ways. \"I've spent a lot of time thinking about this,\" Sala says, \"and 2025 is mean-gaming. You're trying to get on the viral flywheel. \"Everything ever since Balatro,\" he explains, \"you see that viral hits, they get bigger - it's that eternal [upwards] curve. We end up with algorithmic systems where the masses get nothing, so the thousands of games released on a day get next to nothing, then there's a very small middle-ground and an ever-expanding top that gains more and more and more. That's how Steam works: if your game sells, they'll show it to more people, who will buy it so they'll show it to more people. It's a flywheel. Once it goes faster and faster and faster, you can go stratospheric.\" We've seen many examples of this in effect, with games like Escape from Duckov - a PvE single-player extraction shooter - currently enjoying hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. Duckov amassed 2 million sales in under two weeks. Then there's 3D Vampire Survivors-alike Megabonk, which had a massive moment earlier in October, and co-op climbing game Peak, which was everywhere in late-summer. These small-team or solo games seem to appear from nowhere, blaze briefly like magnesium fire, leaving the rest of the more traditional gaming industry dazed and mystified by their success. It's a conscious shift, says Sala. \"In 2025, you're seeing games made to go viral. It's what you're seeing happening on Roblox. It's a certain easily digestible viral sensation.\" TikTok and its short-form video are another huge influencing factor, Sala acknowledges. Mix AI in as well, and you see the potential for potentially endless amounts of quick-made games, which can respond in a heartbeat to whatever's currently trending. But Sala refuses to be swayed. \"I am not a believer in that,\" he says. \"I am on the opposite saying that's not tenable; you don't want to be part of that. Everything in my gut says to run away from that and try to build sustainable.\" His great pivot, then, has been to look at what games like Dwarf Fortress and mech-shooter Brigador do, which is double-down on their communities, and nurture them. \"Those are small teams that have persevered in making a sustainable business out of their game, their franchise, their universe,\" Sala says. Crucially: \"Those are the people I know that have the most fun. They're the least stressed because they're not releasing hit singles, they're selling out arenas, because people are just coming for them. They're coming for the fact the game will be there in five years, and it'll have changed. \"I want to be there,\" Sala tells me. \"And with Bulwark, I did it.\" Both The Falconeer and Bulwark required fixing and additional development - things that daunted a tired Sala at the time, but which have retrospectively played a key part in where he finds himself now. This kind of work energises him. \"You need people to shit over your work otherwise you can't improve,\" he says. \"It's so painful. It's emotionally damaging. But if people don't come out and say this fucking sucks, I can't get arsed to fix it.\" Taking the time to improve his games after launch enables him to leave them in a much better place, and build a community. Especially for games like Bulwark, which has a larger presence on Steam. That's why you see him so transparently interacting with the players of his games there, candidly telling them what he's up to while asking for their ideas about what to do next. They appreciate it and he appreciates the work. And Bulwark is a much better game now because of it. All of which has led Sala to - and this is the caveat I mentioned above - embarking on a huge overhaul for The Falconeer, the Revolution Remaster, which launched this week. For free. (And there's currently a free-play weekend underway.) He's used Bulwark's town-tech to beef-out the world and enlarge the settlements; he's also remodelled the giant falcons you fly around on; and he's structurally condensed the world so there's distance to travel. \"I think you were the one that said it could have done being a more condensed experience,\" Sala tells me, \"and I thought, yeah, that's fucking right.\" And he's finally added proper mouse and keyboard controls. Really, it's a top-to-bottom rework, and it's worth reiterating that it's free. All that work for no monetary gain? That's part of the point. The bigger reward is building trust and support from a community - a stable base of players who can support his work now and into the future. This way he doesn't have to play the \"casino\", as he calls it, when releasing a new game on Steam. He's happier, his community is happier, and The Falconeer and Bulwark have never been better. It's a virtuous cycle. That, in turn, means his Ursee trilogy - to which those two games belong - represent an up-to-date body of work, rather than games he left alone five years ago. And that's important when you consider there's still one more game to come - a third, ship-based game called Ancient Waves that he's going to make a proper start on in January. He's actually going to openly test a lot of ideas for it in Bulwark. It's the most relaxed I think I've seen Sala, and we've talked a few times over the years, which suggests to me he really has found a more enjoyable way of working. \"I've lost my appetite for launching games because, but I've gained an appetite of working with players to make games better,\" he says. \"I've grown into someone who wants to not release games, but make games sustainably.\" And given the state the industry's in, I wonder if it's a template we could adopt more widely.

Across KPMG's offices nationwide, employees say they prefer round tables. So with that feedback and more in mind, the Big Four consulting firm designed and opened a new, 450,000-square-foot office at Two Manhattan West in Manhattan's Hudson Yards neighborhood. The firm hopes the gleaming new headquarters will not only reassert its presence in New York City but also tempt its more than 5,000 employees in New York back to the office more often. Few things have tested corporate America's resolve quite like the whiplash between the work-from-home movement and the subsequent return-to-office push. Over the past few years, many companies have attempted to lure \u2014 or force \u2014 employees back to the workplace with everything from new perks to stringent mandates. At KPMG, employees typically split their weeks between the office, client sites, and home. Last month, 81% of New York-based partners and employees worked in person about 2 days a week, the firm said. Tim Walsh, who stepped into the role of KPMG's CEO and chair in July, told Business Insider that the new headquarters signifies the firm's commitment to strengthening its presence in the city. \"We've always been committed to New York,\" Walsh told me at the firm's new office when I visited. \"This is certainly a strong recommitment on behalf of KPMG in terms of how important this market is for our firm.\" \"It's certainly brand elevating, in my opinion,\" he added. I visited the office on a rainy morning in October. Soon after I arrived, I met Vanessa Scaglione, KPMG's head of real estate services \u2014 one of hundreds involved in designing the new office \u2014 who took me on a tour of the space. The 12 floors of the office are divided into four blocks of three, each themed after a different New York neighborhood \u2014 Upper Manhattan, Midtown, Downtown, and the Financial District. Throughout the office, decorative touches \u2014 from neighborhood murals to the perforated steel ceiling in the lobby, designed to evoke Park Avenue radiator covers \u2014 pay homage to an earlier era of New York, when the firm was first established as Marwick, Mitchell & Company in 1897. The office, which officially opened on November 5, was more than five years in the making. It was designed in partnership with design firm HOK, along with several other vendors. KPMG did not disclose financial details about the total cost of the new office. What surprised me most was how much the office design was shaped by employee feedback, which also guided the choice of location \u2014 one that keeps commuting times steady or shorter for two-thirds of the firm's staff. A firm representative told Business Insider that the design was informed by feedback gathered from employees after they moved into earlier offices. These suggestions were used to identify what was working well and where adjustments might be needed. In addition, they also had an ambassador program which drew employees from across departments to guide colleagues through the transition, the KPMG spokesperson said. The firm also distributed a newsletter, digital renditions, and built a lab, where they piloted various types of workspaces and technology to obtain feedback from staffers on what worked best. For Walsh, the office is also the start of a new chapter for the firm \u2014 one where employees, clients, and technology work together more seamlessly. \"It's really a new era at KPMG, and this space is a perfect physical representation of that,\" he said. \"It's changing the way our people will work together and collaborate. It's bringing technology into everything that they do.\" The new office is replete with rooms for major meetings and board discussions, and smaller breakout rooms for employees to collaborate with each other and clients. Navigation has been simplified by using room names that match New York City landmarks. Interactive maps appear throughout the building. There are a few enclosed offices that are intentionally located away from the perimeter of the floor so that staffers and clients can easily find their way, the spokesperson said. The firm tracks attendance through badge swipes and time sheets. One of the hallmarks of the new office is a space called \"Ignition,\" where staffers lead clients through customized sessions in design thinking, which the firm says is a more human-centered approach to problem-solving. Projects that the firm has worked on through Ignition include helping large banks develop a system for employees to navigate international assignments, assisting large retailers with corporate storytelling, and helping clients through mergers and acquisition decisions. \"These are our existing, ongoing clients. They're experiencing new disruption in their industry. They really don't know what's next, and they might come to us to explore that next level,\" Caroline Berman, a manager at KPMG supporting Ignition, told me at the office the day I visited. Clients spend anywhere from a minimum of 90 minutes to multiple days in KPMG's Ignition experiences, she said. When a client has a change in leadership, or new board members join an organization, they may turn to KPMG for guidance on \"effective teaming,\" she said. Participants begin in the Arrival Lounge at Ignition, then branch into different paths based on session size. They enter the immersive space, a dynamic area used to introduce or emphasize key moments in the sessions. From there, they move into the lab, which is equipped with modular furniture that's rearranged throughout the day for workshops and exercises, she said. \"We want them to leave here with tangible outcomes, like a 30-60-90 roadmap,\" or even \"actual shifts in mindset and behavior,\" Berman said. Spaces for deep work and collaboration are an important part of the firm's effort to upskill its workforce on AI. The firm has developed several internal AI tools like aIQ Chat, which gives employees secure access to large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and its Digital Gateway, an AI-powered platform the firm says helps it model and scenario plan in real time for changing legislation and regulations for its tax clients. KPMG has also been running an internal AI transformation program to train employees on AI for the past two years, a spokesperson for the firm told Business Insider. \"In the US, we know virtually every KPMG employee is using AI \u2014and not just occasionally. 90% of our people are actively engaging with our advanced AI tools, and our data shows that those who use them more frequently are seeing the greatest benefits, including higher quality output, reduced stress, and more time to focus on strategic work,\" the firm's spokesperson said. Walsh said the firm is committed to providing employees access to AI tools, but did not explicitly say how it'll change the way the firm evaluates performance. \"It's a high-performing culture,\" he said. \"So I wouldn't say we're asking more from our employees, but what we are saying to everyone at KPMG is you need to adopt and use the tools that are being provided because it's critical to your success in the future.\" The office isn't just a place for work. KPMG's new office features areas where employees can gather and socialize. Near the first-floor entrance, there's a coffee bar that transforms into a full bar in the evening. Scaglione said it captures the atmosphere of classic New York City bars \u2014 for her, it's reminiscent of the famous Old Town Tavern, which opened in 1854. There's an employee lounge, known as The Manhattan, where employees can network. Within Ignition, there's a more residential-looking room, known as \"The Living Room,\" where employees finalize deals with clients. The intention is to create an environment where employees feel comfortable, Walsh said. \"I think our employees are going to come and expect to be in tight quarters. That's the furthest thing from what we did here,\" he said. \"We provided so many spaces for people to come in and just feel good about being here.\"         Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        If you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t alive, or weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t news-cognizant, back in 2007 when the slow motion debt crisis all around us started to give way to The Great Recession, what was eerie was that it felt like you were always hearing about refinancing debt. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn on a TV, or click a page on MySpace, without someone offering to refinance your debt. This was because there was a huge\u00e2\u0080\u0094and for most people, hidden\u00e2\u0080\u0094market for things called mortgage-backed securities. This piece at the Onion captured the moment well.You could get a cheap mortgage weirdly easily because of mortgage backed securities. This involved repackaging people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mortgages\u00e2\u0080\u0094as in mortgages on their homes\u00e2\u0080\u0094as lucrative, tradable assets, and these assets were being purchased on behalf of entities like investment banks and retirement funds. Lehman Brothers, for instance, was a staid, boring financial institution that was heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities.Mortgage-backed securities were everywhere in the economy, and the entities that owned them were the pillars of economic stability. When, slowly but surely, people defaulted on their mortgages in higher and higher numbers, the mortgage-backed securities that had been thought of as valuable were suddenly thought of as doodoo. In 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, and the world was plunged into chaos. In this way, over $10 trillion in wealth vanished in the U.S. during 2008 alone. That crisis has come and gone. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a different world, where things don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work the same way. We have different problems.Today, all U.S. economic growth is driven by investment in AI. Entire U.S. towns are banking on the idea that data centers being built in their communities will sustain their economies forever, or at least until some other type of business exists to create a different kind of boom. The real estate biz, which caused the 2008 crisis, is also being propped up by the data center business. AI is inescapable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the defining fact of this economic moment. But in surveys, people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work in AI largely doubt it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for the world. With that in mind, Ian Frish at the New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 DealBook newsletter wrote something a little unsettling yesterday. It seems that a company called QTS Data Centers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe biggest player in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is entirely owned by the investment company Blackstone. And Blackstone, it seems, is seeking to refinance $3.46 billion in QTS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt. DealBook apparently got a peek at an offer sheet showing that Blackstone is about to put this debt up for sale. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the largest of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommercial-mortgage-backed securities\u00e2\u0080\u009d deals in AI in 2025. The largest so far anyway. Things are not the same now, like I said. We have different problems. If OpenAI fizzles and never figures out how to make revenue, and the investors all lose their hats, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure other AI investors like, say, Elon Musk and the Saudis will pick up the slack and find a way to drive revenue from AI and keep that crazy amount of AI debt valuable. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure the contagion won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spread too far, and there will be some other perfectly healthy area of the economy, with a wholesome, substantive, real driver of value at its center.

Since my first experience with Bose's noise-cancelling headphones, they\u2019ve come a long way, and I\u2019m happy to say I can wholeheartedly recommend them to more than just the jet-set crowd. Their ANC is exceptional, and this year\u2019s sound quality is satisfyingly detailed, with some other tricks that are worth the price of admission. Noise cancelling (Of course!) Detail retrieval Charge while listening Fold flat disconnect USB-C Audio Comfort Mics disabled when not using Bluetooth LDAC has broader support than aptX Adaptive  Why you can trust Android Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  Years ago, I tested the Bose QC35II and eventually Bose QC earbuds. While the active noise-cancelling (ANC) was excellent, I found the sound quality a bit flat for my taste. Since then, Bose has changed that sound signature, releasing one of my absolute favorite open-ear products, the Bose Open Ultra. I was also highly impressed with the Bose SoundLink Plus and how robust its audio playback is. With those recent experiences, I was looking forward to seeing what Bose has done with the latest generation of the QuietComfort Ultra over-ear headphones! I\u2019ll let you know right now, I was definitely not disappointed with the sound quality this time around. There are some things you should know before buying, though, so I\u2019ll get into all of that below.      The Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) is widely available for $449 through Bose\u2019s own website, Amazon.com, and in many brick-and-mortar stores like Best Buy in the United States. There are some new colors on offer this year, in addition to black and white; you get the limited edition colors of Midnight Violet, Driftwood Sand, and Desert Gold. Categories Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Conectivity Bluetooth 5.4 w\/Multipoint connectivity Speakers TBD Codec support SBC, AAC, aptX Adaptive (Snapdragon Sound) Wired support 16-bit, 44.1 or 48kHz audio via USB-C audio, 2.5mm to 3.5mm analog aux cable Battery life Up to 30 hours playback w\/ANC (up to 23 w\/Immersive Audio enabled), 15-minute charge for 3 hours playback Charging USB-C App support Android, iOS Audio tuning 3-band EQ (app) Microphone 10 mics total Colors Black, White Smoke, Desert Gold, Midnight Violet, Driftwood Sand,   Bundled accessories USB-C cable, 2.5mm to 3.5mm aux cable, hard case - Best wireless headphones - Best noise-canceling headphones - Best headphones to travel with There is a lot to like about 2025\u2019s Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen). As full-size headphones go, you get a relatively compact hard case to carry your headphones in. They fold up small to fit in the case, and you\u2019ll find the included USB-C and 2.5mm-to-3.5 mm cables in a small pocket on the case's lid. Some cosmetic changes were made this year: the matte finish of the first gen has been replaced with shiny metal earcup yokes. The 2nd generation QC Ultra Headphones are still incredibly comfortable during long periods of wear, due to their weight (~264 grams\/9.3oz), a respectable amount of padding on the cans and the headband, and a clamping force that feels almost non-existent- and that\u2019s a feat, considering that I have a huge melon.      Despite having such a light clamping force, the headphones don\u2019t wobble or make noise when walking, jogging, or working out. I was surprised by how well they stay in place when lying down on a weight bench. I'd advise against using them at the gym as they have no water-resistance rating, though. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Similar to the previous generation, you get a touch-sensitive volume strip, which also allows you to assign one of four shortcuts to trigger when you touch and hold it. USB-C charging is still on board, but this year, you also get USB-C audio support for 16-bit, 44.1 kHz, or 48kHz audio, and you can charge while listening, in all modes this time around.      Also new is the ability to remove the headphones and lay them flat on a solid surface to disconnect from your source device, which took around four seconds during my testing. Lying flat for 20 minutes, the headphones will enter a deep sleep, power-saving mode. When I picked them up again, the QC Ultra 2nd Gen would wake and reconnect to the previously connected device in under 10 seconds every time. Building on that, the headphones' wearing detection functionality has been top-notch. Highly responsive!      New this year, you can completely deactivate ANC through the app. The ANC menu features an on\/off toggle and a slider that allows you to adjust the noise cancellation level to your preference. Specifically, where the QC Ultra 2nd Gen excels over the competition, such as Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 excellent Px7 S3, is its ability to reduce high-frequency noise significantly. Many competitors do a good job of hushing the noise of car engines in a metropolitan landscape, but the whoosh! of cars passing by, the squeal of a subway car\u2019s brakes, or airplane cabin noise is often where things fall apart. Not the case with the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen). In addition to my testing while out and about on the streets, I used 80dB of airplane cabin sound on YouTube to test high-frequency ANC, and the QC Ultra 2nd Gen continues to shine in this area. One aspect of the ANC function that I enjoy is when you transition from the natural-sounding Aware mode to Quiet mode via the multifunction button on the right earcup; it takes a few seconds to fully activate. As the noise cancellation ramps up, ambient sounds gently fade into the background. While some may not like that, it\u2019s a very pleasing auditory experience for me. What about the sound quality, though? Overall, the QC Ultra 2nd Gen\u2019s default sound profile is a V curve with warm lows for modern music listeners, and solid clarity in the upper mid and high frequency ranges. The soundstage is fairly airy, with good stereo imaging, sound separation, and instrumentation. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail retrieval from these headphones as well. The app includes a basic set of EQ presets and three-band EQ customization to get the sound closer to what works for you if the stock sound doesn\u2019t completely do it. The headphones take well to those three-band adjustments. Just be careful with the bass slider \u2014 at higher volumes, you may experience some distortion. Listening to Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cTha Shiznit,\u201d you can clearly hear a detail that often gets lost with other headphones: the sleigh bells in the background. In Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019,\u201d you can hear the backing vocals that play during the intro as well. Listening to Michael Abel\u2019s \u201cViolin Duel\u201d from the \u201cChevalier\u201d OST, the attack and decay of the aggressively bowed violins, where the martel\u00e9 technique is being liberally applied, are rendered much better than I had anticipated.      Listening to music and movies with the Immersive and Cinema modes was a mixed bag. One of the muddiest Hip Hop tracks known to man, Method Man\u2019s \u201cBiscuits,\u201d sounds better with Immersive mode on, as it makes the vocals pop despite being buried by the bass. However, on other tracks with more balanced mastering, I\u2019ve found that while Immersive mode widens the soundstage a bit, it ultimately renders the treble a bit too bright for my liking. Not sibilant, though, so it isn\u2019t all bad. I also found myself deactivating both Immersive and Cinema mode when watching action movies like \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d or \u201cBlue Eye Samurai,\u201d as it buries bass response in favor of pushing forward the frequencies that contain dialog. I can see how, with films that mix more chaotic sound design with dialogue, Cinema mode could be pretty helpful, but in movies and content with percussive sounds like Thor\u2019s hammer clobbering minions in Surtur\u2019s den, that thump gets diminished in an unsatisfying way.           Final notes on sound quality: Having had the headphones for only a couple of weeks, I\u2019ll need more time to test, but so far the battery life has been very good. The previous-generation QC Ultra headphones were rated for 24 hours or 18 hours with Immersive mode activated, while this second-generation model is rated for 30 hours or 24 hours with Immersive mode activated. It\u2019s going to take you three hours to fully charge them when drained, but a 15-minute charge will get you three hours of playback in a pinch. The good news is that with the addition of USB-C music, you can also charge while plugged in, so the number of times the headphones are dead and unusable for at least 15 minutes should be minimal.      - Lossless audio explained - Bluetooth audio codecs explained - Bluetooth LE Audio FAQ For the most part, my complaints are very minor. Starting with putting them away, you\u2019ll need to position the cables and any dongles in a corner of the lid pocket for the case to close properly. This means that using the entire pocket is a non-starter. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) doesn't support passive playback, which is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you get ANC and Aware mode functionality when wired. On the other hand, if the battery is dead, you can\u2019t just plug in the aux cable and go, which feels like a missed opportunity. Additionally, the built-in microphones don\u2019t work when wired, so you\u2019ll have to raise your phone to your mouth to chat. That brings me to my final area of improvement. The call quality has definitely improved over the previous iteration, but with so many microphones on the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) and at this price point, I expect it to be even stronger. It isn\u2019t bad at all, but my voice could be clearer and a bit brighter. As it stands, in my testing, the sound quality is a bit bassy. The bright spot, though, is the ability to use the app to control how much of your own voice you\u2019ll hear while on a call.      At $450, Bose has a lot of competition on sound quality, but the only other headphones that currently reach, and potentially exceed, its level of high-frequency noise cancellation are Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM6. In terms of sound, there\u2019s no clear winner between Sony and Bose, as the differences are very subjective. Sony wins over Bose in terms of sound customization as its app\u2019s EQ options are much more extensive than Bose\u2019s three-band sliders. That said, Sony still doesn\u2019t offer USB-C audio, so you\u2019ll get more flexibility out of Bose when it comes to sound sources.      The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 feel more luxurious and sound better than Bose, but can\u2019t match the level of ANC, so if you\u2019re a frequent flier, the QC Ultra 2nd generation headphones will likely be the move. You should buy them if\u2026 You shouldn\u2019t buy them if\u2026 For their entertaining sound, top-tier noise cancelling, and USB-C audio, the new Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) is a tough act to follow. And we can\u2019t ignore the elephant in the room! Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM6. Which is better is really a matter of preference. I thoroughly enjoy hearing all an audio file has to offer, so the inclusion of USB-C audio does it for me, giving the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) the edge. For that and the ability to charge while connected, my money goes to Bose.       Sweet silence! For their excellent noise cancelling, overall sound quality, the ability to charge while listening, and USB-C audio, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) are the ANC headphones to beat in 2025!

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.        Durable, powerful, long-lasting The OnePlus 15, which is available in China and coming to North America soon, is a powerful phone and one of the most durable on the market, if not the most durable. With a massive, long-lasting battery, powerful processing, and incredible cameras, it's value is unmatched.       Premium value With a screen size just as big, incredible specs, and affordable price, along with 7 years of software and security support, it's tough to beat the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. While it's battery doesn't last as long as it isn't as durable, nor is the processor presumably as powerful, this is more than enough phone for most. If you are looking for a large-screened phone, the OnePlus 15 vs. the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL are two devices worth considering. Both fit in the relatively affordable yet premium category. They're fantastic phones from reputable brands; you can't go wrong with either, given the reputations of their respective previous generation models. So, the question isn't whether you should get one of these devices if you want a phone with a massive screen. Which one should you get? We're here to help by comparing them in the most important ways. Please note that the OnePlus 15 is currently only available in China, and we will not have specific details about the North American market version until later this month. With that said, some specifications, such as charging speed, may differ for that device. However, it's likely that the phone should, by and large, boast the same specs for the U.S. and Canada as it has in China.      First, we'll dive into the look, feel, and durability. The OnePlus 15, as noted, is currently only available in China but is expected to be released soon in North America. It features a 6.78-inch LTPO screen with a 2,772 x 2,772 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, which can be boosted to 165Hz for gaming experiences like Call of Duty and Clash of Clans. Get up to 1,800 nits brightness. With a matte texture and boxy design based on early renders, it also has a distinctive camera island. On the side is the dedicated Plus Mind button for customized actions. It comes with 256GB or 512GB storage, sadly missing a 1TB option. Where it really shines, however, is in durability. It's not only water-resistant with the usual IP68 rating. It doesn't even just have an IP68 and IP69 rating like the previous-gen OnePlus 13. It also meets an IP66 rating for resistance to dust and water pressure, as well as an IP69K rating for close-range high temperature and high-pressure water jets. You could literally toss this phone in the top rack of a dishwasher, run a cycle, and it should be fine. It also excels in terms of battery life, boasting a massive 7,300 mAh silicon battery that can theoretically last for up to two days before needing to be recharged. Further, it supports ultra-fast charging at 80W or up to 100W with the SUPERVOOC charger and up to 50W wireless with the AIRVOOC charger. This is virtually unmatched by any other phone, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL included, and perhaps only the OPPO Find X9 Pro is the exception. Keep in mind that the North American version might not have the same battery and charging specs, but it's likely to be comparable. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android      Comparatively, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is made from a mix of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and aluminum that gives it a premium feel. According to Nicholas Sutrich in his review, it looks identical to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Admittedly, it's heavier and bulkier than you might like, especially with the added weight required to incorporate Pixelsnap magnets on the back for magnetically attaching MagSafe and Qi2 accessories, such as portable chargers and grips. This decision, however, is a long overdue and smart one, marking the first Android phone that can work with Qi2 accessories out of the box, without a case. It features a large 6.8-inch Super Actua QHD+ OLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, a 2,992 x 1,344 resolution, and a peak brightness of up to 3,300 nits, which Sutrich says makes it \"ridiculously easy to see outside.\" Get it in 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB capacities. It's durable, too, but it \"only\" meets an IP68 rating. So, you can dunk it in water, even keep it submerged for a short period of time. But it's nowhere near as durable as the OnePlus 15. In terms of battery life, it has a 5,200mAh battery and supports 45W wired and 25W wireless Qi2 charging. That sounds incredibly fast, and it is. However, the OnePlus 15 stands out in terms of both battery life and charging speeds. Sutrich says he only noticed meager improvements to battery life with the Pixel 10 Pro XL compared to the previous generation phones. One area where Google has a leg up is in terms of support and longevity. You get seven years of software and security updates with the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, while the OnePlus 15 will presumably only come with four years of major Android OS updates and six years of security patches. That's still pretty good, but something worth considering if you want a phone you can hang onto for as long as possible. Let\u2019s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison of their key specs. Category OnePlus 15 Google Pixel 10 Pro XL OS Android 16, (OxygenOS 16) Android 16 Colors Infinite Black, Sand Storm, Ultra Violet Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, Obsidian Screen Size 6.78 inches 6.8 inches Screen Resolution 2,772 x 2,772 2,992 x 1,344  Screen Type LTPO LTPO OLED Refresh Rate 120Hz (up to 165Hz for gaming) 120Hz Processor Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 Google Tensor G5 RAM 12GB, 16GB 16GB Storage 256GB\/512GB (not expandable) 128GB\/256GB\/512GB\/1TB (not expandable) Cameras 50MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto, 32MP front 50MP wide, 40MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto, 42MP front Speakers Stereo Speakers Stereo Speakers Battery 7,300mAh 5,200mAh Wireless Charging Yes Yes Bluetooth 6.0 6.0 Cellular 5G 5G Size 161.42 x 76.67 x 8.2 mm (8mm for Sand Storm) 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm Weight 211-215 grams 232 grams      Running on Oxygen OS 16 and OnePlus AI with Android 16, the OnePlus 15 boasts a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor with a touch response chip and an advanced Wi-Fi chip. You get 12GB RAM with the 256GB version and 16GB RAM with the 512GB option. Bottom line: this phone is powerful. Along with Gemini AI, you get the new personal assistant with Plus Mind, accessed via a Plus Mind button on the side. Launch PlayLab for experimental AI features. It can stay cool while you're engaging in intense gaming sessions thanks to the 360 Cryo-Velocity Cooling System combined with thermal management and a vapor chamber. A feature called CPU Scheduler can allocate resources intelligently so you get an optimized experience while using the phone. With dual app control, you can even interact with two different apps at the same time. This phone is seemingly built to be a multitasker's and gamer's dream. We'll have more details about this phone and how it operates once we have had the chance to run it through its paces and publish a review.      Running Android 16, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with a Google Tensor G5 chip, which isn't nearly as powerful as the OnePlus engine, especially for activities like gaming. But it will handle multitasking and light to moderate gaming. It's still a powerful phone, but it won't keep up with the OnePlus 15 for the most intense activities. You do get 16GB RAM with every variation, along with deep Gemini integration, including Gemini Live. As far as intelligence goes, this phone earns an A+. For example, there are unique features like Magic Cue that can intelligently call up information across Google apps that are relevant to your conversation or logical next steps as you perform different actions. Sutrich says this is his favorite feature that, once it kicks in after a few days, is worth the wait. The phone also comes with a two-year trial for Satellite SOS access, and handy features like Call Screen and Theft Detection.      The OnePlus 15 has a fantastic triple 50MP camera system with the proprietary DetailMax Engine that uses advanced algorithms combined with powerful processors to help you capture better images. The three cameras include a 50MP Sony IMX906 sensor, a 50MP ultrawide lens with a 116\u00b0 field of view, a 50MP telephoto lens, and a 32MP front camera that can capture ultra-clear 26MP high-resolution images in daylight. A LUT preview feature shows you real-time colour-graded previews of images in the viewfinder so you can get incredibly accurate images. Given the phone's durability, there's even an underwater mode for capturing both photos and videos in freshwater sources. There's also ultra-res digital zoom up to 120x for getting up close to subjects. Sutrich has already taken 100 pictures with the OnePlus 15, and to say he's impressed would be an understatement. He appreciates the less aggressive processing that comes with the DetailMax Engine versus Hasselblad, which was used in previous-generation phones like the OnePlus 13. The result is more realistic-looking pictures with wonderful depth and no \"over beautification,\" as OnePlus CEO Pete Lau called it, nor distortion.      With the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, you get a 50MP wide main camera, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP telephoto with up to 100x Pro Res Zoom, and a 42MP front-facing camera. Sutrich notices that with zoom, if there's text in the image, the camera tends to hallucinate, providing wonderful clarity but without any understanding of what the text actually is. There are all the usual unique features you get with the latest Pixel phones for editing and capturing photos, like Best Take, Add Me, and Magic Editor, along with a few more. Camera Coach guides you while framing a photo to help you get the best result, and Sutrich says it's a fantastic feature for budding photographers. Ask Photos can intelligently edit a photo based on analyzing what could improve it. There's also improved stabilization in videos with up to 20x zoom, automatic Best Take so the camera does the work for you, and more. Overall, Sutrich says the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL camera experience is largely excellent, with even the portrait mode being vastly improved compared to previous generation models.      The decision between the OnePlus 15 vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL really comes down to personal preference and priorities. With the OnePlus 15, you're getting an incredibly durable and powerful phone that will keep up with the needs of heavy users. That's especially so thanks to efficient cooling, powerful processing, and extremely long battery life. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is also a powerful phone, but it comes with some concessions in areas such as battery life, durability, and processing power. However, you also get a clean Android experience with fantastic Gemini and overall AI integration across the board, along with an intuitive user experience. You'll also get a few more years of support for software and security updates, and Google does Feature Drops at least twice a year, always bringing fresh and new experiences to the phone. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a great phone for productivity and light entertainment, while the OnePlus 15 is more of a powerhouse phone for activities like gaming and advanced photo capture, though it has intelligence built in, too. You can't go wrong with either phone. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL already makes our list of the best Android phones, and it's a certainty that the OnePlus 15 will replace the OnePlus 13 on that list. If you're an ultra-power user who games a lot on your phone and works out in the field, the OnePlus 15 is an enticing option worth considering. If you feel like you don't need all the added processing power and durability and just want a simple and familiar experience, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a good option, too. Both give you a lot of phone for a huge price tag.       The best for power users If you're a heavy power user who multitasks, plays intense mobile games, travels, maybe even works outdoors, the OnePlus 15 is an option you should consider. It's a premium phone that will likely come in at an affordable price. It's specs are a cut above the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in many respects.       Still enough for most If you find the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL for a good deal, it's more than enough for most. You'll get an unmatched AI experience with Gemini built in, great cameras, decent battery life and charging speeds, and a stunning large and bright screen. It's not as slim and sleek, but it's still a great phone.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"Mobile payment providers like PayPal, Google Wallet, Stripe, and Apple Pay are likely here to stay, especially since these apps now offer the\u00a0opportunity to create a digital ID for use with TSA's system\u00a0as well as let you store your state-issued identification on your phone. That is to say, they're important for more than just mobile payments and simple banking. PayPal is one of the more popular options, holding 45% of the global payments market.\u00a0PayPal boasts 434 million users and merchants use the service, with\u00a026.3 billion transactions completed in 2024 alone.\u00a0 Unfortunately, PayPal is also known for its high service fees\u00a0and poor support, with over 35,000 reviews on Trustpilot amounting to a less than two-star rating. Not to mention, PayPal is known to have outages from time to time.\u00a0The good news is it's not the only app that exists, so it may not be the best for you. Sometimes, just knowing there are alternatives is enough. But are there any worth using according to real people? Alternatives include Square, Venmo, Cash App, Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet, Apple Pay, Skrill, Payoneer, Stripe, Amazon Pay, and a few others \u2014\u00a0like Shopify Payments. There's not nearly enough time to evaluate all of these services, but there's clearly a lot of competition. To find out which one is best for you, it's good to focus on user satisfaction. Exclusively available on Apple devices like the iPhone and Apple Watch, Apple\u00a0Pay is the ecosystem's standard tap-to-pay digital wallet and money management platform. According to Apple, payment through the service is accepted at 85% of retailers in the U.S. and works pretty much anywhere contactless payments are supported. Like PayPal, that means you can pay with your phone at registers, vendors, and vending machines. You can also use it to pay on websites and on apps, as well as\u00a0send Apple cash. Some popular vendors that support Apple Pay include Starbucks, Groupon, Fandango, Uber, Etsy, and Postmates, but the list goes on. There's no shortage of places to use your digital Apple wallet, which is a huge benefit. Like most digital wallets, you add cards or cash through the app, all of which is connected to your Apple ID. You'll notice that most Apple Pay features are centered around paying for transactions or services, either at a store or online. It's less about sending money to others, but you can do that with Apple Cash. TrustPilot reviews aren't great, but there aren't enough to make a valid conjecture there and Apple users seem happy with the solution. Apple Pay uses advanced security, too, so your iPhone can save you from gas pump skimmers hidden in the wild. Cash App is simple, intuitive, and offers several money-related activities, including the option to buy cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or invest in stocks. Money can be automatically deposited into your account from your bank, there are low payment limits, you can send and receive money to friends and family, and there are built-in tax-filing tools to help calculate what you owe. In addition, Cash App is PCI DSS Level 1 compliant, which stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard\u00a0and means they use robust security to protect credit card data. It works on the web, so you can use it on a computer or on Android and iOS phones through mobile apps. Cash App also allows you to make in-store payments and send money directly, all while taking advantage of Square loyalty rewards. Unfortunately, international payments aren't supported; it's for U.S.-based users only. With over 21,000 reviews, Cash App has a 4.6 star rating on TrustPilot which means users generally rate it \"excellent.\" You'll find quite a few comments that mention they \"absolutely love\" it. It's easy to use and people usually have few or \"no issues.\" That's not to say there aren't negative reviews, but 64% percent of the total reviews are five stars, 7% are four stars, and 3% are three stars. Quite a few people are happy with it. It's worth knowing\u00a0a lot of common text message scams utilize Cash\u00a0App and similar services. Google Wallet is the default mobile payment option on Android devices and is one of the most popular competitors to Samsung Wallet. It used to be called Google Pay, and it dropped some features in the change. For example, you can't use Google Wallet to send money to friends and family. It's mostly for storing payment cards and managing digital IDs, tickets, boarding passes, and so on. This is another service that doesn't have a measurable rating on TrustPilot, seeing how there are less than 50 reviews. However, if you refer to Google Play, Android's mobile app store, the Google Wallet app has 4.5 stars with over 2 million reviews. Some of the top comments there praise Google Wallet for its security, ease of use, high compatibility, and overall convenience \u2014 which could be said about most mobile wallets. You can add credit and debit cards, bank accounts, loyalty rewards cards, and even add your state ID to your Google Wallet. You can also add supported gift cards to shop and pay with them. Mostly at locations that support contactless payments, but you can pay online through select websites and retailers, too. If sending money abroad is the goal, Wise may the best option out of the bunch. You can use it to send money to family and friends, make any kind of transfer, exchange funds into foreign currencies, spend anywhere through contactless and mobile payments, and receive money. Moreover, it's federally regulated and offers excellent security with\u00a0specialized fraud tech that actively checks for suspicious activity daily. On TrustPilot, Wise has a 4.3 star rating with over 270,000 reviews, which is phenomenal. Top comments say that it's convenient, the Wise team offers great customer service and support, the app works reliably, and it's fairly intuitive. Where most of these alternative options don't allow you to do much outside of the United States in terms of sending money or paying (unless they support contactless payments), Wise is a solid option for making money transfers of any kind; not unlike bank wire transfers, but simpler. You can also sign up for a Wise debit card\u00a0and connect it to your account. Wise is available for Android and iOS, but you can access your account in a browser if need be. Also highly-rated by users, with a 4.3 star rating on TrustPilot and nearly 7,000 reviews, people mention in the reviews that Square works well for mobile payments, offers fast response times in terms of support, and is a valuable tool for small business owners. You can also see that the official Square account responds regularly to user reviews on TrustPilot, which is a good sign they're responsive in general. For Square, it's more about facilitating business payments, allowing contactless payments person-to-person, customizing and sending digital invoices, and making card payments from a browser or phone. It works with Android and iOS, and with mobile apps on both platforms. What's also great about it, if you are a small business owner, is you can take contactless payments from other sources\u00a0like\u00a0Apple Pay or Google Wallet. A common complaint for Square, however, is that they have inordinately high credit card processing fees, which is similar to\u00a0PayPal's high fees. Overall, however, user reviews seem to be much more positive about their experiences when using the platform.","label":0}

A real theater-going experience.\u201d  \tSPC felt pretty good going into the weekend given the response to screenings in LA, San Francisco and other markets that saw audiences break out into applause during the film and pushed strong word of mouth. Indie distributors do need to think carefully about opening wide, Barker said, but \u201cthere was no question in our minds that this was a commercial picture.

Hey, maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll even meet your Mr. Right while stepping inside the bookstore or coffee shop. But you want something more than just a few festive lights. You want to travel somewhere you can experience the whole fall and winter holiday season, with the changing colors and beautiful scenery. We have you covered with these seven locations in the United States. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with a location that has actually been used in a Hallmark movie. Chester became the location for Moonlight & Mistletoe, thanks to its Victorian inns and the beautifully historic train station. As soon as you step into the streets, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel like this is where you belong\u00e2\u0080\u0094and where that handsome stranger awaits you. There are two historic districts in Chester, both of them listed in the National Register of Historic Places, so you know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re transported back in time. While the city goes all-out for Christmas, you'll want to visit a little earlier. There are beautiful landscapes that offer the ever-changing colors of the leaves. Another city that was used in a real Hallmark movie is Nevada City in California, used in the movie The Christmas Card. And yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all just like a magical Christmas card, lighting up the streets with market stalls and bright lights throughout the holiday season. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll even find gas lamps out there on the streets! This location will make you feel warm and fuzzy as the colder temperatures settle in during the late fall. The city is in the heart of Gold Rush Country, and throughout the holiday season, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find chestnuts roasting (on an open fire) and a 25-foot Christmas tree that becomes the perfect meeting spot\u00e2\u0080\u0094 just make sure you know which side of the tree you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all meeting on! Stop for some hot buttered rum and cocoa from the vendors at the artisan market. A Perfect Christmas Pairing is such a sweet Hallmark movie, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to visit where that one was filmed. Well, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heading to Georgia for this one, LaGrange to be exact. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to pay specific visits to Pretty Good Books and Nutwood Winery to get a feel of the movie, but also just to get a feel of the season. Throughout the holidays, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find holly decorating each of the storefronts, and there is an outdoor skating rink that you can spend some time on. You know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the perfect first date in Hallmark movies! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget to head to the Snowland Experience, where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a snow globe you can walk into! Yes, really! Where would we be without heading to Dolly Parton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home state, considering just how much we connect her to the holiday season? Christmas at Dollywood is the movie that draws us in here, which was filmed in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a must when you need that fall spirit. Head straight to Showstreet, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re immediately stepping onto the set of the Hallmark movie. As the temperatures don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drop as quickly as they do further north, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little more time to enjoy the reds and oranges of the changing leaves. You'll feel like you can just sit back and relax, watching the world pass you by. While you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there, head over to Smoky Mountain Christmas, the grand event of the season, which includes six million lights and dozens of Christmas trees all beautifully decorated to invite you to Santa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Village. Add Mental Floss as a\u00c2\u00a0preferred news source! Want something that includes the mountains? Well, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to head to Colorado for that, and Vail is the city to be in to get a taste of Winter in Vail. Not all of the movie was filmed here, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll certainly recognize a few shots, including the bell tower and the bridge. Plus, this is the perfect spot for skiers as the colder weather rolls in, and we all know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some romance on the slopes! One of the great things about this Hallmark movie feel is that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a European village theme. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extra special feeling of the Hallmark fall events that are put on in various movies, and the mountains will help to ease off some of the colder bites of the elements. In fact, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fall in Switzerland rather than the U.S.! While it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used for a Hallmark movie (yet!), Leavenworth is a must to get that Hallmark movie vibe. The mountain background will immediately give you that sense of the holiday spirit, and just like Vail, Colorado, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be transported into that feeling of European comfort. The city goes all-out as soon as the holiday season arrives, bringing the Village of Lights, where you can enjoy live music and strolling carolers. The shop fronts are all beautifully decorated, and even the shopping mall makes you feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a European market in spots! There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s storytime for the kids, gingerbread-making events, and much more. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a city. Sometimes, you need a quaint village, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what most of the places are in Hallmark movies. East Aurora, located just southeast of Buffalo, is going to be the place for you. The community comes together during the fall season, with both traditional and new events. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even the home of an upcoming Hallmark movie, Holiday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story. Make sure you stop by Vidler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5& 10 Store, a central part of the town. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been used multiple times for holiday movies, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll immediately feel yourself transported into them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the home of the Carolcade, which has been going on for more than 50 years and remains a village-proud event. Where are you heading first for your Hallmark movie experience?

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"ByLance Eliot, Contributor. In today\u2019s column, I address how you can discover hidden best practices that underlie deep expertise and then codify that secret sauce of domain knowledge into modern-day generative AI and large language models (LLMs). The crux of this vexing matter is that we can lean into the precepts of knowledge elicitation that were well-formulated during the rules-based expert systems era. I realize that some who are steeped in LLMs might balk at using the \u201cdated\u201d approaches from an earlier era of AI. Despite whatever adverse opinion someone has about so-called GOFAI (good old-fashioned AI), there is absolutely crucial value in leveraging tried-and-true techniques of eliciting deep domain knowledge. It can aid in turning generative AI and LLM into a bastion of best practices and deep expertise for a chosen domain. Let\u2019s talk about it. This analysis of AI breakthroughs is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI, including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).  Suppose that you want to turn an LLM into an expert within a particular domain.  Perhaps you want to devise an LLM that has deep medical expertise and is especially proficient in urology or maybe neurology. Another possibility might be to shape generative AI to be on par with a fully qualified lawyer in real estate law or be a mental health therapist that is deeply versed in CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). What can you do to shift a general-purpose LLM into being steeped in a specific domain? The usual approach consists of gathering as many documents as you can find that encompass the domain of interest. You digitize the contents and then feed the materials into generative AI. A commonly used infusion technique is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), whereby you have the AI pattern-match on the added data at run-time rather than when initially doing data training of the AI at the get-go. For more about RAG and other similar techniques, see my discussion at the link here. This is all well and good when you can get your hands on codified domain knowledge that happens to be written down somewhere. The problem is that an area of deep expertise doesn\u2019t necessarily have everything written out to the nth degree. In the heads of experts in that domain are all sorts of human-devised rules of thumb.  You might say that the secret sauce of best practices in a domain is often locked away in the brains of those steeped in that domain. The question arises as to how to surface that hidden knowledge that contains best practices and make it tangible and visible so that you can get it into an LLM that is supposed to be superb in the domain at hand. You might be aware that during the AI era of knowledge-based systems, there was a great deal of research and practical implementation of domain knowledge elicitation techniques. To develop an expert system, you had to get experts to divulge what they knew. They would have mentally devised numerous tricks of their trade over the course of many years of trial-and-error.  Stepwise, you would work closely with the experts and get them to reveal their seasoned rules of thumb. Elicitation required getting them to talk about their expertise. Another avenue was to present them with problems to be solved and have them write down the rules they used to tackle the problems. Various clever means were crafted to surface the deep domain knowledge that wasn\u2019t found in books and articles. For those of you who remember the time period just before generative AI took off as a popular technology, there was a good deal of work on advancing machine learning (ML). It was during this focus on ML that researchers began to realize that knowledge elicitation still deserved to be at the forefront of AI advancements. Indeed, a research paper undertook a helpful macroscopic look at the intertwining of ML and knowledge elicitation, doing so in an article entitled \u201cA Survey of Domain Knowledge Elicitation in Applied Machine Learning\u201d by Daniel Kerrigan, Jessica Hullman, and Enrico Bertini, Journal of Multimodal Technologies and Interaction, 2021, as per these salient remarks (excerpts): I will highlight how you can readily use knowledge elicitation in combination with getting generative AI and LLM up to speed in a desired domain. In conferring with a successful stock trader, suppose you decided that it would be useful to tune an LLM toward being a deep expert in picking stocks.  The first step would be to choose an LLM and see what the AI has already been data-trained in regarding stock trading. There is no sense in reinventing the wheel if the AI is already fully loaded about the domain and ready to be used as is. I went ahead and opted to do this case study with OpenAI\u2019s immensely popular ChatGPT. I could have selected some other LLM, but I just thought it would be a suitable choice for my readers overall. Upon doing various prompts and conversations with ChatGPT, I was able to determine that a lot of the conventional materials about stock picking had obviously been data-scanned at the initial development of the LLM. This was useful to see. I say that because otherwise, you would have to bring the LLM entirely on board with whatever domain you are working with.  Doing so from scratch can be time-consuming and onerous. There is, though, an upside to using an LLM that isn\u2019t versed in the domain of choice.  You see, once you start to elicit the hidden knowledge of best practices and then ingest that into the AI, there is a sizable chance that conflicts will arise. The LLM will already have some predetermined patterns about the domain, and you will have to potentially lock horns with those aspects. It\u2019s a tradeoff as to whether a less-versed LLM is a better or worse choice than going with a highly versed LLM, and you\u2019ll need to make that decision based on the domain you\u2019ve chosen and which AI you wish to use. After doing a deep dive into what ChatGPT seemed to have about picking stocks, I realized that the secret sauce of the stock trader was not already in the AI. That is not a surprise. This particular stock trader has crafted his own set of rules about picking stocks. No one else necessarily knows or abides by the rules he has come up with.  I am not saying that his rules are unique and unheard of. I am only noting that the AI didn\u2019t have the rules I am about to show you, and it is not surprising that the LLM wouldn\u2019t already have them in hand. I will only show you a few of the rules, due to space limitations for this discussion. I manually went through many of his stock picks with him. We jointly explored his historical performance. I asked direct questions about what made him pick a stock, along with why he didn\u2019t pick some other stock. This is a verbalization or \u201cspeaking aloud\u201d protocol of performing knowledge elicitation. It has its ins and outs and strengths and weaknesses. For example, when you get an expert to verbalize what they do, they might be on their guard about saying what they really do. If they are performing their tasks by guesswork, that would look bad if others knew what they were doing; they don\u2019t want to be embarrassed or called out. In that sense, the expert might make up fake rationalizations and tell you that\u2019s how they do their work. You are then going to falsely or mistakenly rely upon something that isn\u2019t the true state of the matter.  This is often why poorly performed knowledge elicitation led to expert systems that couldn\u2019t function on par with the domain experts. The expertise or rules elicited were rationalizations and not what the experts truly did. Be cautious and do not fall into that kind of trap. Here are two example rules that I was able to surface and then double-checked as being the actual rules being utilized by the stock trader. I was able to identify lots of rules akin to those two rules. The next step entailed getting these rules into the LLM. This is a prompt that I used:  You can enter the devised rules as prompts, or put them into a document and use RAG, or you can even encode them into a structured, machine-interpretable format such as JSON or YAML.  The earning momentum rule would look something like this in JSON: One means of doing the knowledge elicitation entails doing so on a human-to-human basis. That is what I did by conferring with the stock trader. Another way to do knowledge elicitation involves having the AI do the heavy lifting for us. Let\u2019s go ahead and undertake knowledge elicitation on a human-to-AI basis. Here\u2019s my prompt:  After carrying on an extensive conversation with the stock trader, the AI identified an additional rule. Here\u2019s the rule that I didn\u2019t surface during my human-to-human efforts but that the AI discovered: It was then added to the set after I took a look and agreed with the stock trader that it was reasonable and suitable for inclusion. Let\u2019s take a big picture perspective for a moment. I could have begun the entire knowledge elicitation process by first having the AI confer with the stock trader and identifying the initial round of rules. Generally, I prefer to start the process on a human-to-human basis. This usually gets the domain expert into a suitable mood and mode of being involved in knowledge elicitation. The icing on the cake then happens when the domain expert does the follow-up work with the AI. The experts are usually pleased to see how their rules have been codified and echoed back to them. Furthermore, they typically relish verifying the rules, along with the AI often stirring them to think of additional rules. Thus, yes, I like to do the upfront bootstrapping on a human basis, but, if needed, the approach can be done on human-to-AI first and then followed by human-to-human. One thing is to make sure that you do both paths. I realize it might be tempting to do just one path. The odds of getting this done wisely and completely are better if you proceed with both pathways.  If the domain includes the use of data by the expert, another useful step consists of collecting the data and having the LLM try to do pattern detection on the data. The idea is that you want the AI to inspect the relevant data, figure out patterns, and attempt to devise rules according to those patterns.  I went ahead and collected data that included factors such as Trade ID, Date of Trade, Stock Ticker, Trade Action, Price, EPS Growth, P\/E, Sector Trend, Sentiment, Insider Activity, Market Index, and so on.  Here\u2019s what I told the AI to do with the data: An interesting new rule that the AI came up with was this: I discussed the rule with the stock trader. It was somewhat surprising at first glance and not a rule that the stock trader said they personally used. After mulling over the rule and drinking a glass of fine wine, the stock trader indicated that it is a worthy rule and can be added to the set. I trust that you can see how knowledge elicitation of human experts can be undertaken in a chosen domain in an effort to inform an LLM on human-held deep expertise.  In a subsequent discussion, I will go over the ways to test the derived rules and decide whether the AI is ready as a presumed expert in the domain. I\u2019ll mention a bit of a twist on this topic. There is a great deal of debate about using LLMs as an expert, often referred to as a synthetic expert, to distinguish the notion of expertise embodied by a person versus by AI. One viewpoint is that no matter what you do, until we reach artificial general intelligence (AGI), which I discuss at the link here, you aren\u2019t going to have an AI that is on par with a human expert.  This brings up the classic question about narrow intelligence, namely, whether you can have a narrow form of \u201cintelligence\u201d in an AI that performs satisfactorily or whether you must also have general intelligence too.  An argument is often made that contemporary LLMs do have a semblance of general intelligence; therefore, they are a good place to infuse deep domain expertise. But you might disagree that current AI has enough general intelligence and be insistent that only once we arrive at AGI will this precondition be properly met. It is a contentious twist.  Meanwhile, AI developers are proceeding to use knowledge elicitation and aim to infuse LLMs with surfaced best practices and gold nuggets within chosen domains. The work continues while the debate heatedly ensues. As the great American writer and philosopher Elbert Hubbard once remarked: \u201cThe best preparation for good work tomorrow is to do good work today.\u201d Go ahead and do good work with AI today, and it will hopefully dovetail into even better work in the tomorrows to come.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"Login  Michail  09 November 2025   Xiaomi Headphones Review Featured  The open wearable stereo (OWS) market gained serious traction over the last two years, and just about every brand has its own entry now. While traditional earbuds come with the tried and tested plug form factor, which sits inside your ear, the OWS models position their drivers right at the tip of your ear canal. The result is raised awareness of your surroundings at the cost of subpar passive isolation. OpenWear Stereo Pro is the latest offering from Xiaomi, and it aims to one-up its competitors by offering a more premium build while still retaining its open-fit system. Xiaomi is promising impressive claims of reduced sound leakage and extraordinary battery life rated at 8.5 hours from the buds and up to 45 hours alongside the charging case. So, are the OpenWear Stereo Pro worth their \u20ac150\/\u00a3140 asking price or are you better off with a traditional pair of in-ear buds? These are our findings. Table of Contents:  Design Features Sound quality Battery life Verdict  Design While Xiaomi could have used a less convoluted name for the OpenWear Stereo Pro, we have to admit that the fit and finish on the buds and case feel great. The buds feature a shiny metal finish encasing the drivers, which connect via TPU to the bulb on the back. The shiny plastic looks great, but it attracts fingerprints quite easily.  The swooping design hooks around the top half of your ear and positions the driver right on top of your ear canal without actually making contact. This makes for a comfortable fit, and Xiaomi\u2019s three-point support design distributes pressure evenly across the length of the buds.  Each earbud weighs 9.8 grams, while the case is 53 grams, bringing the combined total to just over 73 grams. We never felt discomfort while using the OpenWear Stereo Pro and their ergonomic design is right up with the best of the best in the OWS market.  The ear hook design also ensures that the buds stay in place at all times, even during runs and workouts, where normal in-ear TWS buds would easily lose their grip. The case feels like a skipping stone in that it is smooth and sculpted to perfection with a soft and pleasant in-hand feeling. It\u2019s certainly not compact, but that goes with most OWS earbuds we\u2019ve tested.  Our review unit comes in Graphite Black and features a faux leather finish on the case lid and a matte on the bottom half. Despite its plastic build, the case feels well-built and does not give out any creaking sounds. The lid closes with a firm snap, and the hinge gives off a reassuring feeling. The inside of the case has an imitation suede inner lining on the top. This is our first time seeing this choice of materials inside an earbuds case, and it\u2019s nice to see Xiaomi put this much effort into something that\u2019s only visible when opening the case. The soft material should also prevent any unwanted scratches on the buds\u2019 shiny driver housing.  OpenWear Stereo Pro offers IP54 dust and water-resistance, while the case lacks ingress protection. The unboxing experience is pretty standard, you get the buds inside the case, a USB charging cable and a user manual. Features Xiaomi didn\u2019t skimp out in the features department with the OpenWear Stereo Pro. The buds connect via Bluetooth 5.4 with support for dual device pairing so you can use them on two devices simultaneously. You also get 360\u00b0 head-tracking with surround sound, though this feature is more suited for watching movies than listening to music.  Sadly, like all OWS buds, these lack active noise cancellation (ANC), which goes against their primary purpose of allowing you to be aware of your surroundings. This is especially useful for runners and cyclists in urban areas in terms of safety and the on-ear design proves to be more comfortable for longer listening sessions. While there\u2019s no ANC, Xiaomi claims it improved sound leakage, which has been a pain point for all OWS buds. OpenWear Stereo Pro features a dedicated sound leakage reduction driver that emits reverse-phase sound waves. On paper, Xiaomi claims you should not be able to hear any sound leakage within a 25cm range of the buds, but in reality, people in your immediate vicinity will likely hear the sounds coming from these earbuds despite Xiaomi\u2019s optimizations. You control the buds via the touch controls that are integrated on the outer part of the drivers. We had no issues with touch registers, and you are free to customize single, double, triple taps as well as press and hold gestures.  Adaptive volume is another nice feature that adjusts the volume levels based on your ambient noise levels. In our experience, it had a tough time regulating volume in noisier environments where it was needed the most, so we can\u2019t vouch for its effectiveness. Xiaomi also added the ability to record audio directly from the buds. You get up to 120 minutes per earbud for a total of 240 minutes of total recordings. The recording quality is not that great, but this feature is quite useful for jotting down audio notes when you\u2019re in a rush. Connectivity was great with no drops or irregularities in our time testing the buds with Android, iOS and macOS devices. Sound quality OpenWear Stereo Pro feature custom 18 x 13mm dynamic drivers with piezoelectric ceramic tweeters and dual balanced armatures. They support the AAC, SBC and LDAC codecs and feature Harman audio tuning. We\u2019re not always impressed with audio from OWS buds due to their sound leakage and disproportionate levels of bass and clarity.  But the OpenWear Stereo Pro offer a surprisingly lively soundstage with ample amounts of bass for earbuds that don\u2019t make contact with your ear canal. You get to experience detailed mids and highs while also benefiting from the comfortable wrap-around design of the buds. Turning up the volume does not distort sounds at higher ranges, which is not always a given with OWS buds. Speaking of volume, you\u2019ll need to raise the slider if you\u2019re using these buds in noisier environments, as sound does tend to leak out.  We found that the OpenWear Stereo Pro delivers more detailed sound output compared to something like the Nothing Ear (open) with deeper bass and a livelier soundstage. While you don\u2019t get actual control over the equalizer, Xiaomi did provide four pre-installed options, including Harman Master and Harman AudioEFX, as well as treble and voice enhancement modes. In our experience, the Harman Master preset brings out a wider soundstage and more detail in instrumentals. While the microphone quality on the buds is far from class-leading, it gets the job done indoors, with people on the other end reporting clear reception of my voice. Jumping to a noisy street with car traffic, the microphones experience a tougher time with voice pickup. Battery life Xiaomi claims you can expect up to 8.5 hours of playback from the buds which extends to 45 hours combined with the charging case. Each earbud houses a 56 mAh battery while the case packs a sizeable 700mAh charge.  During our testing period, we consistently got over 8 hours of playback from the buds, with the case being good for 5 full recharges. This type of battery endurance is quite good and more than enough for multiple days of heavy usage. The case charges via USB-C. A full charge from 0 to 100% takes over 2 hours, while a quick 10-minute top-up will net you 2 hours of listening. Verdict Xiaomi\u2019s OpenWear Stereo Pro is a great pair of OWS earbuds that pair detailed sound output with spatial awareness and excellent battery life. They have a premium design and just about every feature set you\u2019d want from a pair of open earbuds.  The fact that they hang over your ears means no ear fatigue even after multiple hours of use, and the evenly distributed weight only adds to the great experience. Sound output is surprisingly rich for an OWS product, though you will need to raise the volume in noisier environments. Despite Xiaomi\u2019s efforts to conceal sound leakage, it is still present in everyday usage, but that\u2019s just the nature of this form factor of earbuds.       Xiaomi OpenWear Stereo Pro     \u20ac150 at Amazon DE \u00a3140 at Amazon UK   At \u20ac150\/\u00a3140, OpenWear Stereo Pro delivers a great balance of features, style, comfort and battery endurance. You can certainly get better deals with proper in-ear TWS earbuds, which will offer ANC, but those aren\u2019t exact competitors. As it stands, these are some of the best OWS earbuds we\u2019ve tested so far. Xiaomi is also offering the OpenWear Stereo Pro bundled with the Xiaomi 15T Pro in some markets, which makes for a great gift to go along with your new phone.

Adaptive volume is another nice feature that adjusts the volume levels based on your ambient noise levels. In our experience, it had a tough time regulating volume in noisier environments where it was needed the most, so we can\u2019t vouch for its effectiveness. Xiaomi also added the ability to record audio directly from the buds. You get up to 120 minutes per earbud for a total of 240 minutes of total recordings. The recording quality is not that great, but this feature is quite useful for jotting down audio notes when you\u2019re in a rush. Connectivity was great with no drops or irregularities in our time testing the buds with Android, iOS and macOS devices. Sound quality OpenWear Stereo Pro feature custom 18 x 13mm dynamic drivers with piezoelectric ceramic tweeters and dual balanced armatures. They support the AAC, SBC and LDAC codecs and feature Harman audio tuning. We\u2019re not always impressed with audio from OWS buds due to their sound leakage and disproportionate levels of bass and clarity.  But the OpenWear Stereo Pro offer a surprisingly lively soundstage with ample amounts of bass for earbuds that don\u2019t make contact with your ear canal. You get to experience detailed mids and highs while also benefiting from the comfortable wrap-around design of the buds. Turning up the volume does not distort sounds at higher ranges, which is not always a given with OWS buds. Speaking of volume, you\u2019ll need to raise the slider if you\u2019re using these buds in noisier environments, as sound does tend to leak out.  We found that the OpenWear Stereo Pro delivers more detailed sound output compared to something like the Nothing Ear (open) with deeper bass and a livelier soundstage. While you don\u2019t get actual control over the equalizer, Xiaomi did provide four pre-installed options, including Harman Master and Harman AudioEFX, as well as treble and voice enhancement modes. In our experience, the Harman Master preset brings out a wider soundstage and more detail in instrumentals. While the microphone quality on the buds is far from class-leading, it gets the job done indoors, with people on the other end reporting clear reception of my voice. Jumping to a noisy street with car traffic, the microphones experience a tougher time with voice pickup. Battery life Xiaomi claims you can expect up to 8.5 hours of playback from the buds which extends to 45 hours combined with the charging case. Each earbud houses a 56 mAh battery while the case packs a sizeable 700mAh charge.  During our testing period, we consistently got over 8 hours of playback from the buds, with the case being good for 5 full recharges. This type of battery endurance is quite good and more than enough for multiple days of heavy usage. The case charges via USB-C. A full charge from 0 to 100% takes over 2 hours, while a quick 10-minute top-up will net you 2 hours of listening. Verdict Xiaomi\u2019s OpenWear Stereo Pro is a great pair of OWS earbuds that pair detailed sound output with spatial awareness and excellent battery life. They have a premium design and just about every feature set you\u2019d want from a pair of open earbuds.  The fact that they hang over your ears means no ear fatigue even after multiple hours of use, and the evenly distributed weight only adds to the great experience. Sound output is surprisingly rich for an OWS product, though you will need to raise the volume in noisier environments. Despite Xiaomi\u2019s efforts to conceal sound leakage, it is still present in everyday usage, but that\u2019s just the nature of this form factor of earbuds.       Xiaomi OpenWear Stereo Pro     \u20ac150 at Amazon DE \u00a3140 at Amazon UK   At \u20ac150\/\u00a3140, OpenWear Stereo Pro delivers a great balance of features, style, comfort and battery endurance. You can certainly get better deals with proper in-ear TWS earbuds, which will offer ANC, but those aren\u2019t exact competitors. As it stands, these are some of the best OWS earbuds we\u2019ve tested so far. Xiaomi is also offering the OpenWear Stereo Pro bundled with the Xiaomi 15T Pro in some markets, which makes for a great gift to go along with your new phone. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.  While Xiaomi could have used a less convoluted name for the OpenWear Stereo Pro, we have to admit that the fit and finish on the buds and case feel great. The buds feature a shiny metal finish encasing the drivers, which connect via TPU to the bulb on the back. The shiny plastic looks great, but it attracts fingerprints quite easily. The swooping design hooks around the top half of your ear and positions the driver right on top of your ear canal without actually making contact. This makes for a comfortable fit, and Xiaomi\u2019s three-point support design distributes pressure evenly across the length of the buds. Each earbud weighs 9.8 grams, while the case is 53 grams, bringing the combined total to just over 73 grams. We never felt discomfort while using the OpenWear Stereo Pro and their ergonomic design is right up with the best of the best in the OWS market. The ear hook design also ensures that the buds stay in place at all times, even during runs and workouts, where normal in-ear TWS buds would easily lose their grip. The case feels like a skipping stone in that it is smooth and sculpted to perfection with a soft and pleasant in-hand feeling. It\u2019s certainly not compact, but that goes with most OWS earbuds we\u2019ve tested. Our review unit comes in Graphite Black and features a faux leather finish on the case lid and a matte on the bottom half. Despite its plastic build, the case feels well-built and does not give out any creaking sounds. The lid closes with a firm snap, and the hinge gives off a reassuring feeling. The inside of the case has an imitation suede inner lining on the top. This is our first time seeing this choice of materials inside an earbuds case, and it\u2019s nice to see Xiaomi put this much effort into something that\u2019s only visible when opening the case. The soft material should also prevent any unwanted scratches on the buds\u2019 shiny driver housing. OpenWear Stereo Pro offers IP54 dust and water-resistance, while the case lacks ingress protection. The unboxing experience is pretty standard, you get the buds inside the case, a USB charging cable and a user manual. Features Xiaomi didn\u2019t skimp out in the features department with the OpenWear Stereo Pro. The buds connect via Bluetooth 5.4 with support for dual device pairing so you can use them on two devices simultaneously. You also get 360\u00b0 head-tracking with surround sound, though this feature is more suited for watching movies than listening to music.  Sadly, like all OWS buds, these lack active noise cancellation (ANC), which goes against their primary purpose of allowing you to be aware of your surroundings. This is especially useful for runners and cyclists in urban areas in terms of safety and the on-ear design proves to be more comfortable for longer listening sessions. While there\u2019s no ANC, Xiaomi claims it improved sound leakage, which has been a pain point for all OWS buds. OpenWear Stereo Pro features a dedicated sound leakage reduction driver that emits reverse-phase sound waves. On paper, Xiaomi claims you should not be able to hear any sound leakage within a 25cm range of the buds, but in reality, people in your immediate vicinity will likely hear the sounds coming from these earbuds despite Xiaomi\u2019s optimizations. You control the buds via the touch controls that are integrated on the outer part of the drivers. We had no issues with touch registers, and you are free to customize single, double, triple taps as well as press and hold gestures.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"Welcome to the arc side. Arc Raiders has once again smashed its own concurrent peak user count on Steam, topping 400,000 for the first time this weekend. Last week, we reported that Arc Raiders had surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam just a day after its release, and then again on 1st November when it topped 328,062 simultaneous players, making it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter ever. Now, over the weekend period, Arc Raiders has broken its own record once again, hitting a new high of 416,517 concurrent users on Steam, making it the fifth biggest game on Steam over the last 24 hours. Based on data from Alinea Analytics, market analysts believe around 69.2 percent of the game's playerbase is on Steam. That means roughly 30 percent of its playerbase - 17.3 percent on PlayStation, and 13.5 percent on Xbox - are not accounted for in that figure. As for why Arc Raiders is so popular when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? As Connor reported earlier in the week, market analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics believes that \"Arc Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter\". In Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview, we wrote: \"Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories.

The latter term is reserved for the newest variety, which comes from artificial intelligence. Though references to AI slop date back at least to 2022, a poet and technologist who writes under the name \u201cdeepfates\u201d popularized it two years later as \u201cthe term for unwanted AI generated content\u201d in a post on X. Shortly afterward, developer Simon Willison shared the concept in a blog post: \u201cNot all AI-generated content is slop,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut if it\u2019s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn\u2019t ask for it, slop is the perfect term.\u201d Today slop\u2019s pejorative bite is increasingly aimed at all things AI, treating it as an undeniable cultural pollutant. And most of it is\u2014but by indiscriminately dismissing all of it, we risk missing out on the minority of creations that are keepers. Mass\u2011produced culture has a long, messy history. The biblical book of Ecclesiastes\u2014thought to have been written between 300 and 200 B.C.E.\u2014laments, \u201cOf making many books there is no end.\u201d This was in response to the flood of philosophical writings in the ancient Near East and Hellenistic world. Since then, whenever new tools to crank out communications have become available, somebody has flooded the zone with the fastest, most imitative material that could garner attention. But over the years, some of that sediment has incubated new artforms, and trash and treasure have appeared in the same stream. One notable slop moment came after Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press in Europe. The device\u2014the ChatGPT of the 1450s\u2014allowed the mass production of cheap printed material. Over the next 300 years, chapbooks and broadside ballads became mainstays in Britain. Carrying news, satire and story into places where expensive books had seldom reached, they were sold for pennies, tacked to alehouse walls and sung aloud for the illiterate. Some of this material was drivel, sure, but much of it entertained and educated the masses. It also inspired authors from William Shakespeare to Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

In the early 1700s, a growing reading public and coffeehouse networks created steady demand for text, giving rise to Grub Street\u2014the slop generator of its time. The name belonged to a London area with printing shops, booksellers and cheap lodgings where impoverished writers churned out pamphlets, satires, political tracts, sensational stories and hack journalism\u2014whatever sold. Samuel Johnson\u2019s 1755 dictionary made \u201cgrubstreet\u201d a synonym for \u201cmean production.\u201d Elites stirred up a now familiar moral panic about commerce corrupting letters and mocked Grub Street even as its writers built the first modern freelance economy and mass-print culture. Johnson himself made his early living in the Grub Street milieu, and other luminaries, such as Daniel Defoe, Eliza Haywood and Jonathan Swift, all wrote for the burgeoning market. The 20th-century cinema boom followed a similar pattern. By 1908 roughly 8,000 nickelodeons\u2014five\u2011cent storefront theaters\u2014ran nonstop shows. The production demands produced a lot of rubbish, but this effort also developed the motion-picture industry\u2019s infrastructure while spreading information and helping newly arrived immigrants learn English. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, B-movie studios churned out films while training directors and actors who would reshape Hollywood, such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro. In all of these situations, the point wasn\u2019t to forge masterpieces; it was to create rapidly and cheaply. But the production of new types of slop widens the on\u2011ramps, allowing more people to participate\u2014just as the Internet and social media birthed bunk but also new kinds of creators. Perhaps because much of mass\u2011made culture has been forgettable, original work stands out even clearer against the backdrop of sameness, and audiences begin to demand more of it. The current wave of AI\u2011generated slop raises the stakes because the cost for those making slop has collapsed to near zero, while the cost for others is high in terms of cognitive burden\u2014of doubting what we see and experiencing the demands on our attention\u2014not to mention the environmental cost of heavy computing. The onslaught of mass-produced content urgently requires that we identify and elevate what stands out so that we can better discourage what doesn\u2019t. The word \u201cslop\u201d helps us do that when it is used correctly. Willison and deepfates were careful to specify that not all AI content is slop. Many human-guided AI creations are original, surprising and affecting. Some have been displayed in museums. Calling everything worthless is a misguided attempt to dam the flood rather than channel it. If \u201cculture is ordinary, in every society and in every mind,\u201d as Welsh cultural theorist Raymond Williams wrote in 1958, then the ordinary act of making at scale will always include waste. But with work and luck, it\u2019ll also produce the seeds of the next thing we\u2019ll decide to keep. Deni Ellis B\u00e9chard is Scientific American\u2019s senior writer for technology.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"There are a lot of shady mini PCs and sellers out there. Here's how you can get a small computer you can count on.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  I'm a big fan of mini PCs and frequently recommend my most trusted mini PC brands to family and friends. These devices tend to cost much less than a desktop or laptop and don't take up a ton of room while still being able to tackle a range of tasks. The thing is, there are several mistakes people tend to make when purchasing a mini PC. Some of these oversights are harmless, while others can put you at risk. To keep you safe and allow you to get the exact device you're looking for, I've put together this list of the seven common mistakes to avoid that people make when buying a mini PC.      I'm going to hammer this home several times during this page; there are some underhanded people out there trying to sell mini PCs with malicious software on them, specifically malware that can send your sensitive data, like banking and other personal info, to someone else. RELATED: I discovered malicious software on a couple AceMagic mini PCs a few years ago One of the most common ways these shifty sellers convince people to buy one of these dangerous devices is by selling it for a song. Outside of safety concerns, the cheapest mini PC might not fit the use case you have in mind for it. As such, you shouldn't just buy the cheapest mini PC you can find. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. If you do want an inexpensive mini PC with modest performance, I recommend looking at the Beelink EQR6, which has a starting price of $389.00 at Amazon.      This goes hand in hand with the previous tip, but it's different enough that it warrants addressing separately. If you discover that a mini PC is being offered at a ridiculously low price, then it's likely a scam. And if it isn't a scam, then there might be something wrong with the device, or it might not work well. Now, there are certainly times when a mini PC can go on sale, like during a Black Friday deals event or Amazon Prime Day. However, you'll want to check prices against other similar devices to ensure it isn't too far down from where it ought to be. Really, to save yourself any kind of hassle, avoid buying a mini PC that's selling at a much lower price than is typical.      There are two reasons why buying a mini PC based on customer reviews is a bad idea: Safety and usability. Retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Newegg, and others allow third-party sellers to sell things on their sites. The problem is that it is possible for a malicious third-party to sell an item that has been tampered with or intentionally designed to cause harm. So even if a customer likes their mini PC, they might unknowingly have a device that's stealing their information and isn't safe to use. On top of that, what one person uses their mini PC for might not fit the same use case you're intending to use it for. What you want to do is understand what you want the computer to do and then buy a mini PC whose specs, ports, and size are conducive to that vision.      Mini PCs are just like desktops in that you need to connect them to a keyboard, a mouse, and a monitor in order to interact with them. I recommend checking out our lists of the best computer mice, best keyboards, and best monitors to help you out with this. Note that some mini PCs come with HDMI cables or USB-C display cables. However, others do not. So you will want to double-check this and buy a compatible cable, if necessary.      Despite their small size, there are several mini PCs on the market that allow for limited upgradeability \u2014 Typically, only the RAM and SSD are intended to be swapped out. Make sure you know what kind of options are available to you and what their max capacities are. Now, since mini PCs have such small form factors, many of them are fanless. If they aren't optimized and designed well, they can throttle, overheat, and get damaged. Some can even emit a loud noise as air rushes out of the vents. It's hard to know if this is the case unless you have one in your presence. To check these things before buying, it's best to check a review from a trusted site and see what the reviewer has to say.      Although small, mini PCs can offer vastly different performance from each other. This is due to a variety of factors, including what kinds of processors and other components are used in the devices. While most mini PCs offer modest performance, there are some, like the HP Z2 Mini (G1a) ($1.999.00 at HP) and the ASUS ROG NUC (2025) ($1,899.00 at ASUS), that are specifically designed for gaming and have relatively powerful GPUs. Additionally, how well a mini PC keeps cool also determines how well it works. Before buying a mini PC, determine what kind of tasks you want it to perform, and then make sure to buy a device that offers the following:      This might seem like an obvious one to many people, but it's still a problem for some. While most mini PCs on the market run Windows, there are also mini PCs that run macOS or Linux. Never assume that the mini PC you're looking at is the operating system you're looking for; this will only lead to frustration.      While it's true that wiping a computer and reinstalling Windows on it can get rid of the vast majority of viruses and malware, it's still possible for a device to be harmful or for it to not work properly after doing a clean install. After all, if a company cut corners or allowed shady software on a device, they might have made other alterations to the mini PC, such as putting firmware malware on secondary drives. It's also possible that an untrustworthy seller or manufacturer fudged some things to make the mini PC work, and doing a clean install could break these adjustments. As an example, when I did a clean install of Windows on a mini PC that had malware on it, the Wi-Fi card stopped working, possibly because the manufacturer used a generic Wi-Fi card and tricked the system into thinking it was a more common one. My advice is to avoid shady devices to begin with, rather than putting yourself at risk. If you plan out what you want from a device and then thoughtfully purchase a mini PC with the right specs, you can end up with a reliable little device. Just remember that there are scammers out there who would love to get you to interact with malicious software. Only purchase trusted mini PCs and only from trusted sellers to keep yourself safe. Additionally, never fall for a deal that seems too good to be true. Avoiding common purchasing mistakes can help you get a safe mini PC that perfectly suits your needs. Mini PCs are compact, affordable, and versatile \u2014 great for office work, media centers, or light gaming. Untrustworthy sellers. Some devices ship with malware or poor components. Always buy from reputable brands. Most allow limited upgrades (RAM and SSD). Check specs before buying to ensure future flexibility Some models have poor cooling due to their small size. Look for reviews that mention thermal design and noise levels. Don\u2019t fall for deals that seem too good to be true. Compare prices and stick to trusted retailers. No. Some run Linux or macOS.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"\u00a0  REVIEW \u2013 Most mammals have hair on their bodies. We humans have evolved to mostly have it on our heads. (My bald friends say \u201cThere are only a few perfect heads \u2013 the rest are covered with hair!\u201d) Keeping this in check is a huge market for all humans. Barbers can be expensive, especially if you have to go several times a month. Today\u2019s gadget under review is a kit from MaxGroom for a set of trimmers to handle both the \u201cScalp\u201d hair and hair that is elsewhere. (Trust me, if you\u2019ve never had your neck shaved with a straight razor, you have not missed a slight bit of terror! There\u2019s a reason Sweeney Todd is so terrifying to some.)\u00a0So, let\u2019s talk about safer shearing methods with a little more control: the MaxGroom Premium Barber Clippers Trimmer Set. \u2b07\ufe0e\u00a0Jump to summary\u00a0(pros\/cons) Price: $99.99 \u2013 currently on sale for $74.99 \u2013 $69.99 Where to buy: MaxGroom | Amazon A hair care kit with a set of cordless hair trimmers for all the hair your body grows, as well as a barber\u2019s cape, combs, and a charging cable.

The elegant packaging not only enhances the unboxing experience but also makes it an ideal gift for special occasions such as Christmas, Father\u2019s Day, or any milestone event. Whether you\u2019re treating yourself or someone special, this grooming set combines practicality with a touch of sophistication. MaxGroom has created a very nice package for both \u201cscalp\u201d hair and hair in other places that may require a bit more \u2013 um \u2013 finesse. The two trimmers operate on the same principle \u2013 dual blades that oscillate against each other at high speed \u2013 but the size of the blades is quite different.  The larger clipper (the adjustable blade clipper) has blades 1.75\u201d wide, which can be adjusted to four different lengths. There are also four different length combs (3\u30016\u30019\u300113 mm) that can be clipped on to prevent hair shorter than a certain length from being cut. The trimmer is about 7\u201d long overall and is a roughly cylindrical shape 5-6\u201d in diameter.  The smaller trimmer is 1.5\u201d wide, with guides that are 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm long and 4-5\u201d in diameter. There is a large, metal positive switch on the side of the larger one. It\u2019s not going to get turned on by accident in your suitcase, unless you\u2019re a very messy packer. (More on travel later.) The smaller one has a less aggressive slider switch, but it is in an indented area with a small tab sticking out. Very basic needs: Make sure the big one is changed. The smaller one can run with the cord plugged in.  When plugged in to charge, a very low-level power adapter is needed. I tried several higher-powered USB chargers, and only 5W chargers made the charging lights come on. Which may explain why they note that it recharges in \u201cjust 180 minutes!\u201d (That\u2019s three hours, for those keeping score at home!) They do arrive almost fully charged, and I\u2019ll talk about batteries more under Performance. You can tell if you have an adapter that will work when the charge level appears on the handle. Once you have the unit charged, decide how much guidance you need with your trim. Attach the proper guide comb, and turn the unit on. If you are \u201cfreehanding\u201d, be careful, because these babies cut deeply and quickly! I grew my hair out for a month, and then used the longest guard to buzz it all over. It\u2019s pretty short, but I get comments about my \u201cnew look\u201d from friends. I have a friend who has been cutting my hair with scissors for a long time, and will probably just let that continue, but the smaller trimmer is great for keeping my beard in check. I really liked the quiet operation and the guard, but it was a lot shorter than I prefer, even with the shortest guide. As mentioned, these trimmers are quiet, fast, and can lop off a lot of hair in not a lot of time. The smaller unit is great for shaving under your chin, shaping your beard, and thinning it with one of the guide combs \u2013 if you want to have a Drei Tage Bart, this may be your ticket to super-stardom! (Be aware that the tongue-in-cheek lyrics are a little PG-13! But if you remember the \u201890s and Don Johnson in Miami Vice, you\u2019ll get the idea of the \u201cThree Day Beard\u201d quickly.) I also used it for the back of my neck, where my hair grows back very quickly after a trim. I have had a beard on and off since leaving high school. (They were prohibited there, both by dress code and by parental code!) I usually would shave in summer for jobs, but since 1976, I have only shaved fully once \u2013 for my mother\u2019s 90th birthday. (After 40 years of her saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trim that beard off?\u201d every single time she saw me, I figured it would be a nice gift. I\u2019d had that one for 40 years!) I took to leaving the smaller trimmer readily available for touch-ups. It\u2019s much more accurate than the scissors I had been using, and less likely to bite. I do wish there was a travel sleeve just for it, because I\u2019m not happy just tossing it in my toiletry kit unprotected. The included zipper case is more of a storage box for the full kit, rather than a way to pack the clipper for use on the road.

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"Mini PCs are small, but with the right controller, they deliver a full gaming experience. Here are the best options for every budget.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you're here, then you likely already know that mini PCs are an excellent way to play video games without having to spend as much money on a full-blown desktop or laptop. If you're not inclined to use a keyboard, then you need a reliable controller to game effectively. Thankfully, any controller that works for a Windows laptop or desktop will work on a Windows mini PC. I've rounded up our absolute favorite options so you can get the best gaming controller for your mini PC setup. I'll be upfront and tell you that the Xbox Wireless Controller, which has a starting price of $53.99 at Best Buy, is my pick for the best controller for mini PCs, but I've also included some other options for different budgets.       Best controller overall When it comes to choosing a reliable controller for your computer, I always recommend the Xbox Wireless Controller first. It offers a comfortable layout that most fingers can easily use, has a good weight to it, and connects wirelessly to computers via Bluetooth. There are several colors to choose from, but I particularly like (and own) this purple one.        Best budget controller Now, if you're more interested in getting a good mini PC controller that doesn't cost too much, you really can't do better than the GameSir Nova Lite. Despite its low cost, it still provides a USB-A dongle, so you can use it wirelessly with your computer, and it even has Hall Effect joysticks that don't drift. You can get it in several different colors, including this light blue.        Best premium controller Several people here on the Windows Central gaming team absolutely love the Wolverine V3 Pro, and it's no wonder, given its top-tier features. It's certainly pricey, but this purchase gives you a wireless controller with Hall Effect joysticks, customizable triggers and buttons, a comfortable layout, and very responsive controls.        Best controller with charging dock\ufeff  Keeping your controller charged up is important if you want to be able to jump into a game at any moment. That's where buying a gamepad like the G7 Pro, which comes with a charging stand, is incredibly useful. It offers TMR Sticks, Hall Effect Triggers, and a 1,000Hz polling rate, and can last around 10 hours. There is also a wired version if you want a similar experience at a lower price.   Why you can trust Windows Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.       One thing I've learned over my years of PC gaming is that you really do need a reliable controller if you want the best gaming experience possible. Sure, there are plenty of cheap controllers on the market, but some of them are designed horribly, aren't very responsive, tend to drift quickly, or might regularly drop the wireless connection mid-game. First and foremost, I always recommend the Xbox Wireless Controller. Its well-spaced buttons, stable Bluetooth connection, large joysticks, and solid weight make it an excellent choice for playing on your mini PC. Now, if you'd like something that doesn't dig as much into your wallet, then I recommend the GameSir Nova Lite, which is a far more affordable wireless controller with Hall Effect joysticks. Anyone looking for the best experience available today and doesn't care about price should check out the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro. It offers Hall Effect joysticks, six remappable buttons, extremely responsive buttons, and a comfortable layout. Yes, you most certainly can. You just have to make sure the controller you pick is compatible with your kind of mini PC. Any controller that works on Windows computer should work on a Windows mini PC.  There are tradeoffs when using a controller rather than a keyboard during PC gaming sessions. Controllers have fewer buttons and usually aren't as precise when it comes to aiming, but they tend to be designed for ergonomically comfortable, compact use with smooth thumbsticks and sometimes vibration.  Meanwhile, keyboards offer far better aiming for competitive play, there are more buttons, and these buttons can be far more responsive if you have a good product. However, keyboards can take more time to learn how to use and, for some, they aren't as comfortable or convenient to use as a controller.  Some also argue that controllers are better suited for platformers, racing games, and fighting games, while keyboards are better for first-person shooters, strategy games, and MMOs. In the end, it really comes down to preference and game compatibility. Yes, we have tested and reviewed several GameSir products over the years and highly recommend this company's controllers for gaming.  USB-A and USB-C wireless dongles provide a wireless connection to their intended devices when they are plugged into a computer's port. They provide a less expensive means for a controller to work without needing cables. Hall Effect and TMR (Tunnel Magnetoresistance) joysticks are both good in that they both prevent stick drift from happening. However, TMR is largely considered better since it is more precise, require less power, and offers higher polling rates.

Responding to questions from shoppers during a walk at the Sunday Gaya Street market on Sunday (Nov 9), Anwar said the Federal Government earned about RM10bil in revenue from the state last year but was allocating about RM17bil. He had been asked when Sabah would receive its 40% revenue return, to which Anwar replied by questioning if the man was aware of the federal government\u2019s financial commitment to the state. The person argued that the 40% tax revenue and development allocation were different, but Anwar did not have time to explain the numbers in detail. A video of the discussion between the Prime Minister and shoppers went viral on social media. The issue of the 40% federal revenue resurfaced after the October 17 Kota Kinabalu High Court ruling. The ruling ordered the federal and state governments to work out payment details required under the Constitution within 180 days. During his hour-long walk, Anwar took selfies with shoppers and chatted with tourists and hawkers after arriving at about 8.50am. He was greeted by Kota Kinabalu Mayor Datuk Seri Sabin Samitah and state Infrastructure Development and Entrepreneur Minister Datuk Phoong Jin Sze. Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil and Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Mustapha Sakmud also joined the Prime Minister. Anwar had nasi lemak at a coffee shop along the street. Many people were pleasantly surprised to meet Anwar at the Gaya Street Sunday market. \u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you for your report!

{"date":"2025-11-09","content":"ByPaul Tassi, Senior Contributor. While I know that Netflix has been rushing to get out KPop Demon Hunters merch after its unexpected tidal wave of success, \u201crush\u201d is not often a thing that can happen in the retail industry, much of the time. The first KPop Demon Hunters Mattel dolls certainly prove that.  Pre-Orders for the KPop Demon Hunters Dolls will have you battling scalpers on Wednesday, November 12, at 12 PM ET, where you can buy three 3-packs at once. As in, nine dolls, if you\u2019re so inclined to try to get into the resale market yourself. But if, as a normal consumer, you just want one trio, that will run you $150 for the set.  The other problem? The ship date. You are pre-ordering these dolls, not buying them. The images shown are not factory products, they are renders of what they will look like, and Mattel\u2019s best estimate is that they will ship almost a year from now, in October 2026. So, just in time for next Christmas, and a year and a half after the original movie actually aired. The sequel is reportedly not getting here until 2029. Past all of this, the doll design is just\u2026not very good? Some fans may approve, but on closer inspection, a lot of these just look\u2026off. I\u2019d say that\u2019s especially true of Zoey, who pretty much looks like an entirely different character. The others are better, but there\u2019s just not something quite right about Rumi and Mira either. If you want to see this in action, you can check out the work of doll customizer Yohan, who has gone through all three of them with fixes: FEATURED | Frase ByForbes\u2122 Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder The caveats here are that A) these are renders, not the final product, and things could still change or be adjusted before production and B) these are not hyper-accurate figurines, they are still dolls, and there is often some leeway there. For many fans of the movie, \u201cgood enough\u201d is probably all that\u2019s needed. But I mean, $150 and an entire year of waiting isn\u2019t nothing. Despite all of this, no matter the stock, they will sell out immediately, so prepare to get your heart broken. And like I said, there\u2019s a good chance this is not just going to be other rabid fans you\u2019re competing against, but scalpers and their bot armies, and expect to see these on sale on Ebay for 10x the price at some point. There will be a rolling wave of all kinds of KPop Demon Hunters merch heading to shelves between deals with Mattel and Hasbro. As for the movie itself, as mentioned, the sequel is four years away, and we don\u2019t know what else may show up in the interim, with nothing officially announced.
