One of the world's most prominent investors has sold all of its shares of the world's most prominent AI stock. Is that the end of the AI bubble? Not yet. Because the full story is more complicated: SoftBank Group disclosed Tuesday that it has sold $5.8 billion worth of Nvidia stock \u2014 and that it's putting the proceeds into OpenAI, the era-defining company behind ChatGPT. That is \u2026 confusing. And also kind of fitting, since OpenAI and Nvidia have been tightly coupled for the past few years. Because while OpenAI is privately held, Nvidia has been the most exciting stock in the world for several years \u2014 going back to late 2022, when OpenAI blew many minds with the debut of ChatGPT. Prior to that, you might have bought Nvidia stock because you thought its chips would be crucial for the video game industry. But since it turns out Nvidia's chips are crucial for the AI engines OpenAI and its competitors are building, Nvidia has now become the primary stock proxy for the AI boom, with its shares up more than 10x since ChatGPT's launch. So when SoftBank \u2014 a company known for making big crazy bets on the future \u2014 dumps its Nvidia holdings, you might think that's a signal about AI. Particularly given the roiling \"Is AI a bubble and when will it pop?\" discourse. Nvidia shares are down nearly 3% on the news. But SoftBank isn't bailing on AI. Instead, it's selling the world's hottest AI stock so it can buy more AI. SoftBank has already put $7.5 billion into OpenAI, and plans on investing another $22.5 billion into the company soon. That is: Nvidia is the hardware that makes OpenAI possible. But SoftBank thinks what OpenAI eventually builds will be more valuable than the building blocks. You can see SoftBank making that case in its Q2 earnings presentation, which goes on and on and on about the upside of OpenAI. There is also some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu happening here. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has already made a version of this deal once before: He bought into Nvidia in 2017, sold out two years later for a healthy gain, and then missed Nvidia's crazy rise that started a couple of years later. He has been understandably regretful about that one. But this time he's swapping shares in a public company \u2014 one that has to provide close-to-realtime reports on how it's doing \u2014 with a private one led by CEO Sam Altman, who bristles if you suggest that his valuation and financial obligations are out of whack with its current reality. That seems risky, but that also seems on brand for Son, who has made a career out of making big swings. He was early and right about the internet in the 1990s and on Alibaba in the 2000s. He was also terribly wrong about WeWork. We don't know how this one is going to pan out. Still, SoftBank's latest move tells you what kind of market we're still in: one where the biggest players are willing to sell the sure thing to chase the next thing. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Beijing\u2019s grand ambitions threaten to take down the global car industry. Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. In China, you can buy a heavily discounted \u201cused\u201d electric car that has never, in fact, been used. Chinese automakers, desperate to meet their sales targets in a bitterly competitive market, sell cars to dealerships, which register them as \u201csold,\u201d even though no actual customer has bought them. Dealers, stuck with officially sold cars, then offload them as \u201cused,\u201d often at low prices. The practice has become so prevalent that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to stop it. Its main newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, complained earlier this year that this sales-inflating tactic \u201cdisrupts normal market order,\u201d and criticized companies for their \u201cdata worship.\u201d This sign of serious problems in China\u2019s electric-vehicle industry may come as a surprise to many Americans. The Chinese electric car has become a symbol of the country\u2019s seemingly unstoppable rise on the world stage. Many observers point to their growing popularity as evidence that China is winning the race to dominate new technologies. But in China, these electric cars represent something entirely different: the profound threats that Beijing\u2019s meddling in markets poses to both China and the world. Bloated by excessive investment, distorted by government intervention, and plagued by heavy losses, China\u2019s EV industry appears destined for a crash. EV companies are locked in a cutthroat struggle for survival. Wei Jianjun, the chairman of the Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor, warned in May that China\u2019s car industry could tumble into a financial crisis; it \u201cjust hasn\u2019t erupted yet.\u201d Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu: China is building the future To bypass government censorship of bad economic news, market analysts have opted for a seemingly anodyne term to describe the Chinese car industry\u2019s downward spiral: involution, which connotes falling in on oneself. What happens in China\u2019s EV sector promises to influence the entire global automobile market. China\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of EVs highlights the serious challenge the country poses to even the most advanced industries in the U.S., Europe, and other rich economies. Given the vital role the car industry plays in economies around the world, and the jobs, supply chains, and technologies involved, the stakes are high. But the wobbles in China\u2019s EV sector demonstrate the downside of China\u2019s state-led economic model. China\u2019s government threw ample resources at the EV industry in the hopes of leapfrogging foreign rivals in the transition to battery-powered vehicles. The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that the government provided more than $230 billion of financial assistance to the EV sector from 2009 to 2023. The strategy worked: China\u2019s EV makers would likely never have grown as quickly as they have without this substantial state support. By comparison, the recent Republican-sponsored tax bill eliminated nearly all federal subsidies for EVs in the U.S. The problem is that China\u2019s program encouraged too much investment in the sector. Michael Dunne, the CEO of Dunne Insights, a California-based consulting firm focused on the EV industry, counts 46 domestic and international automakers producing EVs in China, far too many for even the world\u2019s second-largest economy to sustain. Dunne told me that the EV sector in China is consolidating; 11 Chinese companies now dominate the local car market. But the industry should probably shrink further. The capital-intensive car business relies on economies of scale, which is why the world has so few major automakers. Yet China\u2019s auto industry is still nascent enough to attract new players, including major electronics companies. Xiaomi, which makes everything from smartphones to rice cookers, launched its first EV model just last year. To woo customers in this crowded market, China\u2019s EV companies have been slashing their prices, making profits slim. In most economies, the market would sort out this mess by culling the weakest players. But China\u2019s leaders don\u2019t trust markets to achieve their national goals, so they readily intervene. In China, state support or ownership of automakers extends the life of struggling businesses. Local governments are also reluctant to lose the jobs they bring, so officials prop up unprofitable companies. The city of Wenzhou recently helped arrange financing for an EV maker called WM Motor, to get the company\u2019s local factory humming again. The city of Hefei rescued the EV start-up Nio in 2020, but the publicly listed company continues to lose money\u2014$1.6 billion in the first half of this year. China\u2019s EV woes are a direct consequence of these interventions, which have engineered an unsustainable glut of vehicles. But instead of addressing these market problems, China\u2019s leaders are cracking down on what they call \u201cdisorderly competition,\u201d such as the aggressive EV price war and the sale of zero-mileage \u201cused\u201d cars. Beijing has its own reasons to avoid the economic reforms that would make its EV industry more viable. By keeping factories running, even at a loss, the government can shore up an economy plagued by sluggish consumer spending and a slumping property market. More important, EV makers are a key part of Beijing\u2019s plan to expand China\u2019s global power. China\u2019s state-led EV program, by design, has been predatory. By subsidizing these companies, China sought to edge out more established automakers in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. Beijing\u2019s economic planners are willing to sacrifice something as frivolous as profitability to fulfill their dreams of building an internationally competitive car industry. China \u201csustains a lot of inefficiency at home in order to dominate industries and markets globally,\u201d Dunne told me. Yet even the Chinese state may not be able to prop up its automakers indefinitely. The research firm Rhodium Group figures that Chinese policy makers spend the equivalent of 3 percent of the central government\u2019s fiscal revenues to subsidize car sales. Gregor Sebastian, a senior analyst at Rhodium, told me that this level is probably unsustainable, particularly if the Chinese government also hopes to develop semiconductors and AI. He recommends that Chinese policy makers \u201cslowly take the foot off the gas pedal, but in a way that the sector doesn\u2019t collapse.\u201d Patrick George: The American car industry can\u2019t go on like this China\u2019s EV industry\u2019s gains in the international market are also under threat. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration imposed a 100 percent tariff on Chinese EVs last year, which President Donald Trump has maintained, effectively shutting these vehicles out of the U.S. market. The European Union, Canada, Turkey and Mexico have also hiked duties on Chinese cars. Restricted access to key international markets could make it even harder for Chinese EV companies to survive without aid from their government. The international automobile industry is shaping up to be a test of wills between the Chinese leaders determined to dominate it and the global policy makers who hope to stop them. This contest isn\u2019t all bad. By pushing down car prices, China\u2019s policies may benefit consumers worldwide. But China\u2019s state-led economic model still comes at a high cost, given the ways its huge subsidies and low prices are forcing governments around the world to use tariffs to meddle with the markets. China\u2019s distorted EV market now threatens to hoard industry jobs by making it impossible for any car company to turn a profit. In the end, China\u2019s EV industry may overrun its competitors, but still be a financial catastrophe. TheAtlantic.com \u00a9 2025 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":" Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Legends: Z-A  It is exhausting seeing how many aspects of the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon experience people try to exploit as part of some money-making scheme. The cards are obviously the most prominent example of this, as scalpers and the content creation mill have turned the act of buying and selling packs into a lucrative business at the expense of players being able to derive any joy from the hobby. But people selling Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon-related stuff for a profit isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to physical goods. Nowadays, you can find someone asking for real-world cash for a Shiny Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon in games like Legends: Z-A. Despite how much easier Legends: Z-A makes it to find the rare, alternate-colored \u00e2\u0080\u0098mons in Lumiose City, some folks would rather just fork over some of their hard-earned money to save themselves a few hours of grinding to make one of them spawn. At least, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what some sellers on places like eBay are banking on. If you search for Shiny Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon on the site, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find dozens of listings, some selling specific creatures and others letting people specify the Shiny they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeking. One of the most expensive offerings includes a full \u00e2\u0080\u009cLiving Dex\u00e2\u0080\u009d of every Shiny Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon in Legends: Z-A for $300. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a cheaper (but still very expensive) $80 listing for every Shiny Mega Evolution Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon in the game thus far. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than it costs to buy the game itself. I understand that for a lot of people, the joy of shinies is not in the exhausting hunt and they just want to put these rare creatures in their party or in a box so they can say they have them. But man, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine being that devoted to Shiny Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be willing to fork over real-world money for one, especially when they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited-time offerings. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprised when scalpers were selling free Shiny Miraidon and Koraidon codes because GameStop had made that an issue of false scarcity. But people are often willing to spend money to save themselves time. So I guess this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that different from spending money on microtransactions to skip through a waiting period in an app. But at least with those, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to haggle and negotiate on something that was never meant to have a real-world monetary value.

Amazon just cut the price on what runners everywhere call their favorite workout companion: The Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones have dropped to $124, down from their usual $179 price tag. These aren\u2019t your standard issue earbuds that block out the world around you: they use bone conduction technology to deliver audio through your cheekbones while keeping your ears completely open. It\u2019s a design that makes them a go-to for runners who need to stay aware of traffic, fellow joggers, and their surroundings without sacrificing their workout playlist. See at Amazon The OpenRun Pro takes a fundamentally different tack with workout audio: traditional earbuds create a seal in your ear canal which might be OK on the gym floor but becomes a serious safety hazard when you take your runs outdoors. These headphones perch on your cheekbones and transmit sound through bone conduction and leave your ear canals wide open. You hear your music, podcasts, or calls clearly while simultaneously hearing cars approaching, cyclists calling out, or someone trying to get your attention on the trail. The 9th generation represents years of refinement in bone conduction technology: They\u2019re the first Shokz headphones built to take advantage of TurboPitch technology, a design that confronts the main critique of bone conduction models of the past. The bass response feels full and rich rather than tinny or weak. You get clear vocals across your favorite tracks, powerful volume when you need to bear down during tough intervals, and surprisingly deep low-end frequencies that other bone conduction models struggled to deliver. The physical design solves problems that plague conventional workout headphones: A wraparound titanium frame weighs almost nothing but provides serious durability. This lightweight, titanium construction flexes to fit different head sizes without creating pressure points. The frame keeps the headphones locked in position through sprints, burpees, or mountain climbs during intense training sessions Battery performance matches the requirements of the most serious athletes: The ten hours of continuous playback will handle everything from marathon training runs to full days of back-to-back activities. You charge them once and don\u2019t worry about battery anxiety for days of normal use. The Quick Charge feature proves super-practical when you forget to plug them in overnight. Just five minutes charging gives you 1.5 hours of battery life. The sweat-resistant construction handles whatever your workout throws at it. These headphones resist humid summer runs, aggressive HIIT sessions, and rainy morning jogs without degradation in performance. At $124, these headphones cost less than most premium traditional sports earbuds and offer better situational awareness. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

As the days get shorter and the weather gets colder, it\u2019s going to be more and more difficult to stay motivated to keep in shape and stick to running throughout the winter. One thing that keeps me going is that I use my runs as my podcast time. Been working my way through the third campaign in\u00c2\u00a0Not Another D&D Podcast and four days a week, I\u2019m out running and listening. My pair of OpenRun Pro headphones from Shokz are perfect for the job. Right now, they happen to be on sale over at Amazon for 31% off. The brings them down from $180 to just $125. You end up saving yourself a solid $55. See at Amazon These headphones are different from your standard earbuds in that they don\u2019t go in your ear. They sit around your ears and deliver sound using bone conduction. By vibrating your skull, you get the perception of sound.\u00c2\u00a0 Elder millennial like myself might remember this tech from those lollipops in the 90s that could play hit music when you put them in your mouth. Though unlike those, these play music, audiobooks, or podcasts through your cheekbones, not your teeth. The main advantage to designing headphones this way is it keeps your ears free to hear the various sounds in your environment, keeping you alert of your surroundings. This is crucial while running in case, say, a car is approaching. You\u2019re going to want to hear traffic for safety reasons. The Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones sit comfortably on your ears like a backwards pair of sunglasses. They feature a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame which helps keep your headphones firmly in place during high intensity workouts. I much prefer this to in-ear buds so I can eliminate any fear of one falling out while on a run. Battery life is reliable. You can expect a full 10 hours of listening time on a single charge. The OpenRun Pro headphones can recharge fast, providing up to 1.5 hours of listening time after being plugged in for only five minutes. Shokz also offers a mini model which has a shortened connecting band that stretches around the back for smaller heads. The standard model measures across at 20.7 cm while the mini is 21 mm (or 0.83 inches) shorter at 18.6 cm. Check the product page or the Shokz website for instructions on how to decide which model is best for you. Thankfully, both the standard and mini version are seeing the same discount. The standard comes in black, beige, or blue. While the mini has the same color options, the beige and blue appear to be out of stock at the moment.

In the end, China\u2019s EV industry may overrun its competitors, but still be a financial catastrophe. TheAtlantic.com \u00a9 2025 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

Texas has welcomed a number of residents from less affordable parts of the country looking to get more for their money \u2014 and they may be on to something. Texas is becoming more than just a temporary escape from high costs on the way to homeownership; many of its cities can actually retain residents thanks to other assets that extend beyond sheer affordability. WalletHub ranked 300 cities based on two key dimensions: its real estate market and its affordability and economic environment. A total of 17 relevant metrics were examined to determine not only an area's potential for a home's value to increase, but also the surrounding market economics, like job growth and unemployment rates. WalletHub found that the Lone Star State fared disproportionately well, taking five of the list's top 10 spots. \"Texas cities in the top 10, like McKinney, Frisco, Richardson, Denton, and Allen, stand out because they score well in both the real estate market and the affordability and economic environment dimension,\" WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo told Business Insider. \"The rankings reflect strong performance across factors such as median home-price appreciation, job growth, and the share of newer housing, all of which contribute to long-term stability.\" Texas cities are often known for being more affordable than large coastal cities thanks to their generally low tax burden. But the ones that showed up on WalletHub's list weren't the ones you might expect: Austin and Dallas, for example, didn't crack the top 10 \u2014 likely because their sizes aren't conducive to more growth. \"Most of the top-ranking cities fall into the midsize population category, which suggests that market health in this year's rankings is closely tied to environments that are growing, but not yet at the scale of major metropolitan areas,\" Lupo said. \"Midsize cities may have an advantage because they can offer newer housing inventory, more building-permit activity, and housing affordability that aligns with local income levels.\" Each market was graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the healthiest market. Median home listing prices came from Realtor.com. Below are the 10 healthiest housing markets in the country, according to WalletHub.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":" Mega Gengar exPok\u00c3\u00a9mon TCG  As\u00c2\u00a0Kotaku has been reporting for the whole year, the\u00c2\u00a0Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Trading Card Game has been in a crisis from which it\u2019s showing no signs of recovery. As new card prices hit record highs, it naturally draws in many new collectors hoping to hit it big, which causes scalpers to swoop in to drive up scarcity and prices, attracting more new collectors, then more scalpers, and so on, a vicious circle that is increasingly tightening, strangling the hobby. This situation has now reached a spectacular new low, with reports that people are attempting to sell the Mega Gengar ex special art rare card from PTCG set Mega Dream ex for $800. But there\u2019s a small problem: the card doesn\u2019t exist yet. It\u2019s set to be part of Japan\u2019s Mega Dream ex special set, only officially announced on Friday, which doesn\u2019t go on sale until November 28. Despite multiple promises throughout 2025 from The Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Company, it remains the case that it\u2019s close to impossible to walk into either a specialist or mainstream store and buy a pack of Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon\u00c2\u00a0cards released in the last 12 months. Since November 2024\u2019s pre-orders began for the Eevee-themed Prismatic Evolutions, new sets have sold out before human beings can click on sites to buy them, while stock in stores has been stripped from shelves by camping scalpers before kids can spend their allowance. The only solution is to outprint the demand, but as yet The Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Company has demonstrated that it either can\u2019t or won\u2019t do this, and in fact seems to be going out of its way to make the situation far worse. And following on from the gold card fiasco of Mega Evolutions, the latest English-language set that goes on sale November 14\u00e2\u0080\u0094Phantasmal Flames\u00e2\u0080\u0094ups this ante by including a single gold card, and having it be the most desired Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon on cardboard, Mega Charizard. It\u2019s going to be\u00c2\u00a0crazy. But if there\u2019s one card that could potentially prove more popular than Mega Charizard ex (which is also getting a Special Illustration Rare version that will inevitably fetch more than $500), it\u2019s Mega Gengar ex, and that ghostly beast is appearing in\u00c2\u00a0 Japan\u2019s Mega Dream ex later this month. And as reported by Wargamer (thanks\u00c2\u00a0PC Gamer), people are already putting the card up for sale on eBay. For $797.99. To be clear, even though you will see American YouTubers ripping open packs of international cards long before their street dates (either because they are sent samples by TPCi, as we are, or because they get retail stock ahead of sale), this isn\u2019t the case for the Japanese sets. No one has these cards yet. The art for the Mega Gengar ex Special Art Rare was only revealed digitally on Friday. Then cut and pasted onto eBay with a price tag. Japan is having all the same problems with stock as the rest of the world, such that even physical Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Centers over there are\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u2019ve been told\u00e2\u0080\u0094limiting customers to four single packs each. Scalpers will likely be abusing retail options to get hold of the booster boxes, stripping them down to resell valuable cards, and then dumping the bulk. That\u2019s how someone could be confident enough to believe they can honor a sale of a card that is probably still in production right now. Presumably the only thing stopping people from trying to hawk copies of the English version of the Mega Gengar ex is that they haven\u2019t got an image of it yet. It will likely be included in whatever January\u2019s special set of Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon cards proves to be, and guarantees that this tiresome situation will drag on into at least the start of 2026. It\u2019s a bubble, and it will burst, but the concern is just how much harm it will have done by that point. Not only is an entire generation of children being excluded from the hobby (and thus from becoming the next generation of collectors), but it\u2019s having a real-life impact on specialist card stores. Store owners are telling me they\u2019re unable to get stock, and that TPCi is actively refusing to engage with them about the issues, meaning customers aren\u2019t coming in. One store owner told me he\u2019s resorted to getting up in the early hours of the morning to try to buy packs online from other retailers, just so he has something to sell on his shelves, while knowing he\u2019s driving the problem by doing so. It\u2019s miserable. So, don\u2019t buy from these scalpers. Don\u2019t endorse those selling sealed product at double or triple the MSRP. Refusing to participate is the only action we can take to address the situation, and thinking, \u201cWell everyone else is doing it, so\u2026\u201d makes you part of the problem. Yes, it\u2019d sure be great to pull that gold Mega Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0094it could pay for a vacation\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you most likely won\u2019t. (The pull rates for one of the Mega Evolution golds were one in every 2,250 packs, ffs.) Oh, and especially don\u2019t buy from people claiming to sell you a card that\u2019s not even printed yet.

Ford's CEO had an EV wake-up call after tearing apart cars from Tesla and its rivals in China. Speaking on an upcoming episode of the \"Office Hours: Business Edition\"  podcast, Jim Farley said the \"shocking\" realization of how far ahead Elon Musk's automaker and China's EV upstarts were pushed him to overhaul the company. \"I was very humbled when we took apart the first Model 3 Tesla and started to take apart the Chinese vehicles. When we took them apart, it was shocking what we found,\" Farley told host Monica Langley in the interview, which is set to be released on Wednesday. The Detroit executive said Ford's Mustang Mach-E had around 1.6km more electrical wiring than the Tesla, adding extra weight to the car and requiring a much bigger and more expensive battery. Taking apart rival vehicles is a common practice in the automotive industry. The CEO of smartphone-maker-turned-EV-upstart Xiaomi revealed in September that his team bought three Tesla Model Ys and ripped them apart to study every component. Farley, who has led Ford since 2020, said the teardowns convinced him the company had to change to match its new rivals. In 2022, Farley spun out Ford's EV operations into a new division called Model E. The division lost more than $5 billion in 2024 and is projected to face a similar hit this year, but Farley said he doesn't regret the move. \"I knew it was going to be brutal business-wise,\" he said on the podcast, adding that he thought it was important for Ford's EV operations to be accountable to investors. \"My ethos is, take on the hardest problems as fast as you can and do it sometimes in public because you'll solve them quicker that way,\" Farley said. Farley has regularly warned that China's EV giants pose an existential threat to Ford and other Western automakers. In June, he described Chinese EVs as \"far superior\" to their Western counterparts, and last month he said Chinese brands like BYD were \"completely dominating\" the global EV landscape. Around 50% of new car sales in China are electric, compared to about 10% in the US. Chinese automakers have outpaced most of their Western rivals by offering a range of high-tech electric models with affordable price tags \u2014 and now many of them are expanding overseas, rapidly taking market share in Europe and developing markets. Farley has been sounding the alarm about the rise of Chinese EVs, but he's also a fan. The Ford CEO said last year he'd been driving an electric sedan built by Xiaomi for six months, and \"didn't want to give it up.\" \"EVs are exploding in China,\" said Farley on the \"Office Hours\" podcast, adding that the Chinese government had put its \"foot on the economic scale\" in favor of battery-powered vehicles. \"We can't walk away from EVs, not just for the US, but if we want to be a global company, I'm not going to just cede that to the Chinese,\" Farley said. Despite this, Ford's EV push continues to face a bumpy road in the US. The Blue Oval reported record electric vehicle sales in the third quarter as buyers rushed to snap up vehicles before the end of the federal tax credit, but Farley told investors in an analyst call last month that he expected only around 5% of the US market to be electric in the near term as EV demand slows. \"We now know that the EV market in the US is totally different than we thought,\" said Farley on the \"Office Hours\" podcast, adding that US consumers are more interested in affordable electric models than a \"$70-80,000 electric vehicle.\" To meet that new market, Ford is once again shifting its EV strategy. In August, Farley unveiled a new EV production line that he said would help Ford beat BYD and Tesla. The first vehicle to roll off the retooled production line will be a $30,000 midsize truck, which is expected to launch in 2027. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Update November 11: The Logitech MX Master 4 has regularly been out of stock since its initial launch last month. Right now, however, it\u2019s in stock and ready to ship on Amazon. Act fast if you\u2019ve been on the hunt for one. It\u2019s clearly very popular, so who knows how long this availability will last.  The Logitech MX Master line of mice has become a staple in the setups of Mac users everywhere. Now, the company is out with the highly-anticipated MX Master 4. It packs a handful of changes to the iconic mouse, while staying true to the form factor that has made the lineup so popular over the years. One of the big changes to the MX Master 4 is the addition of haptic feedback. Here\u2019s how Logitech explains it in today\u2019s press release: The MX Master 4 reimagines user control with customizable haptic feedback, delivering subtle vibrations for scrolling, navigation and selection. This tactile precision is ideal for tasks like video editing, design work and data analysis. The haptic feedback is built into a small panel on the MX Master 4\u2019s thumb rest. You can have to dive into the Logitech Options+ software to really take advantage of it, but once you do, you\u2019ll get little bits of haptic feedback when performing certain tasks in apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Zoom. There\u2019s also system-level integration on macOS and Windows. Further leaning into the Logitech Options+ app, the MX Master 4 has a new Action Rings system: Actions Ring, a digital overlay enabled by Logi Options+, offers app-specific shortcuts and customizable controls to place frequently used tools at your fingertips anywhere on your screen. With features such as assigning commands in Photoshop or automating functions in Excel, professionals can save up to 33% of their time and reduce repetitive mouse movements by 63%. In terms of connectivity, the MX Master 4 uses a high-performance chip and optimized antenna that Logitech says offers \u201ctwice the connectivity strength of previous models.\u201d There\u2019s also a new USB-C dongle, but that\u2019s not included in the box with the Mac-optimized version of the mouse. The overall form factor of the MX Master 4 is the same as its predecessors. Logitech, however, says it\u2019s more stain-resistant than before and replaces some of the rubbery finish with a new textured plastic material. We\u2019ll have more details and hands-on with the Logitech MX Master 4 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, I\u2019ve linked a few reviews below that are worth reading. The Logitech MX Master 4 is available to order now on Amazon for $119.9,9 with the first orders arriving as soon as today. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        Controllers bore me. The modern Xbox controller and Sony DualSense both conform to the same general shape that gently cups your palms and leads the thumbs right to the necessary joysticks and face buttons. A comfortable design has led to stagnation, something that Valve could be ready to take a sledgehammer to for some extreme remodeling. Sure, the Steam maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decade-old attempt at a gamepad failed, but the rumored new Steam Controller may have enough going for it that trackpads could finally replace thumbsticks\u2026 in some cases. Valve may be on the edge of releasing its first novel hardware since it gave us the Steam Deck OLED in 2023. There have been enough rumors to suggest Valve is close to dropping its rumored \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeckard\u00e2\u0080\u009d VR headset as soon as this month. It would serve as a wireless sequel to the 2019 Valve Index but use the more common Snapdragon XR2 chip like the Quest 3 and 3S. This headset, which has also been referred to as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteam Frame\u00e2\u0080\u009d based on data unearthed within SteamOS, would be distinct from most other headsets. Reliable VR rumormonger Brad Lynch has catalogued several leaks that suggested it would also be able to play your regular Steam library through the headset\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built-in displays. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be playing those games with your head sandwiched between a VR headset, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to need a controller that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require any extra probing to find the right button. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the supposed new Steam Controller comes in. The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips pic.twitter.com\/loIqpJb0YZ \u2014 Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) November 9, 2025  Lynch has posted several renders of this controller generated based on his data mining and other sources. He shared a recent AI-generated \u00e2\u0080\u009cslop photo\u00e2\u0080\u009d he claims the controller will resemble upon release. Lynch suggests the gamepad could detect how far your hands are from the controller, akin to Valve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original Index VR controllers, though without finger tracking. You can see by the image mockup that the two large trackpads are recessed into the controller. The Steam Deck normally used the triggers as a mouse click in some games and when using the desktop mode. Valve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original controller from 2014, built for the long-defunct Steam Box, had two massive saucer-like trackpads built on an extremely lightweight frame. It required players to use these trackpads since it otherwise contained a single thumbstick alongside the traditional ABXY face buttons. The idea was that players could use the trackpads like a mouse for the sake of first-person shooters or real-time strategy games that required more precise input. While the Steam Controller lasted longer than any of the supposed Steam Machines, Valve eventually liquidated its stock for $5 a pop. That controller worked, but only to a point. It took way too much getting used to and lacked the haptics necessary for precise controls. Dell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Alienware gaming brand also developed a Nyx concept controller with a single haptic pad. Valve, however, could be the one to make trackpad controls mainstream. The Steam Deck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twin thumbpads are easily the best of any of the many, many handheld PCs I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried over the past three years. The microtextured plastic combined with the force feedback offers better mouse controls than moving your cursor around with a joystick. The reason I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often opt for the trackpads in games is simply because the Steam Deck OLED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small 7.4-inch, 800p display isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t great for most CRPGs or RTS games that I prefer to play. Which is why it makes more sense when combined with a VR headset, or better yet, with an updated Steam Machine console such as the supposed \u00e2\u0080\u009cFremont\u00e2\u0080\u009d console that\u2019s been in development within Valve. Lynch recently posted on Discord that, according to anonymous sources, Valve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next hardware could drop as early as this week. Valve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normal Autumn sale on Steam ran from Sept. 29 through Oct. 6, which is earlier than usual. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to have some Valve superfans speculating the company could launch new hardware sometime this month.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":" JapanPrice DropPS5SonyState of Play  During Tuesday\u2019s Japan-focused State of Play, Sony announced a new, cheaper Japanese-language-only PlayStation 5 Digital Edition console that will be available exclusively in Japan. It\u2019s likely a reaction to tariffs in the United States, inflation in Japan, and Nintendo\u2019s own cheaper Japan-only Switch 2. On November 11, at the very end of PlayStation\u2019s latest State of Play broadcast, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino announced \u201csomething very special\u201d for gamers in Japan: A Japanese-language-only PS5 console that will cost \u00c2\u00a555,000 yen, which is roughly $350 USD. That same console, following a price increase earlier this year, now costs $500 in the United States. Currently, the digital-only PS5 in Japan costs roughly \u00c2\u00a573,000. So if you live in Japan and know the language, you can save quite a bit of money buying this cheaper, Japanese-only version of the PS5, which goes on sale on November 21. PS5 Digital Edition \u2013 Japanese Language only console announced \u2013 55,000 yen \u2014 Wario64 (@wario64.bsky.social) 2025-11-11T22:40:28.429Z   As to why Sony is releasing a cheaper, Japan-only PS5, there are a few factors. One of the big ones, as reported by the Financial Times, is rising inflation and the yen losing value in Sony\u2019s home country. And since, as Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games told VGC, many gamers in Japan don\u2019t care about their consoles being region-locked or restricted to Japanese only, this is a way for Sony to offer a cheaper console to one of its key markets. It also makes it harder for resellers and people outside of Japan to snatch up PS5 consoles at a cheaper price, a factor that led to Nintendo offering its very own Japan-only Switch 2 console earlier this year. And yeah, that\u2019s another likely reason for a Japan-only PS5: The Switch 2 is doing very well in the country, and the OG Switch is holding its own, too. Sony\u2019s pricey PS5 is likely too much for consumers in Japan who are struggling with inflation. A cheaper, region-locked PS5 that can\u2019t be easily resold on the grey market could be a big hit in Japan and help Sony regain some ground. It also marks Sony\u2019s first region-locked console since the PlayStation 2. Of course, one more factor in all of this is the ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. These tariffs led to Sony raising the price of all PS5 consoles in the United States earlier this year, and a Japan-only PS5 can help the company focus on its local market without having to pay high tariffs or deal with outside buyers.

Reading time 2 minutes        Your laptop dying mid-flight or during a long train ride creates that sinking feeling when you realize the nearest outlet is hours away. Most portable chargers handle phones and tablets just fine but they barely make a dent in laptop batteries that demand serious power. The Anker 25,000mAh laptop power bank changes that equation by delivering up to 100W through any of its three USB-C ports which means you can charge your MacBook, your phone, and your tablet all at the same time. Right now on Amazon, this powerhouse drops to just $91, down from its usual $134 price tag. That\u2019s an all-time low for a charger that transforms how you work and travel away from wall outlets. See at Amazon All three USB-C ports push 100W of power\u00c2\u00a0which is enough to fast-charge a MacBook Pro or any modern laptop that draws significant wattage. This matters because most portable chargers max out at 18W or 30W, which barely keeps a laptop from dying rather than actually charging it up. You can plug a laptop in and watch the battery percentage climb at the same speed as if you were connected to your wall charger at home with 100W available on each port. The triple-port setup means you can charge your work laptop while simultaneously powering your phone and your wireless earbuds, all without slowing down the charging speed on any device. The 25,000mAh capacity translates to real-world charging that gets you through multiple work sessions before the power bank itself needs a refill. This battery holds enough juice to fully charge a MacBook Air twice, an iPhone 15 about five times, or an iPad Pro more than twice. That huge capacity is just what you need on those long flights or all-day conferences when power outlets may just not exist. What impresses much more is how fast the power bank itself recharges. Plug it into a 100W charger, and it reaches 30% capacity in just 22 minutes, meaning you can top it up over lunch and have enough power for the rest of your day. Anker built two cables right into the power bank body to eliminate that frustrating moment of realization when you\u2019ve packed the charger but left the cables at home. One USB-C extends up to 2.3 feet and retracts back into the unit after you\u2019re done, built to handle over 20,000 pulls before wearing out. The second cable comes in at 0.98 feet and doubles as a carrying strap, letting you hang the power bank off your wrist or backpack. The four-device charging capability means that you and your travel companions can have power anytime, all at once. The two integrated USB-C cables take care of your main priorities, while the extra USB-C port and USB-A port round out the connections for two more gadgets simultaneously. This works perfectly in those instances where you are at a coffee shop and there are very few outlets, or in an airport lounge where everybody is competing for those charging stations, or on a road trip and sharing power with family members. At $91, you\u2019re getting a great charging solution that handles everything from emergency laptop power to multi-device charging during long trips.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Today, Google announced its own version of what Apple is doing with Private Cloud Compute, in what may be a landmark moment for the consumer AI market. Here\u2019s why. For the past few months, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that what is really disappointing when it comes to Apple\u2019s predicament with AI is not just the general notion that it is \u201cbehind\u201d on whatever amorphous concept of AI may be the trend du jour. What is disappointing, to me anyway, is the fact that for the first time in a long while, Apple seems genuinely incapable of delivering a novel(ish) piece of technology on the same level as its competitors can. And while it may be especially infuriating to see Apple counter the idea that it is behind on AI by listing multiple machine learning-based features it has shipped for the last few years, the company does have a point. For much of the past decade, Apple has been exploring and shipping interesting machine learning-powered features, many of which are supported by its long-running body of in-house academic research, some of which it began sharing publicly through its Machine Learning Research blog. But, Apple did miss the tidal shift sparked by the launch of ChatGPT, which, it\u2019s worth noting, debuted four years after the release of the original GPT framework. In other words, Apple, like the rest of the industry, had four years to realize where the puck was going. And while the rest of the industry managed to move and start shipping LLM-based products, each at its own pace (and with wildly varying levels of success), Apple remains largely stuck in the same spot as it was when ChatGPT came out. But Apple has done some excellent behind-the-scenes technical work, some of which I\u2019ve covered over the past few months. Chief among them is the Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, which is, hands down, Apple at its best. While the rest of the industry rushed and basically lowered its privacy standards to join the age of LLMs, Apple stuck to its principles and developed a truly beautiful technical solution to the problem of keeping user data private and secure to leverage a piece of technology that, in a way, gravitates towards the opposite direction. Yes, Apple is yet to truly take advantage of this beautiful technical solution with an actual product to run on it. Real artists ship. 100%. But the fact that today, Google announced pretty much its own implementation of Apple\u2019s solution is a validation of Apple\u2019s technical work towards a more private AI ecosystem. What\u2019s more, now that Google and Apple offer this sort of infrastructure, it is very likely that this may push other frontier AI labs to do just the same, which is a resounding win for user privacy. Would it be great to know that Apple can keep up with the rest of the developments in the AI world? Sure. But even in this situation, Apple is still able to influence the market toward a more private and responsible direction, and that counts as a win in my book.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a difficult year for Tesla drivers who don\u2019t align with founder and CEO Elon Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political views, DOGE moves, or recent compensation package. Regardless of the reason, used Teslas have flooded lots across the country this year, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been finding new buyers more quickly than almost all other similarly aged vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0094gas or electric. Edmunds released its report on the 20 fastest-selling three-year-old vehicles in the third quarter of 2025 on November 10, and the Tesla Model S took the fewest days to sell at 21.5 on average, just over half the average of 41 days for a used car. The Model 3 was a close second at 22 days, and the Model Y was in fourth place at 26.3 days.\u00c2\u00a0 Three-year-old models are used for studies such as these because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a typical amount of time for a new car buyer to change to the latest model due to a significant revision or the end of a lease.\u00c2\u00a0 Despite Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sliding sales in 2025, the Model Y and Model 3 are routinely the best-selling EVs in the US, and with more coming off of two or three-year leases in 2026, inventory is expected to keep up with demand, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything like 2025 so far. The problem is that much of that momentum, especially until October 1, was driven by the phasing out of the used EV federal tax credit of as much as $4,000.\u00c2\u00a0 That makes the last three months of this year the largest indicator of whether used EV demand continues as cars are traded in or if they also experience the post-tax credit hangover new EVs already did in October. The Honda Prologue EV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s October 2025 sales fell 81% compared to a year earlier, according to Car and Driver. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor dealers, the elimination of the highly visible federal credit for new EVs could push more shoppers toward the used market in search of affordability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Edmunds stated in its report.\u00c2\u00a0 Teslas weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only hot-selling used EVs, though, as Hyundai Ioniq 5, Volkswagen ID. 4, Audi e-tron, Kia EV6, and Ford Mustang Mach-E all made the top 20 and took no more than 32.4 days to sell on average, below the 34-day average for all EVs in the report. Many of those EVs were among the best-selling models new in 2022. It also comes as all used cars sat on dealer lots longer than the same period in 2024. Buyers paid more for them amid greater economic uncertainty, and people increasingly look for used deals, with the average new car costing more than $50,000 this year. Edmunds noted that one of the reasons for EVs selling more quickly than other used cars has been because of the small inventory, stating only 1.6% of all used car inventory in the third quarter was made up of EVs. That makes sense because of the relative lack of models at the same time three years ago, but also indicates there should be more availability starting next year. A vast inventory of 2022 Model 3 and Model Ys has helped Tesla in similar quarterly reports, but affordability is another issue. Edmunds reported the average three-year-old Model 3 sold for $24,447, or more than $32,000 less than the original sticker price. The average 2022 Model Y sold for close to $28,000 compared to about $69,000 new. All EVs face steeper depreciation compared to equivalent gas or hybrid cars, but the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and VW ID. 4 retained about 47% of their value after three years, compared to about 40% for a Model Y. Tesla experienced growth in deliveries in 2023 before slowing in 2024. It already reacted to severe drops in international demand and predicted slowing sales in the US with cheaper and decontented Model 3 and Model Y Standard models last month, which were extremely poorly received by the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fans and critics.\u00c2\u00a0 That makes the performance of used Teslas next year, compared to rival models, even more telling of the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health with mainstream buyers.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"The team over at Consumer Reports is known for putting out reliable reviews on new cars, trucks, and SUVs. They've now announced a list of the best used cars for the month of November, selecting the vehicles based on depreciation and what makes them attractive to buyers. Consumer Reports broke down its report of the best used cars to buy into specific categories, such as the best sports cars under $20,000 and the best hybrid under $20,000. To help make your car-shopping experience as pain-free as possible, we've selected five of the best vehicles in the Consumer Reports list to share. The following five vehicles are surprisingly from just two manufacturers, Toyota and Mazda. Both brands receive impressive ratings from Consumer Reports regarding both new and used car reliability. What's even better is that the vehicles listed below all have an average used car price of under $20,000. Read on to find out what Consumer Reports believes the five best used cars to buy in November are. No, the Mazda CX-5 is not a car, but it's still one of the best SUVs under $15,000 to buy used this month, according to Consumer Reports. The Mazda CX-5 is one of the more fun-to-drive SUVs on the market, offering lithe handling and a 187-horsepower four-cylinder engine. Not only that, the compact SUV also had some of the best fuel economy estimates in the class, earning 24 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway. The CX-5's interior offers the driver and passengers alike comfortable seating on standard cloth upholstery. While the seats may be cloth, the steering wheel and shift knob have both been wrapped in leather. The CX-5 came standard with a 7-inch touch screen infotainment system, and a Bose audio system could be added in higher trims. The 2018 CX-5 also had numerous standard and optional safety features, including lane departure warning, lane keep assist, and an adaptive cruise control that features a stop and go function. While those are the highlights, there are still some things you should know before buying a new or used Mazda CX-5.\u00a0 Coming up next on our list is the 2016 Mazda6, which Consumer Reports says is the best used car under $10,000. Just like its larger sibling, the CX-5, the Mazda6 is a joy to drive and offers agile handling. The Mazda6 was also incredibly fuel-efficient for the time, earning a combined 32 mpg in testing done by Consumer Reports. The Mazda6's engine isn't the most powerful or exciting on the market, but it does offer 184 horsepower and a manual transmission. The interior of the Mazda6 is what you would expect from an affordable midsize car, with manually-adjustable cloth seats. In regard to the cabin, Mazda said in its press release that \"every detail related to texture and quality was polished to perfection, further lifting the level of quality in the interior.\" Unfortunately, the Mazda brand nixed the Mazda6 in 2021 and now the Mazda brand only sells one sedan, the Mazda3.\u00a0 The first non-Mazda, on this list of the best used cars to buy in November, is the 2019 Toyota Corolla. Consumer Reports calls it the best used car to buy that is under $15,000. This generation of Corolla began in 2014, with 2019 being the last year of production before another full redesign. The Corolla is one of the best-selling vehicles in history, having reached the 50-million mark in 2021. In its 12th generation, the Corolla has been a mainstay in the automotive market for more than 50 years. The 2019 Corolla was powered by a 168-horsepower four-cylinder engine that won't win many straight-line races. However, where it lacks in power, it makes up for in fuel economy, getting 36 mpg on the highway. The interior of the Corolla is classy and comfortable, featuring a touch screen infotainment system that's relatively simple to use. The Corolla also featured one of the most expansive lists of safety systems on the market, with lane keep assist, pedestrian detection, and lane departure warning all standard. SlashGear took the 2025 model for a spin, if you are considering a newer model.\u00a0 Next up on our list is Consumer Report's pick for the best used hybrid vehicle under $20,000. The winner for November is the 2019 Toyota Camry Hybrid, which has sold more than 300,000 units since the vehicle came to the market in 2006. The Camry Hybrid comes powered by either a four-cylinder engine mated to a lithium-ion battery that is capable of earning 47 mpg combined in city\/highway driving. This hybrid has a full-driving range of more than 600 miles when using the hybrid technology. The Toyota Camry Hybrid's interior features some hard plastics in lower trim levels, although the higher up in the lineup you go, the more luxurious the interior begins to be. The Camry Hybrid features an easy-to-use touch screen infotainment system, and all the safety features on the Corolla are also on the Camry Hybrid. Toyota seems to be sticking to the script on the 2025 Camry hybrid, as it remains affordable and economical.\u00a0 The final car on this list of the best used cars to buy in November is also the smallest, the 2020 Mazda MX-5 Miata. The Miata is proof that it is more fun to drive a slow car fast than it is to drive a fast car slow. Consumer Reports says that the 2020 Miata is the best used sports car under $20,000 to buy. Powered by a 181-horsepower four-cylinder engine and weighing just over 2,300 pounds, the Miata is a tiny car with a relatively not-so-tiny engine. Inside, the Miata's cabin can fit two people somewhat comfortably. The two-seat sports car doesn't offer a lot of interior space, especially in the hardtop convertible trim, due to the convertible top being stored in the trunk. The Miata is a convertible and can be had with a retractable soft top or a retractable hard top, the latter adds a bit of weight and actually slows the zero-to-60 time by a tenth of a second. For the newer iteration, SlashGear found the 2025 Mazda Miata to be nicely balanced performance wise, while also being economical.","label":0}

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jesse Tervooren, a 39-year-old former HR executive based in Vancouver, Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity. When I quit my $250,000 corporate HR job last year, I thought finding another job would be no big deal. I was out of touch with the reality of the job market. I hadn't applied to a job in a traditional way in over a decade because I'd always been recruited. Now that it's rounding up on a year of unemployment, I wish I could go back and shake myself. At the same time, my time away from work has finally allowed me to be a present mother and confront my strained relationship with money. I'm absolutely ready to go back to work, but I plan to make a few changes. I identified early on in my career that I was good at work, and I let productivity and achievement become my identity. There were many times, throughout my decadelong career in HR, when I tried to take a step back and be less intense, but I think I had an addiction to the dopamine that came from stress. When my daughter was born, my husband became her main caregiver, and I became the sole provider for our family. In 2023, I was promoted to director of people experience at a dental company. I loved the diversity of my job's responsibilities, the salary, and my team, so I stayed for months. The straw that broke the camel's back came when I was in direct opposition with my boss about something that made me realize I wasn't the right person for the job. I made a commitment to myself that I would never stay in a role where I was compromising my values. I didn't wake up that day thinking I was going to quit, but something about that day made me feel like I couldn't take it anymore. I had a little too much hubris, thinking it would be easy to find my next role, so I didn't start applying to jobs until January of this year. I was very out of touch with reality. As a healthcare recruiter, I saw an almost constant shortage of workers, so I thought it would be the same for the HR industry. From January to April, I applied for jobs, wrote personal cover letters, reached out to past coworkers, sent LinkedIn messages, and did everything I could to secure a new role, but it felt like all my applications went into the abyss. It was very humbling. I don't have any regrets and feel that everything worked out as it should, but I wish I had looked at the job market in my field and started applying sooner. I used to think I was the most present mother I could be. I'd stop working at five and put on a smile to play with my daughter, but I was still mentally going through everything I had done that day. I was available, but I wasn't present. Since quitting my job, I'm finally able to give my 6-year-old daughter what she needs: me fully immersed in her world, playing, being silly, and not just physically being next to her. Kids are intuitive, and I feel like she's noticed the difference. When I was earning a $250,000 salary, I'd cope with a stressful day by ordering something from Amazon, buying myself a little treat, or doing a Target run. I'd justify it by saying, \"It's just a sweater from Target, it's not a designer purse.\" I didn't realize that I was using money to distract myself from stress. Now that I don't have access to disposable funds, I've had to find other ways to deal with stress. I've gotten into coloring, painting, and even doing my own nail art. I'm not overly artistic or talented in any of these things, but they're cathartic and allow me the satisfaction of seeing something through to completion without pressure. I've also built a community of friends over this time. I go walking some mornings with a neighbor who has kids in the same school as mine. It's good for physical health, mental health, and connection. My time away helped me realize I'm so much more than how productive I am in a day and how much I can contribute to a company. Although it's nice and relaxing to stay home and color, I miss working. I miss feeling productive, like I've accomplished something that is tangible and in the service of others. I also miss the daily social connection that I had at work. I'm ready to work again and need to work again to provide for my family, but I guess I've become disenchanted with corporate America. I don't want to go back to an office, from 9-to-5, or have to send my daughter to day care instead of spending time with her. I'm not even seeking balance \u2014 just a job that won't systematically conflict with motherhood, mental health, and life. I may be idealistic, but I'm no longer willing to sell my soul for work.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"The arrival of cheap thermal printer mechanisms over the last few years has led to a burst of printer hacking in our community, and we\u2019re sure many of you will like us have one knocking around somewhere. There are a variety of different models on the market, and since they often appear in discount stores we frequently see new ones requiring their own reverse engineering effort. [Mel] has done some work on just such a model, the Core Innovation CTP-500, which can be found at Walmart. The write-up is a tale of Bluetooth reverse engineering as much as it is one about the device itself, as he sniffs the protocol it uses, and finds inspiration from the work of others on similar peripherals. The resulting Python app can be found in his GitHub repository, and includes a TK GUI for ease of use. We like this work and since there\u2019s an analogous printer from a European store sitting on the Hackaday bench as we write this, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll be giving it a very close look. Meanwhile if [Mel] sounds a little familiar it might be because of their print-in-place PCB holder we featured recently. I was looking as well at printers of this type to hack, but in the end I decided against starting another project that would most definitely end up in a drawer after I have taken the whole thing apart. Instead I took the more simple route of buying a thermal printer module on Aliexpress that had a TTL uart interface that accepted ESC\/POS commands, attached an ESP8266 board to it that effectively is just a telnet to uart bridge. I also added a mosfet module on the side that will power off the printer after a timeout or after the telnet connection ends. The beauty of it is that all of the additional electronics fits inside the enclosure of the printer quite neatly, and the only interface to the outside is a power barrel connector. Maybe not much of a hack, but it does the job that I need it to do. What\u2019s up elmesito! I absolutely relate to deciding against unfinished projects. For me, I knew sourcing all the components separately would be my doom, so I took a shot at ordering a finished product and make it do what I need to do. I\u2019m happy things worked out for the both of us in the end! Your build sounds great, I would love to see a picture if you have it documented somewhere! Thermal printers are great for printing small notes without wasting a whole sheet of paper. I use mine all the time. It\u2019s an old receipt printer, so all I had to do was plug it into the parallel port on my desktop and write a simple script using the python-escpos library so I can send text files and images to it. There are many such BLE thermal printers, a good number supported by my Thermal_Printer library (https:\/\/github.com\/bitbank2\/Thermal_Printer). I\u2019m not sure why this particular model is noteworthy \u2013 it costs more at Walmart than many products with the same physical characteristics available from other vendors. Hi Larry, Mel here! Going over my notes I can see that the Thermal_Printer library repository is in there, but it looks like I didn\u2019t use it. Maybe I tested it and it didn\u2019t work for some reason? Regardless, no doubt I learned a lot just from reading the notes in the repository. Thanks for putting this library back on my radar! Hi Larry! Going through my notes I can see your Thermal_Printer library repository is in there. I don\u2019t think I used it in the end \u2013 I think maybe I failed to get the printer to connect? \u2013 but looking at the code and your notes surely helped me think my way around this project. Thanks for putting it out there! There\u2019s nothing noteworthy about this device aside from being available at Walmart! And you\u2019re right re. price, which is why I bought it off Amazon since my local store couldn\u2019t price-match for me. Ultimately, I wanted to make something that would help people who just buy stuff from Walmart make the most of their little printer. If it helps at least one other person, I\u2019m a happy camper! sounds like a good justification :) A reminder that there are quite a few thermal papers with coatings that contain BPA or BPS that does absorb with skin contact. Thanks for the reminder Lord Binky! Good to know \u2013 I\u2019ll make sure to look for paper alternatives when I need to refill. This might be the model I have This would be great, the app sucks Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent. (Comment Policy) This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Apple is expected to announce a new HomePod mini imminently, headlining with new chips. Here are all of the new features we're expecting. The second-generation \u200cHomePod mini\u200c is highly likely to contain a more up-to-date chip for more advanced computational audio and improved responsiveness. The current \u200cHomePod mini\u200c is equipped with the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip from 2019. Apple is likely to opt for the S9 chip, which was a considerable leap forward in terms of performance, or one of its derivatives such as the S10, which is a more compact iteration of the S9.  The S5 chip in the \u200cHomePod mini\u200c is derived from Apple's A12 Bionic architecture but runs at lower clock speeds and is tuned for always-on, low-power operation, making it well-suited for tasks like Siri processing and real-time audio tuning. In contrast, the S9 and S10 chips are based on the A13 chip, offering higher CPU and GPU performance, a more advanced Neural Engine, and greater efficiency per watt.  The new \u200cHomePod mini\u200c will be equipped with the N1 Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, which is much faster and has lower latency compared to the current \u200cHomePod mini\u200c's Wi-Fi 4 connectivity. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router. Apple could also bring its second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to the \u200cHomePod mini\u200c for a more reliable and lower-latency Handoff experience. The chip debuted in 2023's iPhone 15 lineup. If present, the chip should allow far more precise spatial awareness than the current model, allowing it to detect the exact position and orientation of nearby devices within a few centimeters. New color options are also highly likely, but specific finishes are not yet known other than red, which was reportedly in testing. The current \u200cHomePod mini\u200c comes in Blue, Yellow, Midnight, Orange, and White.  Gurman says that, just like the next-generation Apple TV, the new \u200cHomePod mini\u200c \"will be built with Apple's new smart home ecosystem in mind.\" It is unclear if the next \u200cHomePod mini\u200c will have \u200cSiri\u200c improvements. Unlike Apple's long-rumored smart home hub product, the new \u200cHomePod mini\u200c is not expected to get Apple Intelligence support. Recently, Apple retailer B&H started listing all \u200cHomePod mini\u200c models as discontinued. Some other retailers are also listing the \u200cHomePod mini\u200c as out of stock or on backorder, which suggests that a refresh is set to take place soon. Gurman believes that a new \u200cHomePod mini\u200c \"shouldn't be far off\" amid tightening inventory and planned Apple Store refreshes.  Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":" BungieDestiny 2Marathon  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been almost four years since Sony acquired Bungie, the developers of Destiny 2 and the creators of Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship franchise Halo, for a whopping $3.6 billion. Now, as we approach the fourth anniversary of that transaction, it looks like Sony isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t satisfied with the monetary return, as the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CFO and Corporate Executive Officer, Lin Tao, revealed that Destiny 2 has not met the PlayStation maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations. In Sony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 earnings call (thanks, This Week in Video Games), Tao spoke about Destiny 2 and said that its sales and player engagement have \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot reached the expectations [Sony] had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tao said through an English translator. Destiny 2 is one side of Bungie\u2019s business right now, while the other is the upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, which has faced some middling reception during its testing phase. For now, Sony seems intent on releasing the game within this fiscal year, meaning sometime before March 2026. Marathon was indefinitely delayed earlier this year to address feedback, so it has no set launch date at this time. Bungie recently concluded another testing phase in October, and Tao says the company is in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cprocess of analyzing the performance against [its internal] KPIs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are fully dedicated to launching the title to schedule,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tao said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will assume that we will launch this within this (financial) year, and that is included in the forecast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While Destiny 2 might be struggling in Sony\u2019s eyes, Tao did say games like Helldivers 2 and MLB: The Show 25 have performed well, as far as the live-service section of the business goes. Ghost of Yotei has also sold 3.3 million copies since its launch last month, so PlayStation games are seeing some notable success in 2025. Bungie has been a big pillar of Sony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts at carving a space in the live-service games market, but the studio has been mired in controversy in the years since the acquisition. From canceled projects to widespread layoffs, Bungie has been publicly struggling for a few years now, and things are reportedly not great privately, either.

The West needs to see the bigger picture when it comes to the drone threat, a counter-drone tech company is warning. The number of potential targets is skyrocketing, going well beyond war. Matt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, told Business Insider that in the US alone, \"there's a lot of area to cover,\" from critical infrastructure and large gatherings to speaking events and landmarks. \"We definitely have to expand our thinking as far as the potential threats and how we guard against them,\" he said. The use of drones in Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2014 including massive bombardments that have struck civilian infrastructure as well as military sites \u2014 has alarmed the West, showing how future wars may be fought. And concerns are only growing, even outside active conflict, with more Russian and unidentified drones crossing into European airspace, flying near military bases, and disrupting civilian areas like airports. In the US, there have been hundreds of drone incursions over military sites. DroneShield, an Australian company with US operations, makes counter-drone tech that detects, tracks, and disrupts drones by jamming their radio links, and it's noticing a growing demand. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and a range of systems operating in Ukraine. McCrann said that week after week, there's rising \"alertness about drones and the threats that they pose\" to airports, critical infrastructure, energy and data centers, and sporting events. And awareness that drone defenses are inadequate is \"snowballing,\" he said. In Europe, where DroneShield is expanding, drones are becoming a serious problem. Incidents include Russian drones entering Polish airspace \u2014 prompting NATO F-16s and F-35s to respond \u2014 and repeated sightings near northern military bases. Some countries have seen airports repeatedly disrupted as drones fly nearby. McCrann said the concern is evident in incidents around large US sporting events. The NFL said that there were 2,537 reported unauthorized drone flights over games in 2022 and 2,845 in 2023. Many have resulted in disruptions. He said that \"there's at least a couple of games every couple of weeks or so where there's a high-profile drone flying over a stadium of 70,000 people and nobody knows the source of that drone or its intent.\" There hasn't been a major incident yet, McCrann said, but it might only take one drone with bad intent to make the danger clear. Hopefully, that doesn't happen, he said, but drone tech has already collided with helicopters, forced down emergency aircraft, and grounded planes for hours at airports. In many cases, it takes a serious wake-up call to really generate investment, he said, but people are recognizing the risk and urgency, with budgets increasingly aligning more closely with policies and technological capability. In Ukraine, where the Russians often launch hundreds of drones in a single night, apartment buildings, energy facilities, schools, hospitals, and public spaces are regularly hit thousands of miles from the front-line fighting. It's a massive problem \u2014 not only stopping the drones but also the cost imbalance. A single interceptor for a US-made Patriot air-defense system costs about $4 million, while attack drones can cost only thousands. That's forcing Ukraine to innovate. NATO has concluded that it has underinvested for decades in ground-based air defenses to stop missiles and drones. It now sees the need for cheaper, faster-to-deploy defenses, but efforts to drive development have only recently gained momentum. Adm. Pierre Vandier, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, who oversees modernization efforts, told Business Insider previously that NATO is building a \"Walmart\" of cheap counter-drone systems. \"We need to find a mass versus mass solution,\" he said. \"We are working on that, and the goal I've given to my team is a cost-efficient solution in order to match the threat.\" The drone threat was growing even before Russia's invasion. Iran and its proxies used drones against Saudi oil fields, and drones have been used in assassinations, including by the US military, and in disruptions at airports and bases. But now, particularly with the war in Ukraine, drone technology is being used more than in any conflict in history, their numbers, technology, and inventive use creating a new level of risk. Ukraine's Operation Spiderweb, which snuck drones deep into Russia and unleashed swarms of them to set aircraft on fire, showed that large-scale attacks can originate from unexpected places. Ukraine, through necessity, has had to pioneer cheaper ways to stop enemy drones, including building interceptor drones \u2014 drones designed to stop and destroy other drones. McCrann called Ukraine \"a big part\" of ongoing innovation in the sector. Western militaries were investing in this space but are now pursuing it more aggressively. McCrann said \"the emphasis and the urgency coming out of Europe and NATO allies\" has been reflected in soaring demand. For DroneShield, the US has long made up 70 to 80% of its business, but now \"we are seeing Europe as basically as large of a potential market or addressable market for us as the US, or at least close.\" The company is still investing heavily in the US, doubling its workforce there. As \"much success as we've had here, we've just scratched the surface of meeting the demand,\" he said. That's been playing out over the past six months to a year. McCrann said the thousands of systems DroneShield has put in Ukraine have given them data and feedback \"on how to improve our systems and make them better.\" A NATO-Russia war wouldn't look much like the one in Ukraine, as NATO has far greater combat power, but when it comes to drones, the West's concerns go far beyond the battlefield. \"This threat is here to stay, and it moves very quickly,\" McCrann said. It evolves as fast as the creativity and ingenuity of the people experimenting with it on the front lines. He called that \"a scary thought,\" but as a company in the space, \"we have to realize that that is the reality and our solutions have to be different than what this industry was building five, 10 years ago when we first started.\" Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Despite the best efforts of modern medicine, Huntington\u2019s disease is a condition that still comes with a tragic prognosis. Primarily an inherited disease, its main symptoms concern degeneration of the brain, leading to issues with motor control, mood disturbance, with continued degradation eventually proving fatal. Researchers have recently made progress in finding a potential treatment for the disease. A new study has indicated that an innovative genetic therapy could hold promise for slowing the progression of the disease, greatly improving patient outcomes.  Huntington\u2019s disease stems from a mutation in the huntingtin gene, which is responsible for coding for the huntingtin protein. This gene contains a repeated sequence referred to as a trinucleotide repeat, where the same three DNA bases repeat multiple times. The repeat count varies between individuals, and can change from generation to generation due to genetic mutation. If the number of repeats becomes too long, the gene no longer codes for huntingtin protein, and produces mutant huntingtin protein instead. The mutated protein eventually leads to neural degeneration. This genetic basis is key to the heritability of Huntington\u2019s disease. If one parent carries a faulty gene, their children have a fifty percent chance of inheriting it and eventually developing the disease themselves. Over generations, the number of repeats can increase and lead to symptoms appearing at an earlier age. The new treatment relies on advanced genetic techniques to slow the disease in its tracks. It involves the use of a custom designed virus, which is inserted into the brain itself in specific key areas. It\u2019s a delicate surgical process that takes anywhere from 12 to 18 hours, using real-time scanning to ensure the viral payload is placed exactly where it needs to go. The virus carries a DNA sequence and delivers it to brain cells, which begin processing the DNA to produce small fragments of genetic material called microRNA. These fragments intercept the messenger RNA that is produced from the body\u2019s own DNA instructions, which is responsible for producing the mutant huntingtin protein which causes the degenerative disease. In this way, mutant huntingtin levels are reduced, drastically slowing the progression of the disease. The effects of the treatment are potentially game changing, with progression of the disease slowed by 75% in study patients. Results indicate that with effective treatment, the decline expected over one year would instead take a full four years. In more qualitative areas, some patients in the trial have managed to maintain the ability to walk at a point when they would typically be expected to require wheel chairs. In typical Huntington\u2019s cases, the onset occurs between 30 to 50 years old, with a life expectancy of just 15 to 20 years after diagnosis. The hope is that by delaying the progression of the disease, affected patients could have a greater quality of life for much longer, without suffering the worst impacts of the condition. The initial trial involved just twenty-nine patients, but results were promising. Data indicated consistent benefit to patients three years after the initial surgery. Crucially, the treatment isn\u2019t just slowing symptoms, but there is also evidence it helped to preserve brain tissue. Markers of neuronal death in spinal fluid, which would typically increase as Huntington\u2019s disease progresses, were actually lower than before treatment in study patients. The therapy isn\u2019t without complications. Beyond the complicated and highly invasive brain surgery required to get the virus where it needs to go, some patients developed inflammation from the virus causing some side effects like headaches and confusion. There\u2019s also the expense \u2014 advanced gene therapies don\u2019t come cheap. However, on the positive side, it\u2019s believed the treatment could potentially be a one-off matter, as the brain cells that produce the critical microRNA fragments are not replaced regularly like other more disposable cells in the body. While it\u2019s a new and radical treatment, pharmaceutical company UniQure has plans to bring it to market as soon as late 2026 in the US, with the European market to follow. It\u2019s not every day that scientists discover a new viable cure for a disease that has long proven fatal. However, through genetic techniques and a strong understanding of the causative factors of the disease, it appears scientists have made progress in tackling the spectre that is Huntington\u2019s disease. For the many thousands of patients grappling with the disease, and the many descendents who struggle with potentially having inherited the condition, news of a potential treatment is a very good thing indeed.

I'm a 17-year-old high school senior living just outside Los Angeles, and I'm gearing up to apply to more than 20 colleges over the next few months. I'm the founder of Voices Unmuted, an organization that teaches public speaking workshops to children internationally. I regularly compete in debates, host a podcast, co-authored a children's book, and have built a TikTok following of over 100,000 people. My student r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sounds impressive on paper, but the path to get here wasn't what you might expect. It has been years of narrowing my passions down so I can market myself as a specific student to colleges. When I started high school, I fell into what my college counselor, Steve Gardner, calls the \"impressiveness trap.\" I was trying to do everything to look perfect on college applications. I joined clubs I didn't enjoy to pursue leadership roles, volunteered wherever I could, and took classes that weren't my interest. I was spreading myself thin trying to be the stereotypical perfect applicant. I wanted to appear like the well-rounded student, only to realize that I was making no significant progress in my activities and feeling more drained than ever. Steve's first piece of advice shocked me: \"Drop all the unnecessary clubs and prioritize your sleep.\" The advice was life-changing. I reviewed my activities and decided to focus on my interest in public speaking, pursuing a major in political science. I wasn't even good at Speech & Debate club initially, but because I stuck with something I genuinely loved rather than trying to balance countless random activities, it rekindled the energy I had lost, and I rapidly improved. The simplicity of doing less actually helped me achieve more. What started as an interest in speaking naturally expanded. My organization, which began by helping just five elementary schoolers, has grown to serve over 250 families internationally. My TikTok account, which I started during the pandemic as a way to convince my mom to let me have social media, now reaches over 100,000 people. I eventually found myself on the national final stage at the NSDA National Speech and Debate Tournament. These weren't calculated moves to impress colleges; they were natural extensions of what I'm passionate about. The most important lesson I've learned is that when you focus on what you genuinely care about, it gives you energy. My organization, my podcast, and my TikTok content don't feel like work because they align with my core values. The stress of college applications affects my whole family. My mom is very involved, constantly sending me resources and videos about college selection. My family has high expectations about where I should apply, but their support has been crucial in my high school career. My mom and I have had numerous disagreements on which activities I should prioritize and which passions I should chase. She's wanted me to focus on my SATs rather than new public speaking projects, but I know her support has been crucial in helping me navigate this difficult process. The stress is real for all of us, but I remind myself that authenticity always beats perfection. I just wish I had started focusing on public speaking earlier, rather than trying to seem well-rounded. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"In 1945, Europe was ruined. Average incomes were 22 percent lower than the United States at the start of the war; by the end that gap had grown to 75 percent. These economies were different in kind, too. In 1950, for every farmer in America there were 2.7 manufacturing workers, compared to just 1.3 in Germany and 0.92 in France.11. From the GGDC 10-Sector Database. But rather than stay poorer, as one might have expected, Europe rapidly rebuilt itself. Not just did it reach its previous levels of development within nine years, it then blew past them. Even though the decades after the war saw some of the fastest growth in American history, Europe grew much faster. In thirty years after 1950, the core European economies grew so fast that consumption per capita tripled while their citizens worked 400 fewer hours per year.22. Bergeaud, Antonin, Gilbert Cette, and R\u00e9my Lecat. Productivity trends in advanced countries between 1890 and 2012, Review of Income and Wealth 62, no. 3 (2016): 420-444. Part of this growth was catch-up: converging on the frontier America had set for us. But part of it was pushing the technology frontier forward. By the end of the 1970s, Europe was mass-producing jet engines and nuclear power plants. This success was not an accident; it was \u2018constituted\u2019 through a set of common beliefs, proved principles, and appropriate practices that stimulated innovation.33. As in Friedrich Hayek\u2019s 1960 book, The Constitution of Liberty, we use \u2018constitution\u2019 to mean the basic principles and practices needed for innovation and prosperity to return to Europe, not a legal document. However around 1980, this unprecedented growth period ended. While the United States maintained a remarkably constant 2 percent growth rate in average income, the European core economies decelerated, slowly and then sharply. Since 1995, Europe\u2019s average annual growth has been just 1.1 percent; since 2004, it has been a mere 0.7 percent \u2013 all while the United States has continued on its steady track. By 2022 the relative gap in output per head has returned to where it was in 1970. Decades of convergence were surprisingly wiped out.44. All figures from \u201cThe Past, Present and Future of European Productivity\u201d, written by Antonin Bergeaud for the ECB Forum on Central Banking, July 2024. A long list of reports by European luminaries have diagnosed this decline. The 1988 Cecchini Report calculated the enormous \u2018cost of non-Europe\u2019; the 2004 Sapir Report identified Europe\u2019s \u2018disappointing\u2019 growth; and the contemporaneous Kok Report argued the EU was failing through lack of political will. In 2010, Mario Monti warned that the internal market was suffering from \u2018integration fatigue.\u2019  Last year, Enrico Letta found the European market critically fragmented, while Mario Draghi concluded that Europe\u2019s competitiveness had fallen so far it now required \u2018radical change\u2019 just to survive. Despite these warnings, the European Union\u2019s response to its decline has been weak where it needs to be strong, and active in the areas where it should be passive. The problem is not a lack of reports, but a system that refuses to prioritise. The continent faces two options. By the middle of this century, it could follow the path of Argentina: its enormous prosperity a distant memory; its welfare states bankrupt and its pensions unpayable; its politics stuck between extremes that mortgage the future to save themselves in the present; and its brightest gone for opportunities elsewhere. In fact, it would have an even worse hand than Argentina, as it has enemies keen to carve it up by force and a population that would be older than Argentina\u2019s is today. Or it could return to the dynamics of the trente glorieuses. Rather than aspire to be a museum-cum-retirement home, happy to leave the technological frontier to other countries, Europe could be the engine of a new industrial revolution. Europe was at the cutting edge of innovation in the lifetime of most Europeans alive today. It could again be a continent of builders, traders and inventors who seek opportunity in the world\u2019s second largest market. The European Union does not need a new treaty or powers. It just needs a single-minded focus on one goal: economic prosperity. This prosperity is necessary for its own sake and for all the other things we want Europe to be: a bulwark against Russian tyranny, a generous supporter in lifting the world out of poverty, and a champion against climate change.55. As Jean-Jacques Servan Schreiber observed in the 1960s, \u201cThe degree of autonomy, prosperity, and social justice that a country aspires to depends upon its growth rate. A society enjoying rapid growth is free to define its own form of civilization because it can establish its order of priorities. A stagnant society cannot really exercise the right of self-determination\u201d. See Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, The American Challenge (Penguin, 1969), p182. To achieve this prosperity, we need to return the Union back to its original intent, as a federal body dedicated to economic development through a common and free market. The neglect of that purpose has been overwhelming. The European Union currently pursues a long list of goals, including (as given by the Commissioner titles): promoting the \u2018European way of life,\u2019 \u2018health and animal welfare\u2019, \u2018environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy\u2019, \u2018intergenerational fairness, youth, culture and sport\u2019 or \u2018social rights and skills, quality jobs and preparedness\u2019. Meanwhile, the internal market has become so fragmented that, according to recent IMF analysis, internal trade barriers are equivalent to a 44 percent tariff on goods and 110 percent on services. And, as Mario Draghi famously pointed out, no European company worth over \u20ac100 billion was set up from scratch in the last 50 years; the continent that birthed the industrial revolution has wrecked its own ability to catch the digital one. These are not accidents of history; they are consequences of our choices. In recent decades, the Union and its Member States have confused regulation with progress and bureaucracy with integration. If the European Union keeps stagnating, our countries will not be able to maintain the things its citizens take for granted: unemployment benefits, free healthcare, lifelong pensions, and affordable education. Growth is necessary to pay for existing commitments, and fulfill the recent deluge of new ones. Stagnation is going to make the European welfare state a utopia of the past. This paper proposes a different path, one guided by pragmatism, not ideology. This requires a clear set of principles to focus the actions of the European Union on a few critical objectives and act decisively to achieve them. To understand how to correct its course, we must first examine how the EU lost its way. The European project began with a clear purpose. The 1950 Schuman Declaration proposed integrating the coal and steel industries \u2013 the raw inputs of war \u2013 to make conflict between France and Germany \u2018not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.\u2019 This approach, known as functional integration, was based on the proposition that when economies become interdependent through trade, war becomes prohibitively expensive.66. This was the prevalent view before 1914; Germany was integrated with the United Kingdom, and war still broke out. Many have argued that the insight is false. The Coal and Steel Community (1951) evolved into the Economic Community (1957), creating the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. The Single Market (1993) removed trade barriers between Member States. The Euro (1999) provided price stability across borders. Nations that shared a long history of violence were progressing towards what Robert Kagan called a \u2018post-historical paradise of peace and relative prosperity\u2019.77. Robert Kagan, Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order (Atlantic Books, 2003). But initial success led to mission creep. With peace secured, the European institutions began to look for new problems to solve. Jacques Delors, Commission President, captured Europe\u2019s principle of action in a famous metaphor: \u2018Europe is like a bicycle. It has to move forward. If it stops, it will fall over\u2019. This mantra \u2014 that integration must constantly increase or founder \u2014 converted the European peace project into a self-perpetuating regulatory flywheel. Legal scholars, practitioners, and policymakers transformed an untested vision into a grand narrative, \u2018integration through law\u2019.88. Robert Sch\u00fctze, \u2018Integration-through-Law\u2019: Grand Theory, Revisionist History, 4 Eur. L. Open 1 (2025). From the 1980s Europe began legislating on topics with little to no connection to economic integration or peace \u2013 the amount of fruit in marmalade, the conditions under which a piece of clothing could be considered sustainable, or what constitutes appropriate political advertisement. What started as functional integration \u2013 removing barriers to trade \u2013 morphed into the superstition of regulation for the sake of integration. Each new regulatory text justified the next, creating a governance culture where \u2018more Europe\u2019 became the answer to every question, regardless of whether European intervention added value. This regulatory overkill has culminated with the response to the digital and environmental challenge, which led to an avalanche of rules driven by the \u2018Brussels effect\u2019\u2014 the theory that pretends that writing legal rules sets global standards and thus gives European firms a competitive edge.99. Vagelis Papakonstantinou & Paul de Hert, The Regulation of Digital Technologies in the EU: Act-ification, GDPR Mimesis and EU Law Brutality at Play (Routledge, 2024). In practice, the Brussels effect has created high costs that harm European firms more than their global rivals. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), favors US tech giants which can shoulder the burden of massive compliance costs but undermines European startups. A recent study shows that GDPR reduced European Union technology venture investment by 26 percent relative to the US.1010. Jian Jia, Ginger Zhe Jin & Liad Wagman, The Short-Run Effects of the General Data Protection Regulation on Technology Venture Investment, 40 Marketing Sci. 661 (2021). See also Jian Jia, Ginger Zhe Jin, Mario Leccese & Liad Wagman, How Does Privacy Regulation Affect Transatlantic Venture Investment? Evidence from GDPR, NBER Working Paper No. 33909 (June 2025). The AI Act follows the same logic, imposing technical requirements for market access on an emerging technology before Europe has even created one major AI company. These rules raise the cost of innovation and slow the dissemination of digital technology across the European Union. The regulatory bicycle is pedaling at full speed. But it is pedaling towards a wall of bureaucracy created by its own policies. Europe must do less, but do it better. Prosperity through economic integration should again be central to the Union. In practice this will mean two things. First, the Union must simply focus on the exclusive competencies its architects gave it, which are already orientated towards prosperity. These include the customs union; the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market; monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro; and a common commercial policy.1111. As defined in Article 3(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 3(1) also lists the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy as an exclusive competence. Second, it must work with the Member States to complete the internal market. The internal market has only one definition: the free movement of goods, services, capital, and workers. It is against these standards that it should be judged, exclusively and fully. Every other issue of political expediency \u2013 from the energy use of household appliances to the length of the work week \u2013 is not an internal market issue, despite what has been said to justify further legislation.1212. Marija Bartl, Internal Market Rationality, Private Law and the Direction of the Union: Resuscitating the Market as the Object of the Political, 21 Eur. L.J. 572 (2015), arguing that \u201cThe clear-cut \u2018added value\u2019 of the EU in building the internal market gives an incentive to the EU institutions to translate various social problems into internal market language, bringing them thus into the normative and cognitive domain of the internal market\u201d. While many of these issues are important, the Union provides for their regulation through Member States at the central, regional and local levels under the subsidiarity principle.1313. See Article 5(3) of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU). This is not a repudiation of social concerns. Only a prosperous Europe can fund the welfare state. As Article 2 of the Rome Treaty of 1957 already spelled out, the internal market constitutes the foundation for improvements in standards of living: The treaties that have shaped the European Union provide the solutions that we need. Yet, today, the core business of Europe, the internal market, is a fiction. The European Commission, which should be its referee, has stopped calling fouls. Infringement cases are down 75 percent from a decade ago. And the time needed to resolve them has dramatically increased.1414. Ian Johnston, \u201cPolicing of EU Market Rules Drops Under von der Leyen\u2019s Commission\u201d, Fin. Times (May 8, 2023), https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/b81c0d86-4837-42a5-bf01-d4768791f2cf. The European Union needs to stop wading into new policy areas like housing or animal welfare and get serious about enforcing basic internal market rules. This is a question of will and of prioritization, not capacity. To face the great transformation ahead, Europe needs both an innovation system and creative destruction. We lack in both areas, but we are particularly weak in creative destruction. The ECB has pointed out repeatedly that Europe\u2019s failure to kill zombie firms crowds out credit for healthy firms.1515. Dan Andrews and Filippos Petroulakis, Breaking the shackles: Zombie firms, weak banks and depressed restructuring in Europe, ECB WP Series, February 2019. We must stop defending legacy assets and build a system that accepts both market entry and exit as the basic conditions for innovation. This requires a firm commitment to economic dynamism. It means we must actively seek and eliminate barriers to entry that favor incumbents, such as special rights, subsidies, or skewed regulations from banking to telcos, from energy to agriculture. We must support market exit through streamlined bankruptcy laws and flexible labor rules. Market exit is not failure; it is how we reallocate assets, people, and resources from old businesses to new ideas. This entire system must be built on a foundation that allows entrepreneurs and inventors to reap the rewards of their success, supported by secure property rights, deep financial markets, and unwavering legal certainty for risk-takers. Some risks require prudence. But currently, Europe\u2019s risk paranoia is killing its future. Our generalized precautionary approach disincentivizes the bold bets that lead to breakthroughs, from AI or genetic engineering to venture capital. Innovation requires risk-taking. We should enable it, not regulate it out of existence. Ukraine provides an extraordinary example of this vision. It is much poorer than any EU Member State but it has rapidly and affordably fielded military capabilities none of them have, in large part because it has trusted and enabled its citizens\u2019 ingenuity. If Ukraine is still standing today, it is because of the resilience of its people, but also thanks to the efforts of its hundreds of \u2018tinkerers, tweakers, and implementers\u2019 in building, testing, and deploying new ideas, especially with drones.1616. In The Gifts of Athena: Historical Origins of the Knowledge Economy (Princeton University Press, 2002), cited by the Nobel Memorial Prize committee, Mokyr famously refers to the crucial work of \u2018tinkerers,\u2019 \u2018tweakers\u2019 or \u2018implementers\u2019 in launching Europe into the industrial revolution. Ukrainian Border Guard Servicemen with DJI Mavic Drones. Photo by ArmyInform. Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). Europe led the industrial revolution in part thanks to its political diversity: competition among states drove societies to seek and reward the best talent and innovators. Variation is a strength. What works for five countries may not work for twenty-seven. Instead of forcing uniformity, we should embrace \u2018variable geometry\u2019, that is, letting groups of willing countries cooperate more deeply on shared goals. Committing to diversity requires genuine mutual recognition. If a product is safe enough to be sold in Lisbon, it should be safe enough for Berlin. We should not burden traders with the task of removing local barriers to trade through judicial remedies in the target country, let alone expect them to do so. Stephen Weatherill has shown that a pure mutual recognition model does not exist in the  European Union. Instead, the European Union has a model of non-absolute or conditional mutual recognition. European Union law in reality allows Member States freedom to restrict imports of goods and services and only forces them to demonstrate why imports are not good enough for the home market under a specific procedure. Traders are therefore subject to \u2018an unstable litigation-driven trading environment of inter-State regulatory diversity\u2019.1717. Stephen Weatherill, The Principle of Mutual Recognition: It Doesn\u2019t Work Because It Doesn\u2019t Exist, Eur. L. Rev. (forthcoming), Oxford Legal Studies Research Paper No. 43\/2017, available at https:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2998943. The business of business is business, not litigation. A genuine model of mutual recognition lets different approaches compete to find what works best and removes egregious obstacles to trade through swift judicial redress at the European level. We must create simple and clear rules that free competition instead of centrally planning our economy by regulatory fiat. Europe\u2019s frenzy of regulation has been predicated on the existence of free lunches. For instance, climate laws have been sold as leading to job creation and innovation (the \u2018green deal for jobs\u2019) not just as the solution to climate change. Citizens were asked to swallow make-believe propositions, like the idea that fighting global warming would be free of economic cost. Similar Nirvana fallacies have been observed in other domains, like migration, trade policy or digital regulation.1818. Where, as said above, the benefits of data privacy are championed without acknowledging the immense compliance costs imposed on startups. Honest policymaking requires accepting that goals often conflict. A decision to prioritize one objective, whether environmental protection or data privacy, generates a cost somewhere else \u2013 often competitiveness and innovation. We must acknowledge and face these trade-offs. This does not mean that we should give up on the dream of political integration. But our inability to generate prosperity cost us the support needed to achieve it. In order to achieve everything else, our proposal is that the  European Union concentrate on its core function \u2013 prosperity \u2013 for the foreseeable future. Other projects are and should still be possible, but, to quote Mario Draghi, they \u201cwould be built through coalitions of willing people around shared strategic interests, recognizing that the diverse strengths that exist in Europe do not require all countries to advance at the same pace.\u201d1919. Mario Draghi after receiving the Princess of Asturias Prize in Spain, on October 24, 2025. https:\/\/thediplomatinspain.com\/en\/2025\/10\/24\/draghi-defends-a-pragmatic-federalism-for-europe-to-counteract-the-slowness-of-eu-decision-making The European Union has 450 million citizens. They are educated, tolerant, and committed to freedom and democracy. The continent is rich, and, for now, large. This is not a weak starting position. But the Union has become reactive, trapped by crises and caught on the back foot by events, busy protecting what it is instead of thinking about what ought to be. A renaissance is possible. A much better Europe is feasible if it stops building walls of regulation, lets innovation happen, and focuses on prosperity above all else. It must trust its people and let them build. We can take six practical steps now to reorient Europe towards prosperity. At a minimum, we must: enforce the internal market rules, stop directives from fragmenting it in the name of \u2018harmonization\u2019, facilitate the growth of entrepreneurial firms, focus the union on its priorities and limit the excessive flow of legislation without regard to cost. In 1979, the European Court of Justice ruled in the Cassis de Dijon case that goods lawfully produced and marketed in one Member State must flow freely to all others. The principle of mutual recognition was born. Unless there is a general public interest at stake, Member States cannot enforce their own domestic laws to bar imported goods. While mutual recognition should have delivered an internal market, forty-five years later, businesses must still comply with a maze of national barriers. France imposes unique carbon tests on imported diesel. German L\u00e4nder require separate fire safety certifications for construction materials already approved elsewhere in the European Union. Spain blocks food with compliant labels. Denmark banned cereals sold safely everywhere else in the European Union. Varying national recycling logo requirements for paint create needless complexity for products that already conform to European Union standards, forcing manufacturers to maintain separate inventories for each country. The solution is to abandon directives entirely.2020. Where this is possible. In some areas, directives are required by the Treaty. Letta offered to deprioritize directives relative to regulations. Our proposal is more drastic. We want a moratorium on the usage of directives. Note that the European institutions should also avoid fake regulations that work de facto as directives, maintaining lots of room for MS to introduce national implementations. These legal instruments betray their harmonizing purpose. Too often, Member States shirk on their duty to transpose directives. Worse, the abstract, broad, and general language of directives gives Member States opportunities to add local requirements.2121. In any case, with directives based on minimum harmonization - which set a baseline standard but permit Member States to impose stricter national regulations. Their usage must be reduced. Businesses end up facing 27 different versions of supposedly \u2018common\u2019 rules. European Union lawmakers have tried to mitigate this problem by issuing increasingly prescriptive directives. The result is that directives today often reach the same level of detail as regulations. However, directives do not enjoy equivalent direct applicability in court.2222. While Article 288 TFEU distinguishes between the direct applicability of Regulations and the transposition requirement for Directives, the practical distinction has blurred over time. They must still be transposed. A better state of affairs would be achieved if regulations were to become the default, allowing traders to benefit from their unconditional applicability in litigation.2323. Regulations are additionally useful because once adopted, they foreclose Member States\u2019 ability to raise public interest exceptions that limit mutual recognition, with the important exception of Article 4(2) TFEU that maintains full MS competence over \u2018national security.\u2019 Denmark blocked Kellogg\u2019s cereals after having been condemned by the EU courts because the judgment allowed it to do it on public health grounds. See the judgment in Case C-62\/01, European Commission v. Denmark, ECLI:EU:C:2003:492 (Sept. 23, 2003). The internal market\u2019s main weakness is enforcement. When Italian regulations illegally block a French trader, that company faces only bad options. It can file a complaint with the Commission and wait years for action that may never come; sue before Italian courts only slightly familiar with European Union law; operate illegally and hope to reach the European Court of Justice through proceedings brought against it; or simply give up. Under that model, effective mutual recognition is a pipe dream.2424. Stephen Weatherill, supra note 17. The issue is this: inter-state barriers to trade can only be taken down through administrative and judicial enforcement. The unlikely prospect that traders will commit time and money to complaints and litigation leaves Member States essentially free to regulate domestic markets. We propose that the European Union create Specialized Commercial Courts with exclusive jurisdiction over internal market violations by Member States. This structure fits well with treaty law which allows for specialized tribunals attached to the General Court to hear proceedings in specific areas.2525. Article 19 TEU permits \u2018specialised courts\u2019, and Article 257 TFEU says that they can be established by a Regulation (under the ordinary legislative procedure) as \u2018chambers\u2019 attached to the General Court. It is notable that a past judicial reform eliminated the only special tribunal which was constituted (the Civil Service Tribunal) to double the number of \u2019generalist\u2019 judges in the General Court, plausibly to safeguard the power of the Court of Justice which feared becoming only a constitutional court and losing the appeals on points of law in an increasing array of specialized areas. The system foreseen in the Treaty is preferable and more efficient. The resources allocated today to the General Court could be more effectively deployed to secure specialization in key areas of EU law.  Specialized Commercial Courts would have many benefits, including legitimacy, expertise and speed. This is crucial. Any business facing discriminatory or non-discriminatory trade barriers could bring proceedings directly under English-language procedures. Decisions would be handed down within 180 days. The Specialized Commercial Courts would issue European Union-wide injunctions, award damages for lost profits, and their rulings would bind all Member States \u2013 when one country\u2019s licensing requirement falls, similar requirements elsewhere become unenforceable. Judgments from the Specialized Commercial Courts would be subject to appeal to the General Court only on points of law, and without subjugation to other policy goals.2626. According to paragraph 3 of Article 257 TFEU, \u201cDecisions given by specialised courts may be subject to a right of appeal on points of law only or, when provided for in the regulation establishing the specialised court, a right of appeal also on matters of fact, before the General Court\u201d. The entire system \u2013 five regional courts plus a limited appeal on points of law to the General Court \u2013 would cost less than what Europe loses due to trade barriers in a single week. European and national laws do not suspend each other. They add up. This means that traders face a regulatory thicket, which only gets denser as more national, regional, and local regulations are introduced. Right now, banks answer to European supervisors, national central banks, and local regulators simultaneously. According to the Draghi report, there are over 270 digital regulators in the European Union, each interpreting \u201ccommon\u201d rules individually. The solution is that when the European Union regulates in areas of exclusive competence and internal market legislation, all national, regional, or local rules in that specific area cease to apply. This is the so-called automatic field preemption. This is not a proposal for an imperial European Union with centralized powers. As said before, there ought to be a drastic narrowing of the spectrum of areas governed by European Union law. The European Union should focus only on core economic functions. But when Brussels acts within its exclusive competences, or for the internal market strictly understood, the result must be true unification. The idea of a 28th regime \u2013 versions of which have been proposed by both the Letta and Draghi reports \u2013 is to give up on harmonizing 27 different corporate systems, which often accords to the lowest common denominator, and instead create an outside option for firms. In practice, Portugal would not need to adopt German corporate law or vice versa, as there would be a European alternative that companies can embrace if it serves them better. Several 28th regimes for business have been tried, and every single one failed.2727. Amongst those tried: the European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), Societas Europaea (SE), Societas Cooperativa Europaea (SCE) and Societas Unius Personae (SUP). On the SCE, specifically, 18 years since the entry into force of the founding Regulation, there were only 113 registered in 30 EU\/EEA countries, of which 75 were active. See Report on Council Regulation (EC) No. 1435\/2003 of 22 July 2003 - Statute for a European Cooperative Society (SCE). To see what can go wrong, consider the European Company (Societas Europaea, SE). Introduced in 2004 the SE has been a complete failure. Amongst 23 million corporations registered in the European Union, only between 3,000 and 5,000 are registered as European SEs. Most of them are large firms. Why? First, the statutory conditions for the formation of SEs require businesses to incur high set-up costs and follow time-consuming and complex procedures for incorporation. This has tended to favor large firms.2828. Joelle Simon, Conference on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (Brussels, May 26, 2010). Moreover, the law embodied a high number of referrals to national law and burdens in terms of employee participation.2929. The SE Regulation is, by its own text, an \u2018indissociable complement\u2019 to Council Directive 2001\/86\/EC, which governs the involvement of employees in the SE. The Directive mandates a complex and potentially protracted negotiation process before an SE can be legally formed. The management of the founding companies must convene a Special Negotiating Body (SNB), composed of employee representatives from all affected Member States, to negotiate an agreement on future information, consultation, and (where applicable) board-level participation rights within the new SE. This process is time-consuming, legally complex, and costly, creating a significant procedural barrier and a high degree of uncertainty at the very outset of a company\u2019s formation. For a fast-moving startup or a resource-constrained SME, such a mandatory, open-ended negotiation is a powerful disincentive.  Furthermore, the Directive is built on the \u201cbefore and after\u201d principle, which aims to ensure that the creation of an SE does not lead to a reduction in existing employee involvement rights.  This forced companies and investors to navigate a complex web of rules: the SE Regulation, the national laws implementing the SE, the underlying national company law, and the company\u2019s own statutes. This self-inflicted flaw stripped the SE of its core utility: giving small and medium-sized firms scale through simple and swift pan-European incorporation.3030. Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the Application of Council Regulation 2157\/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE), COM (2010) 676 final (Nov. 17, 2010). As the discussion in Europe stands right now, this is the most likely fate of this new proposal. A leak on the European Commission work program for 2026 says the proposal will take the form of a directive to implement this regime, which means that, sometime in the future, after years of national debates on its transposition, each country will have its own 28th regime. It is essential that this time the European Union gets it right and creates a regime that is truly comprehensive and appealing for businesses that want to scale up across Europe, and for venture capital that wants to invest, and crucially, exit, in Europe. The US demonstrated the power of this solution when it allowed companies to bypass state securities laws by being regulated at the federal level \u2013 late-stage firms became four times more likely to attract out-of-state investors.3131. Michael Ewens & Joan Farre-Mensa, The Deregulation of the Private Equity Markets and the Decline in IPOs, 33 Rev. Fin. Stud.  5463 (2020). The European Union could achieve similar results by letting businesses opt into European rules rather than forcing all Member States to abandon their national systems. This would also go some way towards unifying capital markets. Countries that wish to maintain their legal traditions can keep them. Businesses seeking European scale can bypass them. Competition between the 28th regime and national systems would reveal which rules promote economic efficiency and which ones protect incumbent\u2019s rents. The 28th regime needs to be a fully supranational (e.g. with no appeal to national laws) set of rules such that companies voluntarily prefer it.3232. See the European Parliament\u2019s July 2025 report \u201cThe Scope of the 28th Regime\u201d  for a discussion of all the options available. https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/RegData\/etudes\/IDAN\/2025\/776311\/IUST_IDA(2025)776311_EN.pdf Incorporation, as well as the entire legal life cycle from formation to dissolution, should be fully digital. To avoid the fate of the European SE it should contain provisions on employee involvement. Of course, that does not exclude the company from being subject to the mandatory public policy laws of the Member States in which it operates. These companies should fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the new Specialized Commercial Courts. The contents of the regime should be to govern the internal affairs of corporations (corporate governance, conflicts of interest, fiduciary duties, shareholder rights, and capital structure) and leave maximum freedom for company specific procedures. Statutory requirements, formalities, and involvement of intermediaries should be kept to a bare minimum. It is an arresting fact that much of the European Union\u2019s expansion has taken place in areas where existing institutions already operate. Fundamental rights is the obvious example. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), also known as the Strasbourg Court, is an international court of the Council of Europe, which has countries such as the UK or Switzerland as members. Instead of joining this long-standing system, the European Union built its own. It justifies this duplication by insisting on the idea of an \u2018autonomous legal order\u2019 \u2013 a self-contained legal system. This doctrine is often invoked as a pretext to set up redundant, European Union-specific institutions and rules. In the case of fundamental rights, this approach is not just poor practice; it arguably violates the European Union\u2019s own law. Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union requires the Union to join the Strasbourg Court\u2019s system, not compete with it.3333. Nicolas Petit & Jo\u00eblle Pilorge-Vrancken, Avis 2\/13 de la CJUE: L\u2019Obsession du Contr\u00f4le?, Rev. Aff. Eur. 731 (2015). Now, a worthwhile policy would consist of systematically determining which other existing institutions the European Union could use to discharge some of its core missions. For example, it would intuitively make sense for the jurisdiction of the Unified Patent Court to be expanded to also hear European Union trademark or copyright disputes. Once adopted, European Union law becomes eternal law. It cannot be written off, even if wrong. Of course, most, if not all, European Union regulations or directives contain a review clause. Many temporary law and policy programs have become permanent. New regulatory structures entrench interests and are hard to dismantle. National regulatory authorities (NRAs) in network industries like telecoms illustrate this problem. Created to open monopolistic markets, they were supposed to hand over their powers to national competition authorities (NCAs) following liberalization. Decades later, the European Union has both NRAs and NCAs, adding compliance costs to industries no longer in need of market opening reforms. To solve this, review clauses should be replaced with sunset clauses. Unless evidence shows a persistent market failure requiring maintenance or reform of a regulation or directive, the presumption should be that once a set period has elapsed, the instrument is no longer useful. Combined with rigorous impact assessment and productivity boards, sunset clauses would create natural pressure toward regulatory efficiency. Moreover, the European Union fails at submitting new rules to a rigorous analysis of their costs and benefits. The Commission does have the duty to run an initial cost and benefits analysis of draft legislation. However, the Parliament and the Council, when they rewrite the law, often in private meetings (called \u2018Trilogues\u2019), are not required to check the costs and benefits of their own changes. This loophole leads to duplicative and often inconsistent legislation. Political deals get made without anyone knowing their true cost. This allows politicians to avoid confronting the cost that new rules imposed on citizens and businesses. To fix this, we need to make cost-benefit analysis (in European Union parlance \u2018Impact Assessment\u2019) an integral part of the entire process. First, the Parliament and the Council must each set up their own independent teams of experts to assess the impact of new laws. Second, a new rule must require them to use these teams. Whenever a change is proposed to a law that alters its purpose, key terms, or costs, the team must produce a short, public report on the effects. This report must be available before a final deal is made, so that everyone is working with up-to-date information. This last change can deliver two benefits. Laws that state their costs and benefits strengthen democracy: voters and representatives can judge the trade-offs. Laws that face their economic impacts improve competitiveness: legislators must prove their rules do more good than harm. If this slows the machinery that produced 13,000 legal acts between 2019 and 2024, so much the better. For Europe, growth is existential. It is the precondition for every other political goal we may have, including our very survival. For too long, it has been traded off for other priorities, even though those priorities cannot exist without growth. In trying to do everything, we have hindered innovation, investment, and prosperity. Fortunately, European institutions have a long track record of growth. They did it once, in the three decades after the Second World War. They did it again in Eastern Europe, in the last three decades. Poland entered the millennium at 47 percent of the European Union average income and today stands at 93 percent. Romania climbed from 37 percent to 83 percent. Lithuania surged from 39 percent to 96 percent. Few institutions can lay claim to not one but two of the great growth miracles in the past century. But neither was achieved through the competencies that have been layered on in the last twenty five years. They were products of economic integration and solid European institutions. The European Union must learn from its own successes, and loosen the chains that hold it back from prosperity. The constitution of innovation we propose offers a different path, built on limited objectives, clear rules, and strong enforcement. This constitution does not require a new treaty. It requires will. The Constitution of Innovation was shaped through interactions with diverse individuals and groups, particularly at the events that took place at the European University Institute (EUI) on Delivering Draghi on 05-06 May 2025 and at the Fundaci\u00f3n del Pino Workshop \u2018Hablemos Instituciones\u2019 on 25 September 2025.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"     Copyright is one of the most important legal issues in the age of AI, and it affects all of us.    Copyright is one of the most important legal issues for generative AI. You might not think about copyright very often, but we are all copyright owners and authors. In the age of generative AI, copyright has quickly become one of the most important issues in the development and outputs of chatbots, image and video generators.\u00a0 Sadly, copyright and AI are something of a mess. The race to develop the most advanced AI models shows no sign of slowing anytime soon. In order to create those next-gen models, tech companies are looking for a lot of high-quality, human-generated content. They need these works to make their AI models better, whether that's giving a chatbot a more lifelike personality or an image generator more artistic styles to reference. On the flip side, AI enthusiasts might be wondering if it's possible to receive copyright protection for AI-enabled creative works. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.\u00a0Add CNET\u00a0as a preferred Google source. Most AI companies have been very vague about what content they use, which has led to more than 30-plus lawsuits winding their way through US courts. You might have heard of some of the most notable, like\u00a0The New York Times v. OpenAI, in which the publisher alleges that ChatGPT used reporters' stories verbatim without proper attribution or permission. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\u00a0 I spend a lot of time thinking about copyright and AI in my work reporting on AI creative services. I've interviewed intellectual property lawyers, spoken with many concerned creators, and spent way too much time breaking down legalese from government agencies. I've used that experience to make this guide on what you need to know about copyright in the age of AI, which we'll keep updating as things change. Copyright is a set of expressed rights that protect \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated,\" according to the Copyright Act of 1976.\u00a0 In other words, copyright is a legal protection that gives original authors the rights to and control over their original works. Copyright protection can apply to books, art, music, movies, computer programs, blogs, architectural designs, plays, choreography and more. We're all copyright owners. As the US Copyright Office puts it: \"Once you create an original work and fix it, like taking a photograph, writing a poem or blog or recording a new song, you are the author and the owner.\"\u00a0 There are a couple of ways copyright intersects with AI. On the output side, people who use AI services like chatbots and image generators want to know whether their AI-enabled work is eligible for copyright protection. On the development side, there are a lot of concerns about AI companies using copyrighted material illegally. Here's what we know so far. As with many legal questions, the answer is: It depends. Our guidance on this question comes primarily from the US Copyright Office, the federal agency in charge of administering copyrights. The Office has released a series of reports on AI and copyright with its latest guidance. In the second report, the Office maintained its position that images and videos that are entirely generated by AI are not eligible for copyright protection. However, there are a number of generative AI editing tools now available. These tools aren't used for wholesale creation, but they use AI to do things like add or remove objects, de-age actors or refine audio and video. You can still register and potentially receive copyright protection for AI-edited content, but you have to disclose your AI use. In the public record portal, you can see in the notes how people used AI in the creation of their copyrighted work. In rare cases, you can receive copyright protection for work that is entirely AI-generated, but you have to prove that your input or creative manipulation of those AI-generated elements rises to the level of protection. Here's how one company managed to do that. The basic premise in copyright law is that the rights holder -- usually the original creator, sometimes in other cases it can be a person's employer -- can decide how they want their works used. In many cases, owners choose to license their content; this lets people use copyrighted work, for a fee, with proper attribution. So, if a copyright owner wants to give an AI company permission to use their content to train AI models, there's nothing wrong or illegal about that. Many publishers, including the Financial Times and Axel Springer brands, have struck multimillion-dollar deals with AI companies to do just that. Issues arise when AI companies potentially use copyrighted content without first receiving permission from the copyright holders. And that's what creators are alleging happened in many lawsuits, including a class-action lawsuit led by concept artist Karla Ortiz against Stability AI. There are currently more than 30 active lawsuits between AI companies and creators over copyright concerns. Decades of copyright law precedent say that such a use, without permission, is not allowed. Some of the creators are alleging that the tech companies infringed on their copyrights. Infringement occurs when a copyrighted work is \"reproduced, distributed, performed, publicly displayed, or made into a derivative work\" without the permission of the copyright holder, as the Copyright Office defines it.\u00a0 It will be up to the courts to decide whether the use of copyrighted material in AI development reaches the threshold of infringement. In the meantime, many tech companies are trying to pursue an alternate solution: A fair use exception. The fair use doctrine is a fundamental part of copyright law, part of the Copyright Act of 1976. Fair use lets people use copyrighted content without the holder's express permission for specific purposes. In the pre-AI era, fair-use cases included a teacher using a copyrighted book for educational purposes or a reporter referencing copyrighted work in news coverage. There are four factors that help determine whether someone's use can qualify as a fair use, including: The purpose of the use: How would the person using copyrighted material be using it? Commercial interests -- whether someone can make money off the use -- are important here. The nature of the copyrighted work: What is the actual format of the disputed work -- is it factual like a newspaper article or highly creative like artwork? The amount and substantiality of the use: How much of a copyrighted work does someone want to use? Even if it's only a little bit, if it's the \"heart of the work,\" that might not be eligible for a fair use defense. The effect on the market: By using a copyrighted work in a proposed way, is that going to be competing with the original author? And what effect will that have on the greater market? There are questions about every factor when it comes to fair use and AI, said Christian Mammen, an intellectual property lawyer and San Francisco office managing partner at Womble Bond Dickinson. There's also a debate about whether the fair use factors apply to the AI input, output or both.\u00a0 \"Does that apply on the input side, where you take the whole work in this training data, or does it apply on the output side, where there may be an unrecognizable, tiny bit of influence by any particular work in the output?\" Mammen said.\u00a0 Tech companies are pushing hard for a fair use exception because it would allow them to use copyrighted content without contacting every rights holder and paying licensing fees. For companies like OpenAI and Google -- which have already spent billions of dollars on development -- a fair use exception would save considerable time and money.\u00a0 Google said that fair use would allow it to continue innovating quickly; OpenAI took a parallel approach and said that unimpeded AI innovation is a matter of national security. The Copyright Office\u00a0essentially punted on the issue of fair use, saying in its third report that there could be cases where a fair-use case could be made, but there are times when it wouldn't meet the necessary criteria. We've seen two major lawsuits agree with AI companies that their use of copyrighted books is fair use. Anthropic won its case, as the judge deemed its use of the copyrighted books \"exceedingly transformative.\" Authors whose works were alleged pirated, though, can receive compensation as part of a $1.5 billion settlement. Two days after Anthropic won, Meta won on a similar case. Giving tech companies carte blanche to run amok with copyrighted content isn't something creators are excited about. In March, over 400 writers, actors and directors signed an open letter asking the Trump administration not to give OpenAI and Google a fair use exception. They wrote that Google and OpenAI \"are arguing for a special government exemption so they can freely exploit America's creative and knowledge industries, despite their substantial revenues and available funds. There is no reason to weaken or eliminate the copyright protections that have helped America flourish.\"\u00a0 Copyright owners are in a bit of a holding pattern for now. But beyond the legal and ethical implications, copyright in the age of AI raises important questions about the value of creative work, the cost of innovation and the ways in which we need or ought to have government intervention and protections.\u00a0 There are two distinct ways to view the US's intellectual property laws, Mammen said. The first is that these laws were enacted to encourage and reward human flourishing. The other is more economically focused; the things that we're creating have value, and we want our economy to be able to recognize that value accordingly. \"For most of our history, the humanistic approach and the industrial policy approach have been fairly well aligned,\" Mammen said. But generative AI has highlighted the different approaches to copyright and IP. \"Do these laws exist primarily as an issue of industrial economic policy, or do they exist as part of a humanistic approach that values and encourages human flourishing by rewarding human creators?\" he asked. \"At the highest, most abstract level, I'd say that is one of the questions that's being forced by these debates.\"","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"             POPULAR SEARCHES                         BROWSE BY            There are games like Monday night that make you grateful for high-flying, efficient offenses. We know those two quarterbacks can play better than they did. And we know those defenses are special. That didn\u2019t make it easy to watch. So let\u2019s discuss some\u00a0other performances from last week\u2019s action. In these QB rankings, I\u2019m focused on monitoring the fluctuations of a quarterback\u2019s performance throughout the season. No one \u2014 not even Matthew Stafford \u2014 is safe at the top. No one \u2014 not even Justin Fields \u2014 is stuck at the bottom. There is room for quick ascent \u2014 and rapid decline. One question holds most important: What have you done for your team lately? Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Watching Matthew Stafford is like getting a birthday gift from that one person in your life who knows exactly what you want, sometimes before you even know it yourself. He just doesn\u2019t make mistakes. It\u2019s one thing to make big plays and lead your team to the top of the conference. It\u2019s another thing to do it with an almost spotless record on 310 passing attempts. Just two interceptions. Just two lost fumbles. Compare that to Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, a more fun and exciting candidate for the MVP \u2014 but after this week, a less deserving one. He has seven interceptions and two fumbles lost, almost double the turnovers. There is such a dogged pursuit of the big play in the NFL that we sometimes lose sight of the guys who never cost their team a yard or a possession. In that respect, Stafford reminds me of the Buccaneers version of Tom Brady. Stafford has the answers to the test unlike any QB currently in the NFL. But he also has one of the best pass-catching units, from Puka Nacua to Davante Adams to Kyren Williams to the deep gang of tight ends. But then, Stafford will roll out to his right \u2014 and even elude pressure with his legs \u2014 and throw with a weird arm angle. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll see elements to his game that Brady didn\u2019t have, not even as he seemed to get faster into his 40s.\u00a0 Stafford is just doing what he\u2019s done for years, but he\u2019s never had this much support. Maybe ever. It\u2019s pretty easy to argue this year\u2019s Rams team is better \u2014 and more talented \u2014 than the Super Bowl-winning roster from 2021. There are times when Stafford looks wise, and there are times when he looks old. But there are never times when he looks washed up. That\u2019s an accomplishment for a 37-year-old QB who entered the season with an aggravated disc injury in his back. He has been as dominant \u2014 just not as healthy \u2014 as he was last year. And as far as defensive matchups go, the Vikings are among the least desirable for a QB. Brian Flores\u2019 blitzes are exotic and aggressive and they highlight the outstanding cast of playmakers on that defense. Jackson didn\u2019t look electric this week, but no one does against Minnesota. The Ravens QB stuck around and avoided mistakes. So, when the Vikings handed him opportunities with poor offensive play and turnovers, Jackson and the Ravens capitalized for a comeback win. Now, Baltimore\u00a0also\u00a0opened the door for the Vikings to get back into the game, in part because of a few poor third-down plays. But Jackson and company did just enough. If I\u2019m going to wax poetic about the ways Stafford has played mistake-free football, then I should do the same for Lamar in a season where he has only one interception and one lost fumble. There\u2019s still that blowout loss to the Chiefs, which is dragging down the quality of Jackson's season as a whole. But given how well he and the Ravens are playing, he might get another shot at KC in the postseason. Inconsistency has often been the story of Jordan love's career, and that's especially been the case in recent weeks. (Photo by Kevin Sabitus\/Getty Images)  Can Daniel Jones limit the turnovers enough to remain effective and keep the Colts in title contention? (Photo by Maja Hitij\/Getty Images)  I fear Williams and the Bears are headed for a massive regression. But first \u2014 before hating \u2014 I\u2019ll acknowledge what\u2019s going right. Williams has cleaned up the accuracy issues that plagued him at the beginning of the season, which has made a\u00a0massive difference for the Bears offense \u2014 and for Williams\u2019 trajectory as a quarterback. Chicago is no longer leaving as many yards on the field. His final two fourth-quarter drives were a fantastic demonstration of what he can be.\u00a0 There was\u00a0tight-window throwing. There was timely scrambling.\u00a0There was arm arrogance but with fine-detail execution to back it up. My favorite throw was a timing-based route to Luther Burden where Williams let the ball go before Burden had even slowed to break off his route. It was crisp execution of a concept that looks simple but takes time, trust and practice to complete. But. But \u2026 *sighs dramatically* There\u2019s still so, so, so much room for Williams to clean up his game. It\u2019s exasperating to see someone with this much potential struggle to know what to do with it. And even worse, his potential gets in the way of his own development. Because remember: The Bears fell\u00a0way behind against a dumpy Giants team (that just fired its head coach). And Chicago couldn\u2019t get into the game until after rookie QB Jaxson Dart suffered a concussion, which thrust (washed-up) Russell Wilson into the game. One of Williams' biggest problems was one of his biggest assets: his fastball. On third down, on deep passes, on crucial checkdowns, Williams\u2019 pass-catchers dropped the ball against the Giants. They\u2019re pro receivers \u2014 they need to catch the football. That said, Williams needs to take some speed off these easy plays to keep them easy. He\u2019s unnecessarily upping the degree of difficulty. There are too many instances where Williams looks like a one-read quarterback \u2014 sitting\u00a0way too long on his first option and then abandoning the pocket for a hero ball. It\u2019s especially painful to watch when he heaves the ball incomplete to the end zone on a third- or fourth down, when there\u2019s a checkdown (and likely conversion) waiting, wide open. Last year, Williams regressed to a version of himself that was worse than the guy who left USC. This year, he isn\u2019t just back on track. He\u2019s finally better than the guy who was tabbed QB1 before rookie minicamp in 2024 \u2014 before the Bears derailed his development. But if he's going to be elite, he still has a long way to go. Rodgers\u2019 film almost looked like a QB who was injured. I know he\u2019s not hurt. I know he didn\u2019t suffer an injury and was not listed on the injury report. But Rodgers played poorly \u2014 well below his typical level of play \u2014 for reasons that I can\u2019t quite explain.\u00a0 Immobile. Inaccurate. Ineffective.\u00a0 The Chargers played good coverage and applied plenty of pressure, this despite blitzing only once, per Next Gen Stats. They were content rushing four and dropping into coverage, where Rodgers either couldn\u2019t find anyone or simply couldn\u2019t hit them in the hands. It\u2019s hard to reconcile exactly what went wrong. Were the Chargers simply\u00a0that much better? Was it simply an off day for Rodgers \u2014 leading to his worst outing as a Steeler?\u00a0 Or was this a sign of things to come, as the Steelers are on the verge of squandering their divisional lead over the Ravens? One thing is certain: Rodgers isn\u2019t the athlete that he thinks he is \u2014 not anymore. And so his tenure in New York, where he didn\u2019t have the requisite protection, was a disaster. His tenure in Pittsburgh has been much better, because his pocket is much improved. Because his arm and his mind are still lively, even if his legs are not. But in this game, the Chargers were able to 1) get Rodgers off his spot and 2) do it without bringing any extra rushers. It\u2019s not a formula that everyone can follow \u2014 but it\u2019s also not a complicated blueprint. Good defenses should be able to replicate what the Chargers just did. Rodgers and the Steelers will have to come up with some counters.\u00a0 It's Year 5 and former No. 1 overall pick Trevor Lawrence is having another middling season. (Photo by Ian Maule\/Getty Images)  If J.J. McCarthy continues to struggle, how committed are the Vikings to starting him? (Photo by Carlos Gonzalez\/The Minnesota Star Tribune via Getty Images)  I feel about Gabriel much like I did about Spencer Rattler, which was that neither guy was doing much to get excited about. But also, given their situation, neither guy was culpable for losses.\u00a0 At this point, Gabriel is deeply committed to his checkdowns, ingrained no doubt by the constant pressure and lack of downfield separation from an underwhelming receiving corps. Jerry Jeudy has been off all year, with his separation declining to 2.2 yards per route (down from his career average of 3.1) and his receiving yards over expected sinking to -125. Coach Kevin Stefanski does what he can to help out Gabriel, with\u00a0a lot of boots and rollouts \u2014 with tight ends trailing horizontally for short passes. But all in all, the Browns offense looks like one big shrug. The root cause of their problems is \u2026 everything. The good news is that Gabriel does a respectable job of not making things worse. But he is a 5-foot-11, third-round quarterback who fits the bill. They can\u2019t build around him. He will be a really good backup.\u00a0 He is only contributing to the future of this organization in that he\u2019s unintentionally helping them lock up the No. 1 overall pick \u2014 or as close to it as possible. But since I mentioned Rattler, I\u2019d like to also mention that Tyler Shough immediately upgraded the Saints' offense. It remains to be seen if that holds up long term. But it was an immediate upgrade nonetheless. So \u2026 You know where I\u2019m going with this, right? Where. Is. Shedeur. Sanders? Why. Isn\u2019t. He. Playing? Stefanski must be seeing something truly awful in the meeting room or on the practice field to justify keeping Sanders off the field. And then, if Deshaun Watson comes back, maybe they\u2019ll use that as an excuse to stop Sanders.\u00a0 It might just remain one of the NFL\u2019s biggest mysteries of 2025.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Login  Vlad  11 November 2025   Huawei Android Honor vivo Oppo Samsung  According to the latest IDC report, Huawei led the Chinese foldable market in the first three quarters (January to September) with a very comfortable margin, securing a whopping 68.9% of the pie. In second place is Honor with 11.2% of the market, followed by vivo with 5%, Oppo with 4.9%, and Samsung with 4.3%. It's interesting to see Samsung making the top five here since in overall smartphone sales it's long been a rounding error in the Chinese market. But apparently Chinese people really like the Galaxy Z Fold7. The foldable smartphone market in China reached 2.63 million units shipped in Q3, which is 17.8% more than in Q3 2024. If we take the first three quarters combined, shipments reached 7.62 million units in total, which is 14.3% more than in the same period of last year. With this data, IDC predicts \"nearly\" 10 million shipments for the full year. IDC says foldables are well on their way to transforming from niche toys for early adopters to mainstream devices, at least in the Chinese market, especially fueled by advances in thinness and lightness over the last generation. Source (in Chinese) Pura X is still the best foldable Even if it doesn't become a mainstream enough product category, it's at least proven to be profitable enough to be a consistent, dependable niche that makes companies measurable profit.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Milan's Salone del Mobile has announced its first-ever exhibition dedicated to unique and limited-edition design with Salone Raritas, which will debut as part of the furniture fair's next edition. Billed as a \"fair within the fair\", the inaugural event will feature stands from a range of collectible design galleries within a modular set conceived by Italian studio Formafantasma. It will mark the first time that this growing segment of the design industry receives a dedicated section\u00a0at Salone del Mobile, which is the world's most important furniture fair. \"Unique and research pieces, limited editions and high-end creative manufacturing are entering fully into the heart of the Salone for the first time,\" said Salone del Mobile president Maria Porro. Salone del Mobile's editorial director Annalisa Rosso, who is curating Raritas's inaugural edition, described the exhibition as \"a new chapter for the collectible design segment\". \"Salone Raritas builds open channels of communication between realities that until very recently seemed far apart, allowing many of them a chance to meet for the first time,\" she said. The exhibition in Salone's central Pavilion 9 will feature one-offs and limited-edition pieces by contemporary makers alongside rare antiques and craft objects. Exhibitors will include a selection of just under 30 \"galleries of excellence\" from across the world. \"We're finalising a strong first cohort and will share names very soon,\" Porro told Dezeen. The aim is to open this smaller-scale work up to the larger audience of developers, investors and clients that attends Salone del Mobile. \"Raritas is a direct interface between collectible design, antiques and high-end craftsmanship on the one hand, and the contemporary B2B market on the other,\" Porro said. \"As projects compete on uniqueness, content and quality, one-of-a-kind and signature pieces have become strategic assets for brands, architects and investors. Salone Raritas reads this market shift and offers a curatorial platform that connects authorial design and high craftsmanship directly with the professional design system.\" Formafantasma's scenography for the exhibition will consist of modular islands instead of traditional stands, which participating galleries can customise using a predefined colour and material palette. A central lounge will provide a space for networking, meetings and negotiations. \"They will not be booths,\" said Formafantasma's Simone Farresin. \"The modular, respectful design allows each gallery to express its own identity while maintaining a choral narrative, designed for both visitor memorability and for market effectiveness.\" Fairs dedicated entirely to collectable design have conquered the globe in recent years, with new international editions announced seemingly every week. Design Miami is now hosting events in Basel, Seoul and Paris, while Brussels fair Collectible has launched in New York and Nomad is popping up in Abu Dhabi and the Hamptons. Established furniture trade shows have taken note and started launching their own competitors, from the Curatio section at Maison&Objet in Paris to Design Shanghai's Collectible Design & Art exhibition. But Salone Raritas offers something unique, Rosso argues, in its ability to connect independent galleries and makers with the business-to-business market. \"This idea is coming from years of conversations,\" she said at the initiative's launch event in London. \"We want to be something different. This is something I really want to tell you in a crystal-clear way. We are not replicating something that already exists.\" Sent on alternate Fridays, this US edition of Dezeen Agenda is a fortnightly newsletter rounding up everything you need to know from America, featuring news, projects and interviews with industry figures.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Apple has launched a limited edition accessory for the iPhone, called the iPhone Pocket. It evokes a modern day iPod sock, using a single 3D-knitted cloth to create a wearable pocket. The accessory was designed in collaboration with renowned designer Issey Miyake. The Pocket is kind of like a high-end version of the iPhone Crossbody Strap. Unlike the 2004-era iPod Socks, the iPhone Pocket is not cheap. Available this Friday, the short strap Pocket will cost $149.95, and the long strap design will cost $229.95.  The Pocket is made of a stretchable cloth material that can hold your iPhone as well as other everyday items. You can stretch the Pocket to glimpse at the iPhone\u2019s screen, without fully taking it out. The Pocket can be attached to a handbag, worn over the shoulder, or over the wrist.  Issey Miyake's design director Yoshiyuki Miyamae said it is inspired by the concept of \"a piece of cloth\". I guess they got the idea from Apple's display cleaning cloth, and that you can charge an arm and a leg for it. The design of the accessory was led by Apple in partnership with the Issey Miyake design studio, the makers of Steve Jobs\u2019 iconic turtleneck.  Apple says the iPhone Pocket launch is a limited edition release. It\u2019s unclear how much stock they have. It will also only be available in select regions online; US, UK, France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. It will be on display in a handful of Apple Stores. The short strap version is available in lemon, mandarin, purple, pink, peacock, sapphire, cinnamon and black. The longer version is offered in sapphire, cinnamon and black.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"What does it mean to be a scalable, modern investment firm? Apollo Global Management has transformed itself from a traditional private equity giant into an insurance-fueled credit powerhouse\u2014thanks to its acquisition of life annuity issuer Athene. CEO Marc Rowan makes a bold bet that an asset-heavy model, which is backed by hundreds of billions in long-term insurance liabilities, can drive repeatable, superior returns and propel Apollo\u2019s assets under management to $1.5 trillion. However, public markets award Apollo a multitude on its earnings that is far lower than asset-light peers like Blackstone, which highlights important trade-offs. Harvard Business School professor George Serafeim joins host Brian Kenny to discuss the questions raised by the case, Apollo Global Management, and explore what Apollo\u2019s transformation reveals about business-model innovation and risk management in today\u2019s rapidly evolving private markets ecosystem, and what it means to be a modern investment firm. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Apollo Global Management began in 1990 as a bold, if not controversial, private equity firm, built on buying undervalued assets and distressed debt. Fast forward three decades, and under the leadership of CEO Marc Rowan, Apollo has transformed itself into something far more ambitious, and far more complicated. By 2025, the firm had grown into a financial colossus, managing over $750 billion in assets. But here\u2019s the twist. Apollo\u2019s growth no longer came from private equity deals alone, its biggest engine was a life insurance and annuities business they acquired in 2022. Suddenly, they weren\u2019t just managing investor capital, but the retirement savings and the hopes and dreams of millions of policyholders. At its heart, this case isn\u2019t just about Apollo, it\u2019s about the future of finance itself. Today on Cold Call, we\u2019ll discuss the case, \u201cApollo Global Management,\u201d with Professor George Serafeim. I\u2019m your host, Brian Kenny, and you\u2019re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Podcast Network. George Serafeim\u2019s research spans the fields of accounting, finance, management, and strategy. He is the author of Purpose and Profit: How Businesses Can Lift Up the World, and a repeat guest here on Cold Call. George, welcome back. GEORGE SERAFEIM: Thank you for having me, Brian. BRIAN KENNY: It\u2019s been a little while since you\u2019ve been on the show. Where have you been? GEORGE SERAFEIM: It has. We both look older, I guess. BRIAN KENNY: I still have no hair, so that hasn\u2019t changed at all. No, it\u2019s great to see you back. This case, for me, was really, really interesting, because I do think that it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say this is a transformative change in private equity and in financial services, in general. So, thank you for writing it. Thanks for being here to talk about it. Let\u2019s just get started. If you can tell us what motivated you to write the case on Apollo at this particular point in its evolution? I\u2019d love to know what your cold call is, when you start the discussion in class. GEORGE SERAFEIM: Sure. Brian, the first answer is that Apollo is a window into a much larger transformation of the financial system. With the case, we\u2019re talking about how financial capital is getting manufactured, sourced, and deployed, and ultimately, how companies in the real economy are getting financed. We\u2019re talking not only about the largest companies in the world, but also middle-sized companies, thousands and thousands of them, and the way they are getting their credit, for example. So, 30 years ago, private markets were small. They were niche. Right now, they are gigantic. And asset managers, insurers, and banks are blending to create the future of financial intermediation. For me, there was also a personal story in my motivation for writing the case. One of the chapters of my thesis was on embedded value accounting in the life insurance industry. What that allows you to understand is to move beyond the quarter, and understand long duration cash flows, and understand the attractiveness of having permanent capital fueling your business engine. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. And that\u2019s a big part. We\u2019re going to talk about that further as we get into the case. How do you start the conversation? GEORGE SERAFEIM: I start the conversation by asking if this is a good idea or not, meaning the merger with Athene, for Apollo? There is quite a bit of tension about it, and it\u2019s a big decision. You\u2019re looking at a firm that goes from roughly 30 to 40 billion in assets in its balance sheet, to 250 billion next year. So, you see the balance sheet transforming completely. And you see that new risks emerging, for example, much tighter regulation because of insurance regulations. But at the same time, have this engine for creating and manufacturing capital, that you can then deploy. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. So they don\u2019t have to go out and do rounds of fundraising, that they take that off the plate. I think it\u2019s fair to say that in popular culture, private equity does not get the best representation, if you look at the way they\u2019re represented in movies and other things like that. And so, the early history of Apollo seems to have emerged out of a little bit of that kind of controversy. They basically came into being after the fall of Drexel Burnham Lambert. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about how that unfolded, and how it shaped their culture and their appetite for investment? GEORGE SERAFEIM: Yes. In many ways, Apollo, you can think about them as the stereotype that you would find in the movie. Right? Very, very aggressive firm going into distressed situations, leaning towards very complex situations, and trying to get the best price that they can. So this triangle of distress, complexity, and price discipline, are at the core of the firm for many, many years. But then the firm goes public. Becomes a publicly listed company, which is, I guess, a counterintuitive thing. You can think about a private equity firm like in private markets, but it\u2019s becoming a publicly listed company. But with that, there is a transformation. And that transformation happens because complexity doesn\u2019t scale. How many complex situations can you keep finding? So, once you\u2019re a publicly listed company, you understand that the game is changing, and the game is changing also for Apollo. BRIAN KENNY: And the pressure is changing, once you\u2019re a publicly listed company. GEORGE SERAFEIM: 100%. BRIAN KENNY: You\u2019ve got different things driving your motivations, perhaps. Apollo\u2019s founders built a reputation for, I love this term, \u201cvulture investing.\u201d I would love for you to explain what that is, because it doesn\u2019t sound good. I\u2019m wondering how that identity evolved as the firm expanded beyond private equity into other asset classes? GEORGE SERAFEIM: \u201cVulture investing\u201d is associated with this idea of distress. So you find basically distressed firms, you can buy their debt. And through their debt you get control, basically, of the company. So you\u2019re a vulture. BRIAN KENNY: We need to rebrand that, I think. GEORGE SERAFEIM: Yes. Yes. Some marketing people, far beyond my expertise. But the way that you can think about the identity as well, is to go back to this idea of scalability. What is scalable here? Complexity is not scalable. As a sourcing strategy, it does not scale well for a public company. Why? Because it is episodic, it is volatile, and also critically, it leads to lower earnings quality. Why that is? Because you have a lot of volatility. In some years you might make a lot of money because you have a performance interest in the company that you acquired, and then you exit that company by selling it, and you make a lot of money. And another year you don\u2019t. Public market investors, when you have volatile earnings, attach a lower multiple on those earnings. So, what happens when you become a publicly listed company, you realize that you would be better off by having recurring revenues, recurring earnings, and also growing segments of the business that you can deploy a lot of capital. Not try to identify niche situations of complexity. That leads us to where we are. Basically it goes from an opportunistic business to a business that is trying to think about systematic value creation across equity and credit, and many other strategies. BRIAN KENNY: So this gets a little bit to the strategic transformation piece that the case really delves into. I\u2019m wondering what prompted Marc Rowan, CEO at the time, and the protagonist in the case, to pivot Apollo towards the insurance and retirement services space, and ultimately the acquisition of Athene? GEORGE SERAFEIM: As with all stories of strategic transformation, there is a confluence of opportunities. And time matters a lot. The first one is that there is an opportunity because banks are retrenching after the great financial crisis, and banks are pulling back because of regulation. So, they are pulling back and leaving some white space for lending, especially to mid-sized companies, and mid-market companies.The second element that is happening, is that insurers are looking for yield. Because if you think about the basic life insurance annuity business, is you provide some kind of a promise to your policyholder that in X number of years, and usually that X is a long number of years, might be 10, 20, 30 years, or so forth, you will get some types of cash flows. So you need to invest that money in order to be able to fulfill that promise. So, insurers are looking for yield for those long-dated annuity promises. But interest rates are now going down. So, where are you going to find that yield? So, insurers are having a need for that. The third factor is that a lot of us are retiring. There are a lot of people that are retiring. So this is a growing market of retirees that are looking for many of those products, and that is a great opportunity. So Marc Rowan and the whole team there probably is having a realization. A realization that, \u201cLook. Look at all this capital. This is a gigantic market that can provide long-duration capital, meaning those cash flows can be coming to us for many, many years when people are becoming policyholders.\u201d And also they are not only long-duration capital, but they are also lower cost of capital, compared to our traditional closed-end fund that people are expecting 15% or 20% required rates of return. These ones might be 4% or 5%. That allows us to actually go and invest that money in investment-grade debt, which is becoming a very, very crucial deployment mechanism for Apollo. BRIAN KENNY: Okay. And now they\u2019re dealing with a completely different set of expectations as well, and they\u2019ve got more people watching them. So governance becomes a challenge in this situation, because now you are in a regulated space. How did the acquisition of Athene change the culture there, with respect towards governance, but also the financial profile of the firm? GEORGE SERAFEIM: The first one, just to give you a sense of that, in 2024, 26 billion of revenue. 22 billion of that is coming from the retirement business. BRIAN KENNY: Wow. Enormous, yeah. GEORGE SERAFEIM: Okay? So, we\u2019re talking about five times the revenues of the traditional asset management business, that\u2019s coming from that. That is giving you a sense of the transformation from just a business perspective. But also, there is a transformation of governance, as you are saying. Because now, you are just not a partnership for a private equity firm. Now you\u2019re becoming a financial services organization. So as a result, governance needs to adapt as well. So you observe a couple of things. First, more shareholder voting power. So they are distributing more shareholder voting power to make sure that actually the organization is seen as governance-friendly, that if I invest in the company, I have a say in that. You observe a stronger independent board. So, the traditional things that we tend to think about as good governance, you see compensation reforms, for example. You see much more now of the compensation going towards deferred equity, in the form of restricted share units. So you observe several of those dimensions of governance. And critically, you also observe that the organization is setting up separate investment committees, for the asset management side of the business and the retirement side of the business. Because sometimes those interests might be aligned, but sometimes they might be misaligned. So you need to make sure that you have a proper governance structure, in order now to manage all these sometimes conflicting incentives. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Now, they\u2019re not the only ones that are doing this in their space. There are competitors, KKR, Blackstone, others, that have also taken a similar approach. What have they done differently than those other competitors? GEORGE SERAFEIM: The simplest distinction that I can make is asset-heavy versus asset-light. BRIAN KENNY: Okay. GEORGE SERAFEIM: So, you can think about Apollo and KKR as adopting an asset-heavy perspective. So what they have done, is they have just bought an insurance company and they have integrated it. So, as a result, their balance sheets are gigantic. They are in the hundreds of billions of assets and liabilities. Now, compare that with Blackstone, that they have, for example, acquired minority interests in some insurance businesses, and then they have signed separate investment management agreements. That makes a big difference. Let me give you one statistic to make that real. So when you look at the asset to equity ratio, a reflection of how much leverage is basically the balance sheet, that for Apollo is about 12 to 13 times. When you look at Blackstone, that\u2019s about two. BRIAN KENNY: Wow. GEORGE SERAFEIM: That makes a big difference when you\u2019re thinking about that. So, how can you think about the pros and cons when you\u2019re thinking about that? And this is a lot of discussion that is happening in the classroom, because this is a decision that many businesses outside of financial services are always making. Do I have an asset-light business, or an asset-heavy business? And there are pros and cons when you\u2019re thinking about that. So the weakness of the asset-heavy business is that, well, you have a much larger, more levered balance sheet, and insurance regulatory exposure. So now you\u2019re regulated, and you have very, very strict requirements around that. And when you think about it, when you have an asset-light, you have a fee stream, basically. You rely on that fee stream. That might come with higher valuation multiples, higher, for example, price-to-earnings ratios. That comes with lower capital intensity, and less regulatory complexity. But what you\u2019re not getting? You\u2019re not getting that permanent capital flywheel. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. The growth engine. Right. GEORGE SERAFEIM: Right? The growth engine. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Do you know, you may not have insight into this from regarding the case, but I\u2019ll ask anyway. Because the case mentions that the culture at Apollo, particularly with the original partners, was a very aggressive culture. There were shouting matches in the boardroom as they tried to make their best case for where they were going to invest and how they were going to invest their money. Do you know if this development changed any aspect of that culture? Did they have to think differently about where they were going to place their bets? GEORGE SERAFEIM: Yeah, it is very different. It\u2019s very different and very interesting, Brian, around that. Because think about it for one moment. So, Apollo 1.0, let\u2019s say, so, what are you doing? You are actually going to firms, let\u2019s say a mid-sized firm. You have a couple of hundred million of revenue, and some EBITDA, and so forth. And you are antagonistic to them. You\u2019re buying their debt, and you\u2019re trying to get control. So you\u2019re the enemy, effectively. Now what are you? You\u2019re actually the friend. You go to the management and you say, \u201cHow can I provide credit to you, in order to help you grow?\u201d I think that requires a different personality and different temperament, different types of incentives, and fundamentally, a different way of approaching the identity of the firm, and how do you do businesses with firms in the real economy? BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Did Marc Rowan sort of drive that cultural change within the organization? Was it his leadership that pointed them in that direction? GEORGE SERAFEIM: Yeah, we always tend to idolize a single person in companies. The Steve Jobs effect. He created the iPhone, and so forth. And probably he played a big role in that, because you do need leadership, especially when it comes to changing a whole identity of a company. But it\u2019s a collective effort. There were several key people there that were behind the strategy. Because at the end of the day, if a critical number of people don\u2019t coalesce behind the new strategy, nothing is going to happen. So, definitely he played a critical role, and he has been a very vocal advocate of that, of seeing basically the gigantic growth market that retirement markets are representing. The fact that actually when you\u2019re thinking, for example, about private credit, you\u2019re not just thinking about what some people are thinking sometimes, which is basically providing credit to other private equity firms that are going to buy some companies. But actually thinking about the totality of what exists in the bank balance sheets, which is about 40 trillion in assets. BRIAN KENNY: So it\u2019s a growth mindset at this point. GEORGE SERAFEIM: It\u2019s a growth mindset. BRIAN KENNY: The case describes Apollo\u2019s focus on credit origination at scale. I don\u2019t claim to know what that means. I\u2019m wondering, maybe you can explain that to us? But also explain why it\u2019s become central to the firm\u2019s strategy? GEORGE SERAFEIM: I think it\u2019s super important, because it is the distinction between making the assets, versus waiting for them to show up. So, if you don\u2019t have credit origination at scale, what are you going to do? You\u2019re just going to basically wait for the banks, for example, to originate that credit. If you have credit origination at scale, you are actually going to create those assets. BRIAN KENNY: I see. GEORGE SERAFEIM: So you\u2019re going to establish those relationships. They have created, I believe by now it\u2019s 16 specialized origination platforms. You can think about it, credit that goes towards aviation, equipment, energy infrastructure, warehouse finance, and others, in order to create investment-grade loans. Having investment-grade loans is very, very important, because going back to who the customer is. Policyholders, to a large extent, right? So you cannot actually deploy large amounts of capitals in extremely risky types of investments. So, you want actually to have investment-grade debt there. To give you a sense of the scale, I believe that the firm now originates about 100 billion annually, in terms of credit. BRIAN KENNY: Wow. GEORGE SERAFEIM: They have a target within five years to go to about 200, 250 billion of origination. BRIAN KENNY: Where does that put them, if you look at the financial services, the banking industry more generally, where does that put them in the context of maybe JP Morgan, or some of the other big players in the space? GEORGE SERAFEIM: It\u2019s actually hard to make the exact benchmark, because banks also make all kinds of loans on the personal side, on the commercial side, and so forth. BRIAN KENNY: Sure. GEORGE SERAFEIM: But I would say, in general, private credit is the fastest-growing type of credit. It\u2019s actually approaching other markets like leverage loans, or in some cases it has surpassed those markets. So, it is becoming a very, very significant component of how credit is flowing into the real economy. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. I want to talk a little bit more about governance and culture. We\u2019ve touched on it a little bit, but one of the things that the case goes into is the major governance changes they made internally, compensation reforms. You talked about them creating subcommittees, which is a new approach for them. Can you maybe go into a little bit more detail about the motivations behind some of those changes? GEORGE SERAFEIM: I think there are two motivations, primarily. So, one is credibility, and the second one is time horizon. The first one is, you are running now, what I call, a very trust-sensitive business. BRIAN KENNY: Yes. GEORGE SERAFEIM: The insurance is a trust-sensitive business. Somebody is not going to basically tie their future in retirement with an untrustworthy institution. So, you need to be able to signal, both to your policyholders, but also to agents, and also regulators, that you\u2019re trustworthy. So, you need to implement all of the types of things that we talked about, such as, for example, building your compensation towards restricted share units that are going to vest over time, establish independent investment committees, all of those types of changes, in order to create credibility. The second element is because the capital is long-duration capital, you want to make sure that the time horizon of the incentives also aligns with that idea that I have the long-duration capital that I\u2019m going to deploy on the other side. So, you see this almost fundamental thing that we teach at HBS, which is basically strategy, capital formation and capital deployment, and then governance, need to be all aligned on the time horizon space. Another interesting thing is that, for example, senior leaders, they are required to co-invest in the funds, alongside clients. So you see multiple mechanisms at play there, to try and signal credibility, and signal also that the time horizon is aligned. BRIAN KENNY: Right. That they\u2019re invested in this as much as their clients are. We talked about the tension early on. Certainly there is tension where it comes to incentives across these three groups, where you\u2019ve got some people that are looking at the long-time horizon, like the policyholders. But you\u2019ve also got shareholders, you\u2019ve got investors who work for you, who are looking at a much shorter time horizon. How did they balance the tension across those sort of competing interests? GEORGE SERAFEIM: I think one of the interesting elements here is, and I think that happens in many organizations, is that you can try and write as many contracts as you can. But at the same time, it goes back to culture. There is an important element of culture here, which is in Apollo, something very important over time has been this idea, and the North Star being excess return per unit of risk. That is a very important element, because it shows that basically you need to care both about generating excess returns, but you also need to care about how much risk you\u2019re taking when you are doing that. So that is a well-ingrained idea on the almost philosophy side of things. Now, on the structure side of things, because of many of the governance things that we have already talked about, laid over with insurance regulation, capital buffers, risk-based capital, all of those kinds of things, create a structure to try and align incentives. But at the end of the day, Brian, policyholders want certainty. Investors want some kind of excess returns or alpha, as it\u2019s called in the asset management industry. And shareholders, which also have different interests in Apollo, compared to the investors in the fund, want scalable recurring earnings. So, the only way to manage sometimes the tensions that are going to be created, is by being explicit that the tensions exist. BRIAN KENNY: Yes. Yeah. I can tell you, from one person\u2019s perspective, my 89-year-old mother lives on an annuity, and she\u2019s always afraid they\u2019re going to run out of money. \u201cWhat if they sell it? What if\u2026\u201d So there\u2019s definitely that concern, right? In the case, Marc Rowan talks about the distinction between public and private risk, and he says that\u2019s diminishing. I\u2019m wondering if you, in looking at the sector itself, do you agree with that? And what implications do you think that has for the financial system? GEORGE SERAFEIM: Directionally, yes, I agree with that. Public can be safe or risky, and private can be safe or risky. So, you can see that in, for example, many of the companies that have been publicly listed now, and if you try to invest in them, some of them are highly speculative, they have almost zero revenues, and you\u2019re up for a ride, basically, right? BRIAN KENNY: Right. Right. GEORGE SERAFEIM: And then in private, you see some companies that are already on very solid financial grounds, basically. So, I think Marc Rowan is making this argument that we used to think that private is just risky and public is safe, and that is just not true anymore, in terms of how the market has developed. At the same time, what you\u2019re observing as well, is that if you have a retirement portfolio, and for example, you put it in the S&P 500, and you look at the big bet that you\u2019re making, given how a few companies, a few technology firms, are dominating those indices, you are making a big bet, basically on those technology companies that are very richly priced. Some of them might trade at 40 times earnings, 50 times earnings, 60 times earnings. So he\u2019s looking at that, and he\u2019s saying, \u201cIs that really safe? Doesn\u2019t seem so.\u201d I think directionally there is a useful concept to start thinking about public and private as being both safe or risky. Both of them. And to understand that the real difference between them to a large extent, is liquidity, basically. That you basically have liquidity in public markets that you can get in and out, you can sell, as you said, basically. Your mother might be able to sell her annuity at some point. In private debt or in private equity, you just don\u2019t have the same level of liquidity. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. So, do you think that this integrated model is resilient enough to face a liquidity crisis, if one were to come up? GEORGE SERAFEIM: It\u2019s really interesting, because a lot of these changes that have happened, we have been in a relatively very long cycle right now, right? BRIAN KENNY: Yes. GEORGE SERAFEIM: So, there\u2019s an open question. If the economy slows down in a pretty significant way, what we were going to see in terms of, for example, credit defaults and so forth, or how things are going to slow down on economic activity. That is a question. The real solution to that is strict underwriting, and having strict risks established. BRIAN KENNY: Which we didn\u2019t have in 2008, right? GEORGE SERAFEIM: Correct. So now, the question is how, when Apollo, for example, is saying that we are having investment grade debt that is senior, is well-protected, and so forth, when a potential tsunami comes, you say, is that indeed the case? I think what you\u2019re probably going to find in the future, because as in all bull markets, there are down markets as well, and the economy slows down, is that when the economy slows down, is that some firms will have done a better job at managing risks, and having proper underwriting than some other firms have done. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. George, this has been a great conversation. I feel like I\u2019ve learned a lot about just the system itself. So, thank you. I\u2019ve got one last question before our time is up here, and that would be, if you look at the broader lessons, what does Apollo\u2019s transformation offer about the future of financial intermediation, and the role of alternative asset managers in the global economy? GEORGE SERAFEIM: I think a couple of lessons, Brian. I think the first one is what we talked about in terms of origination. I think the ability to originate will be a critical source of competitive advantage. Firms that can consistently manufacture the right assets at scale will be at a competitive advantage. The second one is that I think a lot of people are still thinking about many of those firms as private equity firms. They even call them private equity firms. They are not anymore. They are actually financial services companies. And as a result, from that perspective, they are great laboratory for understanding business transformation, and how do you change the identity of a company, how do you change governance, how do you change incentives? And really understanding all elements of business model transformation. The other thing that you will see is that there is this very interesting phenomenon that actually the nature of the liabilities that you have can shape your strategy. This is a very interesting element. So, we always tend to think about it as, \u201cOkay, what do you want to do?\u201d And then get the capital for what you\u2019re trying to do, right? BRIAN KENNY: Right. Right. GEORGE SERAFEIM: But what if you actually stumble upon a superior source of capital that now allows you to do many different things that you haven\u2019t thought about before? This is exactly what is happening here, that we\u2019re actually understanding that there is capital that can be sourced that, for example, in a very simple way, what is happening here, is that the different source of capital allows for those companies to expand product scope, to go from just traditional private equity into much more credit and infrastructure and real assets. So what you will find now, companies like Apollo do, is give a credit, for example, to build infrastructure for the electricity grid in Germany, for example. What you will see now is many of those deals happening, and those, importantly, are at scale. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. So you see more of this coming, it sounds like? GEORGE SERAFEIM: It seems so.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Investing Caterpillar (CAT) shares are up over 56% year to date. The company set a sales growth target of around 6% for the next four years. Caterpillar trades at more than 23 times forward P\/E after its recent rally. Goldman Sachs (GS) is up over 36% year to date and more than 142% in the last two years. Goldman Sachs trades below 15 times forward P\/E with a 2.0% dividend yield.  \t\t\t\t\tSending You to Google News in 3  \u00a9 Scott Olson \/ Getty Images The Dow Jones Industrial Average offers too small a sample size for many to be an effective gauge of how well the stock market is doing on any given day. But, of course, we have the S&P 500 for that, which is more widely followed and invested in by investors. Still, having only 30 stocks in a basket does make the Dow an interesting and reasonably well-diversified portfolio that might act as a model for new investors looking to get started in the stock-picking game. Of course, the Dow Jones basket can be fun to keep tabs on as a beginner. And, of course, the index has a very rich history on Wall Street alongside a price that\u2019s continued to swell, serving as an example of the wonders of compounding over extremely long periods of time. In any case, if you\u2019re a fan of blue chips and are interested in when the legendary index adds a new holding or gives one the boot, you might be compelled to see what\u2019s winning or losing in any given year. Though the year isn\u2019t over yet, this piece will explore a few Dow stocks that have had their way with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (NYSEARCA:VTI), which are both up close to 15%, so far this year. But does their recent hot streak warrant chasing them into the new year? Let\u2019s find out. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a heavy-duty construction machinery company that I found to be one of the most surprising market beaters for 2025. Shares of Caterpillar are up over 56% year to date, and despite recent turbulence, the rally off Liberation Day lows still seems intact. Wall Street analysts have high hopes for the $263 billion industrial blue chip going into 2026, especially after the firm revealed some pretty upbeat targets during its latest Investor Day meeting. Could Caterpillar really be in for a renaissance of growth over the next four years? Perhaps. A sales growth rate of around 6% seems easily doable, especially as buyers better appreciate its digital technologies. That said, the business of construction, mining, and all the sort can be quite cyclical. And with that, investors had better have a tolerance for pain should the environment shift drastically. If a recession is encountered at some point down the road, the rosy sales guidance may be too high a bar that\u2019s been set. Either way, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the name while it\u2019s trading for more than 23 times forward price-to-earnings (P\/E). I could be wrong, but I think much of the optimism and strength might already be priced in here. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is up over 36% year to date, but more impressively, it\u2019s up more than 142% in the last two years. The iconic investment bank really is firing on all cylinders, thanks to tons of dealmaking momentum, which is expected to carry into the new year, as well as continued resilience in the economy. If M&A looks to kick things up a few notches, the good days for Goldman Sachs might be about to get even better. In any case, the stock looks way too cheap at less than 15 times forward P\/E, with a nice and growing 2.0%-yielding dividend. While I\u2019m no fan of chasing rallies, it\u2019s hard to make a case against Goldman Sachs when it\u2019s going for so cheap, with such macro tailwinds at its back. In the new year, I would not be surprised if shares top the S&P 500 once again. It\u2019s a winner that has all the tools to continue winning big.

As a stay-at-home mom of six tiny humans, grocery shopping is a major part of my weekly responsibilities. I've shopped pretty much everywhere \u2014 chain supermarkets, Walmart, Target, you name it \u2014 but my favorite store, hands-down, is Trader Joe's. In my opinion, Trader Joe's is the best grocery store. It's fun, it's easy to navigate, and most importantly, there's always something new and delicious to try. Although I love all of TJ's unique offerings, I live and die by its freezer section. Life is busy enough without having to cook fresh meals every weeknight \u2014 and these affordable, slam-dunk freezer staples help me always feel prepared. Not to mention, they're a hit with even my pickiest kids. Here are the 10 freezer items that I try to grab on every trip to Trader Joe's. These baguettes are the perfect side dish for soups, salads, and pasta. They're also delicious dunked in marinara sauce or drizzled with Trader Joe's garlic olive oil. My kids call these baguettes \"tiny breads,\" and I will never not buy them. We always have a bag (or four) in our freezer for bread-mergencies. This pizza is thin, crunchy, and a little bit tangy in the best way. If you cut it into bite-sized pieces, it makes for a fun \"appetizers for dinner\" meal that can surprisingly feed six whole children (and occasionally me!). At my Trader Joe's, one pizza costs just $5 \u2014 an unbeatable price, in my opinion. The only thing better than mac and cheese is deep-fried mac and cheese. After just 15 minutes in my air fryer, these bad boys are better than most chain-restaurant appetizers. Two boxes feed my whole crew, and they're usually gone before I can reach for condiments. Trader Joe's elevated take on pigs in a blanket is great for days I need to make an easy weeknight dinner. In my opinion, they're more delicious than other hot-dog bites I've tried: The crispy, lightly cheesy Parmesan-crust layer makes them feel fancier than classic pigs in a blanket. Even if you're not gluten-free, these nuggets are worth the purchase. They're juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside, and one bag is the perfect size for our family. For an amazing, kid-friendly meal, I love pairing them with Trader Joe's incredibly delicious waffle fries. When I first bought these Trader Joe's patties, I was beyond skeptical that they would pass the \"kid test\" \u2014 my 4-year-old son can smell \"healthy food\" from a mile away, and this was no pork sausage. So, I was pleasantly surprised when they raved about these and asked for seconds. These are a quick and easy breakfast for busy school mornings \u2014 I just pop them in the air fryer. Trader Joe's potato pancakes are absolutely incredible. I crisp these up in my trusty air fryer, and the result is perfect every time. Some of my kids eat these plain, and others slather them in ketchup. I eat their leftovers either way \u2014 that is, on the rare occasion that leftovers exist. Why are tiny things so cute? My kids like these fun-sized pancakes infinitely better than regular-sized pancakes, which defies all logic, but there you have it. They are the perfect base for berries, shredded coconut, and even an occasional dollop of whipped cream. Full transparency: These mini pancake puffs are not necessarily the most nutritious breakfast option. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, though, I can't recommend them enough. They're light, airy, and deliciously chocolate-forward. I like to pair them with a side of chicken sausage breakfast patties for a little more protein. I remain unconvinced that a more perfect dessert exists. These tiny ice cream cones \u2014 which contain chocolate-chip ice cream and a delicious fudge bite at the tip \u2014 are the ideal after-dinner treat. Plus, they're small enough to fit seamlessly into tiny toddler palms. Pro tip: The seasonal peppermint flavor is the best! Jump to","label":0}

And as we approach the end of 2025, it's not slowing down.  The END. x adidas Tokyo sneaker brings a clever football-inspired twist to a low-profile '60s runner. A black and white color scheme, inspired by END.'s local football club Newcastle United F.C., is joined by net detailing covering the base of the shoe (a reference to the net in football goals).  Release Date: November 11 Editor's Notes: Vaquera's Converse Chuck Taylor sneakers are built like sweatpants. Instead of laces, these knee-high boots come with a drawstring upper to cinch the waxed canvas upper around each leg \u2014 you know, like how sweatpants are tied around the waist. Trust a label as inventive as Vaquera to pull off such a feat.  Release Date: November 14  Editor's Notes: It's hard to imagine this was originally a climbing shoe. New Balance's Tokyo Design Studio, the American label\u2019s creative lab for experimentation, has refined its techy Minimus model to create a sleek slim-shaped leather slip-on.  Release Date: November 15 Editor's Notes: The original Air Jordan is back in its original colorway. But the \"Chicago\" sneaker has had some updates, with Nike upgrading the materials and slightly widening the silhouette.  Release Date: November 13 Editor's Notes: Skate shoes are made to be thrashed. So why not buy them that way? This distressed Old Skool sneaker is a deliberately scruffy rework of a Vans classic, created by its high-end OTW line. And if you look past all the purposefully pre-destroyed fabric, you find tasteful details like new leather accents and a slip-resistant Vibram sole. Release Date: November 13 Editor's Notes: These waterproof boots are only going to get more beautiful with age. Milanese concept store One Block Down has recreated the classic 6-Inch Timberland boot in pull-up leather, an oil-finished leather designed to develop a deep patina over time.  Release Date: November 14 Editor's Notes: True to its name, Australia's leading female sneaker boutique, Finesse, has transformed ASICS' retro runner with finesse. The retailer's interventions are simple, really, covering the sporty sneaker in a clean sandy beige hue with black overlays.  Want to keep browsing?

Valve's iconic Steam Deck has aged exceptionally well and is still a perfectly capable handheld gaming PC. Its Linux-based SteamOS has matured and remains the best overall experience, streamlining customization and software maintenance with minimal tinkering compared to its Windows-based rivals. Some missing features are still locked to Windows, including Game Pass, and controversial anti-cheat issues prevent many AAA titles from running at all. Its hardware shows its age, but the software and UX keep the Steam Deck relevant. SteamOS is still the best handheld user experience Capable of playing modern games with tweaks Durable hardware and parts There's a full (albeit Linux) PC underneath its software Easily customizable Optional OLED variant Anticheat support is still mostly non-existent in major titles SteamOS is available for more powerful handhelds Quite large and heavy No native access to Game Pass (but the cloud is still an option)  Why you can trust Windows Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  Valve's Steam Deck needs no introduction. It is to handheld gaming PCs what the iPad is to tablets. It's the one that everyone thinks of first. Whenever I was using other options, such as the highly praised ASUS ROG Ally X, the first question I'd regularly be asked was, \"Is that a new Steam Deck?\"  I've owned one since April 2022, delivered less than two months after the first units started shipping. It's still the only thing, tech or otherwise, that I pre-ordered the moment I could. I was pumped. Having spent much of the previous two years learning about Linux and the quirks of gaming on it, I had high hopes. Initial reactions were pretty positive across the board \u2014 including our own Steam Deck launch review. Sure, it didn't run Windows 11, but that wasn't a problem then, and it's even less of a problem now. But as three years (with some change) have passed, and the market has a lot more competition among the best handhelds, is the Steam Deck still worth it in 2025? I think it is. I'd have no problems recommending someone buy one, even with the likes of the slightly more powerful Xbox Ally on offer alongside the SteamOS-based Lenovo Legion Go S and its monstrous, Windows-based Legion Go 2 successor, which joined the party this year. However, the conversation is certainly more complex than it was when the Steam Deck first launched. I'm the team's resident Linux mega-fan with years of experience using the operating system for gaming alongside Windows, and I've owned the Steam Deck since the very beginning, using it regularly.      Having owned the same Steam Deck since mid-2022, I feel like I'm in a good place to talk about how it's held up. The short version is that it's done really well, and continues to do so. That's not to say there haven't been people with issues on their units, but my own has been solid throughout. Aside from spending the last couple of years inside a $60 dbrand Killswitch case, I can't say I've been treating it particularly like a fragile baby. It gets tossed into bags, it's been used by children (a traditional test of durability), and it still looks about as good as it ever did. The only visual 'mod' it currently has is a dbrand Steam Deck skin on the front. With the kinds of games I'm typically playing on my Steam Deck these days, I can still get around 3-4 hours of playtime. I did use the JSAUX transparent rear case on my Steam Deck for a time, but I went back to the original for a couple of reasons: one was that I didn't like the replacement rear buttons, and the second was that it featured a heatsink, which ironically became pretty hot on the outside. So, I went back to stock parts. The screen is still perfect on my early LCD model, and while the battery will have undoubtedly degraded over time, it's still holding up. With the kinds of games I'm typically playing on my Steam Deck these days, I can still get around 3-4 hours of playtime, which is far more than you should expect from any AAA titles.      I'll tackle the elephant in the room first. The Steam Deck doesn't run Windows 11; it runs SteamOS instead, which is based on Arch Linux. \"But, games are built for Windows, it can't possibly work that well, right?\" Wrong. Valve has put significant work into the Proton compatibility layer over the years, both before and since the Steam Deck launched. In the majority of cases, the hardware is more of a limitation than the software. There are exceptions, though. You can't play the modern Call of Duty games, for example. Nor can you play Fortnite, EA multiplayer titles, or Destiny 2. But you can use the cloud, and NVIDIA even has a native Steam Deck app now for GeForce Now. Xbox Cloud Gaming on Steam Deck can also be used via standard web browsers, and there's even an official Xbox guide to setting it up. The reason for these missing games isn't that the hardware isn't capable; it's that the anti-cheat solution simply doesn't work. The worst part is that some anti-cheat solutions, such as Destiny 2's, actually do work on Linux \u2014 but it's down to developers to enable it. Others, such as Activision's Ricochet, Riot's Vanguard, and EA's Javelin, do not support Linux at all. Currently, these kernel-level anti-cheat solutions are only compatible with Windows 11.      Thanks to Proton, a huge percentage (I believe at last count was around 90%) of the Steam catalog works on the Steam Deck. At least, if the hardware can handle it. Just like graphics cards, which get updated drivers targeting specific games, Proton does the same. Valve does all the hard work, so the game developers don't have to. But as the market has matured, many have taken it upon themselves to ensure their games work well on handhelds through optimized settings. Cyberpunk 2077, Spider-Man 2, and Forza Horizon 5 are just a few examples of fairly demanding AAA titles from my own library of games that are enjoyable on the Steam Deck. I've found (and so have others) that the sweet spot is targeting 40 FPS, for a balance of performance and battery life on the Steam Deck. There are sacrifices to settings and frame rates, but 30 FPS is perfectly fine on a handheld. In many games, I've found (and so have others) that the sweet spot is targeting 40 FPS, for a balance of performance and battery life on the Steam Deck. Lock the refresh rate to 40Hz, and you're generally good to go. Naturally, the focus is on Steam, but you can also play games from other stores. Thanks to the broader Linux community, there are simple ways to play your Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, and even Amazon Games on the Steam Deck, with tools such as the Heroic Games Launcher and Junk-Store. Here are some examples from my own library, including a couple of older, less demanding games, all running at 1280x800 resolution: Game Settings Performance Shadow of the Tomb Raider Medium 46 FPS (average) Spider-Man: Miles Morales Medium, FSR 3 FrameGen, Vsync on 60 FPS Control Ultimate Edition Low 45-50 FPS Dead Island Definitive Edition Medium 65-75 FPS Thankfully, the community database at ProtonDB is a great way to get an idea of how your games will play, along with some handy tips for optimization. The hardware and software could be just as good as it is all day long, but it doesn't matter if the games don't run well enough. As the Steam Deck heads towards its fourth birthday in February 2026, it can't be denied that, on sheer performance, it's starting to fall behind the competition.      Mercifully, I haven't had to repair my Steam Deck in the 3+ years I've had one (compared to the two months my ROG Ally lasted before dying). Nevertheless, it's incredibly easy to repair and customize. The battery and the SSD are both easily accessible, and anyone with a screwdriver and a little time can swap them out if needed. There's a healthy third-party market of customizations, too, to truly make your Steam Deck your own. That starts with skins and goes all the way to customizable shells, upgraded displays, hall-effect sticks, and custom buttons; there's so much out there. Any upgrades are always done at your own risk, and my colleague, Jennifer Young, can tell a tale of woe about attempting a shell swap (with stories on the contrary, highlighting Valve's great customer service), but if you're careful, you can make your Steam Deck whatever you want it to be.      That also applies to the software, too. Unlike Windows 11, which can be customized away from its stock settings but requires a more involved process, SteamOS can be easily tweaked to look however you want. Using Decky Loader, a third-party plugin tool and store, you can go absolutely wild, changing the look and adding new features to your Steam Deck. Yes, you can install Windows 11 on a Steam Deck instead of SteamOS if you really want to.  On my own, I've altered the look of the homescreen, applied custom colors and fonts, custom game art, a plugin to improve compatibility with my XR glasses, added custom system sounds, and found a fantastically helpful plugin that puts ProtonDB compatibility badges on every game. And yes, you can install Windows 11 on a Steam Deck instead of SteamOS if you really want to. It's just a PC, after all, and Valve has ensured it will work as best it can.      Be it the Steam Deck LCD or the slightly upgraded Steam Deck OLED, it's still an easy handheld gaming PC to recommend. It's a little larger than some other handhelds, and quite hefty, but with the overall package of price, software, and performance, it still stands strong. I still use mine regularly, and it's single-handedly helping me play games in my backlog that I just wouldn't have done otherwise. Still, the market has changed a lot since the first Steam Deck reviews surfaced online, not least because of Valve's behaviour. You can now put official builds of SteamOS on other handhelds, such as the ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, even the new Xbox Ally, if you wish. SteamOS is just better to use on a handheld than Windows 11, even with the recent improvements like Microsoft's dedicated full-screen mode. This is where it gets more complicated. I have no problems recommending the Steam Deck, but if you want more performance behind the same experience, that's now possible without having to dabble with community-built Linux distros such as Bazzite. The software is where the Steam Deck has always stood tall, even with its mostly anti-cheat-related limitations. SteamOS is just better to use on a handheld than Windows 11, even with the recent improvements like Microsoft's dedicated full-screen mode that was added to the Xbox app as part of recent OS updates.      The Steam Deck was built from the ground up to work like a handheld console, and you don't ever have to go into the desktop UI if you don't actually have a specific need to, such as installing Decky Loader. Windows 11 will get there \u2014 hopefully \u2014 but right now, SteamOS installed on either its native Steam Deck or overwriting a Windows 11 handheld is still my preferred choice. It even has performance benefits, as we've seen with those aforementioned folks trying it on their Xbox Ally. SteamOS is far leaner than Windows 11, and it shows. So, if you really want a Steam Deck, go buy one. It's still a brilliant handheld gaming PC. If you want something with a bit more horsepower, grab an AMD Z1 Extreme or better in a different handheld and slap SteamOS on it. The only people that I still wouldn't recommend buying a Steam Deck are those who are heavily invested in the Xbox Game Pass or Play Anywhere ecosystem. If your games primarily come from Microsoft in this way, you can't get them on SteamOS. Likewise, if you want to go handheld with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the same applies. For everyone else, the Steam Deck is still here. And it is still glorious.       It's still one of the most affordable handheld gaming PCs and, despite its age, Valve's choice of hardware continues to hold its value years later. The Steam Deck is still worth buying. \ud83d\udc49 From $399 at Steam (LCD, 256GB)      Follow Windows Central on Google News to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"In a first-of-its-kind event, the Venn Diagram of \u201cTrump administration catastrophes\u201d and \u201cChristmas gift ideas for family members you really only see two or three times a year\u201d has become a circle. Thanks to Trump\u2019s beloved tariffs, pasta from Italy might be hard to come by come 2026\u2014so, if you consider yourself a saucy little pasta freak, it\u2019s time to stock up. On Monday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced\u00a0a 92% antidumping duty on Italian-made dry pasta, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is on top of Trump\u2019s existing 15% tariff on imports from the European Union, and would affect at least 13 companies, including recognizable brands like Pasta Garofalo, Rummo, and even Barilla (though the U.S.-produced Barilla will be the least affected). \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important market for us,\u201d Giuseppe Ferro, the chief executive of La Molisana, a family-run pasta factory in southern Italy, told\u00a0WSJ.\u00a0\u201cBut no one has those kinds of margins.\u201d Rummo\u2019s chief commercial officer in the U.S. said they wouldn\u2019t pull the product or put the full burden on consumers, but warned prices could still jump from $3.99 to $7.99. The decision follows an antidumping probe by the department launched in August 2024, after two U.S. manufacturers alleged unfair pricing by Italian exporters. Officials say they proposed the tariff after two of the accused Italian companies, La Molisana and Pasta Garofalo, were uncooperative. But both say the process was mishandled and have denied any wrongdoing. The WSJ further writes: American pasta makers have regularly filed antidumping complaints against Italian imports since [the mid-1990s.] Reviews by the Commerce Department have often found one or more Italian companies guilty of underpricing their pasta. But the penalties were usually small. Italian makers shrugged and saw it as part of the cost of doing business in the U.S. \u201cAll pasta makers, big and small, know that to export pasta to the U.S. you have to pay a tariff,\u201d said\u00a0Enrica Massarelli, a Naples-based accountant specialized in fighting U.S. antidumping cases on behalf of Italian pasta companies. Italian companies were convinced that products made in Italy, the birthplace of pasta, would retain their appeal with consumers. The outlet notes this is the first time so many Italian companies have faced \u201ctrade-killing\u201d tariffs. Rummo\u2019s CEO said this isn\u2019t about cheaper pasta, but rather \u201can excuse to block imports.\u201d The department will make its final decision in late December or early January, but if it goes through, it would be the highest-ever tariff on a food import from Italy. The biggest producers say they\u2019ll stop selling to the U.S. as soon as January\u2014which would plunge our country into a pasta shortage by the spring, maybe even earlier.

Amy Bonitatibus, PayPal's chief corporate affairs officer, shared in a video interview for CMO Insider how Venmo is playing ball with college athletes, and PayPal's new opportunities in agentic commerce. Bonitatibus has been at PayPal since May, 2024 and held previous leadership positions at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. Following is an edited transcript and video of the interview. When you think PayPal, you think trusted, safe, secure, and dependable. And then you've got Venmo, which is this huge, culturally relevant brand. Few brands have the benefit of being a verb, and we take that very seriously. College sports was ultimately disrupted when this ruling came down that requires universities now to pay student athletes for using their name and likeness. For us, already being on campus, and Venmo being the way that athletes and students pay for all everyday expenses, it was a no-brainer for us to engage the largest conferences and look for a safe way to process and make those payments to student athletes. We're talking tens of millions of dollars that are going through the system now to young athletes that maybe haven't seen that kind of money. So for us it was an opportunity not only to process the transaction, but also to provide financial literacy to those athletes, and bring them closer to the brand. CMO Insider asks marketing leaders to share their about big brand moments, weigh in on topical trends, and talk about the changing nature of their jobs. If you have an idea for the series, contact editor Julia Hood. Now the marketing sponsorship piece of it is \u2014 debit cards at these campuses, and even for alumni. People are so loyal to their college and universities, but to have that now for Venmo is awesome. What we're seeing is this evolution of not only peer-to-peer payments \u2014 which is what Venmo is known for \u2014 but now to be able to pay everyday expenses using your debit card and pay with Venmo, which you see on thousands and thousands of websites, and that continues to scale. It's kind of taken the brand to the next level. I honestly can say I wasn't surprised at the power of Venmo. When we look across our demographic, it's amazing. You've got the 50-plus-year-old mothers who literally use it every day, to the students that I talked about across college campuses. It's a beloved brand across lots of demographics, which has been exciting. It allows us to be able to personalize and customize the messaging based on who we're trying to reach for that campaign, or for the capability that we're really trying to drive. PayPal is a special brand that's been around for 25 years, the pioneer of e-commerce. When we think about what's next for PayPal and how do we create that competitive advantage as we had in the early days of the brand, the opportunity is obvious \u2014\u00a0it really is agentic commerce. Today you see these agents and they're being used more and more for simple searches. 'Hey, what's the most popular red sweater being sold today?' It populates that red sweater, but what creates a clunky experience is they then have to go to a different site to purchase the red sweater. What we're doing is we're partnering with a lot of those agentic companies to say PayPal can help fulfill that payment, so that it's end-to-end. The red sweater is populated, we already know generally what size sweater that customer wears \u2014 now all they have to do is select it and do a tap-to-pay to be able to process that through PayPal. We've already negotiated and have in market today those partnership opportunities and those capabilities, and I think we're just scratching the surface there. I'm really excited for the future of agentic commerce with PayPal. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"For Jan Gilg, SAP's co-chief revenue officer and head of the Americas market and the global Business Suite, thriving within today's economic climate and technology imperatives isn't about avoiding disruption. It's about using the agility those challenges cultivate to drive innovation. That can start with understanding what's proprietary about your business versus what's a process most businesses rely on. Gilg refers to this as \"standardizing where you don't differentiate.\" In other words, automating standard processes that don't create value. The question, Gilg then posed, is \"where is the innovation happening?\" In his view, determining which area of their enterprise management tech stack to target for innovation can be as critical as the areas of the world where they do business. \"I see that as being located on the layer above automated processes, where you can tap into your data,\" said Gilg. \"It's really about having an integrated set of business applications based on harmonized data models and a unified user experience.\" That, Gilg said, \"is where you build your innovation and drive the most valuable business outcomes.\" Innovation atop automation The SAP Business Suite \u2014 where SAP's core applications, data, and AI come together \u2014 supports this operational layering: connecting processes with modular business applications, on top of which AI and other innovations can cut through complexity to supercharge transformation. The symbiosis the suite strikes between automation and innovation is in step with the current global C Suite perspective. In surveying 3,000 C-suite executives for its recent Pulse of Change report, Accenture found that 39% of organizations are accelerating automation to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Nearly 70% reported seeing AI as a driver of revenue growth, with half saying they would accelerate AI investment even in a recession.  To turn this resolve around AI into real ROI, Gilg and his team advocate a unified, intelligent approach that can yield insights from increasingly dense data and create system-wide visibility to drive business outcomes. This, a key foundation in the architecture of the SAP Business Suite, creates the ability to keep pace with rapid technological shifts. This includes agility to onboard emerging technology, like the current rise of AI agents \u2014 autonomous and proactive taskmasters empowered to pursue pre ordained goals. Enterprise management in the age of agents Signaling their momentum in business applications, earnings-call mentions of AI agents quadrupled across the fourth quarter of 2024, according to analysis by CB Insights. The group also found that more than 60% of leaders place high importance on AI agent deployment over the coming year. Watch episode 1 of the new Beyond Resilience vodcast, featuring Jan Gilg, here. Gilg sees the rise of agentic AI as analogous to the early days of the SaaS movement, when individual software vendors would bring customers a solution for a single need, creating a patchwork system that IT teams found difficult to integrate. Those arduous integrations as companies migrated from on premises to the cloud are a reason SAP worked to make its native AI agents compatible from inception. \"I believe we are really at the brink of a new era of intelligent operations. Because agents don't care about organizational silos, and they just want to get the job done as efficiently as possible. That's why I really think we will see another leapfrog now in terms of productivity gains.\"  \"Having your agents communicate with each other out of the box is a huge advantage with the Business Suite,\" Gilg said. They can hand over tasks along a process and get work done end-to-end. That way you can address much more complex scenarios.\"  Gilg also draws on his background overseeing on-premise to cloud transitions to understand that customers won't accept breaks in the fluidity of hand-offs between AI agents \u2014 an orchestrated flow built into the ways SAP supports agentic infrastructure. \"I know it sounds futuristic,\" he said, \"but the workforce of the future in my mind will be a hybrid force between humans and agents.\" On the horizon: uncertainty tempered by insight That future also appears to be one characterized by uncertainty. In its most recent quarterly survey of global financial professionals to determine economic outlook, the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants found that confidence in their own organizations' prospects fell from 50% in the first quarter of the year to only 37% as of May. The global outlook held by these leaders dropped 10 points between surveys, with only 19% expressing optimism. \"Every C-level leader feels the pressure to do more with less,\" Gilg said. The bright side, as he sees it, is that technology has matured to the point it can deliver on that need. \"I truly believe companies have an opportunity right now to modernize their IT to really embrace that: to have a hard look into how to optimize the way they're working and leapfrog in productivity gains and insights.\" The outcome of that ERP modernization, he promised, will be unprecedented insight and foresight. \"Suddenly, you'll see far above and beyond the four walls of your enterprise, allowing you to see disruptions much, much earlier. And that creates a much more sustainable resilience.\" Explore the SAP Business Suite here. Jump to","label":0}

Now, the company is reorganizing how advertisers access and operate across that ecosystem.\u00a0 At this year\u2019s unBoxed conference, Amazon introduced a unified Campaign Manager that collapses the Amazon DSP and the Ads Console into a single buying tool. It also rolled out agentic AI tools that can generate creative, build campaigns, recommend targeting and write complex Amazon Marketing Cloud queries using natural language.\u00a0 Together, the changes are meant to make full-funnel advertising on Amazon simpler to plan, execute and measure regardless of a brand\u2019s size or internal expertise.\u00a0 \u201cMarketers now get a consolidated view into how their campaigns are delivering recommendations right across the funnel,\u201d said vp of Amazon Ads Kelly MacLean. \u201cWe\u2019ve consolidated the advertising accounts so that you don\u2019t need to go and register and create separate accounts to go and advertise as well as reporting on the back end.\u201d In practice, the unified Campaign Manager brings search advertising and programmatic buying into one workflow. An genetic mode called Full-Funnel Campaigns can set up and adjust muti-format campaigns across Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, display and streaming TV from a single prompt. Ads Agent interprets media plans, builds campaign structures, recommends budgets and surfaces AMC insights. Creative Agent generates or scales video and display assets that fit Amazon\u2019s retail and streaming environments.\u00a0 While the buying experience is now unified, the underlying commercial model remains.\u00a0 Advertisers already using Sponsored Ads can continue to run Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands and video, audi and display formats in Campaign Manager without added fees. The DSP, however, still carries its existing minimum spend requirements. \u201cIf you think about the history of DSPs, a lot of it was focused on more complex use cases for larger enterprises,\u201d said MacLean. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take a lot of that guesswork out as we\u2019ve rebuilt the entire front and back end of the DSP so that it\u2019s really anchored on performance and simplification.\u201d Pieces of this shift have been underway for some time. The first real shift came last October when Amazon lowered DSP entry thresholds through resellers \u2014 a practical opening for the mid-market. Sales teams later began nudging spend toward premium third-party streaming supply, not just Amazon-owned surfaces. And in September, access to Amazon Marketing Cloud broadened beyond the biggest enterprise accounts. Each step pushed the ad stack closer to something more open and less gated.\u00a0 The unBoxed updates formalize that trajectory into a system that doesn\u2019t rely on specialist traders or agency-grade operations to run.\u00a0 If it holds, Amazon\u2019s ads business tilts further toward smaller and mid-market advertisers in a sustained, always-on way. It\u2019s the same dynamic that underpins Google and Meta \u2013 steady demand driven by a broad base of ongoing spend, rather than a narrow set of large enterprise budgets.\u00a0 \u201cReally, the opportunity that we see is by reducing the complexity and effort to create ads, including ones that can run on television for brands of all sizes, we have the opportunity to dramatically increase the overall marketplace,\u201d said Jay Richman, vp of product and technology at Amazon Ads. There\u2019s also a pricing angle. As more advertisers optimize in one loop, demand for Amazon\u2019s inventory could tighten, pushing CPMs higher over time.\u00a0 This is the Amazon flywheel applied to advertising. Simpler tools reduce the expertise needed to get started. Lower barriers widen the pool of always-on buyers. More advertisers drive incremental spend across retail and streaming inventory, which sharpens measurement signals and improves optimization. Better performance leads to reinvestment. Barriers fall further and the loop accelerates \u2013 at least in theory.\u00a0 \u201cAmazon\u2019s actively lowering the historical barriers to entry for sophisticated targeting, measurement and optimization,\u201d said Kashif Zafar, CEO of agentic AI platform, Xnurta. \u201cIt\u2019s a shift from focusing on those larger brands and enterprise clients to really making the ad platform accessible to all sellers of every size.\u201d In some ways, this shift was set once CEO Andy Jassy positioned advertising as a core margin lever. In the four years since, the company has gone beyond its reputation as a retail media performance behemoth and moved into territory typically occupied by holdco media networks and buy-side ad tech vendors like The Trade Desk. The company now has authenticated reach across more than 90% of U.S. households, direct integrations with every major premium streaming provider and determinist measurement tying impression to sales.\u00a0 What remained unresolved was usability, and a way to prove upper-funnel value without splitting teams, budgets or measurement frameworks to do it.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re finding that our Creative agent is getting early traction with independent agencies that either didn\u2019t offer creative services but can now do thanks to it or they have some amount of creative service and they\u2019re just finding a lot of efficiencies,\u201d said Richman. True as that may be, this shift has implications for agencies, especially from those who value rest on knowing how to work Amazon\u2019s system. As AI takes on campaign setup and AMC query-building, operational expertise becomes less of a moat. Instead, the differentiation moves up the funnel: strategy, creative concepting and performance interpretation.\u00a0 \u201cCandidly we\u2019re looking to expand our solutions beyond Amazon now,\u201d said one media buyer on condition of anonymity. Even as regulators probe AppLovin, investors piled in, while The Trade Desk\u2019s solid quarter drew side-eyes, demonstrating the challenges of ad tech in the AI-era.  Despite the AI hype, marketers say the influx of synthetic social and mounting backlash to \u2018AI slop\u2019 isn\u2019t likely to put a premium on human-created influencer content.  The CPG advertiser is planning out its presence at the 2026 World Cup, with a strategy focusing on social and sponsorship.

The move: CoreWeave stock dropped 10% on Tuesday. The data center stock has struggled over the past month but is still up more than 170% year-to-date through Monday's close.  The why: The AI infrastructure darling reported third-quarter earnings. Revenue came in at $1.36 billion, beating the $1.29 billion anticipated by Wall Street analysts. However, the company, which rents GPUs and data center compute to AI companies, also scaled back its annual revenue forecast and revealed temporary delays involving a third-party data center developer. The company's sales range for the year is now $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion after previously being set at $5.35 billion. What it means: While CoreWeave's lowered guidance might be spooking some investors, analysts note that it is likely a temporary issue that will result in revenue for the current quarter being pulled forward into the first quarter of next year. The company's third-quarter revenue beat indicates that demand for its services is still strong.  \"CoreWeave's position as the essential cloud for AI has never been stronger as we drive growth through focus and innovation to power the next generation of AI,\" CEO Michael Intrator said.  However, Tuesday's tumble after otherwise solid quarterly results could also reflect the growing sentiment on Wall Street that tech stocks are simply too expensive. Bloated stock valuations were the culprit behind last week's sharp drop in Palantir stock, as well as the broader swoon in the Nasdaq 100, which had its worst week since April.   Jump to","label":1}

This summer, on a whim, I left Florida for a new life in New York City. After living in Florida for nearly nine years, I packed my bags and headed to New York, hoping to grow my career as a recent college graduate in an uncertain economy. While the high cost of living initially prevented me from considering New York, I realized that living in Miami didn't save me much money, either, nor did it provide the opportunities in my industry that I would have in New York. I don't regret moving at all, even though it was a rushed and complicated process. Having lived in New York City for a few months now, I've noticed just how different life can be here compared to where I lived in Florida. These 11 things have surprised me the most since I moved. I didn't have plans to move to New York when I did. The entire decision \u2014 from even considering it at all to boarding the plane \u2014 came together in just a couple of weeks. I only made the decision to move when a close friend found himself suddenly needing an extra roommate in a three-bedroom apartment. At the time, I had moved back to my parents' house postgrad while working remotely in a six-month-long fellowship. While I didn't want to commit to a yearlong lease without long-term employment, I knew going into the Miami real estate market would also present challenges, especially since I didn't have friends looking for apartments whom I could recruit as roommates. Looking at how much my share of rent would be in a three-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn \u2014 which I had long considered to be out of my price range \u2014 I realized it was cheaper than it would be to live alone in Miami. It was even comparable to what I would pay in just about any major US city if I didn't want to share an apartment with roommates I didn't know. So while the average rent in Brooklyn is nearly double the average in Miami, per RentCafe data, I found that having roommates, whom I knew beforehand, made New York much more affordable for me than it would've been to dive into the Miami rental market on my own. In Miami, a 20-minute drive could easily become an hour-plus trek once rush hour hits, which pretty much means any time between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. or 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. I've found the New York City subway, on the other hand, comparatively fast and reliable. While many New Yorkers might feel like they regularly experience delayed subway trains, on-time performance is around 85%, per MTA data, which I find infinitely more convenient than Miami's much less frequent and often delayed public transportation options. It does require a mindset shift from appreciating the individuality of driving to the communal experience of taking public transit. If the train is delayed, it's delayed for all of us; I've found there's a certain camaraderie in that. I've learned to allow for some buffer time when I'm going from place to place, and I've started bringing a book with me to make the most out of the travel time, something I couldn't do if I had to focus on driving. Florida doesn't have an income tax, so having lived there my whole working life before moving to New York, I had grown used to what my paychecks looked like. When I made the move, I was aware it would change, but it was still surprising to see just how different my take-home pay looked, even as someone early in my career. That said, I don't feel bad about my tax dollars funding things like public libraries or an efficient subway. In New York, I can enjoy public services that I feel are far superior to those in Florida. From the persistent background noise of car honks to ear-piercing subway screeches, the city can be very loud. While this isn't a dealbreaker for me, I might eventually consider investing in a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones, or even earplugs. I've recently grown used to falling asleep to meditation sounds that help me drown out the neighbors' footsteps or the occasional midnight ambulance siren. Whether it's murals around residential neighborhoods or small details in subway stations, art is everywhere you go in New York. There is also a wide variety of museums and cultural institutions around the city, and many of them offer free admission on certain days or with a library card, which has inspired me to immerse myself in the arts during my free time. While Miami also has a variety of museums, in my experience they tend to be smaller and admission isn't often free. The city's layout and traffic also make it more difficult to casually visit them without planning a whole day around it, as most are located in the congested downtown. In New York, I've found it's easier to pack a free museum night at a world-famous institution into a regular weekday. From street art to museums and performing arts centers across the city, it's impossible not to be awed and inspired by the creativity, passion, and talent that so many people have here. In Florida, it feels like everyone is either always on vacation or has an abstract form of income where they don't need to, well, work. On the other hand, New York City is all about the grind. Every conversation starts with asking what people do for work, and sometimes ends with adding each other on LinkedIn. The possibilities feel endless in terms of career growth and creating valuable networks. Living in the city has made me much more conscious of what I wear and how I wear it. While the Miami aesthetic emphasizes physical appearance, such as a good tan or a tasteful cosmetic procedure, New York fashion is much more about what you wear and how it fits you. Walking the streets in some of the more fashion-forward or even business districts of the city feels like scrolling through Pinterest for fashion inspiration. Sometimes, it feels like a never-ending fashion week. To avoid feeling overwhelmed by the sense that I'm not dressing well enough for the city, I've begun slowly building a more fashionable, city-appropriate wardrobe for the office and beyond. During my first few visits to the city, I repeatedly got the same impression of what life here was like: hectic, loud, and crowded. Then I went outside Manhattan. Exploring different neighborhoods beyond the typical tourist areas, I've discovered just how distinct life can be in each neighborhood and how diverse the communities are in each place. Some of the corners I've visited so far, like the East Village, are packed with young people and bars, while others, like Park Slope in Brooklyn, are all about the coffee shops and baby strollers. New York is one of the most diverse cities in the world, with cultures from every corner of the globe, from the Dominican Republic to Bangladesh, having a place in the city. I also find it amazing that I can experience food from dozens of different countries without leaving the city. Where else could you do that? As I've started settling into the city, I've found that having access to so many options can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Although I do venture out to try some of the millions of things the city has to offer each day, I've found that staying near my neighborhood makes the most sense for me. Sometimes, social media virality sends crowds to New York food spots for weeks on end, but despite how good a particular cup of coffee or sandwich might be, I just haven't been convinced that waiting in line for anything in this city can really be all that worth it when so many other options are available. I've started rolling my eyes whenever people try to tell me that one specific pizza spot is the best in the city. Maybe I'm just privileged, but I really don't believe it can get any better than the one a block from my apartment. I firmly believe that whoever said all there is to do in New York City is going to restaurants and bars just didn't try to find other activities. Out of all the life changes I have experienced since moving, the newfound variety of activities in my calendar is one of my favorites. From networking events to book talks and fairs, to community walks, the sheer diversity of activities every day is incredible, and I love filling my free time with the different side quests I can find. It makes my days more interesting and feels much more enriching than trying a million variations of the same meal or drink. Speaking about loneliness in Florida is often taboo, even during times when it's to be expected, such as the transition from college to post-graduation. Even major cities like Miami have a certain hometown quality where it feels like everyone has known everyone since forever, and those who haven't are just out of the loop. New York, on the other hand, feels like a much more welcoming city in that sense. While people might feel even more lonely than in other places, there's no shame in admitting that, and I've found that there are so many events happening every week that are meant to help strangers connect with each other over shared interests, industries, neighborhoods, or even just the shared alone-ness of moving to a major city. While I'm still building what I can call my community, the city has allowed me to meet dozens of amazing people from different walks of life already, whom I wouldn't have connected with if not for admitting to myself and others that the city can be lonely for newcomers like me.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":" ClearStreet analyst Owen Lau upgraded shares of crypto platform Bullish (BLSH) to Buy from Hold on Tuesday, pointing to the company\u2019s growing market share and product expansion, even as he trimmed his price target from $60 to $57. Lau said Bullish\u2019s share of global crypto spot trading jumped from 2.1% in the third quarter to 3.7% in November, taking volume from rivals Bitget, Bybit and Gate. The company\u2019s October trading volume rose 70% from the prior quarter\u2019s monthly average. Lau credited Bullish\u2019s post-IPO credibility and its push into new product lines for the gains. Bullish recently rolled out options trading and began operating in the U.S. after receiving a BitLicense, giving it access to one of the world\u2019s largest crypto markets. The exchange blends a traditional order book with an automated market maker, aiming to provide deep liquidity for both retail and institutional traders. Lau said this broader suite of services could lift recurring revenue from 28% of total sales in 2024 to 70% by 2027. Despite a 21% decline in Bullish\u2019s stock since late October, Lau called the sell-off \u201coverdone.\u201d He attributed recent weakness across blockchain stocks to macroeconomic worries and the market\u2019s shifting focus toward AI.  \u201cThe fundamentals of blockchain remain very strong,\u201d he wrote, citing insights from industry conferences such as Money20\/20 and Ripple Swell. Bullish\u2019s valuation has also reset sharply. The company\u2019s forward EV\/EBITDA multiple fell to 25x from 45x in September, bringing it in line with Coinbase after previously trading at a premium. ClearStreet forecasts Bullish\u2019s revenue to grow at a 25% annual pace through 2027, outpacing Coinbase\u2019s 14%. Lau added that the U.S. government\u2019s reopening this week could restore investor sentiment and pave the way for new crypto regulation, including the proposed Clarity Act. Still, he cautioned that rising interest rates, competitive pressures and volatile token prices remain key risks for the exchange.

Close enough to London for a weekend escape, far enough to provide a dose of countryside calm, and abuzz with wealthy Americans, it's clear why the Cotswolds is known as the \"Hamptons of England.\" Home to members' clubs including Soho Farmhouse, along with stylish boutiques and restaurants, this patch of countryside to the west of England has become a magnet for the rich and famous from both sides of the Atlantic. Ellen DeGeneres has lived there for about a year, and JD Vance visited in the summer, among others. Read more of Joshua Nelken-Zitser's reporting on The Cotswolds becoming a hotspot for Americans: But the Cotswolds have long been a playground for the rich and famous, drawing royals, aristocrats, and wealthy Londoners in search of a rural retreat, as well as plenty of regular tourists. Stroll through the storybook streets of Stow-on-the-Wold \u2014 like I recently did to lift the lid on why the area has become a hotspot for Americans \u2014 and you'll spot the Cotswolds set by their scuffed Barbour jackets and mud-splattered Chocolate Labradors \u2014 status symbols that haven't changed for decades. Here's what you need to embrace the Cotswolds' old-money aesthetic. If one item defines the British countryside look, it's a waxed Barbour jacket. Quilted and waterproof, it's not just practical for the Cotswolds' changeable weather but built to last. Although it may need the occasional rewaxing, many locals wear theirs until it's scuffed and faded, hanging on to the countryside favorite year after year. Whether you're in Bibury or Chipping Norton, expect to see a good number of Barbour jackets in the wild. Originally worn by Scottish and Irish farmers, tweed is a favourite of Britain's upper classes. From tailored riding jackets to blazers and pants, the traditional fabric is a versatile fixture of the Cotswolds. The current brand of choice is Holland Cooper, known for its contemporary take on tweed. You'll see well-dressed, tweed-clad Cotswolders at fancy restaurants, as well as social events, like the Cheltenham Festival, a major horse race, and the Cheltenham Literature Festival. Traditionally, the Cotswolds streets were filled with Hunter Wellington boots. But with an influx of Londoners, Americans, and trendy Europeans, the French footwear brand Veja has taken over. A favourite of urban media types, the simple white trainers are now everywhere in the Cotswolds, especially at places like Soho Farmhouse and Daylesford Organic. For a more casual look, pair jeans with a gilet. Once worn for country pursuits like hunting and shooting, and later embraced by finance bros, the gilet is a smart-casual staple in the British countryside. The brands of choice for the old-money set are Sch\u00f6ffel Country for men and Fairfax & Favor for women. Stores selling country clothing, which you'll find in Stow-on-the-Wold and in Moreton on the Marsh, among other villages, are where you can pick up this staple Cotswolds item. In London, you'll spot small, fluffy breeds like Cavapoos and French bulldogs in the city's parks. But it's Labradors and other working dogs-turned pets that are the companions of choice for the Cotswolds set. You'll find them running through Oxfordshire's farmland, as well as cosying up by a fire while the country elite sip on gin and tonics at gastropubs. At upscale Cotswolds hot spots like Soho Farmhouse, Daylesford Organic, and Burford Garden Company, there's one car you're sure to see in the parking lot \u2014 the Land Rover Defender. I saw plenty of these, parked in market squares and at every chic country hangout. The large 4x4 handles off-road driving well, perfect for navigating muddy fields and narrow snow-covered lanes. \"Some things simply belong together,\" Dominic Worsley, group managing director of AGA Rangemaster, told Business Insider. \"Tea and biscuits, gin and tonic, and, of course, an AGA in the Cotswolds.\" Whether in a sprawling estate or a honeystone cottage, a traditional Cotswolds kitchen is likely to have an AGA cooker.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":" Pininfarina\u2019s design legacy spans eight decades of automotive excellence, but the firm has increasingly turned its attention to spaces people inhabit rather than just vehicles they drive. The AI Transformer Home series marks the studio\u2019s most ambitious exploration of that territory yet: modular, expandable dwellings that treat mobility as a core feature instead of an afterthought. Working with AC Future, Pininfarina applied its signature approach to proportion, surface treatment, and user experience, creating homes that look equally compelling whether compressed for travel or expanded for living. The three models share a flexible platform but serve distinct use cases. The AI-THu functions as a 400-square-foot smart ADU, ideal for backyard installations or temporary deployments. The AI-THt eliminates the driving cabin entirely, relying on patented expansion technology to maximize interior volume when towed to a destination. The AI-THd combines both worlds, offering self-contained mobility with EV or diesel power and three-sided expansion that converts a compact motorhome into a surprisingly spacious residence. All three earned the 2025 Red Dot Design Concept Award, validating their blend of engineering innovation and aesthetic refinement. Designer: Pininfarina for AC Future  That drivable AI-THd is the one that really grabs your attention, because it\u2019s a direct shot across the bow of the entire luxury RV market. The specs are wild. It expands on three sides to create a 400-square-foot living space from a vehicle that starts at 26 feet long. AC Future is quoting a starting price of $328,000, which puts it in direct competition with high-end Class A motorhomes and premium Airstream trailers. The key difference is that a traditional RV\u2019s slide-outs give you a few extra feet of width, while this thing nearly doubles its physical footprint. Its cockpit even converts into a separate room, a clever use of space that most motorhomes completely waste once parked. This whole concept hinges on the expansion mechanism, which is far more sophisticated than a simple slide-out. The AI-THt trailer, without a cab to worry about, is the purest expression of this technology. It\u2019s a 24-foot towable box that unfolds into a legitimate small apartment. You are seeing a level of mechanical articulation that feels more like something from a sci-fi movie than a product you can actually reserve. The engineering challenge is immense: you have to manage plumbing, electrical, and structural integrity across moving walls and floors. AC Future\u2019s patented system seems to have solved this, creating a rigid and fully insulated living space that deploys in minutes.       Beyond the mechanical wizardry, the off-grid capability is what pushes this into a new category. The homes are equipped with solar awnings that deploy during expansion and an atmospheric water generation system that literally pulls drinking water from the air. An onboard AI manages these resources, learning your habits to predict power and water needs, so you aren\u2019t constantly checking gauges. This is true self-sufficiency, allowing for extended periods off-grid without sacrificing the comforts of a modern home, like a full-size kitchen and dual-zone climate control. It\u2019s a closed-loop living system on wheels.  So who is actually buying this? The price tag puts it out of reach for the average van-lifer, and its high-tech complexity might intimidate the traditional RV crowd. AC Future is likely targeting a niche market of affluent digital nomads, tech entrepreneurs, and design aficionados who want a mobile base of operations that reflects their aesthetic and technological values. This is less a vehicle for visiting national parks and more a statement piece for living and working wherever you want. It\u2019s a halo product, designed to showcase what\u2019s possible when you fuse automotive design with smart architecture, pushing the entire industry to think beyond the beige fiberglass box.

Be real: those kitchen drawers are packed with gadgets you once believed would revolutionize your routine, but they've barely seen the light of day since. The specialized choppers, quirky holders and one-trick tools aren't elevating your skills -- they're just creating clutter. What actually deserves a permanent spot in your kitchen? I consulted with professional chefs, and they all agree: focus on fundamentals and forget the drawer stuffed with unitaskers and gimmicks.\u00a0 While some kitchen gadgets are indispensable and others, chefs say, are severely underrated, many just aren't worth the space they take up. A quality knife, a solid cutting board and a dependable pans are the most important pieces of cooking equipment.\u00a0 To separate the essential from the superfluous or downright useless, I asked culinary pros to share the tools they swear by and the gadgets they'd skip.

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"Among enthusiasts, journalists and tech YouTubers alike, the Intel Arc Series has garnered a substantial following, scripting what is shaping to be Team Blue's comeback story. Intel might be poised to shake up NVIDIA and AMD's duopoly in the GPU marketplace in the coming years. What started as a rocky debut has gradually turned into one of the most surprising redemption arcs in recent PC hardware history. The Arc B580 feels less like just another release and more like a glimpse of what's ahead for Intel graphics, and all signs seem to suggest that the next wave of Arc GPUs could turn today's curiosity into tomorrow's genuine competition\u2014much of it happening in the mid-range arena. Here's why the next Arc lineup might bring exactly what the GPU market needs. The Arc GPUs, including the A580 and the B580 sell for $179 and $249, indicating strongly that Intel is coming hard and strong for the budget-friendly GPU segment where price-to-performance is a key consideration for the majority of buyers. In this segment, the Arc lineup has delivered strong performance at 1080p and 1440p at a price point that undercuts NVIDIA's RTX 4060 and AMD's RX 7600. Arc seems to be offering more power per dollar without compromise, prompting many to consider Intel graphics a viable alternative after a long while. This segment carries particular appeal for users wanting to spend $500\u2013$700 on a gaming tower at either 1080p or 1440p resolution without making huge compromises to graphical fidelity on AAA titles, deepening competition within the range. Furthermore, the Arc lineup's generous VRAM allocations give them an edge in both increasingly memory-hungry games and creative workloads as well. The A770 ships with up to 16 GB of GDDR6 memory, comfortably ahead of similarly priced competitors. Not only does this wider buffer help sustain frame stability in demanding titles, but it also affords breathing room for emerging AI-assisted features that futureproof Arc's appeal for the budget-conscious and longevity-minded buyer. If Intel continues to maintain the strong value proposition in the mid-range segment, the Arc lineup may emerge as a likely disruptor, or at the very least, push its rivals into delivering similar value in the range. Either way, the consumer wins. If the Arc hardware lineup signals Intel's determination to carve out its place in the market, its software advancements further prove that Team Blue isn't content to play catch-up for too long. The announcement of XeSS 3 featuring Multi-Frame Generation at Intel Tech Tour 2025 underlines a level of ambition that places Intel squarely in contention with NVIDIA's DLSS 4 and AMD's FSR 4 technology. The chipmaker has confirmed that the upcoming super-resolution technology with MFG will be fully backward compatible with all XeSS 2 titles, which means that every game already supporting XeSS 2 will benefit from their latest software advancements, which instantly widens its impact. What's more striking is Intel's decision to bring XeSS 3 support to older Xe1 GPUs, which represents a refreshing departure from the industry trend of leaving first-generation hardware behind when introducing new frame-generation technologies. Intel has made the decision to extend support for XeSS Frame Generation (XeSS-FG) and Lossless Scaling beyond its proprietary GPUs, with XeSS 3 likely going hardware-agnostic as well. This means that, with the advent of the Celestial GPUs based on the Xe3P architecture, developer support for XeSS 3 is expected to deepen. Intel's latest SDKs already enable super resolution and frame generation on non-Intel hardware that supports Shader Model 6.4, which includes NVIDIA's GTX 10-series GPUs. This is an important and timely development, given the fact that NVIDIA recently announced plans to end driver support for its Maxwell, Pascal and Volta GPUs. Team Blue may be far from achieving an appreciable share in the GPU market so far, but it is certainly charting all the right moves, as they must. They have brought fair pricing, accessible performance and, most importantly, open technology that is not locked into a specific ecosystem. On the hardware side, Arc has found its footing with competitive mid-range GPUs that offer impressive performance-per-dollar. The Celestial generation of Arc is going to be a critical release for Intel to address its shortcomings, performance-per-watt and develop a strong ecosystem to support its hardware feats. Given the fact that Intel's discrete GPU share is minuscule, convincing developers and OEMs to prioritize Arc will demand a clear unique value proposition and capable silicon. Intel has shown it can deliver competitive products, but the next step is proving that it can reliably sustain them. If it can continue along this trajectory, the GPU market may finally gain the third pillar it has long been waiting for. We want to hear from you!

{"date":"2025-11-11","content":"MLB Trade Rumors  By Darragh McDonald | November 11, 2025 at 3:45pm CDT  The General Managers Meetings are taking place in Las Vegas this week, a setting where teams often start conversations on possible transactions to be made later in the offseason. Jon Morosi of MLB Network reports that the Royals are evaluating the outfield trade market. It\u2019s a logical target for the club. The outfield in Kansas City has been a weak spot for years. 2025 was no exception. The team\u2019s outfielders had a collective .225\/.285\/.348 batting line this year. That resulted in a 73 wRC+, indicating the club\u2019s outfield group was 27% worse than league average. That was easily the worst mark in the majors, with the Guardians\u2019 jardineros second-last with a wRC+ of 77. The current group in Kansas City includes Jac Caglianone, Kyle Isbel, John Rave, Dairon Blanco, MJ Melendez, Kameron Misner, Drew Waters and others. Caglianone came into 2025 as a top prospect but struggled badly in his first major league call-up. No one else in the group has any real track record of big league success either. Upgrading there is an obvious way to improve the club overall. The trade market also makes sense as a way to go about doing it, considering the club\u2019s finances. About a month ago, owner John Sherman said that he expects the 2026 club to have a fairly similar payroll to 2025. RosterResource currently estimates the Royals for a payroll of about $140MM next year. That\u2019s slightly higher than the $138MM RR pegged their spending at the end of 2025. That doesn\u2019t suggest the front office will have a huge amount of spending capacity. They could lower their commitments by non-tendering some of their arb-eligible players. Jonathan India has the highest projected salary in the Royals\u2019 class at $7.4MM and he\u2019s coming off a poor season. The club could also perhaps trade Kris Bubic and his projected $6MM salary since the rotation could still be in decent shape without him. Even if the club does pinch a few pennies, they\u2019re not going to suddenly become favorites for a big free agent like Kyle Tucker or Cody Bellinger. Re-signing Mike Yastrzemski is feasible but it\u2019s understandable that president of baseball operations J.J. Picollo would check to see what\u2019s available on the trade market. Morosi mentions the Red Sox and Angels as possible trading partners. Those seem like speculative picks but they make sense. The Angels have a question in center field but have a crowded mix in the corners. Mike Trout, Taylor Ward, Jo Adell and Jorge Soler give them four options for three spots, between the two outfield corners and the designated hitter slot. Trout isn\u2019t going anywhere and Soler has negative trade value at the moment, since he is owed $13MM next year and is coming off a down season. Trading one of Adell or Ward seems like the move for the Angels, as that could clear up the logjam while potentially adding some much-needed pitching help. MLBTR put both of them on our recent list of the Top 40 Trade Candidates for this offseason. Last week, Morosi reported that the Halos would indeed listen on Ward and Adell. Ward has the better track record. He has essentially been a 20-plus homer guy for four years now. He only got to 14 long balls in 2023 but was limited by injuries to just 97 games. He just hit 36 homers in 2025 with a strong 11.3% walk rate to boot. Reviews on his defense are mixed. He\u2019s been credited with seven Outs Above Average in his career but minus-14 Defensive Runs Saved. Adell got many chances with the Angels and didn\u2019t take advantage of most of them but he has shown some promise lately. He did 20 homers in 2024 and 37 this year. His walk and strikeout rates are poor, limiting the overall value of his offense, but he was still a decent contributor in 2025. His .236\/.293\/.485 line translated to a 112 wRC+. His defensive grades were poor in center but more passable in right. Though Ward has the longer r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9, the trade value might be comparable. Ward is just one year from free agency and is projected for a salary of $13.7MM next year. Adell, meanwhile, is projected for just $5.5MM and can be controlled through 2027. The Red Sox have a well-known glut of outfield options which currently includes Ceddanne Rafaela, Roman Anthony, Jarren Duran, Wilyer Abreu, Masataka Yoshida and Jhostynxon Garc\u00c3\u00ada. Anthony signed a big extension with the club and isn\u2019t going anywhere. That\u2019s likely also the case for Rafaela, who also signed an extension and is an elite glove in center. Garc\u00c3\u00ada isn\u2019t yet proven at the major league level but is optionable and swings from the right side, a potential asset in a lefty-heavy lineup. Duran and Abreu are fairly redundant as lefty-swinging corner guys. Both cracked the aforementioned MLBTR list of Top 40 Trade Candidates for this winter. Duran has more big league experience and has shown a higher ceiling but he\u2019s down to two years of club control and will make $7.7MM this year. Abreu, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t yet qualified for arbitration and still has four seasons of club control remaining. Both the Angels and Red Sox plan to compete in 2026. If either club were to trade an outfielder, they would likely be looking for a return that would help the big league club, as opposed to prospects. Both clubs could use pitching, which is something the Royals have. MLBTR\u2019s Nick Deeds recently took a look at the club\u2019s rotation depth and the possibility that the club could leverage that into an offensive upgrade. The offseason is still young, so there are still many possible paths for the Royals to take. In addition to the Angels and Red Sox, clubs like the Cardinals, Twins, Diamondbacks and others could have outfielders available, while signing Yastrzemski or someone similar is possible as well. Photo courtesy of Jerome Miron, Imagn Images Boston Red Sox Kansas City Royals Los Angeles Angels   BaseballFan2222  3 hours ago They should offer the Red Sox a package of minor league players for Abreu or Duran.  What would the package look like?  Joemo  3 hours ago It would be malpractice to use their best resources for a \u201cpackage of minor league players\u201d.  So unless they\u2019re willing to trade Cameron or Bubic, hard pass from this Red Sox fan.  BaseballFan2222  3 hours ago I think the Royals could get Abreu for a package that includes Blake Mitchell, Hunter Owen, & Josh Hansell.  Owen and Hansell would thrive in Breslow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pitching program.  deweybelongsinthehall  2 hours ago I\u2019ve said it before. I don\u2019t see Abreu going anywhere. With his defensive value highest to Boston (50% of games at Fenway) and Henry loving metric and financial value, it\u2019s Duran that gets traded barring a return that is a true #2 starter.  The Sox are looking to win now and as to trade partners, they likely are only looking for MLB talent or low level minor league talent with multiple years before they need to be added to the 40 man roster.  I don\u2019t know the Royals pieces but I don\u2019t think what was mentioned qualifies as a #2. Are they potential talent who will not need to be soon protected?  BaseballFan2222  2 hours ago I do think deweybelongsinthehall  BaseballFan2222  2 hours ago What about Abreu and Yoshida for for a package that includes Blake Mitchell, Hunter Owen, & Josh Hansell?  Bruin1012  2 hours ago The Red Sox farm is absolutely loaded with future pitching.  They aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trading Abreu or Duran for prospects.  It will depend on what they can sign in free agency to what they need most likely a pitcher like Bubic would need to be in the return for Duran or Abreu. I guess the author thinks that there is going to be a lost year in 2027 because simple math says Boston controls Duran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s until 2029 which is three years.  BaseballFan2222  2 hours ago Bubic Is a good picture but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s injured and has not pitched since July.  The Red Sox don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need another injuried pitcher.  Bruin1012  2 hours ago If the Royals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a quality another outfield needy team like the Reds are probably a better fit.  The Red Sox will most likely be looking for immediate pitching help someone to slot in behind Crochet in a trade for either Duran or Abreu.  deweybelongsinthehall  49 mins ago Bruin, you can never have enough long term pitching assets and if they can get a #2 in free agency, a deal involving Duran for prospects could make sense provided they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to soon be protected.  cottman3  3 hours ago This Royals fan would do Bubic and a minor league arm like Beam or Owen for Duran  deweybelongsinthehall  2 hours ago Bubic is a wild card who pitched great last year coming back from a significant injury but adjusted for the park, was he much better than Giolito? For Duran, I think Boston is thinking of packaging him for someone better.  Bruin1012  2 hours ago I think in the right trade they would move Abreu and slide Anthony into right.  twentyfivemanroster  15 mins ago Bubic\u2019s success has come from adding a slider to his repertoire.  He implemented and used it in 2024 when he pitched out of the bullpen. The Royals were smart doing it this way.   It\u2019s sorra the same way the added a sinker to Ragans repertoire that saw improvekents from him. I think Bubic will be just fine, especially with him being in his prime years.  SJKinMD  4 seconds ago For Duran or Abreu, I think the guy the Red Sox would want from KC is Maikel Garcia, to replace Bregman if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not coming back.  For Love of the Game  3 hours ago Cleveland Gardeners (jardineros)\u2026love it!  MeowMeow  3 hours ago Very generous to include Yoshida among the outfielders xD Bubic could theoretically address Breslow\u2019s stated desire for a #2 starter.  ba2929  3 hours ago Unless I\u2019m missing something (very likely), I\u2019m pretty sure Duran is under club control for 3 more seasons. He\u2019s not a FA until 2029.  Bubic for Duran straight up seems like a win\/win for everyone.  Gunnar Henderson Bowman 1st  3 hours ago ba2929- The Royals would have to give up more than Bubic to get Duran. Bubic only has 1 more year left of control. I could see Bubic + Erceg for Duran or something along those lines.  cottman3  3 hours ago Erceg isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going anywhere. Best you could hope for is a lower level arm like Beam or Owens.  All Star starters are in higher demand than good but not great OF.  deweybelongsinthehall  2 hours ago I just wrote about Bubic. Who knows how he pitches on a full season schedule or in a hitter\u2019s park.  The Sox will move Duran but for someone without the injury history. Just my take.  stlcards0911  2 hours ago Bubic would instantly be the second best pitcher in Boston and regardless of control a lefty with ace potential will ALWAYS be worth significantly more the a corner OF\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if anything it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Red Sox that would have to add more  Bruin1012  2 hours ago Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize Bubic only had one more year of control hard pass the Royals would have to include a lot more than just Bubic for 3 years of Duran.  NYMETSHEA  3 hours ago What would you Red Sox want from Mets for the rights to Duran?  BaseballFan2222  3 hours ago NYM \u2013 I think it would take Vientos & Baty to get Duran.  deweybelongsinthehall  2 hours ago Lol.  Baty redeemed himself in my eyes and provides a good glove if Bregman doesn\u2019t return but both could simply end up being a Chavis or Dalbec.  For Duran, the Sox should only be looking for a starter, which the Mets don\u2019t have available.  Perhaps a three team deal could work but those are rare.  They don\u2019t match up unless the teams make other moves first that make more players trade able.  rct  2 hours ago I\u2019m not sure how interested the Mets are in Duran. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019d be a great pick up. But two of their top prospects, who figure to be MLB-ready at some point this coming season (Jett Williams and Carson Benge), have both spent time in CF. Who knows if either will stick there but I suspect they will spend resources elsewhere this offseason.  Jacksson13  3 hours ago Not much to be expected out of the group of outfielders. Their parents couldn\u2019t even correctly spell their kid\u2019s first names. That\u2019s starting a person off with one strike already against them.  Canuckleball  3 hours ago The Caglianone\u2019s misplaced a K, but the Misner\u2019s found it and made good use of it.  dano62  3 hours ago Bubic for Adell makes sense; I can also see them spinning Kolek to Dodgers for Teoscar\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  swanhenge  3 hours ago Although he is coming off a decent season as a starter, Bubic is not who I envision as Boston\u2019s goal for a #2 SP.  GASoxFan  2 hours ago Bubic is a better fit than say Joe Ryan when you look at his peripheral stats, and has age on his side. You might be able to do a trade contingent on getting a couple years extension done, considering historic earnings its probably feasible to lock Bubic up for 3 or 4 more years.  Ideally, a lower overall guarantee, but with bonuses for games started so he gets paid appropriately for either role he winds up in going forward.  swanhenge  1 hour ago All good points GA. Youth has value and he could very well could be a stud on the rise. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really kinda only been a starter for one entire season which was good. Kinda sounds like Crochet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arc. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be opposed to getting Bubic, but IMO he kinda just slots in with their 3-7 possible regular SPs. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather their #2 be if not Cease, someone in that mold\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 power, stopper kind of arm. Lots of Ks. Not many out there for sure. Sox have resources to get about anyone they want. Alcantara? Great arm, still young. Had an uneven year, but might\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve convinced himself he can go all out after surgery. Maybe improved his confidence that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t regress injury wise. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cost as much as Ryan, Gore, etc.  GASoxFan  59 mins ago The problems with Alcantara are the Marlins have, according to rumors, continued to value him at his peak production, before injury \u2013 an injury he hasn\u2019t come back from yet.  Also concerning, before we went under the knife in 2024, he threw 185 IP of 4.xx era ball in 2023. Then he bookends that with an even worse 175 IP of 5.xx era ball in 2025. Part of that was a really bad first two months. But aside from 2 good weeks in late august, he continued to look the part of a 4ish era pitcher all season.  Im not sure he has that ceiling anymore of being a true ace, not everyone comes back and regains dominance.  Someone who watched more of his games could maybe mention if the eye test showed he\u2019s changed motion or mechanics in 2023 as he tried to adapt to irritation that was building and eventually resulted in the surgery?  But 350 IP of 4.xx-5.xx ball isnt a small sample. I wouldnt be willing to pay for him as an ace without seeing much more consistency at his former talent level, and I think that\u2019s why he\u2019s still in MIA, teams dont want to either.  He may be better held till the deadline in the hopes he regains something better with last year under his belt.  deweybelongsinthehall  2 hours ago Agree.  Roper  3 hours ago Kris Bubic for Adolis Garcia makes sense for all concerned. Each with a year left on contracts. Rangers may have to throw in a couple of million or a low level prospect to make the finances equal out.  bighiggy  2 hours ago I think Garcia will be non tendered if they don\u2019t find a trade partner. Last couple years have been rough for him.  CuddyFox  3 hours ago Cardinals have a bunch of outfielders that can be included in trades. Why not have them be put in the post?  DonOsbourne  2 hours ago Noot is hurt. Burly is probably moving to 1B if they manage to move Contreras. Scott is staying put. Walker is terrible. If you like Nathan Church a lot, make a offer.  More than likely the Braves grabbed the St. Louis outfield surplus when they claimed Siani.  CuddyFox  2 hours ago Not Church, but I am thinking of Donovan.  Homerunbunt  3 hours ago I believe in the Royals front office, they\u2019ve done well the last 2 years.  The India trade didn\u2019t work out, but maybe there is still hope.  Drew waters is depth only, he just doesn\u2019t have it.  Rave is way better imo.  Massy fixed something late last year in his swing, 2B is his job to lose imo (defense there is solid). Also he looked decent in LF for India to play some 2B (massy moves to 2B if starts at LF and rave slides into LF\u2026esp if pinch running for India, etc)  Tyler McDuffie  3 hours ago Taylor Ward for Steven Zobac  This one belongs to the Reds  2 hours ago Sounds like Reds and Royals have similar outfield issues. The difference is the Royals will probably do something about it.  cwsOverhaul  2 hours ago Could envision Cincy or KC paying a premium 4-5 yr deal for Grisham off a career year since tougher for them to land FAs. Not saying it\u2019s wise, but realistic.  This one belongs to the Reds  2 hours ago I hope not.  We need someone with consistency, not the usual fly by night guys  Never Remember  2 hours ago Nick Castellanos available really cheap. Please take him.  The Saber-toothed Superfife  2 hours ago Tigers.  libertybell444  2 hours ago Castellanos, Kirkering and Banks for Estevez, zerpa and Cruz.  Bjoe  52 mins ago Pass  The_Porcupine  2 hours ago The stregnth of the royals is their starting rotation.  I wouldnt want to deplete it unless the other team is overpaying.  dlj0527  1 hour ago Unless Duran is going to suddenly get injured often, I don\u2019t want Red Sox to trade him. He leads the team in games played over the past 2 seasons and is still a very good player.  houkenflouken  1 hour ago Royals got any decent bullpen arms to dangle for Luke Raley? Had an injury plagued season last year, but hit for a 129 wRc  from 23-24. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d might turn 30 next year but making around $4m at the most.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a cheaper upside play for the royals. I think the M\u00e2\u0080\u0099s would take a decent bullpen arm like Lynch or Schreiber?  Johnny Bravo  59 mins ago Jo Adell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Flight Path Jo Adell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breakout season wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just loud it was seismic. 37 bombs. 98 RBIs. A glove that finally caught up to the hype. But the Angels need arms, and Adell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control clock makes him a trade chip with wings. So who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready to take flight with Jo? Pittsburgh Pirates: Young, hungry, and stacked with pitching prospects. Adell fits their timeline and ballpark dimensions. Miami Marlins: Elite arms, anemic bats. Adell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power could anchor a lineup starving for thunder. Cincinnati Reds: Great American Ballpark is a launchpad. Pair Adell with Elly De La Cruz and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got fireworks. Philadelphia Phillies: Already circling. proposed deal could land Adell in a contender\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lineup Detroit Tigers: If they move Tarik Skubal, Adell could be part of the return Milwaukee Brewers: Always creative, always pitching-rich. Adell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upside fits their mold. Adell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got team control through 2028. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just value it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leverage. The Angels can ask for MLB-ready arms, and they should.  stymeedone  56 mins ago Seems like the best option for KC would be to trade for another teams under utilized player.  Raley was a good example given above.  Maybe a player coming back from injury, like Matt Vierling.  Maybe a change of   scenery player, like Jordan Walker.  They need value acquisitions.
