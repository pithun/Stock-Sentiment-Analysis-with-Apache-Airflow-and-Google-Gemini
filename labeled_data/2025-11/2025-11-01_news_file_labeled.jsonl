NFTs are just code-designated image files that\u00e2\u0080\u0094for whatever reason\u00e2\u0080\u0094are worth millions of dollars. The sharing economy encourages Americans to make money off the things they already own\u00e2\u0080\u0094their houses and cars. The influencer lifestyle lets people use social media to monetize their daily activities via highly curated posts. Now, the users of various prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi appear to be scraping the bottom of the monetization barrel. The newest way to make money online? Predicting the words a person will say. Yes, there is apparently a new way to make money online, and it is to accurately predict the words that a person will say during a speech or a live appearance.

During the company\u2019s recent earnings call, Armstrong finished up by uttering a select number of DeFi terms: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Armstrong said at the end of the call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just want to add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain, staking, and Web3 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bloomberg notes that, across various prediction market platforms, approximately $84,000 was bet on whether certain words like \u00e2\u0080\u009cstablecoin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u201cmargin,\u201d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstitution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d would be spoken during the call. \u00a0 Explore more on these topics    Share this story           Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

There's a health-focused grocery chain that's opening dozens of new locations \u2014 and it's not Whole Foods. Phoenix-based Sprouts Farmers Market plans to open 37 new stores by the end of the year. The chain focuses on natural, organic, and other good-for-you groceries in a store format that roughly mimics the appearance of a local farmers market. There's no shortage of health-focused grocers these days. Besides Sprouts and Amazon-owned Whole Foods, there are also delivery services like Thrive Market \u2014 and, in all likelihood, a local co-op or health-food store in your area. Sprouts stands out, though, for its rapid growth. While its store network is a little smaller than Whole Foods' \u2014 464 for Sprouts versus just over 500 for Whole Foods \u2014 Sprouts seems to have its sights set on becoming a national retailer capable of competing with the Austin-based chain. Today, most Sprouts stores are located in the Western and Southern US. But the chain is planning to break into new states and regions where it doesn't have a presence, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast, CEO Jack Sinclair said on the company's third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. \"We're going to get to a lot more states over the next year or two,\" Sinclair said. Sprouts' comparable sales growth slowed during the third quarter as some consumers pulled back spending, the company said this week. Still, analysts at UBS wrote on Thursday that Sprouts has ways to lure in customers as the economy worsens, such as a growing line of private-label products. I went to Sprouts to see what shopping there is like \u2014 and what it brings to the table as it expands. Located near Washington, DC, Sprouts opened this store in January 2024 \u2014 apparently part of the company's push toward into the Northeastern US. I visited the store in October, so Sprouts was promoting its selection of pumpkins and other fall-themed produce. The miniature pumpkins were particularly cheap at $0.25 each. I could've used one of Instacart's Caper carts to shop at Sprouts. The carts sense what you put in them and keep a tally of your grocery bill. They also allow you to find coupons and discounts. I wanted to try Sprouts' own checkout, though, so I opted for an old-fashioned cart. The average legacy Sprouts location is about 30,000 square feet. The store I visited is about 23,000 square feet, according to the developer for the complex it's located in. Smaller-format grocery stores have become popular lately, with chains from Aldi to Whole Foods opening more compact stores than the typical 40,000-square-foot American supermarket. Most grocery stores feature fresh fruit and vegetables immediately inside the front door to help draw in customers. At this Sprouts store, though, meat and seafood were the first things I saw when I walked in. I saw these Mycelium-based breakfast patties as I walked into this Sprouts store. Plant-based foods were well represented throughout the store despite some recent sales declines for brands including Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. Swordfish fillets at Sprouts were $10.99 a pound \u2014 a few dollars cheaper than I had paid a few days earlier at Costco and than I have seen recently at a Whole Foods store near me. At home that night, I marinated the swordfish in soy sauce and garlic before baking it. I did the same with my fish from Costco. Both were good, though the Sprouts fish was a little drier than what I bought at Costco. Buying granola, rice, nuts, and other dry foods in bulk from dispensers like these is a quintessential part of shopping at health food stores. Sprouts had an aisle full of options at this store, and they were located directly in front of the main entrance. Sold under pro-surfer Laird Hamilton's brand, the latte was decent when I made it at home later that day. Signs above the produce emphasized products that were in-season and grown locally. Throughout the store, there were signs and labels like this that emphasized how sustainable the products were. Several kinds of nut- and oat-based milk were on offer. Sprouts seems to be capitalizing on the high-protein trend with these canned beverages. It's far from the only chain getting in on the craze; Starbucks' CEO recently talked about its early success offering extra protein in its drinks. These freeze-dried mangosteen pieces were a nice snack as I wrote this article. Whole Foods still sells lots of organic, healthy, and better-for-the-planet foods, even as Amazon has cut prices and integrated the chain into its broader grocery strategy. Shopping at Sprouts, though, I felt a little more emphasis on healthy foods and upstart brands than I've seen at my local Whole Foods stores lately, from the regenerative agriculture signage to these dried cherries from a brand that finds uses for cosmetically imperfect foods. While I didn't do a thorough comparison, the few items I bought \u2014 swordfish for $10.99 a pound and celery for $2.19 a bunch \u2014 were as expensive or cheaper than prices I've seen recently at Whole Foods, Costco, and other stores where I shop for groceries. Sprouts also has its own rewards program, which is free to sign up for. I visited Sprouts in the late morning on a Wednesday, so I didn't have to wait to check out. While the product selection at this Sprouts store wasn't quite as extensive as a typical Whole Foods location, I found plenty of interesting items and a big focus on health. Prices that undercut other retailers also stood out. That could make Sprouts serious competition as it moves into areas of the US where Whole Foods has a strong presence.

I started shopping at Trader Joe's almost a decade ago, as a single mother to a 2-year-old, and was impressed with the affordability and quality of everything the grocer carried. When I got married, I introduced my husband to our favorite things, and he was hooked. Now, we happily drive an hour to the Winter Park, Florida, location (just north of Orlando) every couple of months for these 13 pantry staples. We get four jars of Trader Joe's tomato basil marinara sauce on each trip. I think it tastes homemade and elevates our weeknight pasta dinners to something that feels special. We also use it to make homemade pizza. Half a bag of Trader Joe's Italian spaghetti feeds all three of us with at least one serving of leftovers for lunch. Imported from Italy, the spaghetti cooks perfectly al dente and has a slight sweetness. I've even eaten it with only olive oil and sea salt. For a quick, protein-packed dinner, I like to saut\u00e9 sliced cooked sausage with canned garbanzo beans in herbs and olive oil. It's become a household favorite. We've found that Trader Joe's garbanzo beans taste fresher than the rest, so we always stock up on them. My son loves anything ube-flavored, and I love anything that's gluten-free, so this pancake and waffle mix is perfect for us. They're so easy to mix up that my 11-year-old son has made them for my husband and me. We've eaten them with whipped cream and mixed berries for an out-of-the-ordinary (and colorful) weeknight dinner. I've been adding cinnamon to my coffee every morning for over 10 years. I consume it daily, so I want it to be good, and Trader Joe's organic cinnamon is the best I've ever had. I also add it to smoothies, baked goods, and hot cocoa. I make homemade hot cocoa nightly, using two tablespoons of Trader Joe's cocoa per cup. Just like the cinnamon, the cocoa is the best I've had. I also like to make homemade brownies and chocolate cake with it. I like to grab a few boxes of Trader Joe's organic toaster pastries for an out-of-the-ordinary treat. With a hot cup of coffee, they taste like Pop-Tarts for adults. To me, this peanut butter is a delicacy. I've eaten it by the spoonful for a quick pick-me-up, used it in smoothies for added protein, and drizzled it over chocolate ice cream for a Reese's-like dessert. My son loves salsa, but not when it's too spicy. The addition of pineapples (which he also loves) makes this one sweet enough for him to enjoy. Plus, it's full of tomatoes, pineapples, and peppers, so I like to consider it a serving of fruits and vegetables. I thought it would be fun to use this seasoning to give cooked vegetables a kick, but my son found another tasty use for it. He sprinkles the ranch seasoning blend on plain cashews for a snack that's arguably as satisfying as a bag of flavored potato chips. We love chips in our house, but I like to find lower-fat versions. I think Trader Joe's baked cheese crunchies are just as good as Cheetos, and I can actually taste real cheese on them. I never feel bad putting them in my son's lunch or eating them as a late-night snack. I've never seen these Sprinkles tomatoes anywhere else besides Trader Joe's, but I think they're like vegetable candy. I've eaten them alone, in salads, on snack plates, and in the car on the way home from Trader Joe's, paired with the cheese crunchies. Our dogs get so excited when they see us carrying Trader Joe's bags into the house because they know what's coming. These grain-free peanut butter and banana dog treats cost just $3 at my local store, so I buy three to four boxes per visit. My favorite thing about these treats is that they have real ingredients, like chickpeas, peanut butter, ground coconut, and dried bananas.

If you're one of the millions of unemployed Americans looking for work right now, it's clear the job market is tough. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in August, the number of job seekers outpaced available openings in the US for the first time since April 2021. The shift comes amid a wave of layoffs this year across major employers, including Amazon, Meta, and GM. For many out-of-work Americans, it's easy to feel discouraged \u2014 but there's still hope. WalletHub has ranked the best and worst cities in the US for job hunters, showing where your odds might be strongest and weakest. To find out where you'll have the best chance at landing, keeping, and actually enjoying a job, WalletHub compared all 50 states using 34 metrics that reflect job-market strength and economic health. These include factors such as employment growth, median annual income, average commute time, job security, and even the likelihood that artificial intelligence could take your job in the future. WalletHub found that many of the best states for jobs are clustered in New England, the Upper Midwest, and the Great Plains, with Texas being the lone Southern state. Despite their regional and industry differences, from tech in Massachusetts to agriculture in the Dakotas, these states share common strengths: low unemployment, solid job growth, and business-friendly environments. \"The best states for jobs make it easier for residents to find and retain jobs, and employers in these states also offer very competitive compensation and benefits,\" said WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo. These are the 10 best and 10 worst states for job prospects, according to WalletHub.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"InsideGOLF Fall Special: A report from the financial publication Hunterbrook alleges Phil Mickelson received inside information on an offshore oil investment. Getty Images A report from the financial publication Hunterbrook alleges Phil Mickelson received inside information on an offshore oil company and distributed that information to a private group of company shareholders. Mickelson responded on X Friday afternoon, calling the report \u201cslanderous.\u201d On Friday, Hunterbrook published a story that included a series of private messages allegedly shared by Mickelson with a group of investors for the Houston-based oil startup Sable Offshore. In the messages, Mickelson, according to the report, shared material non-public information gleaned from interactions with Sable Offshore CEO Jim Flores \u2014 a decision that could have legal ramifications for Mickelson, the company\u2019s chief executive, or both. The article centers on the latest actions of the embattled oil company Sable Offshore, which reportedly paid $988 million to assume control of a troubled oil field from Exxon off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif., and quickly attracted investors seeking a potential moonshot. From the beginning, according to multiple reports, the Sable business was predicated on a calculated gamble: If Flores could restart production from the Santa Ynez offshore oil infrastructure \u2014 a collection of three offshore platforms, a processing facility and a pipeline system that were shuttered after an environmental disaster in 2015 \u2014 the near-billion-dollar investment would look like a steal. But the 20 months since the company\u2019s creation have been far rockier than investors hoped. Sable Offshore\u2019s efforts to protect against future environmental disasters have hit a series of regulatory snags in the last year and a half. To date, the company has failed to restart production on the oil infrastructure, causing Sable Offshore\u2019s stock price to tumble more than 50 percent over the last 12 months. Mickelson\u2019s involvement in the company has been highly publicized. The LIV Golf star has tweeted more than 100 times about Sable Offshore over the 20 months, with many of those messages aimed at California legislators and regulators involved in keeping oil production shuttered. Mickelson\u2019s own past with insider trading is well-documented. In 2016, he paid more than $1 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle allegations that he had traded on inside information gleaned from the legendary gambler Billy Walters. The Hunterbrook story alleges Mickelson was more than just a disgruntled investor, revealing the contents of an X group (previously Twitter) that allegedly shows the six-time major champ sharing information taken from Flores before it was made public. \u201cI spoke to Jim this morning. An announcement is coming today after market closes. It could be an 8K or press release,\u201d Mickelson reportedly wrote to a group of Sable investors on X on Sept. 29, hours before an announcement from the company indicating it had submitted paperwork to the state of California seeking permission to restart oil production. This was one of a handful of examples of non-public material information in Hunterbrook\u2018s reporting. The Hunterbook story also alleged Mickelson was involved in a coordinated effort to drum up federal support for the Sable Offshore project, a \u201cprayer\u201d that could reverse stalled oil production and rebound some of Sable\u2019s sunken stock price. An alleged leaked phone call quoted in the Hunterbrook story shows Sable Offshore CEO Jim Flores discussing a \u201cwest coast game\u201d between \u201ca certain left-handed golfer\u201d and current U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. (Lutnick refuted that he had plans to play with Mickelson, and said he\u2019d never heard of Sable Offshore.) The legal implications, if any, of Mickelson\u2019s involvement in the story are uncertain. U.S. insider trading law stipulates that the transfer of material non-public information is not itself illegal, so long as the information is not traded upon. On Friday afternoon, Mickelson replied to several tweets about the story, arguing that he did not trade on the information he received, and that his actions in the story did not \u201cinsinuate wrongdoing.\u201d He also wrote on X of Hunterbrook\u2019s report that he \u201cwasn\u2019t on the investor call you\u2019re referring to.\u201d If Mickelson\u2019s X counterparts traded on material non-public information gleaned from him, Mickelson could still be found legally liable under U.S. insider trading laws surrounding \u201ctipping\u201d \u2014 though authorities would have to prove he benefited in some way from those trades. \u201cSo a company says I can\u2019t say anything to you but we will announce something at the close,\u201d Mickelson wrote on X. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a dilution and the stock goes down or a deal for the stock to go up. I have to wait to see what the info is, I make no trades whatsoever and am ultra ultra careful given past history. I don\u2019t even share that information is coming til after the close.\u201d Mickelson also included an accusation of his own aimed at Hunterbrook, whose unusual business model allows it to trade on information it uncovers, so long as it is not material non-public information. Hunterbrook disclosed on social media that it had not made any trades based on the findings of the Sable Offshore story. \u201cThis looks like stock manipulation on your part and slanderous,\u201d Mickelson wrote. \u201cDid you make any trades today?\u201d The story, which also suggested that Sable Offshore would soon have to raise $200 million in dilutive equity, sent stock prices plunging on Friday afternoon. At close, Sable Offshore was selling for $10.46 per share, down 18.47 percent from the day\u2019s start.

Unless you're into handheld gaming, whether that be Android handhelds or more powerful devices, you probably don't know much about AYANEO. It seems that might not be the case for too much longer, as the company is now branching out into smartphones with the AYANEO Phone. The company surprised everyone by dropping a teaser video that gives us just the slightest glimpse of what's to come. From the almost two-minute video, all we know is that the AYANEO Phone will feature the company's Retro REMAKE branding, which debuted in 2023 and brings retro-styled colorways to modern handhelds such as the AYANEO Pocket DMG and Pocket DS. From there, a silhouette of the phone begins to appear, revealing the dual rear camera setup. Initially, I was getting some Sony Xperia vibes, until I noticed that this isn't going to be just any ordinary phone. After the phone comes completely into view, you can make out what appears to be bumpers on both the top and bottom of the left side (right-side if the screen was facing you.)      There's really not much else to go off of here, besides the inclusion of the triggers and the dual-camera setup. However, after tossing a screenshot from the YouTube video into Photoshop and cranking up the brightness, we can get a better look at the design. Needless to say, it's probably a good thing that AYANEO isn't trying to go for style points here.      Technically, this isn't the first time that we've heard about AYANEO getting into the smartphone business. Earlier this year, the AYANEO Phone was teased during a livestream where the AYANEO Pocket DS and KONKR Pocket FIT were introduced. However, that was back in August, and we haven't seen or heard any rumblings about it since then. Once released, it will provide an alternative to a segment of the market that is largely dominated by the likes of RedMagic and ASUS. Of those, only RedMagic is easily accessible here in the U.S., as the company's latest phones usually arrive on Amazon shortly after they are released. Meanwhile, ASUS' ROG Phone lineup is only readily available in select markets, leaving those in the States to rely on importing or picking one up from the second-hand market. It's too early to tell which category the AYANEO Phone will fall into, as the U.S. market is notoriously difficult to penetrate, especially for newcomers.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"Has the AI boom reached a tipping point, or is it more about pandering to investors?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  South Korea is currently hosting its APEC CEO Summit, and NVIDIA's CEO took to the stage on Friday to speak about the future of AI. The keynote speech came just a couple of days after NVIDIA became the first company in history to hit a $5 trillion market valuation, a meteoric rise after becoming the first company with a $4 trillion valuation just a few months ago. A dramatic spike in valuation, such as NVIDIA and other AI firms have experienced in 2025, has naturally led many experts to suggest that the AI market is more bubble than boom, especially with the cyclical nature of investments within the industry. Bill Gates, for example, recently claimed that the world is in the middle of an AI bubble in which a lot of AI investments will be \"dead ends.\" His words came as Microsoft's FY26 Q1 financial results were made public, in which it was revealed that the company's OpenAI investments might have incurred a massive $11.5 billion loss in the previous quarter. NVIDIA's CEO, however, remains unfazed as usual. Huang believes the current market is doing just fine, and in fact, the circular system of investments and deals between AI firms is actually helping accelerate AI's growth. \"We have now achieved what is called the virtuous cycle. The AIs get better, more people use it, it makes more profit, creates more factories, which allows us to create even better AIs, which allows more people to use it. The virtuous cycle of AI has arrived.\" Huang uses the virtuous cycle analogy to explain away the almost unbelievable rise in company value since the AI boom kicked off a few years ago: \"This is the reason why you're seeing the world's capex going so fast. There are two fundamental things that are happening. First is a transition, as I mentioned, from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. Moore's law has really run out of steam, so we need another way of doing computation. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is the foundation layer for that. On top of accelerated computing, AI has now achieved the virtuous cycle.\" All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The cycle Huang is referring to involves many of the most valuable companies in the world based on market cap. Together, the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are spending more than $300 billion in 2025 to build data centers and to fund startups. NVIDIA alone is investing $100 billion in OpenAI to build new data centers, while, according to Bloomberg, it's also invested in 59 AI startups. That's just scratching the surface of all the deals flying around at the top of the stock market, and Huang believes we're only at the start of a decade-long boom that will see data center buildouts at an unprecedented scale. Every single layer of computing has been fundamentally changed. The massive sums of money might instill fear in some, but Huang has a good explanation as to why this is only the beginning of the AI boom. \"Every single layer of computing has been fundamentally changed,\" he states. \"The computer industry has been largely the same for 60 years. Now, with AI and accelerated computing, every single layer of the computing stack is being changed. All of the computers we created in the past, a trillion dollars \u2014 maybe more \u2014 of computers need to now be transitioned, shifted to the new computing platform.\" Huang adds that due to AI's position as something that \"performs work\" rather than just being another tool in the drawer, it has the ability to scale to extreme proportions. He foresees AI addressing \"$100 trillion of the world's industries\" in the future, which, if you're what I'd now refer to as an organic worker, probably doesn't help assuage the fears of AI stealing your job. (via CNBC) NVIDIA's market cap recently surpasses the $5 trillion mark, making it the first company in history to ever do so. At the time of writing, it sits at $5.024 trillion on the global market cap rankings. It's followed by Apple at $4.030 trillion and Microsoft at $3.869 trillion. A strong argument can be made for both sides of the question, but despite many experts saying that markets are currently experiencing a bubble unlike any other, NVIDIA's CEO believes that we're only getting started with a decade-long AI buildout. NVIDIA is the primary supplier of specialized GPUs used for AI around the world, and the hunger for growth in the AI sector is driving its valuation through the roof. As Huang explains, the computers built in the past must be rebuilt for AI, and NVIDIA is at the center of the evolution. No one can say for sure whether or not the current AI boom is sustainable. The vast majority of AI startups continue to fail, consumer adoption is slow, and the rest of the stock market is flat without AI revenue. Fears of energy and supply chain bottlenecks don't help. These two booms certainly share some similarities, like inflated company valuations, frantic investor hype, and concerns about business models and circular funding. Whether or not they crash in the same spectacular manner, of course, remains to be seen.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"When Milwaukee resident Zakiya Courtney saw a Facebook post advertising free grocery vouchers for food assistance recipients, she knew to drag her family members out to Fondy Farmers Market on Nov. 1. Courtney, a 72-year-old retired educator, does not qualify for food aid under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), known as FoodShare in Wisconsin. But her sister and nephew do, and they are two of nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites stuck in limbo after monthly food assistance payments did not go out Nov. 1. The U.S. Department of Agriculture maintains a $5.25 billion SNAP contingency fund intended to keep the program running in the event funding dried up, but President Donald Trump's administration argued that money could not be released during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. Two federal judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts ruled Oct. 31 that the Trump administration must use the contingency fund to resume SNAP payments, though they indicated the administration could reduce benefits or shuffle other money around to fund the program during the shutdown. The rulings gave administration officials until Nov. 3 to report back. In the meantime, residents and community organizations are left to help SNAP recipients in their neighborhood get though an uncertain few weeks. Food pantry networks, including Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin, are running food drives throughout Milwaukee and accepting food or monetary donations. Fondy Farmers Market, located at 2200 W. Fond du Lac Ave., provided $20 in free groceries Nov. 1 for every customer participating in FoodShare. Shoppers showed their QUEST card, the debit card associated with FoodShare, and received a voucher for produce at the market. The market gave out another $10 for residents of certain Milwaukee ZIP codes. \"This is something that we just felt was so needed within the community, especially today, with people feeling uncertain about food security,\" said Jazmin Wong, coordinator of Fondy's Milwaukee Market Match program. Fondy serves a high volume of FoodShare participants. It's part of the Milwaukee Market Match program, which allows shoppers to match up to $30 in FoodShare they spend on produce at participating local farmers markets. Between 2020 and 2024, the Market Match program served around 2,000 to 4,000 people per season, according to Wong. This year, Fondy had an estimated $180,000 match amount. But Nov. 1 was a much busier Saturday than the market typically sees after Halloween, Wong said. Courtney also serves as a volunteer chef at Tricklebee Cafe, a pay-what-you-can community restaurant on North Avenue in Sherman Park. On Oct. 31, she said she served more than 100 people, considerably more than she does on a typical Friday. \"People are fearful and panicky,\" Courtney said. \"It's going to be an undue burden.\" Bob Craig, 66, runs Craigland Farms in Mukwonago and has served as a Fondy Farmers Market vendor for 24 years. Nearly half of his income comes from FoodShare and other food assistance programs, he said. Craig knows the regulars and what they usually buy from him. He noticed that in recent weeks, they've become more conservative with what they purchase as they're \"budgeting, and trying to make it last.\" \"A lot of people look down at the program as a big giveaway to everybody, but it trickles right down, Craig said. \"Whatever we get, we're going to spend on repairs and whatnot, and it goes back through the communities.\" On Oct. 31, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers declared a state of emergency over the government shutdown's halting of FoodShare payments. Evers ordered state agencies to ensure all resources possible are available to residents, suspend rules impeding the state's response to the emergency and police price gouging. But much of the burden still falls on local organizations, who lack the vast resources of the state and federal government. Fondy Farmers Market dipped into its operating budget to provide the free $20 vouchers, but that's not sustainable long-term. Fondy is open two more Saturdays before ending its 2025 season, Wong said, and staff don't yet have a plan for those days. \"We're kind of taking it week by week right now with the current news and the current situation,\" Wong said.","label":0}

Let's put aside the Tesla vs. Waymo debate and talk about Wayve. The UK-based startup, founded in 2017, is yet another company that has autonomous-driving technology ambitions, but it's not building a robotaxi platform like Waymo. Nor is it a car or robotics manufacturer like Tesla. Wayve's goal is to develop a highly capable Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that it can license to other automakers. Think a flexible version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) that can be plugged into any automaker's cars. The startup is working on fully driverless systems, but it also sees an untapped market in licensing supervised self-driving technology. I tried a demo of an ADAS system powered by Wayve's AV2.0 AI driver in San Francisco, taking a nearly hourlong ride inside a Ford Mustang Mach-E. The car was retrofitted with five cameras, a radar, and Wayve's AI driver. Two Wayve spokespeople joined me for the ride to answer questions I had about the technology, along with a \"vehicle safety operator\" who was behind the wheel in case he had to intervene during the ride. In some ways, it reminded me of a Tesla robotaxi, a ride-hailing service that \u2014 in SF \u2014 operates with a safety monitor behind the wheel. My experience with Wayve didn't diminish my impression of Tesla's FSD. However, it did raise questions: How much of the advantage that Tesla claims \u2014 from complete software ownership to the billions of miles of driving data it says it has on hand \u2014 ultimately matters in developing a competent, assisted driving system? How long will it take for Wayve to catch up? And, if Wayve does, could Tesla truly corner the ADAS market if it's still only thinking about licensing its software? A Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Like Tesla, Wayve has built an \"end-to-end\" AI system, which means the software learns to drive directly from data rather than relying on engineers to hand-code rules. The AI driver scans the road using sensors \u2014 whether with cameras only or a combination of radar and lidar \u2014 and determines how to steer or accelerate based on what it has learned from real-world and simulated driving experiences. Leveraging the adaptability of an end-to-end system, Wayve wants to distinguish itself by providing a \"hardware agnostic\" software. The company says it means Wayve has software that automakers could plug-and-play into all kinds of cars, from personally-owned vehicles to commercial trucks, no matter what sensor stack it has. If an OEM only has cameras, Wayve says its AI driver will work. If a car has more redundant sensors outside of cameras, the AI driver should be able to support higher levels of automation, a Wayve spokesperson said. The proposition to automakers is that there are no additional hardware costs. \"We can integrate on any camera or sensor setup, on any system or chip, which is quite appealing to OEMs because there's no additional hardware or core costs or CapEx on their side,\" the spokesperson said. There's a lot more tech underlying Wayve's ADAS system, but most consumers will likely only want to know: How does it drive? My demo began near Moscone Center in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood during 5 o'clock rush hour. We zig-zagged through the city for a few miles before we circled back to Moscone Center. The 30-minute demonstration ended up being a nearly hourlong ride due to traffic conditions. Throughout the ride, Wayve was capable of stopping for jaywalking pedestrians and maneuvering around drivers who stood too close to the road as they opened their car doors. On Mission and 6th, a car was blocking the intersection when our light turned green. The AI driver still waited for the car to move out of the way before it proceeded. There were two or three moments where AV2.0 braked harder than usual, especially when it was inching along heavy traffic. It's a curious behavior that I've noticed in other self-driving cars. There were no moments of intervention from the safety monitor outside of taking over to park the car. A Wayve spokesperson informed me that I experienced an automated driving level that falls somewhat between what the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) labels as L2 and L3. L2 means that some level of driving is automated, but it is under constant human supervision. L3 is when a car can drive itself under certain conditions without human supervision unless the car requests the driver to take over. The spokesperson said that the safety operator did not have his foot on the brakes, pedal, or steering wheel. This is not a one-to-one comparison of Tesla's technology or progress to Wayve's. I experienced Wayve's AV2.0 in a single, supervised demonstration. Wayve's AI driver may not be in cars until 2027. Anyone can go buy a Tesla and experience FSD today. Tesla is also conducting robotaxi trials without a human directly behind the wheel in Austin. Although a safety monitor remains in the front passenger seat. Wayve announced in June that it would begin testing fully autonomous driving in London with Uber in the spring of 2026. The company was co-founded by Alex Kendall in 2017, when Alphabet was nearly a decade into robotaxi development and around two years after Tesla released Autopilot, a stripped-down version of FSD (Supervised). Tesla boasts 6 billion miles of real-world driving data collected from its vehicle fleet. Wayve collects data from multiple sources, including its own fleet of test vehicles, OEM data, and simulated driving. In March, the startup said Wayve's AV2.0 \u2014 first accustomed to the UK's right-hand driving \u2014 was able to adapt to US roads with about 500 hours of \"US-specific training data.\" Wayve announced in April a partnership with Nissan to incorporate its assisted driving technology into mass-produced vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly said that the company is in talks to license FSD to major automakers. Still, purely from the driving experience, it was hard for me to pinpoint where a passenger might distinguish between FSD and Wayve's AV2.0 system.  Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByTom Aspray, Contributor. The stock market's monthly performance exceeded expectations again in September 2025 as the S&P 500 was up 2.3% just a bit less than the 2.6% gain in September 2023. In both years, it seems as though the historically weak performance of the S&P 500 in September influenced investors.  From 2000 through 2024, the average return in September was -1.6%. That includes five years of declines of over 7%. The worst month was September 2002, when the S&P dropped 11%.  The best was the 8.7% gain in 2010. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was the top performer in October, up 4.8% while the Dow Jones Industrials gained 2.5% and the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) was up 1.8%.  Even though the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) dropped sharply late in the month, it was still up 3.6%. In the last week, the QQQ exceeded the yearly R2 resistance at $623.76 as it had a high of $637.01 that exceeded the upper trading channel on the monthly chart.  The October low was $589.05, which is now an important support level to watch. The early 2025 highs at $538 are an additional level of support with the rising 20-month EMA at $508.70. The April 2025 low retested the late 2021 high, line a, and the monthly starc- band. The NDX 100 Advance\/Decline line has been above its WMA since January 2023 and then overcame the 18-month resistance, line c, in November 2023. This was a sign that the correction from the July high was over. The A\/D line closed at a new high in October as it confirmed the price action. The relative performance (RS) moved above its WMA in March, which was a sign that QQQ was leading the S&P 500. During the sharp decline in April 2025, the RS dropped back to its rising EMA but did not close below its before turning higher. The RS made a convincing new high in October that confirmed the price action. The Spyder Trust (SPY) had a high in October at $689.70, which was short of the yearly R2 at $711.78. The chart shows that SPY has closed higher for the past six months in a row. This is the longest winning streak since August 2021. There is support now at $636.32, which is the yearly R1 and the September low of $633.16. The S&P 500 Advance\/Decline line staged a major breakout in December 2023 as the resistance from late 2021, line a, was overcome. This coincided with the successful test of the rising 20-month EMA. The SPY closed the month 17.6% above its 20-month EMA, which is the most overbought reading since October 2024. The NYSE Composite, a broad measure of the stock market, was down 0.5% in  October as it closed at 21,459, which was above the yearly R1 at 20,798 but still below the R2 at 22,500. There is also support at 20,300 and the late 2024 highs. The rising 20-month EMA is at 19,554. The NYSE Stocks Only A\/D line moved above the resistance from late 2021 in February of 2024, line a. The A\/D line broke out to another new high in August but has declined since then, even though the NYSE Composite made further new highs. The A\/D line has support at line b, and its rising EMA. The NYSE All A\/D line, which includes stocks, bond funds, and ADRs, overcame its resistance a month before the NYSE Stocks Only A\/D line. It has been leading ever since and closed in October just slightly below the September high. There is good support at line c and then the rising EMA that has not been violated since October 2023. The monthly analysis is positive, yet the weekly NYSE Stocks Only A\/D line has been diverging from prices for the past few weeks. In addition, a majority of the daily A\/D lines closed negative on Friday, with only the NDX 100 and Dow Industrials  A\/D lines closing positive.  There have not yet been new sell signals from the other key indicators that I follow, but that could change in the next few weeks. The low cash level from the Bank of America Fund Managers Survey is still a concern as it warns of a correction before the end of the year.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByErik Sherman, Senior Contributor. The witching hour. Is this about All Hallow\u2019s Eve? No, it\u2019s about tech companies \u2014 AI-focused in particular. Promise, hype, and intra-sector cross-investment has created an interesting dynamic of economic concentration and risk.  By no means is this to say that tech companies and their stocks are bad. It also isn\u2019t to say they will be good at all times and past performance is a guarantee of future returns. Technology stocks have shown strong returns, as they have in 2023 and 2024, according to U.S. Bank. The information technology sector gained 23% year-to-date on October 21, 2025. The tech-focused communication services sector gained 25%. In contrast, the S&P 500 increased by 15% and the return for the Nasdaq composite was 19%. More specifically, the so-called Magnificent Seven \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla \u2014 comprise 36.6% of the S&P 500 as of October 2025, up from 12.3% in 2015, according to The Motley Fool. In year-to-date performance, the Magnificent Seven had returns of 18.6% compared to 14.5% of the S&P 500. A big reason is due to artificial intelligence growth. Stanford University\u2019s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group calculated that corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024. Year-over-year private investment was up 44.5% and mergers and acquisitions, up 12.1%. The current AI and tech success, though, creates some structural issues.  \u201cThe S&P 500 is built on a \u2018survivor bias\u2019 basis, with companies having the most success making up the largest weightings,\u201d Vince Stanzione, former currency trader and CEO of financial publisher First Information, says. The higher the market capitalization of the company, the higher its standing in the S&P 500.  Stanzione compared two S&P 500-related exchange-traded funds: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight EFT (RSP) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). \u201cIf you compare the equal-weighted RSP to SPY, you will see the equal-weighted is doing poorly, only up around 8% [year-to-date] compared to 17%.\u201d The reason RSP did better is that it includes larger shares of top technology stocks. \u201cIt is somewhat worrying to have such high exposure in the S&P 500, and at some stage the sector will correct,\u201d he adds. \u201cFor my own trading and clients, we have also had large exposure to mining stocks \u2014 which are hardly represented in the SPY \u2014 and, even after the recent pullback, this is up 113% YTD and on a far lower [price-earnings ratio] multiple than tech stocks, so there are still opportunities in other sectors. But for those just passively tracking the S&P 500, they remain tech-heavy and will keep dancing until the music stops.\u201d The market excitement over AI is fueled by investor belief on its future. But the concentration of tech acts in a way like leverage in investing. The expectations can pile on atop the other. An example The Motley Fool gave was Nvidia. Since the end of 2015, the company has added trillions to its market cap, moving from the smallest contributor to the Magnificent Seven to the largest. That was a jump from 0.8% of the combined value to the largest at 21.2%. If you have ever seen a juggler balancing a spinning plate on a pole, then you know the plates must keep rotating to maintain their stability. \u201cThe current market continues to consolidate with outperformance limited to fewer and fewer stocks, mostly based on the promise of AI and, perhaps more compelling, spending on AI infrastructure,\u201d says Geoff Strotman of investment consulting firm Segal Marco Advisors. \u201cMany of these stocks happen to be the largest stocks in the US stock market (and the largest in history), which is quickly driving performance and valuations higher.\u201d Strotman notes that while the S&P 500 is at \u201chistorically high valuation,\u201d there are many other areas of the global stock market \u2014 US small caps and non-US stocks \u2014 that remain at average valuations. That can mean good returns with lower investment amounts. He adds that emerging markets are having a strong year, up almost 30% year-to-date.  \u201cThe emerging markets outperformance is also a reminder for institutional investors to remain diversified and rebalance into underperforming asset classes in order to take advantage of return divergence and opportunities as Emerging Markets was just about left for dead at the beginning of the year,\u201d Strotman says. However, concerns about risk from tech, or any other type of stock type, can create its own problems. \u201cThe debate over whether AI is a 'boom' or a 'bubble' is interesting, but in reality, it\u2019s a distraction to everyday investors focused on long-term wealth,\u201d says Alex Michalka, head of investments at Weatlthfront. \u201cNo one can know the answer for sure, and attempting to adjust your strategy based on a guess is a form of market timing, which historically is not a wise approach. Instead, you\u2019re better off focusing on ensuring you have a well-diversified portfolio that includes the level of risk you\u2019re comfortable with based on your situation and time horizon.\u201d In other words, if technology is an area where you find heightened risk, you don\u2019t need to run away from it. A diversified portfolio is an intelligent investment tool. Michalka mentioned direct indexing, in which you buy individual stocks to imitate an existing stock index like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq. You can look for areas of tech that gives some of the upside without being married to it.","label":1}

The Toyota bZ Time Attack Concept is what the Toyota Motorsports Garage team envisions as a BEV race car.  It's a purpose-built performance exploration, based on the 2026 all-wheel drive Toyota bZ (formerly the bZ4X).  \u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t to simply create a showpiece,\" said  Marty Schwerter, director of operations at Toyota's Motorsports Technical Center. \"It was to see how far the new bZ platform could be pushed in a motorsport setting. And that meant that we had to tackle the two biggest hurdles for any electric competition car: battery performance and aerodynamic integration.\u201d The team's solution was a hybridized approach to fabrication. Laser scanning, CAD development, and large-scale 3D printing were combined with Toyota's R&D and TRD engineering. Toyota's Add Lab in Kentucky was employed for rapid prototyping to create the one-off widebody aero system on the concept car.  The bZ Time Attack is 6 inches (15.25 cm) lower in ride height, and wider in both body and track widths. The all-wheel drive 2026 Toyota bZ  design boasts tuned electric motors to deliver over 400 horsepower (300+ kW) of output. That's compared to the stock bZ's 338 hp (249 kW). Suspension tuning comes from TEIN coilovers, while braking is provided by Alcon. Hawk pads for the brakes were derived from Toyota's 86 Cup and Corolla TC race programs. Tires and wheels are 19x11-inch BBS Unlimited shod with 305\/30ZR19 XL Continental Extreme Contact Sport 02 tires.  The interior includes a FIA-spec roll cage, OMP HTE-R racing seats, and OMP harnesses.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByRon Shevlin, Senior Contributor. Fiserv\u2019s share price collapsed by nearly 50% this week, the company\u2019s worst trading day on record. The company reported third\u2011quarter earnings of $2.04 per share on $4.9 billion in revenue, both metrics falling  short of analysts\u2019 expectations. The company slashed its full\u2011year outlook for revenue growth from ~10% to 3.5% to 4%, and dropped its adjusted EPS guidance to $8.50 to $8.60 from\u202f$10.15 to $10.30. The Q3 shortfall and guidance cut revealed that Fiserv\u2019s momentum has deteriorated. Revenue growth essentially ground to a halt, and earnings are now expected to be far lower than previously thought.  Management admitted the company had been too optimistic. CEO Mike Lyons candidly said on the earnings call that \u201cour current performance is not where we want it to be nor where our stakeholders expect it to be,\u201d and acknowledged that the challenges were largely self-inflicted by prior missteps. The fintech literati on LinkedIn are busy extracting insights from the stock price fall and making broad proclamations about what it means to the banking and fintech world: The \u201cmajor recalibration of expectations\u201d needs to be unpacked a bit here. William Blair analysts wrote that they\u2019re: \"Perplexed by a 4.5 point sequential merchant organic revenue growth deceleration and a roughly 10-point financial solutions segment revenue deceleration.\" Really? Why were they so \u201cperplexed\u201d? For years, my colleagues at Cornerstone Advisors have been writing and talking about the service issues and technology challenges Fiserv has been facing.  How do they know that? They talk to bank and credit union executives day in and day out.  Who are the Wall Street analysts talking to? It doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re talking to the bankers. They could blame the prior management team at Fiserv for misleading them, but that doesn\u2019t get them off the hook for not knowing what was going on at Fiserv. So here\u2019s the thing that no one is saying about Fiserv\u2019s stock price freefall: Wall Street has been way overvaluing Fiserv\u2019s stock all along.  Major competitors of Fiserv--like FIS and Jack Henry--haven\u2019t seen the same rise in their stock\u2019s valuation like Fiserv. Instead of interpreting the Fiserv stock decline as a major turning point in banking and fintech, it may really just be a decline in one company\u2019s stock price from irrational exuberance to rational reality.  Meaning: This doesn\u2019t represent some life-threatening crisis for Fiserv as a company. Someone said to me this week, \u201cit must\u2019ve been a tough week for Mike Lyons,\u201d Fiserv\u2019s CEO. Au contraire, Pierre--this has been the best week in his professional life.  The stock price hit was a gift from Wall Street: 1) He gets to blame the previous management team for Fiserv\u2019s problems; 2) He\u2019s given permission to make drastic cuts and changes--like consolidating 16 cores down to just 5--because everyone believes this is a \u201clife-threatening crisis\u201d for Fiserv; and 3) The starting stock price on his watch is reset to $71 from $128.  Wall Street just put a lot of treats in Fiserv CEO Mike Lyon\u2019s basket this Halloween week.   ","label":1}

Scott Adelson didn't expect to be sitting in this seat right now. \"I'm probably an accidental investment banker,\" the CEO of Houlihan Lokey \u2014 which has become one of Wall Street's busiest investment banks by deal volume \u2014 said in an interview with Business Insider in September. After earning an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Adelson started a small business and expected to spend his career building companies, not advising them. But when he joined a roughly 30-person valuation shop in Los Angeles in 1987, he thought he was making just a brief stop in the world of high finance. Four decades later, and he's still there \u2014\u00a0and now sits at the helm of the bank, having been named to the chief executive role last year, and previously serving as copresident and global cohead of corporate finance. Houlihan has come a long way from its roots as the restructuring and bankruptcy expert clients thought of when a liquidity panic was afoot. This year, Houlihan worked with financial sponsor clients like Carlyle and advised the hair care brand Color Wow on its sale to L'Or\u00e9al \u2014 part of the 240 transactions it handled through the third quarter, according to GlobalData league tables reviewed by Business Insider. To be sure, other bulge-bracket banks handle larger corporate mergers or take-privates and have surpassed Houlihan in the transaction value they work on; however, in the middle-market arena \u2014 deals generally valued at around $1 billion and under \u2014 the firm has drawn significant deal flow. During its most recent earnings disclosure this week \u2014\u00a0the bank's second quarter of the 2026 fiscal year \u2014 Houlihan announced that it generated revenues of $659 million, 15% higher than the same quarter last year. Corporate finance revenues of nearly $439 million were about 17% higher than the same period last year; while financial and valuation advisory brought in $87 million, up almost 10%. \"Capital markets are wide open and capital is plentiful,\" Adelson said, according to an earnings call transcript. \"All this has increased overall confidence in the dealmaking appetite.\" Adelson has been predicting the rebound for months. After a sluggish few years, dealmaking finally appears to have returned in 2025 thanks to a steadier rate environment, lighter regulation, and a wave of optimism about AI and technology. Adelson says the firm's ready, pointing to a strategy that's expanded its ranks while others have retreated from hiring and deepened its sector-specific coverage. \"The flywheel is catching,\" he told Business Insider, \"and we're ready for it.\" While many large banks have remained cautious about growing staffing levels in recent months, unsure how technology or other efficiency pushes will impact their compensation budgets, Houlihan has taken the opposite approach. Since early September, it's added six managing directors from companies like UBS and Capital One. They've joined Houlihan teams in the US and Europe, broadening the bank's reach in healthcare finance, mortgage technology, IT services, private equity coverage, and capital solutions. Adelson said one growth area of continued investment is the firm's capital solutions group, which advises clients on financings and balance-sheet strategies. As of mid-2025, the firm's overall head count was nearly 2,700 people, of which nearly 350 were managing directors. The hiring spree supports a broader effort to deepen Houlihan's industry coverage. \"To be able to hire through the cycles, to never really have any layoffs in an industry that has historically been known for expanding and contracting like an accordion,\" Adelson said, has brought \"tremendous\" stability to the team. Now, the firm has about 200 dedicated industry sectors, he said; each is led by senior bankers who are specialists in different fields. That's more than double its coverage from a decade ago. Within corporate finance, the capital solutions group operates as one of two engines alongside M&A. It helps companies and investors raise private capital, refinance debt, or manage their balance sheets and has handled more than 100 transactions this year, according to the company. Another part of Houlihan's expansion strategy has come through small, targeted acquisitions of boutique investment banks. Since 2020, it has acquired eight individual firms. In 2024, the firm bought Waller Helms Advisors, a Chicago-based boutique focused on insurance and wealth management. The deal added 50 people to the financial services group, including 13 managing directors, according to the company's announcement. Later that year, it acquired Prytania Solutions, a London firm that builds analytics software used in portfolio valuation and fund-advisory work \u2014 an example of how Houlihan is trying to integrate technology within its core business. Adelson said the firm's approach to M&A prioritizes cultural synergy. \"We've walked away from deals that made tremendous economic sense,\" he said, because they weren't a fit culturally. And he still considers his entr\u00e9e into banking an accident. \"I joined a really small firm and realized that I liked being the dumbest person in the room rather than the smartest,\" he said, recalling Houlihan's early days. Now, he tends to see himself as more of a builder than a banker \u2014 a mindset which he's bringing to the firm's next chapter. \"I am very much a 'looking-forward' person \u2014 what's next, what's the plan?\" he said. \"We're nowhere near what we're capable of achieving.\"         Jump to","label":0}

Tuesday brought 14,000 job cuts and fresh AI concerns. By Thursday, investors were cheering. It was a turbulent week for Amazon and its CEO Andy Jassy, marked by historic layoffs and rising doubts about AI, followed by a swift 48-hour rebound that reassured investors. Wall Street is impressed \u2014 Amazon shares hit record highs on Friday \u2014 though questions remain. \"Amazon isn't perfect, and we are seeing increasing urgency in defending their cloud leadership position and reclaiming some of the unique culture,\" Baird's senior analyst Colin Sebastian told Business Insider. \"Jassy's strategy is proving successful, even if there are still some wrinkles to work out.\" Tuesday's layoffs fueled concerns about Amazon's AI prowess, sparking questions over whether the cuts reflected slowing growth or that efficiency gains were paying off. The company said it was a preemptive move that makes it \"leaner.\" Even before the layoffs, Amazon was contending with a widening perception that it was trailing in AI, with a top Wall Street analyst calling it an \"AI laggard.\" On top of that, Amazon's yearlong push to streamline its culture and cut bureaucracy had yet to deliver stronger shareholder returns. Jassy has cut the manager-to-employee ratio by 15% this year as part of a broader push to instill discipline and reshape Amazon's culture. Until earlier this week, it was the only one of the seven largest tech firms to underperform the broader market over the past five years. Investors were especially worried about Amazon Web Services' slow growth, the company's high-margin cloud unit. Though it maintains a far larger revenue base, AWS' growth has lagged behind competitors such as Microsoft and Google. \"AWS revenue growth acceleration is a must,\" CFRA wrote in a research note last week. Amazon put those concerns to rest on Thursday. The company's third-quarter earnings topped expectations, and it raised its capital spending forecast amid surging demand. AWS reported $33 billion in sales, a 20% increase, its fastest growth since 2022. The company also made a number of disclosures that showcased its progress in AI, including: Wall Street loved what it saw. \"The AWS unlock is here,\" wrote Evercore's Mark Mahaney. Financial firm William Blair called it \"a key step in reclaiming the narrative,\" while Barclays wrote in a note that \"the past 48 hours have gone a long way to dispelling concerns.\" \"AWS is gaining momentum,\" Jassy said during Thursday's earnings call. Still, skepticism remains. AWS may have pioneered the cloud, but the rise of AI is reshaping the landscape and giving rivals fresh ways to compete. Some of its flagship AI products have failed to gain much traction. And it didn't help that Jassy sidestepped an analyst's question on Thursday to specify how much of AWS' growth came from AI versus its core infrastructure business. DA Davidson's Gil Luria, who remains bullish on Amazon, told Business Insider that AWS still hasn't matched Microsoft or Google Cloud's lead in AI mindshare, and has plenty of catching up to do. \"Amazon has been the slowest of the three hyperscalers in commercializing AI,\" Luria said. There's also uncertainty about whether the layoffs are over. Jassy said Thursday that the latest cuts weren't driven by cost pressures or AI, but by cultural alignment, implying the shake-up isn't done. \"It's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do,\" Jassy said.

On the first cruise I ever took, I happened to be pregnant and terribly sick. However, a switch seemed to flip when we arrived at the island of Key West, Florida. The sky and waters were a stunning blue, and the weather was lovely and mild. Suddenly, I felt better \u2014 and that feeling persisted as my husband and I explored the southernmost city in Florida. Though being sick on a cruise ship wasn't ideal, I'm grateful the experience introduced me to what's still my favorite vacation destination years later.  In fact, we love the city so much that we now hope to retire there.  Key West welcomes about a million visitors a year, which is no surprise given it's a popular stop on cruises and it has an international airport.  The city has a lot to offer tourists, and when I travel, I seek to indulge my love of both history and nature. Key West has plenty of both The Key West Shipwreck Treasure Museum enchants with the island's rich history of shipwreck salvage operations, which date back centuries.  Mallory Square, the city's historic waterfront plaza, serves as an outdoor market where visitors can check out local artisans, entertainers, and food vendors.  It's also where dozens of people gather each night for the island's Sunset Celebration. Yes, the sunsets in Key West are that spectacular.  On our first visit alone, we took in the island's gorgeous beaches and stopped by for a photo at the Southernmost Point of the Continental United States.  We were also mesmerized by the inhabitants of the Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory, which has dozens of species of colorful birds and butterflies.  Finally, we took a tour of the Hemingway Home, a museum established in author Ernest Hemingway's former Key West house, and were absolutely charmed by the location's famed polydactyl cats. Key West's food and beverage scene is impressive, and the island is especially famous for desserts and drinks made from its eponymous Key limes.  Coincidentally, Key-lime pie and Key limeade were the first foods I could enjoy without experiencing morning sickness, so they have an especially dear place in my heart. Key West has multitudes to offer on a savory front, too, especially when it comes to seafood.  Though it's native to the area, queen conch is no longer allowed to be harvested in Florida due to decades of overfishing. However, it's still imported and is a staple, as locals in the area specialize in preparing conch and do it very well.  Briny and sweet, conch is used in fritters, chowders, salads, and ceviche.  Don't worry if seafood isn't your thing, as Key West's Gulf Coast locale means you'll also find tasty Caribbean and Cuban fare here. My husband and I have been to Key West several times since that first visit. On our next trip there, we'll be celebrating our oldest son's 18th birthday.  It's hard to believe the cause of that morning sickness will soon be an adult, but I can think of no place more fitting to celebrate his life. I know it won't be our last trip to Key West, either. My husband and I have a goal to make the island our permanent home one day. In my opinion, ocean breezes, local history, a distinctive culinary scene, and unique attractions make the island an ideal place to live out one's twilight years. However, we're still raising our kids in Houston \u2014 a city we love just as much as Key West \u2014 and plan to stay put until they finish their education. Until then, we're looking forward to enjoying brief pockets of \"living on island time\" on our vacations.       Jump to","label":0}

Officials ordered the confiscation of the Campari Group shares from Luxembourg-based Lagfin as part of a year-long investigation into how it absorbed its Italian arm. It is accused of failing to pay a similar figure to that of the shares seized in taxes during that merger. The company said it had always acted according to tax laws. Campari - which also produces alcohol brands including Aperol, Grand Marnier and Courvoisier - said neither it nor its subsidiaries were involved in the case.  However, chair Luca Garavoglia is among those under investigation, local media reports. Lagfin - which owns more than 50% of Campari shares and has 80% of voting rights - told the BBC in a statement that it had \"always acted in the most scrupulous respect of any applicable laws and regulations, including any Italian tax laws\". Prosecutors in Milan launched a probe into the company last year. Financial police said on Friday that they allegedly found \u20ac5.3bn of undeclared capital gains between 2018 and 2020 on which it had not paid a so-called \"exit tax\", levied on firms that transfer their headquarters abroad. It is also accused of transferring its Italian assets into foreign ownership solely for tax purposes, according to Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. Mr Garavoglia, the billionaire who inherited ownership of Campari from his late mother, is implicated alongside Giovanni Berto, the head of Campari's Italian branch, local media reports. Lagfin said it will \"defend itself vigorously\" in the matter, which it characterised as a \"tax dispute\". The company stressed that Campari had never been involved \"in any manner whatsoever\" in the matter, adding that, as it held 80% of Campari's voting rights, the seizure was \"absolutely unable to affect the position of Lagfin as controlling shareholder of Campari\". One of the largest global producers of spirits, Campari is valued at around \u20ac7bn on the Milan Stock Exchange. The company has its roots in 1860, when Gaspare Campari's homemade bitter liqueur became a popular tipple among patrons of his Milan bar.  It became so successful that, in 1904, his family began manufacturing it commercially, and from the 1990s onwards the firm began acquiring other alcohol brands. Araf Saddiq has been assaulted five times, spat on and verbally abused on countless occasions. Local media reports the 69-year-old had been sitting on a wall when he lost his balance. Japan, Mexico and Peru are among the nations included in the updated Foreign Office guidance.  The bus was targeted by fans from a rival team after an earlier game, local media reports.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"How did a guitar that failed to grab its intended market \u2013 the market it was literally named after \u2013 end up becoming the instrument of choice across surf-rock, post-punk, new wave, power pop, shoegaze and more? If my house was on fire, and my wife and kids were okay, and I was told I could take only one material possession with me, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate. Well, okay, I guess my laptop would tempt me because I have a hell of a lot of my life on there. But putting that aside, I\u2019d immediately grab my Fender Jazzmaster. It\u2019s neither vintage nor very valuable in monetary terms. It\u2019s a sunburst 2012 model and it\u2019s MIM (Made In Mexico). I bought it in the Lower East Side of New York in that long-ago, seemingly mythical time when the Australian dollar was at parity with the US dollar. It set me back the princely sum of $700. I\u2019ve bought other guitars since then, but I only ever play this one live, in two different bands, and if I was pushed due to dire economic circumstances, I would sell all the others and just keep this one. It will go with me to my grave. Why? Well, that\u2019s what this story is about. I mainly play indie rock, new wave, post-punk and power pop, and this guitar does exactly what I want it to do when pushed through my Vox AC15. It stays in tune even if dropped down a flight of stairs \u2013 not that I\u2019ve ever literally done that, but it\u2019s taken knocks and always stays tried and true. It sounds jangly when I want it to and biting when I want it to. It takes off when I kick my Rat pedal. And it just looks so damn cool. Whenever I strap it on, I feel 50 percent sexier. As you can see from my photos, I need all the help I can get in that department. I first fell in love with Jazzmasters at exactly the same time I fell in love with Elvis Costello. There he was on the back cover of his 1977 debut album My Aim Is True, a dweeb who looked as nerdy as me, knock-kneed and clutching a cool, unusually shaped guitar I\u2019d never seen before. After hearing that album for the first time, I wanted to be Elvis Costello. So, naturally, I needed to play that same guitar. After doing some research, I discovered that it had a strange history. Fender introduced the Jazzmaster in 1958, and, as the name suggests, marketed it towards jazz guitarists. In that respect it was an abject failure. Suspicious of this solid-bodied, space-age looking instrument, with its bonus array of bewildering switches and dials, the jazz cats turned up their noses and stayed away in droves, preferring to stick with their hollow, big-bodied archtops. But soon, a completely different set of musicians embraced the guitar \u2013 a clutch of 1960s surf rock bands such as The Ventures and The Surfaris loved the brightness, twang and jangle they could coax from a Jazzmaster, and the instrument soon became strongly associated with surf music. Fender reacted accordingly. If you look at vintage advertisements for their offset range, they\u2019re often featured in a beach setting, in the great outdoors and in adventurous situations \u2013 two of the more memorable ones show a guy strumming a Jaguar while riding a wave on a longboard, and a bloke who has just jumped out of a plane, with a parachute on his back and a Jazzmaster around his neck (I can vouch for the durability of the Jazzmaster, but please don\u2019t try this at home, people). The slogan for many of these ads was \u201cYou won\u2019t part with yours either.\u201d Jazzmaster-heads like myself will agree that this piece of copywriting turned out to be a prophecy. The Jazzmaster was very different to Fender\u2019s other iconic models, the Telecaster and Stratocaster. It had an offset body that gave it an angular, futuristic look, two separate circuits for lead or rhythm playing, a floating tremolo, and unique \u201csoap-bar\u201d single coil pick-ups. Despite surf-rock guitarists taking up the Jazzmaster in the \u201960s, by the \u201970s they were seen as out-dated and out of step with the prevailing rock scene, as budding guitar heroes went straight to the Fender Stratocaster or Gibson Les Paul. In fact, Fender stopped producing them altogether in 1980 due to declining sales (Fender Japan would re-introduce them six years later). Subsequently, unloved second-hand Jazzmasters could be picked up cheaply in pawn shops and junk stores. And that\u2019s how they fell into the hands of power-pop, post-punk, new wave, and, eventually, alternative rock musicians who couldn\u2019t afford more expensive instruments. Apart from Costello, one of the most famous proponents of the Jazzmaster in the \u201970s was Tom Verlaine of Television, whose ground-breaking, jagged, spidery playing style came to be associated with the guitar. In the \u201980s, Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth started buying them and they went even further, cranking them, flailing at them, and making them wail and roar by doing things like jamming screwdrivers and drumsticks under the strings, creating the foundation for alternative rock. The number of musical styles the Jazzmaster helped foster continued to expand across the decades. Robert Smith of The Cure made his Jazzmaster sound both nervy and gothic. J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr made his sound like a hurricane, and Fender eventually brought out a popular Mascis signature Jazzmaster through their Squier brand. And Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine pretty much reinvented what a Jazzmaster could sound like, building massive walls of loud, woozy, shuddering feedback. That blurry photo on the cover of the band\u2019s seminal 1991 album Loveless is of a Jazzmaster. From Pops Staples in The Staple Singers through to Nels Cline of Wilco, the Jazzmaster has morphed over the years as far as what it can do in a musical context, while keeping the same iconic shape and basic functions. Since 1958, Fender has refined and updated aspects of the instrument. The latest incarnation was previewed in October at Fender Experience 2025 in Tokyo, when the American Professional Classic Series was launched.  The new Jazzmaster in this series, which retails for $US1599.99, includes many of the updates featured across the series, including overwound Coastline pickups, a modern C-shape neck, and all-new colour shades featuring a faded vintage look. But the biggest change is causing some chatter. The latest iteration does away with the rhythm circuit. For the uninitiated, that\u2019s the switch and two thumbwheels on the upper edge of the face of the guitar, which was initially designed to put the \u201cjazz\u201d in Jazzmaster, providing a darker, smokier tone that cut down the highs. Anyone who has been on a Jazzmaster online forum of late will see some disparaging comments. A couple of the more emotive ones include: \u201cThe rhythm circuit is sacred and it\u2019s blasphemous to remove it\u201d and \u201cFor me, a Jazzmaster without a rhythm circuit is half a Jazzmaster.\u201d I\u2019m in two minds on this one. To be perfectly frank, I never use the rhythm circuit on my Jazzmaster anyway. I\u2019m no jazz guitarist and I find no need for that tone. I want my guitar to sound bright, with plenty of jangle and crunch. In fact, very occasionally I hit the rhythm circuit switch by mistake, changing the sound of my guitar mid-song, which immediately engages my \u201cswearing switch\u201d. I know other Jazzmaster players who either tape the rhythm circuit switch in the off position, or cut off the small eraser from the end of a pencil and jam it into the space to prevent the switch from moving. But on the other hand, I really love the look of those switches and thumbwheels because they\u2019re such an integral part of the guitar\u2019s vintage appearance. While attending Fender Experience 2025 in Tokyo, I brought this up with Patrick Harberd, Fender\u2019s Senior Product Development Manager. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m more than aware there\u2019s been online chatter about getting rid of the rhythm circuit in the new Jazzmaster,\u201d he said. \u201cYou play a Jazzmaster, so you know that they have a lot of idiosyncrasies compared to other Fender guitars, and people have strong opinions about them. \u201cWe decided not to include the rhythm circuit to simplify the instrument, because this series is about making guitars that are reliable and as easy as possible to play, whether you\u2019re buying your first guitar, or you\u2019re a working musician. \u201cWith that said, the new Jazzmasters are routed underneath to take the rhythm circuit, so if you later decide you want to mod your guitar, it\u2019s very easy to take that path further down the track.\u201d Despite these changes, some things stay the same, and always will. Whenever I see a Jazzmaster, whether it\u2019s a new version, a beautiful 1960s vintage instrument I can\u2019t afford, or my beloved MIM Jazzmaster when I take it out of its case to play a gig, it takes me back to seeing that picture of Elvis Costello on the cover of My Aim Is True, my eyes widening and a younger me saying to myself: \u201cI\u2019ve got to have one of those!\u201d And I\u2019m so glad that I do.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"Few things are as fun in this life as waking up and making the choice to head out for breakfast. Instead of dragging yourself to the kitchen and firing up the stove before you've even had coffee, you get to have someone else do all the hard work for you, and enjoy a bunch of foods that you likely don't have the energy to consider making first thing in the morning. You know what can quickly kill the joy of going out for breakfast, though? The bill. One of the reasons why breakfast chains are so popular, and why they seem to spring up everywhere, is that they're usually reasonably priced. In recent years, though, that's been put to the test, and some of the most popular breakfast chains are now almost universally thought to be way too expensive by their customers. What's pretty wild, too, is that a lot of these chains have made their name on offering affordable, down-to-earth food. Restaurants like Bob Evans, Denny's, and IHOP, which have previously been considered value for money, are now gaining a reputation for being overly expensive. Others, like Broken Yolk and Another Broken Egg, aren't necessarily known for being reasonable, but are constantly named as not being worth it. Let's dive into the breakfast chains you should probably avoid if you want an affordable meal. First Watch has had an incredible run lately. In August 2025, it reported that it had reached a milestone of 600 restaurants, alongside enormous increases in its total revenues and system-wide sales. The chain has its eyes on dominating the market and achieving a total size of around 2,200 units. It'll only do that, though, if it can retain a good value proposition for its customers \u2014 and lately it doesn't feel like that's happening. In 2025, some people have started to feel that First Watch's food just doesn't justify its cost, with customers dubbing it being too expensive for what it is. \"It is expensive breakfast food that I don't feel [is] worth the price,\" said one person on Reddit\u00a0\u2013\u00a0one of many who feel this way. It seems as though First Watch's offer is also its downfall. In a market ruled by the likes of Denny's, IHOP, and Waffle House, which give customers hearty plates of fried foods, First Watch opts for a classier approach. Its menu of avocado toast, healthy breakfast wraps, and multigrain pancakes is certainly a breath of fresh air. However, when that simple portion of avocado toast costs $12.99, it's not hard to see why people feel like it's just not worth it. Bob Evans used to be synonymous with value for money, and the kind of place that you knew you'd get a reasonably priced, reliable breakfast from, especially when compared with Cracker Barrel. Now, however, that just doesn't seem to be the case. In recent years, Bob Evans has faced accusations of a decline in quality, combined with an increase in price, which has coincided with uncertainty around its future. Bob Evans explored a sale back in 2022, before ultimately putting itself up for purchase in 2024 ...\u00a0although it still hasn't sold. In the meantime, customers have been left pretty disappointed with what they're getting. Folks who dine there have reported paying high prices for tiny portions of breakfast food, particularly when ordering online. One Reddit user posted a picture of a skillet bowl that set them back $15, for what looks like a few spoonfuls of food. \"My husband & I have noticed that BE has gone down dramatically in quality & portion size,\" said another disappointed customer in the same Reddit thread. \"The dinner rolls are like the size of small rocks. It used to be fluffy & soft. Now it's like stale bread.\" Whether you're eating there for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it seems like it's no longer that good of an option. Waffle House may have recently gotten a boost of publicity in a Jonas Brothers song, but it seems like that band of brothers are the only people who are happy to be associated with the chain. More and more people have been turning away from the restaurant entirely, due to its hefty price rises that have left most folks unable to justify eating there. In the last five years, Waffle House's prices have risen by almost 33% on average. Although this is below the standard rate of increase for many chain restaurants, it's still 11% above the rate of inflation for 2020 to 2025. People aren't just annoyed about its base prices going up, either (although there are plenty of folks who certainly feel that way). They're also exhausted by a new fee that the chain has recently introduced, which requires customers to pay an extra 20% on all to-go orders. This has massively elevated the cost of some meals, and some long-time patrons have been left deeply frustrated by the price of their standard order becoming way too expensive. Dunkin' Donuts is typically thought to be a little more affordable than other breakfast and coffee chains. However, that reputation may soon change, if its recent prices are anything to go by. Customers have recently been feeling increasingly stung by the cost of Dunkin's food, particularly for orders that aren't really that big at all. Others have started to think that the items that they're getting don't feel worth it, with one Redditor stating that while the pretzel sliders they bought were tasty, they didn't justify their $4.99 price point, partly due to how small they were. The issue of size isn't a new one at Dunkin', either. Customers have started to notice that the chain may well be indulging in a little bit of shrinkflation when it comes to its breakfast foods, with accusations that its breakfast sandwiches have shrunk. Its famous donuts also seem to be getting smaller, and its coffees also no longer represent value for money for everyone. If Dunkin' isn't careful, it's gonna drive a lot of loyal customers away. Compared to other breakfast chains, Broken Yolk is on the smaller side. The San Diego-born concept has been around since 1979, but it's only managed to grow to a few dozen locations across a handful of states. While we can't put our finger on exactly why Broken Yolk hasn't exploded in popularity like other breakfast joints, price might be something to do with it. Customers have repeatedly dubbed Broken Yolk as overpriced, with people noting that its food is average and\u00a0not worth the cost. Not only that, but Broken Yolk has also been plagued by accusations of being overhyped, and therefore may be pulling customers in through its reputation as opposed to the quality of its food. \"By far the worst eggs Benedict I've ever had in my life,\" said one Redditor, in a thread discussing the most overrated places in San Diego. \"I can't understand why they're always packed with a line out the door on weekends.\" Others agreed, also stating that the restaurant takes way too long to give you your food in the first place, before you even have to pay for it. It's not a great look for the chain, to be honest. IHOP has never been known as somewhere that's too expensive. For much of its history, it's been known as a down-to-earth chain where you can get breakfast for a relatively reasonable price. In the last half-decade, though, that's completely changed. Between 2020 and 2025, IHOP had the highest price rises of any fast-casual chain, with its menu items increasing in price, on average, by an eye-watering 82%. That figure is almost four times the inflation rate for the same period. It's probably no surprise that customers are noticing the price hikes, and they're not happy about it at all. One person on Reddit described IHOP's menu prices as \"pure chaos,\" before listing the wild cost of additional items in their order, and asking, \"Have they lost their minds? Do they want to lose business?\" To give IHOP credit, it does seem to be aware that its prices have gone through the roof. In September 2025, it launched its first Everyday Value Menu, promising a selection of breakfasts available every day for just $6. Its only problem is that it may have done so too late to beat the reputation of being overpriced, and many IHOP pancake orders now empty out your wallet. Cracker Barrel has an image problem, folks. In the last couple of years, the chain has started to feel distinctly old-fashioned and of a different time, with the CEO even admitting in 2024 that it had lost its relevance in the modern market. This admission came at the same time as disappointing sales figures for the company, after which it announced that it would be raising its menu prices. Although the chain stated that it would only raise the cost of its food by around 5%, that seems to have been enough for it to tip fully into overpriced territory for its customers,\u00a0who have also noticed a simultaneous drop in quality. Its breakfast food has come under particular fire for being much worse than it used to be. \"I ordered Grandma's Pancake Sampler, and it was AWFUL,\" said one very disappointed customer on Reddit. \"The hashbrown casserole doesn't look or taste ANYTHING like it used to, and the ham was so salty I couldn't take more than a few bites. The sausage patty was dry and had no flavor, and there was something strange going on with my scrambled eggs.\" Seems like this chain has lost all of its charm; even its new logo is hated by customers.\u00a0 Few breakfast chains have received the blowback that Denny's has recently over its prices. Customers across the board have noticed that the cost of its food has skyrocketed, while the portions and general quality have decreased. A customer on Reddit stated that Denny's now seemed \"way overpriced,\" with portions that are \"significantly reduced.\" The customer went on to state that they \"ordered an Original Grand Slam with an extra egg. Looked like two eggs, the bacon was one strip cut into two, and sausage links have shrunk to half the size.\" This is a sentiment echoed by plenty of others who have observed that the chain is now seriously expensive, with other restaurants feeling more reasonable while having better food. For its part, Denny's hasn't been shy about pointing out that it has had to raise its prices. In early 2025, it announced that it would be adding a surcharge to egg dishes\u00a0in response to the increasing cost of eggs across the country. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the increased cost of its other foods, nor the smaller size of everything else on the plate. Plus, given that Denny's dubbed this a temporary measure, you'd expect its prices to drop back to normal once eggs did the same. It's hard to feel as though this \"temporary\" move was, in fact, a subtle way to introduce higher prices across the board. Another Broken Egg is a chain that feels pretty trendy. Although it was first founded in 1996, it has recently started to stand out a little more, thanks to its offering of classy breakfast foods that feel both comforting and a little bit special. The trouble is, if you want to enjoy eating there, you're gonna have to fork out a lot of money \u2014 and sadly, a lot of its customers don't think you get what you pay for. \"Prices at Another Broken Egg are WILD,\" stated a very honest reviewer on Reddit. \"You gotta check your credit score before you go to brunch. But when you have a chance to overpay for an average meal, you gotta take it.\" One thing that seems to stand out for people who eat at Another Broken Egg is its fairly chaotic nature. When you're paying almost $12 for a single waffle, you can at least expect it to arrive promptly at your table \u2014 but people have noticed that service times are seriously lengthy, staff turnover is high, and morale is low. On top of all that, the food just isn't that great. It feels like yet another franchise that's had a lot of hype, but it isn't necessarily all that earned.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"        Brian Mann                        John Davis, 62, says he decided not to have children. He's part of an environmental group called the Rewilding Institute that supports returning land to natural habitat. \"We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people,\" he told NPR.                                                           Brian Mann\/NPR                                       hide caption  Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series\u00a0Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World\u00a0explores the causes and implications of this trend. On a late autumn day, John Davis hiked through what looks like wild forest in New York's Champlain Valley, surrounded by flaming red maple trees and yellow birch. A bird flushed noisily through the undergrowth. \"Look there, a ruffed grouse,\" he said, his delight obvious.     This place is an example of what Davis calls \"rewilding,\" which means the footprint of human activity has begun to fade.   \"It simply means stepping back and letting nature unfold as it will,\" he said. \"Some of this was farmed as recently as the 1990s. Probably used for sheep pasture and certainly for logging. You're seeing old stone walls.\" Populations in many countries are beginning to age rapidly and gradually decline, in large part due to individuals choosing to have fewer children.   It's a trend that alarms many experts, and politicians, who say the fabric of whole communities could unravel, but many activists, researchers and economists also see big upsides. This part of New York state, Essex County, has lost about 6% of its population since 2010 due to out-migration and the declining birthrate.     Davis, who works for an organization called the Rewilding Institute, says the pivot toward fewer people is allowing landscapes like this one to heal. \"I have a perhaps unpopular view on human population, I believe we are too many and we consume too much,\" he said. \"We need to encourage a small family ethic, especially among affluent people.\"                  At a rally in 2024, climate activists carry a banner opposing consumerism.  Advocates for population decrease believe fewer humans could mean less consumption, a drop in carbon pollution and a restoration of wild habitats.                                                           UCG\/UCG\/Universal Images Group via G\/Universal Images Group Editorial                                       hide caption  The global population has doubled to more than 8 billion since the 1970s. Davis thinks that growth turbocharged consumerism and accelerated climate change and the loss of wildlife habitat.  \"I love kids, we all love kids,\" Davis said. \"But if we could encourage small families, we'd have a better chance addressing not just the extinction [of species] and climate crisis, but also problems of poverty and inequity.\"  That hope is being tested, as the \"small family ethic\" championed by Davis and other activists arrives in much of the world.   Since the 1970s, researchers say family size dropped by more than half, from about five children per woman on average to roughly two, according to the latest United Nations data.   Actual population decline has already begun in about half the G7 industrialized countries that make up much of the world's economic activity.   Every one of those countries, including the U.S. has fallen below the so-called \"replacement rate\" of births needed to maintain a stable population over the long term.   Without large-scale immigration, the U.S. will join the list of countries losing population in the coming decades. Experts say the trend is driven in large part by women choosing to delay having children, having fewer kids, and in many cases, deciding not become mothers at all. \"I just really wanted to do other things with my life,\" said Marian Starkey, who told NPR she and her husband opted not to have children.   \"Most of my friends here don't have children.  People have made the decision they also want to do other things with their lives than raise children.\"  Starkey works with a group called Population Connection that advocates in favor of policies that support this shift toward smaller families and gradual depopulation.   According to Starkey, fewer people will mean a healthier environment, but she also thinks the trend is good news for humans.   \"The smaller families are, the more time and wealth there is to invest in each child, making sure all of your kids get an education, which does not happen in all parts of the world, especially for girls,\" she said. Many experts are voicing deep concerns about this population shift. They say it's not clear how economies and family structures that have relied for decades on steady growth will function as communities age and begin to decline.   \"I think this has huge implications for which we're not prepared as a society,\" said Martina Yopo-D\u00edaz, a sociologist at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, who studies population loss, in a July interview with NPR. \"Key social systems, from the economy to the labor market to pensions, are based on the principle that there will be new generations to replace the old ones. But now we see that that principle is no longer something that we can, you know, take as given.\" But NPR also found experts who who view this as a hopeful moment, part of a decades-long trend with benefits for the environment, families and women. Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, said fears about declining population are overblown. She says there's evidence people are happier when free to decide for themselves if and when to have kids.   \"To have the number of children they want to have, and to have them at the right time in their lives, is certainly a benefit to couples,\" she said.   None of the advocates for lower population interviewed by NPR favor efforts that force people to have fewer kids, like China's infamous \"One Child\" policy, which ended in 2016. Instead they support access to reproductive freedom, family planning information, and contraception. Goldin and other experts said the biggest single upside to the trend toward smaller families may be improvements in the lives of women and girls. Research shows delaying motherhood and having fewer children often leads to more education, more financial security and better health.  \"The ability of women to decide how many children to have and when to have them, it's something that is a very positive development in the history of mankind,\" said Vladim\u00edra Kantorov\u00e1, the lead population scientist at the United Nations.   Kantorov\u00e1 points to the fact that much of the falling birthrate in the U.S. and around the world reflects a plunge in teen and child pregnancy. \"Adolescent child bearing has declined everywhere, so this is something that is really a success story,\" she said. Those who see advantages in this population shift generally agree that smaller families and declining birthrates will bring serious policy challenges. Finding workers, maintaining a strong economy and weaving a sense of community could be more difficult in many areas.                   John Davis, 62, chose not to have kids and he thinks smaller families and a lower human population will help solve problems like climate change and habitat loss.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. ServiceNow beat Q3 revenue and earnings estimates, raising its 2025 full-year guidance, reflecting strong and consistent operational performance.Growth is driven by high demand for AI-infused services and a 30%+ increase in U.S. federal contracts, with AI platform revenue targeting $1 billion by 2026.A 5-for-1 stock split is planned to boost retail investor access, and analysts project a 22% stock price upside despite current valuation concerns. ServiceNow stock has fallen 12.8% so far in 2025 while the Nasdaq rose 22%. After the business software company beat expectations and raised guidance Wednesday, the stock perked up. However, by the end of October, much of that gain had evaporated. Does this represent a buying opportunity for investors? Although the stock fell throughout much of the year on fears of macroeconomic damage from the current administration\u2019s economic policies and a high stock valuation, there are compelling reasons the shares could rise: ServiceNow is pleased with its performance. \u201cWe are very, very excited about the results,\" ServiceNow President and Chief Financial Officer Gina Mastantuono told me in an October 29 interview.  \"ServiceNow is a durable, consistent, overperforming software company. With rule of 50 performance. We have achieved more than 20% revenue growth every fiscal year for the past decade,\u201d she added. The AI boom helped ServiceNow top third-quarter estimates and lift its guidance as it benefits from the AI boom. With an extra boost from the company\u2019s announcement of a 5-for-1 stock split, shares rose 4% after Wednesday\u2019s market close, according to CNBC. Here are the key results: ServiceNow is helping enterprises use AI. \u201cEvery enterprise in every industry is focused on AI as the innovation opportunity of our generation,\u201d CEO Bill McDermott wrote in a release. The results are the \u201cclearest demonstration\u201d that businesses rely on ServiceNow for these capabilities, he added. ServiceNow said its third quarter results and guidance beat expectations.\"Revenue beat by 100 basis points, operating income beat by 300 basis points, and our free cash flow margin increased 50 basis points, Mastantuono told me. \"If you execute with discipline, results follow,\u201d she added. \"I am excited about raising our top line guidance and increasing our free cash flow margin guidance from 32% to 34%. We are achieving this because we are drinking our own champagne. Our business model is resiliency, scalability, and industry leading,\u201d she concluded. ServiceNow\u2019s government contract revenue growth defied investor pessimism about the headwind of government uncertainty. In addition, ServiceNow provided evidence of customers getting value from the company\u2019s AI-infused services. For instance, in Q3 the company\u2019s U.S. federal business grew more than 30%. \u201cWhenever the government reopens, the administration\u2019s continued focus on cost efficiency and modernization aligns directly with our strengths,\u201d said Mastantuono, according to CNBC. \"There was uncertainty due to DOGE and other factors, but the business continues to rock,\u201d she said in our interview. While many companies are not earning a return on their investment, according to an MIT NANDA study, some of the ones that are earning such a payback are ServiceNow customers. \u201cWe are helping companies achieve a return on AI,\" Mastantuono added.  This return is coming from ServiceNow\u2019s AI Control Tower \u2013 software to onboard, monitor, and manage AI agents -- which is driving an increase in net new artificial intelligence ACV. \u201dWe are offering large companies trust, governance, security, and real ROI built into the platform,\" she said.  For example, Alta Beauty uses AI Control Tower free associates in 1,400 stores from manual tasks so they can focus on the customer experience. Astra Zeneca uses the product to help them achieve their goal of introducing 20 new medicines by 2030. \"Our product reduces the time to do material requests from 30 minutes to seconds,\u201d she concluded. Another potential positive for the stock is ServiceNow\u2019s pending stock split. The reason? The much lower per share price \u2013 which would be about $184 a share at the October 31 price will \u201cmake our shares affordable for retail investors,\u201d Mastantuono told me. ServiceNow sees demand for its stock because these investors want a piece of the software company\u2019s AI momentum. \u201cWe know that there are consumer investors, not just large institutional investors, that want a piece of our company, and we want to make it easy for them to be involved,\u201d McDermott told MarketWatch. Analysts say ServiceNow stock may be overvalued. Indeed, the stock trades at a forward price\/earnings ratio of 54.69 -- roughly 2.2 times the sector median premium of 25.22x. This represents a \u201csignificant premium to sector peers which may limit near-term upside,\u201d according to SeekingAlpha.  What\u2019s more ServiceNow faces competition \u2013 such as Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce \u2013 and sells its services at a high price. Should buyers become more price-sensitive, ServiceNow might lose customers or choose to lower prices. How so? ServiceNow is \u201cconsiderably more expensive than many competitors due to its complex features, opaque pricing, and high implementation costs,\u201d according to SmartSuite, which found prices from public sources \u201cranging between $50,000 and $500,000 annually.\u201d ServiceNow says customers are paying more because they like the company\u2019s hybrid pricing model which combines a \u201ctraditional subscription-based component with a consumption-based one for AI-powered services,\u201d noted MarketWatch.  ServiceNow is bullish about its stock. \u201cI think a lot of people are looking at the headlines today saying \u2018wow, I\u2019m seeing layoffs, I\u2019m hearing CEOs saying they\u2019re not getting their money out of their proof of concepts, and then ServiceNow is hiring,\u2019 \u201d McDermott told MarketWatch. \u201c \u2018They\u2019re beating and raising. They\u2019re splitting their stock.\u2019 \u201d Analysts see considerable upside in the stock. Wall Street\u2019s average price target is $1,124.82 \u2013 implying ServiceNow stock could rise 22%, TipRanks noted.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin disappointed traders in October, failing to meaningfully break above its previous all-time highs even as the Federal Reserve started the countdown to a bitcoin price game-changer. Sign up now for CryptoCodex\u2014A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has dropped back from a peak of $126,000 per bitcoin, sparking fears of a $100,000 \"death knell.\" Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk sets bitcoin alarm bells ringing, U.S Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has issued a surprise bitcoin endorsement, triggering speculation he\u2019s sending the market a \u201csignal.\u201d Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex\u2014A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run \u201c17 years after the white paper, the bitcoin network is still operational and more resilient than ever,\u201d Bessent posted to X, adding: \u201cBitcoin never shuts down,\" in a jab at the U.S. Democratic Party over the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u2014\u201cSenate Democrats could learn something from that.\u201d The bitcoin white paper, published by the anonymous person or group of people going by Satoshi Nakamoto on October 31 2008, is just nine pages long and outlines how the bitcoin network would work. Bessent\u2019s comments were seized on by bitcoin and crypto traders as a sign that the Trump administration remains committed to the technology. \u201cPay attention to the signals. This is a signal,\u201d James Lavish, a director at bitcoin treasury company and asset manager Strive, posted to X. In August, Bessent triggered bitcoin price volatility when he suggested the U.S. government wouldn\u2019t buy more bitcoin for president Donald Trump\u2019s promised U.S. bitcoin reserve to rival its gold reserve, as well as revealing the U.S. holds far fewer bitcoin than previously thought. Bessent sought to clarify his comments on X, saying: \"Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the president\u2019s promise to make the United States the 'bitcoin superpower of the world,'\" and calling the \u201cbitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government ... the foundation of the strategic bitcoin reserve that president Trump established in his March executive order.\u201d Since then, president Donald Trump has been revealed to be one of America\u2019s largest bitcoin investors and has recommitted to making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. Sign up now for CryptoCodex\u2014A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Meanwhile, many bitcoin and crypto market traders are betting the bitcoin price rally expected in October will now happen in the final two months of the year, pointing to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continuing to buy more bitcoin and the Federal Reserve further cutting interest rates. \u201cOur base case sees bitcoin rising towards $140,000, with total ETF inflows between $10 and $15 billion not being surprising,\u201d analysts with the cryto exchange Bitfinex said in emailed comments. \u201cOur view is that October demonstrated resilience, with an all-time-high crash and rebound marking a reset in the bull cycle. November may extend gains towards the $140,000 base case as ETFs and a dovish Fed policy support momentum. For most investors, bitcoin continues to serve as a hedge amid currency volatility.\u201d","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByEwan Spence, Senior Contributor. Google\u2019s Pixel 10 family kicked off a wave of Android 16 powered smartphones wen they launched in August and herald Google\u2019s next steps in mobile AI and introducing a building block of an agentic-ai user interface. Yet there\u2019s one more Pixel 10 handset to be released. When will see what the disruptive Pixel 10a is bringing to the market? The Pixel A series is essentially the mid-range smartphone of the Pixel family. They echo many of the tastes and trends of the both the vanilla and the Pro models of the family, although some compromises in specs and construction are made to bring the price down. One of the key similarities is in the main chipset; since the Pixel 6a, the A series have all shipped with the same Tensor Mobile as the more expensive devices. You should expect the Pixel 10a to come with the same Tensor G5 silicon as the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.  Given Google\u2019s focus on artificial intelligence and optimising the Pixel smartphones for day-to-day use rather than ultimate power, the core functionality remains. The Pixel A cameras have been an area where the balance of power and value for money can be apparent. Last year\u2019s Pixel 9a main camera lens was he same as that of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and adde a 13 megapixel ultrawide camera lens into the mix. If the Pixel 10a follows a similar route of using the 10 Pro Fold\u2019s camera components, and the same approach to color realism and dynamic contrast, then the package is going to be one of the better ones in the mid-range. Of course a notable majority of photography in smartphones comes down to the software and here the emphasis on local AI processing will be of benefit to post-processing of images and any subsequent editing by the user. In a head to head the more camera focused Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL models will offer higher quality images, but with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold delivering above-average results, I\u2019d expect similar specs and output on the Pixel 10a. There are compromises in some areas \u2014 such as the camera \u2014 to keep what Google considered important enough to be on a par with the main line; the aforementioned focus on artificial intelligence both in the cloud and on the device. Given the Pixel 10 launched at the same price as the Pixel 9 ($799 in the US), there\u2019s a strong chance that the Pixel 9a\u2019s price of $499 will carry over to the Pixel 10a (These are all for the 128 GB variants). If you look at what that \u00a3300 gave you on the Pixel 9 versus the Pixel 9a, you find that you have a premium feel to the materials and design, an improved camera, with everything else broadly similar. There\u2019s a strong argument to wait for the Pixel 10a if you are looking for a straightforward phone with 2025 specs. The Pixel 8a was launched in May 2024, while the Pixel 9a arrived two months earlier with a mid-March launch. These have to be seen in context with the respective Pixel 8 family and Pixel 9 family launches. Given that, it\u2019s likely that the Pixel 10a will be revealed during march, with sales commencing shortly afterwards. There\u2019a also an interesting question over the competition that Google will face. Last march saw Apple remove the mid-range focused iPhone SE from its product line and launched the iPhone 16e in the same period as the Pixel 9a. That resulted in countless head-to-head comparisons with many giving the nod to the Pixel 9a as the better choice given the price, camera, and hardware specifications. Will Apple have an iPhone 17e ready to go, or will the iPhone 16e, much like the iPhone SE it replaced, stay on as the mid-range phone in Apple\u2019s portfolio? Or will the Pixel 10a rule the mid-range roost as the unopposed champion? Now read the latest deals and special offers Google has for new Pixel customers...","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"With the launch of the iPhone 17 lineup this fall, Apple debuted a new accessory \u2013 the crossbody strap. It certainly received lukewarm reception, but after trying one out, I actually think it\u2019s a rather nifty concept. At least, if you\u2019re the right person for it. In case you don\u2019t know, Apple\u2019s new crossbody strap for iPhone is an adjustable strap that works with their official cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. It has two anchoring points on the bottom corners of Apple cases. This does mean that you have to go deep into Apple\u2019s accessory offerings to utilize it, by both purchasing their official crossbody strap for $59, and by purchasing an Apple case for $50-60. Luckily, there are a good number of third party crossbody strap options on the market. I personally used one from Orbitkey, which comes in at $35 and will work with any iPhone case. This strap isn\u2019t really the focus here, but I will say, it\u2019s really well made.  When talking about crossbody straps for a phone, most people immediately think: \u201cWhy not just put your phone in your pocket? This seems unnecessary.\u201d And sure, that\u2019s been the approach for over a decade now, and if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. That said, as someone who lives in New York City and often takes my phone in and out of my pocket while walking, I actually found that having a crossbody strap was rather useful. It saved me that bit of time, and made my phone more accessible. Is that a game changer? No. That\u2019s why I ultimately wouldn\u2019t invest in Apple\u2019s crossbody strap. It\u2019s too expensive for something that\u2019s just slightly nifty.  The convenience factor is there, though, and it\u2019s enough for me to say that I actually like having one. Sure, it\u2019s a bit different \u2013 but I will say, it\u2019s rather satisfying being able to just drop your phone when you\u2019re done using it, rather than having to slide it into your pocket. My wife has one (not Apple; a cheap one, more like a \u2018refined adjustable shoelace\u2019 lol) and has for a while.  Seems there\u2019s a few use cases for her: She loves how easy it is to have her phone just under her jacket She can get to it quicker than if it was in a jacket pocket She can\u2019t fit her phone in her trouser pockets (apparently women struggle with this as their pockets aren\u2019t as deep as men\u2019s trousers) It adds security at events It makes it easy to keep hands free for longer when dog walking (her job) All in all, the crossbody strap is one of those accessories that you\u2019d have to try before you understand. If you\u2019re someone that drops your phone a lot, uses your phone as your primary camera, or someone who walks outside a lot, it can be a rather nifty accessory. Are you someone who\u2019d consider a crossbody strap for your iPhone? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments.

According to the GSMA database, vivo might be preparing an international version of the X300 Ultra because the handset has appeared with a different model name that doesn't match the usual naming scheme for vivo's Chinese handsets. The model name in question is V2562. That's great news for users who have settled for the standard and Pro versions of the vivo X phones, since there was no Ultra model available. Luckily, vivo couldn't pick a better time to release its Ultra model to the global market, as rumors so far suggest it's going to be an absolute camera powerhouse. It's said to be the first phone with two 200MP sensors and it will likely use Sony's new 200MP sensors for its main and telephoto cameras.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByDavid Hochman, Contributor. You have to admire the audacity of a wine bar that plants itself in Marina del Rey\u2014land of Costco runs and bachelor dad apartments\u2014and announces it will be serving \"Pizza & Philosophy.\" The website for Stoa Wine Bar and Market features a chiseled model feeding himself grapes on a yacht somewhere. The menu promises \"meaningful experiences that disguise themselves in the mundane.\" There are conversation cards. The happy hour is called \"Eudaimonia,\" after the ancient Greek term for true happiness. This better be good. At 4 p.m. on a weeknight, Stoa sits mostly empty in a neighborhood better known for Mother's Beach than Marcus Aurelius. Inside, there are little nooks, a wall of books and a shop selling the kind of imported Italian chocolates and tinned fish that make you at least feel virtuous about your $40 impulse purchases. The space has the carefully curated coziness of someone who's thought very hard about the Stoic principle of apatheia\u2014and also about Instagram lighting. The owners, Constantine Savvides and Richard Peters\u2014who also run The Hive, a high-minded superfood caf\u00e9 in Mar Vista\u2014have committed to the bit entirely. Their menu speaks of \"simplicity, intentionality, and the joy of savoring the present.\" At happy hour, there's a \"pre-alcohol shot for an easier morning after drinks\" (the Zbiotic is $8). A \u201cteam\u201d \u201ccurates\u201d five selections of meats and cheeses for your $22 chef's board. For $12 a glass, you can sip a French red called \"Tout Bu or not Tout Bu.\" But that is not the question. As guests arrive\u2014first young families from nearby apartments, then the Waymos pulling up from Venice and beyond\u2014the courtyard transforms into something you'd find in a hill town on the Ligurian coast. Plates of glistening meatballs and vodka pizza emerge from the kitchen as good-looking strangers gather at a communal table built around a tree. Seneca Spritzes flow like it's golden hour on a terrace overlooking the Adriatic. Two women throw their heads back laughing, like the \u201cafters\u201d in an Ozempic ad. No, the real question is: How can this be the Marina? Roll your eyes about how hard Stoa is trying, calling themselves \"a modern-day porch for the Westside\u2014part market, part wine bar, wholly intentional.\" But here's the thing. Between the amaro nonino selection (outstanding) and the butterscotch budino (excellent), they somehow pull it off. The Stoicism isn't just marketing copy next to the $11 glasses of Muscadet. People are present. They're actually talking. Phones are mostly down. Conversation flows. Someone's answering those conversation cards\u2014in what ways do you compromise who you are? what would your younger self be proud of?\u2014and it doesn't feel forced or pretentious or like a bit. It feels, against all odds, like exactly what we need right now. You came for the ironic distance. You stayed for the meatballs and the magic. Sometimes the most radical thing you can do is create a space where people remember how to be together. Even\u2014and maybe especially\u2014in Marina del Rey, where nobody would think to look for transcendence; Stoa found it anyway. And the good news about an early happy hour in the Marina is, Costco stays open till 7. MORE FROM FORBES","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByPatrick Gleason, Contributor. Next Tuesday, November 5, New York City voters are likely to elect a new mayor who has campaigned on income tax hikes for upper-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, that same day, Texas voters are expected to approve ballot measures banning state taxation of capital gains and the imposition of a financial transactions tax. The heightened contrast is sure to help the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), the new Dallas-based stock market set to launch in 2026. An October 31 Wall Street Journal report about a new $90 million commitment to the TXSE from J.P. Morgan, the investment bank of JPMorgan Chase, noted that the TXSE \u201chas billed itself as more CEO-friendly\u201d than the New York Stock Exchange, adding that \u201cprevious investors include Citadel Securities, BlackRock and Charles Schwab.\u201d The new infusion from JP Morgan, the WSJ added, \u201cbrings TXSE\u2019s total fundraising to date above $250 million.\u201d Ballot propositions banning a state death tax, a financial transactions tax, and a capital gains tax aren\u2019t the only 2025 ballot measures that are set to make Texas an even more attractive destination to live, work, and invest. Texas voters will have the opportunity to enact reforms that provide further tax cuts, particularly property tax relief. Polling shows Texas voters are likely to approve Proposition 13, which will provide property tax relief to Lone Star State residents through a 40% increase in the homestead exemption. The state\u2019s $100,000 homestead exemption would rise to $140,000 if voters enact Proposition 13 next Tuesday. \u201cWhile not a permanent fix to property taxes, the amendment should help slow the growth of property taxes for all homeowners,\u201d says Texans for Fiscal Responsibility (TFR), who has endorsed Proposition 13. While Proposition 13 seeks to provide relief for all property taxpayers in Texas, Proposition 9 would provide relief from the business personal property tax, commonly referred to as the inventory tax, to small businesses across the state. If approved, Proposition 9 would significantly increase the existing $2,500 inventory tax exemption, raising it to $125,000. \u201cTexas is one of just nine states where small business owners pay taxes on the value of their inventory for sale, their personal property, and everything else used to generate income,\u201d noted the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019s Texas chapter in its statement of support for Proposition 9. NFIB adds that passage of Proposition 9 \u201cwould save Texas small businesses over $500 million annually,\u201d and \u201cmake Texas even more competitive amongst its neighboring states.\u201d \u201cThis constitutional amendment simplifies compliance, reduces bureaucratic costs, and incentivizes productivity,\u201d notes TFR\u2019s analysis of Proposition 9. \u201cIt cuts down on burdensome taxation that can stifle economic growth, especially for small operations. This is a pro-growth, pro-business reform that respects taxpayers and limits government overreach.\u201d The ballot measures that Texas voters will likely approve on November 5 underscore why governors and legislative leaders in so many states are pursuing a phaseout of their income tax that would have them join Texas in the club of no-income-tax states. The eight existing no-income-tax states have already demonstrated the economic benefits of avoiding an income tax, and many are now seeking to expand that advantage by making their tax codes even more competitive.  Texas isn\u2019t the only no-income-tax state where legislators are pursuing property tax relief. In fact, in no-income-tax Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is now pushing for a full phaseout of property taxes in Florida. In particular, Governor DeSantis is championing a single measure for the 2026 ballot that would begin phasing out all property taxes in Florida. Republicans in the Florida House of Representatives introduced eight property tax relief proposals on October 17, with seven of them being constitutional amendments requiring voter approval in November of 2026. Constitutional amendments must receive approval from at least 60% of voters in order to be enacted. The James Madison Institute, a Florida-based think tank, recently conducted a poll that found 65% of those surveyed said they would support a ballot measure to provide property tax relief. Lawmakers in other states are also pursuing property tax relief or limitation in the coming year. In no-income-tax Tennessee, for example, legislators will seek to pass a bill in 2026 that limits the growth of property tax bills. Tennessee is currently one of only four states without some form of property tax limit on the books. \u201cTo provide relief for taxpayers, we must set firm limits on how fast local governments can grow their budgets,\u201d Justin Owen, president of the Beacon Center of Tennessee, and John Hendrickson, policy director at Iowans for Tax Relief, wrote in an October 17 article in Governing Magazine. \u201cThis will ensure that taxes do not outpace the ability of families and businesses to pay. Taxpayers must be protected from unchecked growth in local government spending.\u201d \u201cEliminating property taxes may be a noble solution, but tax policy should always be approached with prudence,\u201d Owen and Hendrickson added. \u201cReplacing property taxes with a new tax or raising an existing tax to a higher rate, or even shifting more responsibilities to the state budget, are not necessarily sound tax policies. The best approach to lower taxes is to limit local government spending.\u201d There were already plenty of reasons for lawmakers in no-income-tax states to pursue property tax cuts, property tax limits, and other forms of tax relief. But the case for doing so is strengthened by the fact that, at present, governors and legislators in nearly a dozen states across the country are seeking to phase out their income taxes. As more states eliminate their income tax, the lack of a state income tax will become less of an advantage. Leaders of no-income-tax states \u2014 such as Governors Abbott in Texas, DeSantis in Florida, and Lee in Tennessee \u2014 have made clear they are not resting on their laurels and that they welcome the competition.","label":1}

Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam! It was painfully obvious what the extraterrestrials on board 3I\/Atlas were thinking, they\u2019d heard from across the universe about Bitcoin and were eager to invest,  the blue light emanating from the spacecraft an attempt to fill a buy order, alas out of range yet. Could be.  I heard they were arriving just in time for the Chiefs\/Bills game.  The plan was to land on the 50 yard line just before game time and auction off Gort to the highest bidder.  Maybe to raise funds to buy that Crypto? \u2026what sort of forty time does Gort got? Wukchumni and Henry Moon Pie: klaatu barada nikto The interesting thing about the interpretations of 3I \/ Atlas is that the asteroid is beyond the Sun. So it is cutting through the solar system at a time when no one on Earth can see it \u2014 blocked by the Sun and too far away. And, yes, it has many weird qualities. \u201cThere are more things in Heaven and Earth, Milton Friedman, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\u201d  Nevertheless, it has also arrived at an astrologically volatile time. All of the majors \u2014 Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter have gone into (and sometimes out of) retrograde in the second half of 2025. Mercury is due to go into retrograde again on 10 November in Sagittarius, the sign that 3I \/ Atlas emerged from. This fashion mag gives a highly detailed horoscope: https:\/\/www.russh.com\/every-retrograde-in-2025\/ When the biggies \u2014 Jupiter, his brother Neptune, their dads Saturn and Uranus, gods of time \u2014 all move together, even the skeptics among us (and I\u2019m fairly skeptical) should take notice. Some \u201cdeep astrologers\u201d think that we are receiving a signal of moving collectively into a new epoch. So there is life after Trump Derangement Syndrome. Maybe Jupiter can detach the claws of Bill and Hillary from the Democratic Party. Is Zohran Mamdani a sign of a new age of Saturn, peace, prosperity, and low-cost groceries? The golden toilet in the White House remains unexplained. [I will consult my patron, Mercury, who is more or less in charge of grocery stores.] After 3I\/Atlas touched down on the White House lawn and Atalasians emerged, an excited President Trump almost immediately slapped tariffs on them, claiming \u2018they\u2019ve been cheating earthlings for far too long\u2026\u2019 Well, there are serious matters afoot. My page shows the Galactic Council (a bunch of commies, for sure) as arriving and sorting this earthly human cesspool out. They will instruct us as to having empathy for all life.

All those emigrants could easily have their Social Security number tattooed on their lower arms and as it is only 9 digits, would not have to be big. That way if ICE pulls them up, they can proudly pull up their sleeves and show those agents their Social Security number as that seems to be the only number they are interested in. Any resemblance to this idea and a practise that was undertaken in Eastern Europe in WW2 is just a coincidence. Don\u2019t give anyone in DC ideas. What! no bar code tattoo to expedite ICE processing? That will go on your neck and be your Permanent Record Identifier. According to the Department of Public Information, there is no truth to the rumour that the first three numbers of everyone\u2019s PRI number will be 666. Stay safe, and grey.

Loved the points made regarding Neanderthal extinction and the potential linkages to Speech Sound Disorder and Autism. Radiation hormesis now comes to lead, just in time for the Trump Administration to loosen pollution restrictions. Convenient! I was very much surprised to read how many of those caves were contaminated by lead. How did that work out?  It seems to have been widespread but I would have assumed that having places with lead deposits as well as developed caves would have only been a very small percentage and not over 70% like is suggested here. Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as a pigment to produce white in their cave paintings? Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as the pigment for face and body decoration goop? The Left Wins the Irish Presidential Election in a Landslide Counterpunch  To give some background \u2013 Catherine Connolly is an ex Labour activist who left due (apparently) to internal fights within her local party.  She was little known outside her constituency, although she seems to have been very well liked by other politicians including centrists \u2013 her two political jobs \u2013 Galway Mayor and Deputy Speaker for the parliament are both decided on open votes, which means a lot of the centre and right will have supported her.   She was considered an outsider for the post, but as none of the left parties could agree on their own candidate, she became the de facto left candidate.  She was also aided by the two centre right parties making an appalling mess of their campaign.  She is a barrister and very good with both the public and on TV and won very easily. She has a long, consistent history of being on the general left of politics and in particular anti-war and anti-imperialism and pro-palestine (before it was fashionable, as they say).  More recently, she seems to have become more nationalist on Irish unity (she keeps quiet on this as it\u2019s the primary ideological issue dividing the left).   The Presidential post is largely ceremonial and she will have little real power.  It does have two significant political outcomes: 1.  It will make it almost impossible for the current government to weaken Irish neutrality.  She cannot block any attempt to join Nato or take part in military action, but she has the capacity to create a constitutional crisis over it, so no government would consider it worth the effort to try.  It was never likely, but its pretty much an impossibility now for the next 7 years. 2.  It greatly strengthens Sinn Fein (centre left\/nationalist\/republican).  They initially couldn\u2019t find a candidate that had any chance, so reluctantly backed her.  But as they have by far the best electoral ground game, they became the de facto main partner in a loose alliance of left parties and the Greens.  While that alliance lasts, it shows its possibilities in another election.  But more crucially it has seriously weakened the current Prime Minister who despises Sinn Fein \u2013 it seems very likely he will not make it to the election.  His likely successor belongs to the republican radical wing of his party, one much more likely to join forces with Sinn Fein.  So this could give SF two potential coalition partners after the next election \u2013 a left wing\/green alliance, or a centrist and left Republican one.  They probably prefer the second option. She sounds very much like an Irish traditionalist in having Ireland be neutral and also pro-Palestinian out of principle. If she is there for the next seven years, then it may stabilize Irish politics and stop the idea I have heard of Ireland going into NATO so it can give all its military equipment to the Ukrainians and give Zelensky a coupla billion Euros. Forgive me as I have not been following Irish politics as closely as I used to, but is there really a movement among the Irish center-right to abandon neutrality and join NATO? The very idea seems so shockingly bad to me I could scarcely believe my eyes when I read your comment! No politician in Ireland who wants to get elected openly calls for it, but there is a lobby within the establishment who does want it (as this widely mocked article indicates).  Michael Martin, the current PM, would try to move Ireland towards Nato if he could, but his party would never allow it.  It would be a massive vote loser. The complication for Ireland is that even though it is not part of Nato, because of the lack of investment in defence over the years, the country has had little choice but to rely on UK\/US and other European military help with various issues, from intercepting aircraft in Irelands aerospace to maritime rescue and heavy lift capacity for pulling citizens out of trouble around the world or in shoring up Irelands UN contingent (there has been an Irish Battalion in the Lebanon for nearly 3 decades now).  For pragmatic reasons, Irelands small military accepts Nato standards for its equipment.  So while neutrality is extremely popular with the electorate and the foreign establishment is split over this, no government aren\u2019t actually willing to put in place a meaningful defence force.  Interestingly, Sinn Fein has started calling for much more military spending. It is quite possible to envisage a situation where Ireland accepts membership of Nato as part of a deal for unification. \u201cUS begins troop drawdown in Romania\u201d Not just Romania but apparently Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia as well in December. I would imagine some panic in NATO over this as there might be the suspicion that Trump will eventually reduce US troop numbers until there is only a tripwire force left in Europe- https:\/\/www.kyivpost.com\/post\/63332 Not much profit to be had from only a tripwire force. They only need a skeleton force required for ISR the rest will be done with proxies. that is the European and West Asian plan. That is the impression that I got. That Trump & Co want Europe to field a strong military so that it can be its proxy force for that continent. The US would provide military equipment \u2013 at marked up prices \u2013 Europe would receive satellite data from the US but more to the point would have the US calling the shots for that European military like it does in places like South Korea. Maybe too like in South Korea, that there would be a US general put in charge of these European forces. maybe too the US would order deployment of that European force to places like Asia, maybe even Taiwan. A US general is, and has always been, the military head of NATO.  This is no different, in practice, from US SK command structure. Would that include in combat as well? I know that is so for South Korea. Of course.  SACEUR (who also has the US \u201chat\u201d of COMEUCOM) has operational command from SHAPE in Mons, BE. Dubai: the dark truth \u2014 what lies beneath the wealth and glamour? \u2013 The Standard Read to me like an indictment of many parts of the world including Dubai.

Her concluding paragraph: \u201cMy fear is that we, in our rotting democracies, will become like Dubai, because to value this is to value tyranny, whatever name you give it, and there\u2019s a word for that. Decadence: always the final age of empire.\u201d I think our would-be techno-feudal overlords have a vision. It\u2019s Dubai, but ruled by billionaire genius philosopher-kings rather than Sultans. Guys like Trey Goff will build it for them, and useful political lackeys like those in Congress and the Trump administration will make it possible. It takes a globe full of accomplices to create such a system.  The world doesn\u2019t have a \u201cTrump\u201d problem.  Way beyond that. That\u2019s the overarching point. Multipolar exploitation.

Compliments of an 1980s song from Madonna\u2026 \u201cOnly boys who save their pennies, make my rainy day\u201d The Chain Cent was the first effort by the US Mint in 1793, and they were about the size of a half Dollar. Fitting that we\u2019re seeing off Mr. Lincoln~ A nice example is worth the big bickies, $126k https:\/\/www.pcgs.com\/coinfacts\/coin\/1793-1c-chain-america-bn\/1341 As a young teenager I would often gather coins in \u201cvast numbers\u201d twice per week on a small town paper route.   For a measly $0.25 one could read all the news fit to print, and at the end of the afternoon I could saunter into the Wachovia branch to exchange those coins for \u201cdollar dollar bills y\u2019all\u2026.\u201d So if I sold say 100 on a good day I was doing well even if it\u2019s small time consumer paper media so to speak\u2026 Might have found a few wheat pennies on my route too! All this in a pre-internet world.   What a seemingly more simple time.  Those rainy fall and winter afternoons were awful though on a two wheel delivery machine. When I was a kid \u201cIndian Head\u201d pennies were a thing for collecting.  Same for war cents and nickles. In some local auction decades ago, I bought this big  lot of soup to nuts coins that had a couple of rolls of 1943 steel Cents which had been copper-plated to look like the real thing worth around $250k each instead of a Dime, and I spent them all over LA, one at a time over about a decade. I feel certain more than a few people got really excited about their \u2018find\u2019.  \u201cGood riddance to the meddlesome $0.01\u2026\u201d As you probably know, Canada ditched the penny already. It\u2019s predictable! \u201cOh, it costs more to make it than it\u2019s actually worth\u2026\u201d Two comments: 1. I remember as a kid in the US that I really liked the Eisenhower Dollar. Kind of like what my elders said, you knew you were holding something when you had one of those in your hand. All in for universal sufferage and thought the Susan B. Anthony was a good coin, but it just wasn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d dollar to me. Paper? Pfui. 2. Experience here in Canada seems to be mostly people don\u2019t miss the penny. The bulk of people pay with a debit or credit card, and the rounding doesn\u2019t apply to those. Cash transactions can be amusing to sort out. Always a gamble: am I going to pay more than the actual bill, or less? Fortunately Canadians don\u2019t seem to be disposed to yank a handgun out and start blazing away because they got \u201ccheated\u201d by the system. We\u2019re told it balances out in the long run. I wonder how much longer we have to run. I also remember when I first came to Canada there was some debate over the idea of minting a $5 coin to go with our $1 (\u201cLoonie\u201d) and $2 (\u201cToonie\u201d) coins. The biggest debate was over what to call it. \u201cFoonie\u201d just rang like a lead bell. Ultimately the mint deployed the cost argument, though now I guess they\u2019d just say everybody uses a card so it\u2019s not a thing. I talked to a presenter at the British Museum after she gave a talk in their coin gallery. Their pound coins were relatively new at the time. Having seen some pretty wretched examples in commerce during our visit, as well as the simple design, I asked her what percentage of circulating pound coins she estimated to be \u201chomemade\u201d. She lowered her voice and said in a \u201cdon\u2019t tell\u201d voice it was around 60% (!!!) China? I cannot find official Chinese confirmation that China will pause its rare earths export permits, per an X post by Arnaud B: https:\/\/x.com\/RnaudBertrand\/status\/1983910248416211116 \u2013 I checked and was unable to find a notice on the official Chinese govt website regarding rare earths \u2013 but did find notices on tariff rates and soy beans. Although we have Trump The Fantabulists\u2019 words (echoed by the media), however, he has form. If so, the economic implications to high tech (and the MICC) remain. I also recall that in the prior restriction, I read a report where after several months, China was only able to process a handful of permits. I also saw nothing about Nexperia. Side note, for a 90-minute meeting, 20-30 minutes are for opening statements, 10 minutes for closing statements, so 50-70 minutes of translation-slowed discussions means equivalent to ~20 minutes of normal discussion for issues with complex details. So did they run out of time before discussing rare earths, or was it just a case of: Trump: \u201cAbout those rare earths?\u201d Xi, \u201c\u4e0d\u662f (Bushi) \u2013 No.\u201d Trump: \u201cSo No Lunch or press briefing.\u201d Xi \u201cYes.\u201d Trump: \u201cFine, I was going to order a round of fast food burgers.\u201d Xi \u201cFine: We will buy some soybeans, if you drop tarriffs.\u201d Trump: \u201cOk. Ummm. Hmmmm. How\u2019s the weather in Beijing these days?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t put it past Trump to lie.  He has made shit up before.  \u201c24 hours to end the Ukraine war.\u201d Part of the issue is that nothing is in writing.  Both parties are free to exaggerate, charitably.  Trump has changed his mind so many times and flip-flopped that these may be Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s tariffs. \u201c24 hours to end the war in Ukraine\u201d is not a lie. That was, and still is, quite possible. Can you end the war in a way that keeps the Russophobes and neocon crazies happy in 24 hours? No, you cannot. But you can\u2019t do that in the next 24 years either. So I\u2019d argue ending it in 24 hours where everyone is unhappy is actually a great idea. Fellow Chris: I think the lie was that he would actually do it, not that it was possible. A total cutoff of aid, along with making Zelensky persona non grata the minute he started whining about ceding territory, would have likely done the trick.  Too bad he lied to his base. It really is a pity he lied. I wish he had followed through with the promise. It looked like he was going to. Witkoff put Bibi in his place for a minute before Trump was even sworn in. And now\u2026 we have even more war and chaos. Once I tried to talk a snake out of shedding its skin. Never again. Or the US has more nuclear weapons, I guess he doesn\u2019t think his base understands how to use Google; or maybe that the sycophantic media will not question if the emperor\u2019s new clothes leave him naked. \u2018Heather Johnston @HeatherJ_Israel My name is Heather Johnston, and I am the Founder and President of @USIEducation I am deeply concerned about the hate that Tucker Carlson is spreading in our country. As a supporter of the Heritage Foundation, I am asking Dr. Kevin Roberts to clarify his statement regarding Carlson. Israel is central to God\u2019s divine purpose, and we need to know where the Heritage Foundation stands. @KevinRobertsTX\u2019 Oh god. It\u2019s Zionist Karen. And she\u2019s demanding to talk to the manager of the Heritage Foundation. The tucker Carlson interview was my first real exposure to Nick Fuentes. I\u2019m almost done, but I\u2019ve watched most of it.  I actually thought that he came off as reasonable. He\u2019s a very good and talented speaker, maintains a good flow and poise. He\u2019s overcome a lot which is impressive, was kicked off YouTube, was on the no fly list, was being threatened, had hundreds of people come to his home, etc After he did a debate in college, a daily wire employee asked him if he\u2019d like to visit Israel, he said no.   But the main reason that he has a bright future is that the establishment is not providing an alternative. Nobody under 40 is ever going to be passionate about Lindsey Graham or Ted Cruz or Ben Shapiro. Hey, Afro, don\u2019t blame old people for Graham, Cruz or Shapiro!  Age has nothing to do with it.  Take it from an \u2018over 80!\u2019 Tucker\u2019s Christian theology is spot on, though I wish he\u2019d named the heresy he was talking about.  Darbyism is a 19th century invention by a British Calvinist.  Spread through the Scofield Bible, it\u2019s contrary to 1.900 years of amillennial eschatology shared by Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Reformed churches. Those Catholic church leaders that at best turned a blind eye to the kiddie fiddling surely can\u2019t have believed in the dogma of heaven or hell as a soul\u2019s permanent location in the afterlife. Because they would had had a firm idea about which location they\u2019d end up in. My, what pretty evangs you\u2019ve got\u2026 I love it when they go to the good book in order to defend Israel at all costs, where history majors in a narrow vein of events in an isolated area of the orb a few thousand years ago still resonate today. Reading the Gospels, quoting Jesus, Carlson is correct! There is no \u2018love thy neighbor\u201d in the militarism of the US and its zionist spawn! That said Augustine\u2019s \u201cjust war doctrine\u201d is excuse for heresy! Not one bullet fired by or for US\/Israel in the last 80 years is \u201cjust\u201d murder. So says me a repenting US airman! JD Vance and Augustine: https:\/\/martycenter.org\/sightings\/the-problem-with-jd-vances-augustine Thank you for the linked article! I was indoctrinated in the Just War by a USAF chaplain in the run up to Desert Storm!  I took him as wrong at the time.  I did not find out the rite of the chaplain.  At that time I did serve in the states.  Augustine excused Christians to get involved in Constantine\u2019s state sanction murder. My best feel for Augustine is the quote:  \u201cLord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet.\u201d  That aided my re-conversion and return to the Roman Church.  Repentance is key That said in my seeking who is \u201cthy neighbor\u201d I go to the Good Samaritan and no further.  Your neighbor is Jesus you see in every one you encounter.  See especially the two mainstream men who passed by the sufferer.  Samaritans were outcast to observant Jews in the setting of the parable.  Augustine, doctor of the church, was not a pope and thus evidently fallible. He also gave us the curious concept of Original Sin. According to Hudson Augustine changed Debt to Sin or Economics to Sexual Mores I think. Popes are fallible too.  At least, that\u2019s what Dante said, and he encountered one. What\u2019s going on with Bill Krystal? Somebody may need to check on him bc earlier in the week, I think he endorsed Mamdani for mayor! Rat departing a sinking ship. If you live in NYC, there is increasing desperation from the Cuomo campaign and wealth funded surrogates. Not to mention even more anger directed at Curtis Sliwa. God forbid the actual Republican candidate stay in the race, rather than prop up the sore loser who couldn\u2019t accept that voters didn\u2019t agree with his delusional belief that he got to be mayor just because he wanted to restart his political career so he ran again as an independent.  Look this is NY, and we now have unaccountable electronic voting machines. Cuomo could still win. But all indications are that he is losing by a significant margin. Not enough of one in my opinion, but still significant. Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Associated Press (Kevin W). More incompetence. Australia got rid of the penny before 2002, and required retailers to round up or down to the nearest five cents. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As you say, every other country got rid of small change pretty effortlessly\u2026 I\u2019d guess the last time you could buy something with a lowly Lincoln would\u2019ve been around 1980 from a gumball machine near you. The last time we ditched a denomination was in 1889 when we 86\u2019d the Three Cent Piece, been a spell. it\u2019s called \u2018Swedish Rounding\u2019 by the way. Time to buy boxes of nickels at face value from your local bank \u2013 the copper and nickel contained therein is worth double or more face value \u2013 to sell to refiners when it\u2019s discontinued? I read several years ago that Kevin Bass I think, did so to the annoyance of the local Federal Reserve bank. It\u2019s a bit tricky separating copper from nickel, is what I\u2019ve been told. Wanna buy my 75% copper & 25% nickel Nickel ingot?

Which on the other hand by way of looking at those attacking him tells you the level of incompetence on the region by many German establishment morons. L\u00fcders was Middle East correspondent for Germany\u00b4s biggest weekly DIE ZEIT.

In this interview, he discusses his new book, \u201cDirty Work: Israel, America, and Imperial Megalomania,\u201d and Israel\u2019s wars of aggression against Iran, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and Qatar. L\u00fcders explains how Israel and the USA secure their power in the region through wars, sanctions, and regime change, why Germany supports this policy, and what the consequences of a new war against Iran would be\u2014for the entire region and far beyond.\u201d  The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes  60 min. https:\/\/www.nachdenkseiten.de\/?p=141335 German Wiki on L\u00fcders https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_L%C3%BCders re: Poland \u2013 Michael Jabara Carley \u2013 This piece  was published originally on the Strategic Culture site which is banned from NC.

It\u2019s had everything, almost. Great defensive plays, great pitching, weird plays, firsts of all kinds, including Freddie\u2019s second walk-off homer in the 18 inning game (\u201cLet\u2019s play two!\u201d) a record for any player in any combination of World Series games in history, and Shohei\u2019s mind-blowing performance in one of the early games. But in my opinion, it\u2019s not really baseball anymore, with all the rule changes they\u2019ve made in the past 10-15 years to make the games go faster. No thinking between pitches, just throw another in a hurry, all DH now, bigger bases, etc. The last big rule change before this latest flurry was to lower the mound because of Bob Gibson\u2019s unhittable pitching and it actually seemed to make the game better, but these latest ones are making it worse. Say what you will about his otherwise lackluster hitting in this Series, Freddie is \u201cThe glue in our clubhouse\u201d according to the last two great manager\u2019s he\u2019s played for. Steady Freddie, indeed \u2014 Hall of Famer first ballot no doubt. Interesting that Atlanta fell apart after their World Series win when they let him go to the Dodgers, and the Dodger\u2019s have now won one and may win two with him on the everyday roster. I never thought I\u2019d be a Dodger\u2019s fan, but Freddie\u2019s the last link to Chipper, who was the last link to Maddux, Smoltz and Glavine who were the last links to Otis Nixon\u2019s wall-climbing \u201cThe Catch\u201d and Sid Bream\u2019s slide into home. When Freddie\u2019s career is done, my days of watching baseball will likewise be over. But this has been a historic Series, no matter, and I\u2019m on the same page with you, waiting anxiously. pre-game starts in 10 minutes,  game 7 of this incredible Series starts at 7 central time. \u201cReport: Iran rebuilding its ballistic missile program\u201d Israel would be very keen on attacking Iran once more \u2013 with America\u2019s help of course. Trouble is that Iran is rebuilding their stock of missiles again as they have the industrial capacity to do it. And it seems that the Russians are helping them with their aerial defenses as Iran has finally realized that it needs help here. In addition, most of the groups that Israel set up in Iran are now gone and Iran will be carefully watching countries like Azerbaijan which aided the Israelis in their attacks. They will be a much tougher nut to crack next time. For their part, resupply of Israeli aerial defense missiles are probably proceeding slowly as those missiles take some time to build each. And now they know that Iran can hit any damn place that they want to and it does not matter if they have help from countries like the US, the UK, Jordan, etc. they do not know what to do next. So unless something tips the balance radically in favour of Israel, we may have a status quo developing where Iran won\u2019t attack Israel and Israel can\u2019t attack Iran. Sounds good to me. IDF does not have the wherewithal to do a Curtis E LeMay (bomber Harris with B-29\u2019s and two A bombs) on Iran, too much geography, too much hardening, some level of air defenses.  US help is limited by local infrastructure and depth of magazine which is already devoted to IDF. Do we really believe air shafts in Iran are straight and B-2\u2019s can follow them \u2026\u2026 Or that USAF flew 14 B-2\u2019s in the same year. Your arguments are very logical and rational, and thus, sadly, irrelevant to the Israeli religious fanatics led by an indicted criminal who goes to prison if the war ends (and incidentally hell bent on genocide \u2013 making the IDF the true marvel comic book evil that used to be reserved for WW2 Germans with black uniforms). Israel is not being resupplied by building new missiles \u2013 that is too slow, and that was before the rare earth embargo of the US MICC. \u2013 They are being resupplied from the existing stocks underlying US-China war dreams. Let them be sent, and the US is rapidly losing its fevered war dreams  (in a Thucydides trap). I trust European intel sources were totally honest with CNN, and not propagandizing regarding Iran Rebuilding its missile capabilities. Actually, an honest assessment would state that Iran is building out its capacity, particularly of the newest missiles, which were not used \u2013 they used such a minimal fraction of their stocks. Definitely not the same people who have been saying Russia is running out of missiles since day one are saying the same about Iran, despite its prepping for a US-Israeli war for decades.

Honestly seems very bizarre Interesting about Dubai. I am a fan of movie composer Hans Zimmer\u2019s concerts including one in Dubai where he talks about how much he likes it there.  Each week there is another fawning article about Dubai. Beyonc\u00e9 sang there; Rio Ferdinand moved there. Westerners think it is \u201csafe\u201d, which is laughable. The talk is in English so doubtless his appreciative audience includes those wealthy British expats. But the article suggests his just folks vox populai patter may be cloaking an ugly reality. Still he is a very good musician Various right wing media \u2018personalities\u2019 or \u2018influencers\u2019 in England have very loudly moved to Dubai, because \u2018there is too much immigration in England\u2019 and \u2018England is no longer safe because of immigrants [read Muslims]. But, of course, they will be \u2018expats\u2019 there rather than immigrants and only mix with their own kind in any case. My fascination with YouTube crochet and 90s rock channels has led to some interesting commercials. There were a whole series of commercials touting Dubai as a tourist destination for families, girls trip, honeymoon\u2026 It was yet another instance of cognitive dissonance for me. I could only wonder if tourists were limited to certain areas, almost like a Disneyland version of it. >Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Instead of abruptly discontinuing the production of one-cent coins, the U.S. government should have continued producing them using less expensive metals. After all, the government once profited greatly from producing steel pennies. A more honest idea would be to do what all countries eventually do when debasing their currency via inflation, just chop a zero or two off so the dime or the dollar would be the new penny. Would ditch those pricey nickels too.  Even better, be proactive and make it three. What really is the point of units which are so worthless that one will not purchase anything?

Only been to Chipotle twice and both times got a mild case of food poisoning. Plus it\u2019s kind of expensive for what it is \u2013 a slightly fancier Taco Bell but still fast food.

The third time I went to Chipotle I got food poisoning so severe I was hospitalized for 7 days followed by 7 days of recovery at home where I was incredibly weak. I will not step a foot into a Chipotle again. A good many stand alone \u2018Meskin eateries here, especially so in the towns that are almost all Hispanic (read Mexican) in population, and I\u2019m looking at you Farmersville, Ivanhoe and Woodlake. All the field workers are Mexican, so the food is authentic and tasty. The true test of a restaurant is their chile relleno\u2026 Why go to Chipotle? Absolutely the test is how good are their chile rellenos. I always order that. When it\u2019s good it\u2019s wonderful. My restaurant test for first time eating is red chili. If they ace that, we will return. Also, Yuma AZ has some great authentic Mexican restaurants. Why go? For the ugly, dystopian decor that looks like the set from a sequel to \u201cAliens\u201d? For the seating so hard and uncomfortable that you are left with sciatic nerve pain for the rest of the day if you sit for more than five minutes? For the beef and chicken rendered so inedibly tough that it should have a warning label and come with a side of dental floss? Yes, I always try the relleno but for me the true test is fresh home made tortillas. They are really hard to find but nothing better. since only really fancy places like Mi Tierra in san antone make Mole, anymores, Tam\u2019s Test Dish was always carne guisada. my test in all eateries is to first observe the back door and the dumpster area(if theres cats, thats good), then upon entering thru the front, take a deep whif of the air(sour smelling oil=bad), then immediately wander to the loo, and endeavor to get a peek into the kitchen(clean-ish(i understand the demands) but more importantly, happy people in there who are having a good time) save for chinese food, i prefer mom and pops. for chinese, i prefer corporate\u2026.esp panda express. due to a lack of cats and stray dogs in the neighborhood of this place we went to in san angelo.

Before I quit the Twitter, I\u2019d see occasionally retweets of people complaining about the prices at Chipotle, so their struggles isn\u2019t really news. I was taken once as part of a corporate informal lunch 10 years ago. Not sure what the fuss is about. I never went back, and it was overpriced in 2014. Here are the owners of Chipolte: https:\/\/brandsownedby.com\/who-owns-chipotle\/ Never was a big fan.  I would only do take out the times that I used to go. I needed to take it home and add some seasoning and to make it hot.  Adding that extra heat could have been what saved me from these scary food poisoning incidents.

Many many of those banks were consolidated with buyouts into larger banking entities at the direction of the FDIC. If one wanted to further consolidate the banking sector and reduce the number of community and small regional banks, this is one way to do that, imo.  It\u2019s never the smaller banks that get bailed out.  The smaller banks get eaten. And an aside about the private credit crisis that\u2019s looming:  The big banks beginning after the GFC essentially stopped loaning to small businesses, that created the environment for the expansion of existing and creation of new private credit outfits.  Small businesses still needed operating capital loans, and when their longtime big bank stopped lending even though the small business owner had never missed a payment or been a problem, they naturally turned to local private credit outfits.  If there\u2019s a problem now in the private credit market, it\u2019s a crisis the big banks created, imo.

Market caps are more of an estimated lifetime value while GDPs are yearly stats \u2026 at least to this non-finance guy. Sure, it\u2019s apples and oranges; but it\u2019s a convenient way to put these absurd numbers into context.  What else are you going to use?  Count the sand on the beach? I would like to see a simple, easily understood metric used. Let us consider a mature P\/E ratio as Nvidia ages to a mature company, free of hype. Assuming Nvidia achieves a P\/E ratio of 10:1 as it (or the sum of pieces it may split into) ages, then Nvidia (or sum of pieces) would need to earn $512 billion per year. Someone buying Nvida would then see earnings of about 10% of original share purchase price. Alphabet (Google) reported earnings of $100.12 billion in the year ending Dec 31, 2024. Nvidia at 5x Google\u2019s yearly earnings seems like a very tall order as this level of annual earnings would be bound to attract competition from other semiconductor firms. And Google\u2019s earnings report might be more solid from an accounting standpoint. >Euro-homeless, time to hit the trash heaps?

The end of the EU is coming\u2026 true, this is not certain and only in the Russian media, but oh well\u2026 It\u2019s surprising that Russians are skeptical rather than welcoming the decline of the EU.

And of course trickling up\u2026 Chipotle stock craters as company says young people without jobs can\u2019t afford their food anymore.  I suggest the company hire Luigi Mangione as the company spokesperson, in the manner of Colonel Sanders or Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByJoshua P. Cohen, Senior Contributor. Open enrollment is happening. It\u2019s the annual period during which individuals can adjust or switch plans or re-enroll in their current health plan. Individuals or families purchasing insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace will face steep increases in premiums of up to 30% on average. And for employees selecting plans in the employer-sponsored market\u2014by far the largest insurance sector in America\u2014they will pay 9% more for their insurance in 2026, which is more than three times the current rate of inflation. On rising health insurance premiums, the main focus in the media has been on premium increases in the ACA exchanges as well as the expiring enhanced subsidies. However, a much larger number of Americans will be impacted by premium increases across the commercial markets. According to KFF, close to 165 million Americans receive health insurance through their employers. Surveys estimate premium increases of 9% in this market in 2026. And millions more obtain non-group individual coverage from commercial carriers where the spike in premiums is expected to be even higher. STAT News reports that the total mean cost of a family health insurance policy through an employer is $27,000 in 2025. Of that, an average of $6,850 gets paid by the employee and $20,143 by the employer. Experts predict that the aggregate cost will increase to nearly $30,000 next year. Several factors appear to be driving the rise in healthcare spending and premiums, which include greater utilization of medical services and technologies and higher prices. Furthermore, patient cost-sharing will continue its inexorable rise with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket payments for covered services and items such as prescription drugs. Healthcare-related expenditures for a typical American are more than $17,000 annually. This includes the insurance premiums the individual (and their employer) pays as well as co-payments, deductibles and the taxes that fund Medicare, Medicaid and other public programs. CNN reported last month that employers are preparing for the steepest increase in health benefit costs in 15 years in light of the sharp rise in doctor visits, emergency room usage and claims for mental health services in recent years. Employers say that prescription drug costs in particular are straining budgets. This includes treatments for advanced cancer, autoimmune conditions, diabetes and weight loss. As Elisabeth Rosenthal of KFF Health News points out, while this year\u2019s increases will be large, premiums in the health insurance market have risen enormously in the past 25 years. Family health insurance premiums have surged 297% since 2000. Workers in 2025 paid nearly four times more for the same coverage in employer-based plans as in 2000, far exceeding the inflation rate. High-deductible health plans have also become more common, with 32% of employees facing deductibles of $2,000 or more. And deductibles for employer-based plans have risen nearly 50% since 2015. This is money insured enrollees must spend out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in. The Commonwealth Fund calculated in 2023 that the average annual deductible for an employee of a large firm was $3,547. For an employee of a small firm, it was $5,074. The situation in parts of the ACA marketplace has become worse over time. An average deductible for a standard ACA silver plan in 2025 is nearly $5,000, approximately twice what it was a decade ago. Premium increases are forecast to also impact Medicare beneficiaries. The base average monthly premium for the outpatient drug benefit called Part D is projected to increase by 6% in 2026 to about $39, which is the maximum allowable increase under one the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s provisions. And Medicare Part B premiums are expected to be over $200 a month in 2026, which represents a 12.6% increase. Part B covers outpatient services, including physician-administered drugs. What\u2019s compounding the problem for many Americans is that they have grown accustomed to paying more for less. This decades-long trend has seen health insurers placing more restrictions on hospital, physician and pharmacy networks as well as prescription drug coverage, while raising premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket cost sharing. Anecdotally, when I became self-employed in 2017 and entered the individual non-group market for health insurance, the monthly premium for my \u201cbronze\u201d plan was $286 a month. Now, the same plan costs $637 in 2025. Starting in Jan. 2026, my monthly premium will be $740, a 16% increase. I\u2019m lucky to be in comparatively good health and to hardly ever make use of the healthcare system. Accordingly, the choice among the options available to me is straightforward: The least expensive. I don\u2019t qualify for any subsidies. And while as a self-employed person I get a tax deduction for the premiums I pay, that hardly offsets the considerable costs I incur just to be insured. If I access the healthcare system, my fee to have coverage doesn\u2019t entitle me to free at point-of-service healthcare of any kind, except for vaccines and an annual physical (though even then I incur an out-of-pocket charge of $150 for the bloodwork). My ever-increasing deductible will be $2,900 in 2026, which means I\u2019d have to spend that amount before any actual insurance coverage kicks in. And even then, I\u2019d be nickel-and-dimed with co-payments ranging from $50 to more than $1,000 for physician visits, diagnostic work-up and hospitalizations. I could have opted for plans with lower out-of-pocket costs (that is, better coverage), but the premiums would then be at least twice as much. Taking a bird\u2019s eye view of the high cost of health insurance and healthcare in America, it\u2019s no wonder that a Gallup Poll released earlier this year found that nearly 91 million adults say they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford needed medical care.","label":0}

To tackle this, we turn to Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)\u2014specifically the powerful, scalable framework provided by H2O.ai and integrated into the R modeltime ecosystem. This article dissects a full MLOps workflow, from data acquisition and feature engineering to model training and evaluation, revealing how a high-performance, low-variance model triumphed over the market\u2019s volatility. The core strategy involved converting the univariate time series problem into a supervised regression problem by generating powerful explanatory variables. A robust feature recipe (rec_spec) was designed to capture both time dependence and seasonality: We initiated the H2O AutoML process using automl_reg() under strict resource constraints to quickly identify the most promising model type: These tight constraints resulted in a leaderboard featuring only the fastest and highest-performing base algorithms: The Distributed Random Forest (DRF) emerged as the leader in the cross-validation phase, demonstrating superior generalization ability with the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.99. The DRF model\u2019s victory over the generally higher-accuracy Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is a powerful illustration of the Bias-Variance Trade-off in noisy data: Calibrating the leading DRF model on the final 15-day test set confirmed its strong performance: Finally, we can construct predictive intervals, which are used as a kind of Relative Strength Index (RSI) in this context.

Patricia Willson, 93, stares intently at her leg as her nurse unwraps layers of bandages, revealing a scar that, to Willson's elation, is nowhere near as gruesome as it had been months ago. Hunched over from a fractured back, Willson scrolls through her phone to remind her nurse what the scar had looked like. Last December, she sliced her leg open on a box. A few months later, the three-inch gash got infected. \"It scared me so bad when my legs started hurting,\" Willson tells her nurse, as Business Insider visited her home in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, earlier this year. \"You're a medical masterpiece,\" her nurse says. \"You've been through a lot. Did you mention how many times you've broken a bone?\" \"Well, I've had 14 broken arms,\" Willson replies. As she inches back to her desk once her leg is tended to, Willson stops to clear off a stack of papers. Nestled between bills and medical records on one side of the desk sits a stapled-together printout of 50 websites for finding freelance work. Tucked away on the other side is a slightly wrinkled cover letter she's been sending to companies. \"I really need a job,\" she says under her breath. There aren't too many people her age looking for work, she acknowledges somberly. Willson, a mother of six, worked in payroll at companies like Pfizer before opening a home rental business in 2006, which she runs with her daughter and her son-in-law. Until four years ago, Willson was on her feet doing chores around the property; she has since become less able to perform physical tasks. \"When you don't know what to do, you don't do anything,\" Willson says. \"Things snowballed on me, and I did not foresee that things would get worse.\" She's one of the nearly 1.4 million people over age 65 who have a disability and still work \u2014 whether by choice, like some, or by necessity, like Willson, who says that after paying all her bills, she sometimes struggles to have extra money left at the end of the month to buy a full cart of groceries. Business Insider's \"80 over 80\" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. If you are 80 and older and still work,\u00a0fill out this form\u00a0to contribute to the series\u00a0and read more here: On a recent group call AARP held about applying for jobs, Willson suspected she was the oldest there by at least a decade. With almost nothing in savings, even with Social Security, she's spent hours each day browsing remote jobs and educating herself on what may be out there, knowing full well that most companies might not consider someone at her age. Some nights, she says, the stress of her situation keeps her from sleeping. \"I'm worried every night when I go to bed that what I have isn't going to last until I die,\" Willson says. \"For God's sake, I should have saved every penny I could save.\" It's a growing reality that older Americans are increasingly relying on work to make ends meet. Nearly 550,000 were working into their 80s and beyond as of 2023, according to a Business Insider analysis of 2023 Census data. That's over 4% of the population aged 80 and above. Of the more than 175 people 80 and older who spoke to Business Insider about working later in life, most mentioned some health issue as a challenge. Common ones included arthritis, mobility impairments, heart disease, hearing loss, and memory problems. Most of these didn't prevent them from performing their job tasks. A few said their conditions were severe enough that they would have retired years ago if they could have, though they need to work to pay their bills. Their health issues have led them to either struggle throughout the day or find employment where they can work around periods of pain. For four decades, Patricia Moore, 81, has managed a gas station, earning about $36,000 a year despite suffering from neuropathy and swelling. It's exhausting some days, but she has to work to supplement her $2,800 monthly Social Security income, as she doesn't have sufficient savings. \"Retirement is not in the near future, as it costs more every month to just survive,\" said Moore, who lives in California. The average retirement age in the US is 62, when accounting for people who retire early because of disabilities. Though much research shows that work prolongs people's lives, some papers suggest that work is detrimental to longevity for those with health issues or who work in physical jobs. Research by Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at The New School in New York, suggests that working later in life benefits those who want to work \u2014 and harms those with no choice but to work, especially as mortality risks and stress levels increase. Business Insider's analysis of Census data found that while many of the most common occupations for Americans 80 and older are less risky, meaning lower incidences of injuries or fatalities, thousands work in higher-risk professions, such as truck driving, personal care, janitorial work, and construction. In interviews, some workers in these professions said that while they mostly enjoy the work, they worry that their health could hinder their productivity \u2014 or that working could put their lives in danger. The entire US population is aging, too, suggesting that older people are more likely to stay in the workforce in the coming years. In a decade, estimates suggest, there will be more Americans 65 and older than below 18 \u2014 a flip of the current distribution of age, and a challenge when it comes to keeping an economy growing. \"To offset those pressures on the workforce, people who continue to work into their 80s, beyond conventional retirement ages, help the equation,\" said Nicole Maestas, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, adding that the US has already seen substantial reductions in GDP growth due to an aging population. With fewer people available to work \u2014 and therefore fewer people paying the taxes that fund healthcare benefits \u2014 Maestas said companies and policymakers should consider \"how we can take advantage of technology to complement work.\" During the pandemic, companies rushed to partner with health-based advisors and adopt more age-friendly benefits and health-related policies, said Talia Varley, managing director of global corporate advisory at the Cleveland Clinic. Workplaces are now taking more consideration into medical leave policies, physical accessibility, menopause, phased retirement policies, and disability accommodations. Still, she said, there's much to do. David Hugo Barrett, 82, begins every middle and high school class he teaches with life lessons about the importance of working hard and staying out of trouble. For a few hours each day, he feels young, learning Gen Alpha slang and staying in touch with the latest tech trends. But when he returns home each night, he's reminded of the disabilities that have made his outlook less stable. He has lymphedema, which leads to swelling in his legs, and peripheral neuropathy, which causes nerve damage in his feet. \"People say age is nothing but a number. That's just simply not true,\" Barrett said. \"Aging is not something that can be taken lightly.\" Barrett works as a substitute teacher in Maryland, having spent decades as a systems engineer and teacher. He retired in 2018 and self-published his memoir, \"A Newark Childhood,\" before returning to work part-time in November 2024. His wife, 74, works as a substitute teacher for elementary school students. Staying retired was not an option, he said. \"The financial part is not insignificant, and I look forward to getting those checks every two weeks,\" Barrett said. \"I wish I had waited until I was older to take advantage of my Social Security. In that calculation of how long I'm going to live with my 401(k), I underfunded it because I've lived way beyond what I expected.\" Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a resident scholar at Brandeis University in Massachusetts who studies aging, said that because people's incomes often peak in their mid-50s, it's much harder to earn an adequate salary in later years \u2014 which keeps people employed for longer, even amid severe health challenges. \"Ethically speaking, if we had a good healthcare system in the United States that covered everybody from cradle to grave, we would have more healthy people,\" she said, adding that mid-career ageism can push back people's retirement ages. Additionally, about 26 million Americans under 65 are uninsured, so those who face medical challenges may have to work later to recover medical expenses, she said. Jane Way, 84, wanted to continue a professional career into her retirement years despite mobility limitations. She's been in a wheelchair for five years. Way, who lives outside Phoenix, works remotely as the US accountant for a South African orphanage, often logging in early in the morning to accommodate the time zone difference. Everything she needs is nearby, so she considers her health issues \"not a big deal.\" Way is dependent on her Social Security and paycheck to get by, as she did not expect to live to her 80s. She spent her retirement savings early, putting two grandchildren through college. Her son and grandson live with her. \"I intend to be working when I reach 100,\" Way said. \"We'll see if that happens.\" Ardel Richter, 84, had a storied career in real estate sales and as a notary signing agent. But in 2022, she spiraled after a \"perfect storm\" of events \u2014 heightened competition in the real estate market that tanked her income, her husband's death in a car crash, and the sale of her rental properties at a meager profit. Now, Richter, who lives in north-central Arkansas, accepts whatever notary jobs she can find, often at a lower fee than she'd like. She estimates she makes about $685 a month. Between her $842 monthly Social Security, one remaining rental property that brings in $1,250 a month, and her notary job, she brings in just $185 over her usual expenses each month. \"Being tethered to a cellphone and\/or computer isn't freeing, but it works, as there is no way I could cope with a job with set hours,\" Richter said. Although she considers her health good, the stress of work and some minor health issues make her feel more tired. She takes calcium supplements, struggles to lift heavier objects, and finds that daily tasks take longer than they did two years ago. \"It's a tightrope walk with no net,\" Richter said. \"Nor do I know how long the rope is.\" Jack Rowe, a former Aetna CEO and professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University, said the \"forgotten middle,\" meaning those who earn above the poverty line but not enough to live comfortably, are particularly vulnerable to a dearth of geriatricians, changes to Medicaid policy, and care worker staffing challenges. This demographic often cannot afford to quit working, which could contribute to ailments like fatigue. Despite working for six decades in various roles, Kathy Curtis, 81, has found herself with limited savings and facing health issues. For the past decade, Curtis has worked part-time in the office of a local water company, earning $18 an hour. Because she lives in a rural area in Northern California, where seeing people out and about is less likely, the job is \"like a social event,\" she said. Still, she regrets how tired it makes her feel. She gets out of breath easily, though she's grateful her health issues of the past, such as breast cancer and blood clots in her lungs, have gone away. Between $1,186 in Social Security and the couple hundred dollars she makes from work each month, she squeezes by, she says. Her homeowners' insurance rose after the region's wildfires. Her grandson lives with her and helps her out. \"I've never made a lot of money, but I've also never looked, acted, or felt like a poverty case either, even though a great deal of the time I've stayed just barely above poverty,\" Curtis said. Some of those who don't technically need to work told Business Insider that it provides something necessary: a purpose. Clark Allan Blasdell, 81, works full-time for a nonprofit community development corporation he founded half a century ago and has no regrets about how he managed his finances. Actually getting to work, though, is much more of a feat than ever. Two years ago, Blasdell started going blind. He lost his driver's license, so he has to take the train or rely on others to get around. It's been harder to stay on top of his type 1 diabetes since he regularly has to check his blood sugar levels. Still, he hopes to work until the day he dies since the extra money won't hurt. \"I'm just hopeful that I'll be able to keep my ears open, my eyes open, and that they're working, and I'm trying to find somebody who can help me with this,\" Blasdell said. Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at the financial services company DA Davidson, said that financial advisors have worked increasingly more with clients on addressing long-term care and health planning instead of waiting until health deteriorates. \"We're actively trying to engage in those conversations when people are in their 50s and early 60s, when they're healthy, they're insurable, and they can be at a preferred rate,\" Crowell said. \"Don't wait till you're in your 70s and you've now got glaucoma or COPD. You're not going to get the preferred premium that you would hope to,\" he said, referring to Medicare supplement plans. Back in northwest Arkansas, Willson peers out the window, watching her daughter steering a riding lawn mower around her property. A groundhog stares back as she contemplates her future. Amid the hardships of running the rental business and navigating her job search, she takes a breath. Her health seems stable for the moment, and she suspects there is light at the end of their driveway. \"Everyone thinks their situation is pretty bad, but I know there are people a lot worse than I am,\" Willson said. \"It'll be OK.\" Of course, she yearns for the days of better health and financial security. She would like to have a full night's sleep and wake up refreshed. She would like to have a more stable part-time job that gives her purpose. There's only so much optimism someone like Willson can muster when missing a tax bill or credit card payment can have a domino effect. But like many workers in their 80s and 90s, Willson has no desire to give up on decades of effort, even if it means being stubborn. She feels she'll eventually find a way to make ends meet. Willson walks cautiously down the steps to her small storage room, filled with boxes of old papers. She pulls out her mother's Bible. In it are hundreds of annotations and notes mentioning Willson and her siblings. She flips through the pages, pauses to read her mother's heavy cursive handwriting, then puts it back in the box. Memories from eight decades flow through her mind as she steps carefully back to her desk using a walker. It's moments like this, she says, that give her the will to do everything in her power to stay around a little longer.                  Jump to","label":0}

And, of course, it's aiming its smartphone adventure at gamers. The company has started teasing its first handset, which it bills as \"a mobile phone truly made for gamers\". In the quick video teaser below, we can see the outline of its rear, which appears to house two camera sensors that are flush with the back cover, without any protrusions, RedMagic-style. Aside from that, there's not really much to go on here. \"Real gamers know gamers\", Ayaneo says, and that's surely true but there are plenty of gaming-focused phones on the market already, including from the aforementioned RedMagic. What Ayaneo can do to truly differentiate itself in this space remains to be seen. We do of course assume its device will run Android. Ayaneo promises this project was \"born from the pure love of gaming and the pursuit of dreams\". More teasers will undoubtedly follow, hopefully revealing some actual information about the device, so stay tuned. In the meantime, let us know: are you excited for an Ayaneo smartphone? Saw this and realized ROG Phone hasn't been in the news in recent times. What happened?  Not sure about the US, but in the EU, you have to pay for the import fee\/tax unless you buy a cheap product.

{"date":"2025-11-01","content":"ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The Fed is cutting, and that\u2019s bullish for preferred stocks and their big payouts. Let\u2019s look at a trio yielding up to 9.8% (paying monthly dividends) that will benefit from every ease from Mr. \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d Jay Powell. Most vanilla investors know common shares\u2014and stop there. They buy banks like Bank of America (BAC) or Wells Fargo (WFC) by typing \u201cBAC\u201d or \u201cWFC\u201d into their brokerage account. Financial firms also offer preferred shares with much bigger payouts. All we need to do is keep typing. Preferreds are part stock, part bond. These hybrids trade on regular exchanges under normal tickers. They pay dividends and represent ownership, but their income stems from \u201cbond\u201d DNA. Because of that, preferreds often trade like bonds. That\u2019s why they shine when rates fall. Buying individual preferreds is a hassle, however. Their tickers are alphabet soups. Plus, we need a basket of them for diversification. Enter closed-end funds (CEFs), which can employ leverage to juice their portfolios (and payouts) by an extra 10%, 20% and even 30%. These CEFs can, and often do, trade at discounts to their net asset values (NAVs). That makes them nice one-click buys for those of us who have actual lives. Let\u2019s discuss three preferred funds dishing divvies between 7.2% and 9.8%. And oh by the way, these funds pay monthly dividends. Cohen & Steers Limited Duration Preferred and Income Fund (LDP)Distribution Rate: 7.2% A steady 7.2% payer, Cohen & Steers Limited Duration Preferred and Income Fund (LDP) is a diversified bucket of 260 preferred payers from financial-sector stocks such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C). It\u2019s also global in nature, meaning U.S. companies are only part of the formula\u201450%, in fact. The other half of assets come from companies located in Canada, the U.K., France and a handful of other, predominantly developed markets. What makes LDP different is its focus on \u201cduration.\u201d Duration is a metric of interest-rate risk, typically measured in years, that\u2019s applied to bonds and fixed-income instruments such as preferreds. The calculation, which involves the value of cash flows, compounding periods and more, is a lot to explain here. But the oversimplified explanation goes like this: If a fund had a duration of 5 years, that would imply a 1-percentage-point increase in market interest rates would cause the fund to decline 5% over the short-term, and vice versa\u2014a percentage-point decline in rates would lift the fund by about 5%. Managers Elaine Zaharis-Nikas, Jerry Dorost and Robert Kastoff aim to invest in preferreds with lower overall duration, specifically aiming for a fund duration before leverage of less than 6 years. Now, the CEF\u2019s average modified duration of 6.6 comes in just ahead of both that goal, as well as the category average for all preferred funds of 6.56. But that duration reading includes the effects of very heavy debt leverage (33% currently). And here\u2019s what that portfolio gets us: The use of leverage also means LDP\u2019s performance will be exaggerated in both directions compared to basic index funds. That has worked out over the long term, but it can make for some drastic drops. Timing becomes much more important when deciding whether to jump into highly leveraged CEFs. A reminder: Closed-end funds tend to trade at either discounts or premiums to their net asset value (NAV), so it\u2019s sometimes possible to buy assets through CEFs more cheaply than we could on their own. Right now, for instance, LDP trades at a modest 3.5% discount to NAV\u2014but over the past five years, LDP has averaged a discount of closer to 4.5%. So it\u2019s cheap on a nominal basis, but relatively pricey from a historical perspective. John Hancock Preferred Income Fund III (HPS)Distribution Rate: 8.6% John Hancock Preferred Income Fund III (HPS) cranks up leverage to 37%, boosting its yield (8.6%) but also its volatility. HPS is the spicy option on our preferred menu today. HPS\u2019s four portfolio managers\u2019 strategy is pretty simple: Own a basket of preferred stocks with at least 50% exposure to investment-grade preferreds, from a variety of sectors. Right now, about 55% of the 161-stock portfolio is investment-grade in nature, and the lion\u2019s share of that is rated BBB (the lowest tier of investment-grade debt). The same percentage of assets is allocated to traditional preferreds; most of the rest is in convertible preferreds. Financials unsurprisingly lead the way, but at 60% of assets, they\u2019re not as prominent as they are in competing funds. U.S. preferreds dominate the portfolio, too, at a nearly 90% weight. Leverage is even higher in HPS, at 37%. However, it\u2019s a more volatile fund over the long run, at a beta of 1.19 vs. 0.74 for PFF. Valuation is a problem, though. John Hancock\u2019s preferred funds often trade at a premium, and that\u2019s the case here, with HPS trading at a 6% premium that\u2019s even wider than its historical long-term premium of 4%. Nuveen Preferred & Income Opportunities Fund (JPC)Distribution Rate: 9.8% Nuveen Preferred & Income Opportunities Fund (JPC) delivers a nifty 9.8% dividend with 80% investment-grade quality\u2014making it the best blend of yield and safety we\u2019re discussing today. Managers Brenda Langenfeld and Douglas Baker manage a global portfolio of about 260 preferreds, only a little more than half of which come from U.S. firms. Top holdings are a split of U.S. financials like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Truist Financial (TFC), and international sector names like Barclays (BCS) and HSBC Holdings (HSBC). Management maximizes possible exposure to their picks by utilizing debt leverage in the high 30s, which results in another PFF-pounding performance: The good news? JPC, by beta, is relatively stable compared to many other preferred funds. The bad news? Performance is a little muted, at least versus the aforementioned funds. While Wall Street chases Powell\u2019s next sound bite, we\u2019ll collect these monthly payouts (up to 9.8%) instead. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.
