Step aside, Elon Musk vs. Sam Altman. There's a new beef in the business world, and it centers on the stock market's biggest question: Is the AI boom a bubble? Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame and Palantir CEO Alex Karp have been trading barbs after the investor revealed he bet on Palantir's stock to plunge last quarter. The pair's clash boils down to a fundamental difference in views that's a microcosm of the market's big divide. Burry's assessment is that AI is a bubble, and the valuations of companies like Palantir are way out of whack. Karp's perspective is that Palantir is pioneering a technological revolution, its stock gains should be celebrated for enriching everyday Americans, and betting on his company to fail is just plain wrong. The wider investing community is similarly split between those who say current valuations are justified because AI will change the world, boost productivity, and supercharge economic growth and corporate profits, and those who warn they're overinflated and destined to burst like the dot-com bubble. While Musk and Altman are wrestling over OpenAI, Burry and Karp's dispute hinges on whether AI is worth every billion being thrown at it, or just the latest case of speculative fervor. Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. The feud began with Burry's Scion Asset Management disclosing last Monday that at the end of September, it held bearish put options on 5 million Palantir shares and 1 million Nvidia shares, worth a notional $912 million and $187 million, respectively. Burry had returned to X a few days earlier after a two-year hiatus, posting a cryptic message suggesting AI hype is unsustainable \u2014 but so perilous that \"the only winning move\" is to not get involved. He later posted an array of charts, book excerpts, and \"Star Wars\" memes drawing parallels between AI and the dot-com bubble. Burry's 13F filing was published on the same day as Palantir's third-quarter earnings. Shares of the AI-powered data analysis company tumbled as much as 10% the next day, and Karp lashed out at Burry on CNBC. \"As far as I can tell, the two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp said. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy.\" Burry fired back on X: \"Doesn't surprise me one bit that Alex Karp and his 'ontology' \u2026 cannot crack a simple 13F.\" Doesn\u2019t surprise me one bit that Alex Karp and his \u201contology\u201d @PalantirTech cannot crack a simple 13F.A fundamental principle of any rigorous ontological\/epistemological model - whether philosophical or in data science \u2013 is recognizing when your information set is insufficient\u2026 pic.twitter.com\/863pcAJSvG The Scion boss \u2014 best known for his massive bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in \"The Big Short\" \u2014 was likely nodding to 13Fs being published with a six-week lag, so Karp had no firm reason to think Burry had kept his Palantir and Nvidia puts throughout October and early November. Burry underscored that point in another X post : \"Fake news! I am not 5'6\" \u2014 meaning he's not short, physically or in his portfolio. Palantir stock has surged about 30-fold since the start of 2023, propelling it to a $453 billion market capitalization as of Tuesday's close. That's more than 100 times its projected revenue this year. Burry has doubled down on his bearish AI stance, posting on Monday that so-called hyperscalers such as Meta and Oracle are artificially boosting their earnings by understating the depreciation rates of their computing equipment. \"More detail coming November 25th,\" he teased. \"Stay tuned.\" The other high-profile duel in the AI world right now is, of course, Musk vs. Altman. Altman and Musk cofounded OpenAI along with two others in 2015. Musk stepped down from OpenAI's board in 2018, founded rival xAI in 2023, and has filed multiple lawsuits against Altman and OpenAI. Musk has accused Altman of \"stealing\" the organization from him, and of abandoning its founding mission by not keeping its code open-source, and by converting it from a nonprofit into a for-profit company. Altman recently fired back at Musk on X, saying he \"helped turn the thing you left for dead into what should be the largest nonprofit ever.\" But there's an important difference here. While the Altman-Musk split is about competing visions for the future of AI, Karp and Burry disagree over the technology's true worth \u2014 and whether the corporate titans harnessing it are overvalued. Burry is just the latest investor to wager that a company will falter and get in a shouting match with its defenders. Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn famously shorted Lehman Brothers months before it collapsed in September 2008 and helped trigger a global financial crisis. In presentations to investors and emails to management, he called out the investment bank's aggressive accounting and excessive leverage, and said it was putting itself and the financial system at risk by not addressing its problems. He was soon proven right. Similarly, Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates spotted red flags at Enron and shorted the energy giant before it filed for bankruptcy in late 2001. On the other hand, both Einhorn and Chanos have previously shorted Tesla and criticized Musk. Yet the automaker has defied its skeptics to become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a $1.5 trillion market capitalization. Both investors have raised similar concerns to Burry about the AI boom. Einhorn recently warned the industry's spending binge could result in a \"tremendous amount of capital destruction,\" and said the figures being \"thrown around are so extreme that it's really, really hard to understand them.\" Chanos recently made the same point as Burry about AI companies dragging out depreciation and delivering a \"huge boost\" to their reported earnings. He warned there could be a reckoning over the returns from their investments in microchips and servers, and both spending and earnings could \"collapse\" like they did during the dot-com crash and 2008 crisis. Whether Burry or Karp will be vindicated in their views on the AI boom is an open question. For now, the business world is waiting for the answer. Jump to","label":1}
{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"As Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses continue to turn your face into a computer, with a camera and speaker, Even Realities is doubling down on a design that eschews those components. Instead, it's focusing on extending your smartphone through the display of its smart glasses while figuring out new mechanisms for controlling the experience. Today, the company announced the Even G2 smart glasses, alongside the Even R1, its first-ever smart ring that controls the display of the G2. The Even G2 glasses don't look wholly different from the original G1 that debuted last summer, which is a good thing, because these are still among the sharpest-looking smart glasses on the market. At a closed-doors briefing a few weeks ago, Even Realities CEO Will Wang said the company didn't advertise its first product much, as it wanted to test it in the market and receive valuable feedback, while also working on expanding its retail presence. Today, you can find the G1 in 350 luxury eyewear shops around the world. The new Even G2 glasses cost $599, and the Even R1 is $249. Both are on sale today. There's an introductory promotion where anyone who buys the G2 can get the R1 and other G2 accessories for 50 percent off. With no camera or speaker, these glasses are all about the display, which is 75 percent larger on the G2. The company calls it Even HAO 2.0, which stands for Holistic Adaptive Optics. It combines mini micro-LED projectors, gradient wavelengths, and hi-def lenses for a dual-display picture that is sharper, brighter, and more stable during movement. The G2 also accommodates a wider range of lens prescriptions (from -12 to +12 diopters) to make them more accessible. They're made with a similar mix of titanium and magnesium alloy, but the G2 glasses are lighter than their predecessor (36 versus 44 grams). There are two silhouettes to choose from\u2014panto and rectangular\u2014and they come in gray, brown, or green. Like the previous model, you can add clip-on sunglasses for some shade. This time around, the G2 have an official IP67 dust- and water-resistance rating, so you can wear them without worry in the rain. Even Realities provided me with a sample, and the display is noticeably sharper and clearer than the G1. The glasses also fit much more comfortably thanks to that reduced weight, and the arms aren't as thick. I had to stop wearing the original G1 after a week, as I got a rash above my ear (the fit was tight), but the new G2 glasses don't feel as though they're hugging my face as tightly. Unfortunately, I have not been able to test the glasses extensively because the company didn't have my prescription ready yet. Stay tuned for my full review. As before, you can control the glasses with a series of taps on the thick module at the end of the arms, but if that's too cumbersome, you can upgrade with the Even R1 smart ring. The stainless steel R1 has a zirconia ceramic coating that feels quite luxe; pop it on your index finger and tap or scroll to move through the interface on the glasses (somewhat like the Sandbar Stream ring). Sadly, the R1 is not compatible with the older G1 glasses. The ring isn't just a way to control the screen; it can track your steps, monitor your heart rate, heart-rate variability, sleep, and even your blood oxygen levels. Unlike most smart rings, you can view all this information on the glasses themselves without a phone. Take all of this with a grain of salt, though. Even Realities doesn't have much experience in the health-tracking space, so the results from the R1 may not be up to par with those from smart rings dedicated to fitness and health. In my brief time with the R1, my health results didn't populate in the app, and the app constantly showed the ring's battery at zero even though it was charged and working. (In general, there seem to be quite a few bugs the company needs to work out.) Even Realities claims you can get two days of juice out of a single charge on the glasses, slightly more than before, with the charging case offering seven additional full charges before its battery depletes. The IP68-rated R1 ring supposedly lasts around four days. So what do you actually do with the G2? You can view notifications, use the translation function to see translated words of the person you're speaking with on the display of the glasses, see navigation instructions as you walk, and pin a to-do list. The microphones can hear when you say \u201cHey Even,\u201d and trigger the company's Even AI assistant, which can act like your standard-fare large language model chatbot today and answer your queries. Also in tow is a teleprompter\u2014Palmer Luckey wore the original G1 during a TED talk for this specific function and later said he used it to glance at his notes. Wang says all of these capabilities are improved on the G2\u2014for example, Even AI generates its answers three times faster than before\u2014but the hot new feature is Conversate. Turn it on during a conversation, and the company's \u201ccontextual AI\u201d will suggest follow-up questions, generate subtitles, summarize meetings, or even offer on-the-spot answers. You know, in case you forget how to human. The audio isn't saved, just the transcription. Later this year, the company says it'll launch Even Hub, a space for developers to design new capabilities for the G1 and G2 glasses. Even Realities is a small player in an increasingly crowded smart glasses marketplace. With Meta and Ray-Ban leading the pack, and Google and Samsung's Android XR initiative set to take off (with the likes of Gentle Monsters and Warby Parker) in 2026, and even Apple potentially wading into these waters, the humble G2 feels like an underdog. But Wang has a vision to become \u201cthe Tesla and OpenAI in the smart glasses space\u201d and challenge these tech behemoths despite their seemingly endless resources. So far, it's off to a strong start.

Ukrainian soldiers will soon be able to purchase weapons from an online \"Amazon\"-style marketplace using points earned for evacuating wounded comrades from the battlefield with ground robots, a top government official told Business Insider on Wednesday. Mykhailo Fedorov, the first deputy prime minister of Ukraine and its minister of digital transformation, said that the new incentive will begin within a month and fall under guidance from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We are already tracking and incentivizing logistics,\" Fedorov said in an interview, speaking through a translator and confirming the future rollout of the new points feature. Earlier in the war, Ukraine launched the Brave1 Market, a first-of-its-kind program that awards \"ePoints\" to soldiers for killing Russian troops or destroying their equipment and verifying the successful hit by uploading drone footage to a military network. The Ukrainian soldiers can use the reward points to buy drones, robots, electronic warfare devices, and other defense technology and systems from an online marketplace. Each Russian target has its own value; killing a soldier might be worth a dozen points while destroying a tank may be worth as many as 40. Wounding or damaging a target yields fewer points. The portal allows military units to order directly from manufacturers, skirting government-run supply chains and streamlining the overall procurement process. Weaponry can be delivered straight to the front lines in a matter of days. Last week, Zelenskyy said Ukraine should include soldier evacuation by robot as a way for troops to earn points. \"I think this is fair because saving a person's life, our person's life, is a priority.\" Fedorov, who spearheads Ukrainian defense innovation, said that a soldier who saves their comrade using the evacuation robots will earn \"10 times more points\" than if they were to kill a Russian. Uncrewed ground vehicles have emerged as valuable tools for the Ukrainian military because of their many battlefield functions \u2014 some of which would otherwise be tremendously dangerous tasks if performed by humans. These remotely controlled robots can carry out logistics and combat missions, including evacuating wounded soldiers, delivering ammunition to the front lines, carrying weapons, launching assaults on Russian positions, placing mines, and even exploding next to enemy armored vehicles. \"We are truly a believer in UGVs,\" Fedorov said, sharing that more and more Ukrainian brigades are opting to use the robots for logistics missions. Some units are using them to move tens of thousands of tons of cargo and supplies. Fedorov said there are some \"high-profile cases\" of the UGVs helping to evacuate soldiers, and many other instances that are less public. The new incentives on the Brave1 Market could significantly increase the frequency of this particular mission for the robots. Casualty evacuation is particularly challenging in Ukraine, given the difficulties of bringing wounded soldiers back from vulnerable spots near the front line, US military veterans who have fought there previously told Business Insider. The prevalence of drones for surveillance and strikes makes it dangerous for the wounded and medical personnel to carry out an evacuation, even at night under the cover of darkness. UGVs lower the risk to medical crews, presenting a less valuable target, but Ukrainian soldiers have said that the ground robots have issues as well at times. A severed connection, for instance, could leave a wounded soldier exposed and vulnerable. Russia also fields UGVs, one tool in an ever-expanding inventory of uncrewed systems. Kyiv and Moscow also operate aerial and naval drones, and both sides continue to make modifications to their uncrewed weapons to make them harder to stop, such as by leaning more on jamming-resistant fiber-optic cables instead of radio frequency connections. The Brave1 Market catalog is extensive, and soldiers can use it to buy all sorts of military equipment, from drones, ground robots, and guns to electronic warfare devices, cameras, batteries, engines, and satellite communication systems. Units from across Ukraine's armed forces compete, and a leaderboard tracks the accumulation of points. \"Birds of Madyar,\" a prominent drone brigade, topped the Brave1 Market charts last month. Fedorov calls it the \"Amazon for war\" because soldiers can purchase hardware directly from manufacturers in just a few clicks; when they exchange their \"ePoints,\" the Ukrainian government foots the bill. In just three months, Ukrainian units have already procured some 6 billion hryvnias ($142 million) worth of equipment, Fedorov said, adding that the Brave1 Market plays a crucial role by showcasing defense products for quick purchase rather than forcing soldiers to rely on a slower-moving, centralized, government-led procurement process. The development of the marketplace highlights Ukraine's efforts to accelerate the delivery of arms and other military equipment to the front lines through more grassroots-level initiatives. Crowdfunding, for instance, has been a way for the government to quickly raise funds that are then used to purchase weapons. However, the marketplace also amplifies some long-standing concerns about drone warfare \u2014 that the ability to kill an enemy remotely and share the footage dehumanizes conflict. For Ukraine, Brave1 Market is yet another example of government innovation brought on by the full-scale invasion. Fedorov said the platform allows manufacturers to list new technology that the government \u2014 or military units \u2014 might not have known about otherwise. Tens of thousands of drones alone have already been ordered through the platform. \"It's kind of living its own life,\" he said. \"So in a network-centric war, in hindsight, this feels like a very revolutionary \u2014 yet logical \u2014 step.\" Jump to","label":0}

The 50-inch size hits the sweet spot for most living rooms and bedrooms, large enough for an immersive viewing experience without overwhelming your space. This Insignia F50 Series 4K Fire TV just dropped to an all-time low of $179 on Amazon, down from its regular $299 price. For this price, you\u2019ll get a smart TV equipped with Ultra HD resolution, HDR10 support and built-in Fire TV streaming without the premium pricing that Samsung or LG demand for similar specs. See at Amazon The 3840\u00d72160 resolution supplies four times the pixel density of standard 1080p displays\u00c2\u00a0which becomes evident when watching nature documentaries or sports where fine details make all the difference. Textures in clothes are finer, individual blades of grass on football fields are more distinguishable, and facial features during close-ups are sharper. The upscaling engine takes your existing HD content from cable boxes or Blu-ray players and upscales it to near-4K quality, filling in missing information via intelligent processing. This means that even older shows and movies look better than they did on your previous TV. HDR10 opens up a wider color gamut than what standard dynamic range displays can show, and displays subtle gradations in bright skies and shadow details that might otherwise disappear to black. Sunsets contain more layers of orange and red rather than a flat blob of color, and dark movie scenes reveal details in shadows without washing out the overall image. This wider color gamut makes animated films pop with vibrant hues while live-action content receives a more realistic appearance that feels closer to what your eyes see in real life. The Fire TV interface puts streaming apps front and center and removes the need for external streaming sticks or boxes that clutter your entertainment center. Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max load directly from the home screen, and the system remembers where you left off across different services. Voice control through the included Alexa remote lets you search for content by speaking actor names, movie titles, or even vague descriptions. DTS Virtual-X processing does give simulated surround sound from the TV\u2019s built-in speakers, and furthers dialogue clarity and adding spatial depth to action sequences. It analyzes the audio signal and adjusts the output of the speakers to create an impression of height and width that goes beyond the physical speaker placements. Of course, it is not a replacement for a dedicated sound system, but it considerably enhances the viewing experience compared to the thin, tinny audio that plagues budget TVs. HDMI eARC support transmits full-resolution audio from streaming apps or connected devices to compatible soundbars and receivers without compression. This type of connection is used to handle more advanced audio formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X which need higher bandwidth than the standard HDMI ARC allows. You can attach a soundbar later with no concerns about limitations of audio quality and the automatic switching of the audio output when connecting compatible equipment occurs seamlessly. The refresh rate of 60Hz handles standard TV content and movies smoothly, and refreshed the image 60 times per second so that motion blur does not occur when the camera pans or there is fast action on screen. Smart home integration allows Ring doorbell feeds, Philips Hue lights, or Nest thermostats to be accessed through the TV interface using voice commands. Content from iPhones and iPads can directly mirror onto the screen via Apple AirPlay, without the use of additional casting devices. But this Insignia TV delivers on most people\u2019s actual usage at a price point of just $179 for a 50-inch 4K display with streaming built in, rather than requiring months of budgeting.

Can the AI boom continue to prop up the US economy? Moody's Analytics' top economist Mark Zandi isn't so sure. Zandi has raised a lot of red flags this year over what he sees as waning economic strength in the face of strengthening headwinds. In a post this week, he said that the US may still avoid a recession in the coming year, but only if everything goes exactly right.  The major risk he sees is that the boost to the economy provided by the AI boom will be diminished by another global megatrend: deglobalization. \"Whether the economy grows and successfully navigates the crosswinds of deglobalization and AI depends on nothing going off script,\" he said. \"Of course, when it comes to the tariffs, a lot could.\" Zandi has raised concerns that Trump's trade policies could accelerate America's descent into a recession. Now he sees deglobalization as a growing threat to economic progress, as tariffs and restrictive immigration policies elevate costs and put pressure on the labor market.  AI has contributed 0.63 percentage points to GDP growth this year, and without it, the US economy would likely be in a recession, Zandi said. However, deglobalization will weigh on further expansion next year.  \"Deglobalization will remain a significant drag in 2026, reducing real GDP growth by 1.19 percentage points,\" the economist added.  He went on to note that the ultimate benefits of AI also might not be felt for some time, citing other examples of \"pathbreaking technologies\" that only contributed to growth once they were more fully integrated into businesses.  Additionally, Zandi raised concerns that the benefits of AI are largely confined to the already wealthy, which could limit its contributions to overall economic growth, even if the AI boom continues to drive up stock prices. \"Our already highly skewed income and wealth distribution will become even more so,\" he predicted. \"The economic and political struggle between the haves and have-nots will intensify, to everyone's detriment.\" Zandi added that the macroeconomic fallout from the US government shutdown could also push the economy off script, even as the government prepares to reopen this week.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"                 Reading time 2 minutes        These days, the tech world is obsessed with humanoid robots, and every company worth its salt is racing to develop its own bipedal droid that it can push to market. Unfortunately, a lot of these robots don\u2019t seem to work very well yet. Case in point: This week, a Russian company unveiled its much-hyped prototype for its humanoid bot, only to have the machine face-plant onstage in front of hundreds of onlookers. The robot in question, AIdol, is the product of a Russian company called Idol, which was presenting at a forum from the New Technology Coalition, which The Telegram describes as an \u201cassociation of companies for the development of humanoid robots.\u201d The bot, described as \u201cRussia\u2019s first anthropomorphic robot,\u201d unfortunately lost balance, fell down, and broke onstage. Numerous outlets have noted the sad irony that the event was playing music from the Rocky soundtrack when the bot took its tumble. A video of the incident clearly shows the robot\u2019s not-so-glorious debut: Vladimir Vitukhin, Idol\u2019s CEO, has been quoted as saying, of the incident: \u201cThis is precisely the kind of real-time learning where a successful mistake turns into knowledge, and an unsuccessful one turns into experience. I hope that this mistake turns into experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If the recent incident was a little embarrassing, Idol is not alone. Most of the \u201crobots\u201d that have been unveiled in public over the past few years have suffered similar fates. Remember when Elon Musk initially unveiled the \u201cTesla bot,\u201d and it was just a dude in a suit? Musk has since shared more concrete evidence of \u201cOptimus\u201d (the bot\u2019s new name), but the shame of that original incident persists. That said, there are other robotics companies that are doing amazing (if not deeply unsettling) things in the same space where other companies seem to be floundering. For instance, there\u2019s Boston Dynamics, the company that brought us the 4-legged robot \u201cdog\u201d dubbed \u201cSpot.\u201d The company has also had some success with building humanoid-style bots. \u201cAtlas,\u201d the bipedal robot produced with funding from DARPA, is notably more capable than a lot of its peers.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"EV and future tech Classic and collector Deals and buying guides Ownership Safety and recalls Policy and environment New vehicles and reviews Auto shows General People and culture ... SUVs deliver many attributes that car shoppers love in a vehicle. Thanks to their elevated height, they provide a commanding view of the road. They also deliver lots of passenger space, roomy cargo holds, and often have strong safety ratings. Less appealing are higher fuel bills and the expense of buying an SUV that\u2019s showroom-fresh. The experts at Edmunds have found five solutions on the used market to keep costs in line. Choosing a used hybrid SUV saves money at the point of purchase, and the hybrid engine helps lower the cost of refueling for many miles down the road. Using a price cap of $25,000, Edmunds\u2019 team has compiled five used hybrid-powered SUVs that are practical and kind to a car shopping budget. Ford Escape The Escape Hybrid is the fuel-sipping cousin of Ford\u2019s popular compact SUV. Getting it down the road is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired to an electric motor. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional. In terms of fuel economy, both the front-wheel-drive and all-wheel drive models delivers an EPA-estimated 39 mpg combined. Edmunds has complimented the Escape\u2019s comfortable ride, easy-to-use controls and everyday practicality. Look for:Arriving for the 2020 model year, the fourth-generation Escape Hybrid is a well-rounded driving companion. For 2023, Ford updated the infotainment system and exterior design. For added peace of mind, it\u2019s worth knowing the hybrid has always come standard with Ford\u2019s Co-Pilot360 bundle of driver assist features. Honda CR-V The Honda CR-V has long been a top choice for SUV shoppers looking for reliable transportation at an affordable price. During testing, Edmunds complimented the driving refinement of the CR-V with the available hybrid powertrain. Braking and handling are equally polished, though Edmunds noted accelerating from 0 to 60 mph took 8.5 seconds \u2014 1 second longer than the non-hybrid model. Fuel economy is strong at an EPA-estimated 38 mpg combined city\/highway for 2020-2022 models. The spacious interior has good outward visibility and generous cargo space. Look for:The hybrid version of the previous generation CR-V ran from 2020 through 2022. Standard equipment included all-wheel drive, a 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Honda Sensing suite of driver assist features. Honda dropped the entry-level LX trim for the 2021 model year, so used prices tick upward from that point. Hyundai Tucson Making a styling statement isn\u2019t always high on car shoppers\u2019 priority list. Hyundai didn\u2019t get that memo because the Tucson Hybrid\u2019s eye-catching design is highlighted by a sculpted exterior and headlights hidden within the pattern of the grille. Under the hood is a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder and electric motor coupled to standard all-wheel drive. Fuel economy is up to 38 mpg combined depending on the trim and model year. Better still, Edmunds notes this peppier drivetrain addresses the non-hybrid Tucson\u2019s sluggish acceleration. Look for:The redesigned Tucson created a splash when it arrived for the 2022 model year. Its upscale interior matched the bold exterior; the cabin was filled with high-quality materials, and standard features included an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone connectivity. The Tucson also has an outstanding warranty, including 10 years\/100,000 miles of powertrain coverage. Kia Niro The Niro makes a strong case for itself based on its lower price point and excellent economy. Along with the Niro hybrid, there are plug-in and fully electrified versions. Given its small size, the Niro delivers a surprising amount of passenger space and cargo room. The ride is generally smooth, though Edmunds noted it can get unsettled on bumpy roads. A class-leading warranty and up to an EPA-estimated 53 mpg combined, depending on the trim and model year, are two additional standout qualities. Look for:A redesign for the 2023 model year gave the Niro a futuristic shape and improved cabin quality. Edmunds complimented the interior design but found some audio and climate controls overly finicky. The Niro is also front-wheel-drive, with no option to add all-wheel drive. Yet its budget-friendly prices mean used versions readily come in below $25,000. Toyota RAV4 The RAV4 Hybrid uses the strong foundation of Toyota\u2019s best-selling SUV and adds greater fuel economy and speedier acceleration. Edmunds found the all-wheel-drive RAV4 Hybrid needed 7.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph \u2014 a second faster than the non-hybrid version. Fuel economy is excellent thanks to EPA-estimated combined average of up to 40 mpg depending on trim and model year. The RAV4 also has near class-leading cargo space, plus a low load floor that\u2019s appreciated when loading heavy items. Look for:The fifth generation of the RAV4 and RAV4 Hybrid was available from 2019 to 2025. Outside of some upgraded tech touches \u2014 such as a larger touchscreen and improved smartphone connectivity \u2014 changes were minimal. The RAV4 holds onto its resale value, so older used models will more easily fall under $25,000. Edmunds says A well-maintained used hybrid SUV is a savvy way to save money when sealing the deal and in terms of keeping fuel bills reasonable. ____________ This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

Gen Z workers could lose out as firms chase AI. That's according to economist Marc Sumerlin, who said companies betting on AI may soon scale back hiring of young workers. \"I'm very worried that companies now are going to say: 'I know I'm not getting the returns on AI right now, but I can see it coming \u2014 and so I'm going to stop hiring young people now,'\" Sumerlin \u2014 among the frontrunners to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 told Australia's ABC News this week. He warned that while AI could eventually boost productivity, its early impact on the labor market may be painful for new entrants. \"Before we get the good part of AI, we might get the bad part first, which is less hiring,\" he said. Sumerlin, who served as deputy director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, said that many companies he has spoken to over the past six months are \"dramatically seeing better results\" from early AI integration. That could make companies more cautious about hiring. \"When they hire a new worker, it often takes a year or two before they get value from that worker,\" he said. \"There's a lot of training, and so companies invest in young people, and then after a couple years, they start to get returns.\" He pointed to a troubling signal: unemployment among recent graduates is already ticking higher, suggesting a slowdown in the pipeline of early-career opportunities.  The Fed said in August that the unemployment rate for recent young college graduates was averaging 4.59% so far in 2025, compared to 3.25% in 2019. Sumerlin's comments come as the Federal Reserve struggles to assess the economy's true health. With the government shutdown halting the release of key data, he said the central bank has been \"driving in the fog,\" and will be making decisions without its usual visibility into employment trends. Despite that uncertainty, Sumerlin argued that inflation is easing and that the Fed should cut rates to support the labor market. \"We can see the unemployment rate has gone up for two straight years very gradually,\" he said. \"That tells me we're too tight.\" Sumerlin's warning echoes growing unease about how AI is reshaping the first rung of the career ladder. In London, City veteran Quentin Nason told Business Insider that AI has turned graduate hiring into a \"meat grinder,\" overwhelming recruiters and crushing a generation of debt-laden job seekers. Others see opportunity where he sees risk. Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn cofounder, has called Gen Z \"AI native\" and \"enormously attractive\" to employers precisely because of their fluency with the technology. Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, meanwhile, urged young job seekers to focus less on collecting skills and more on mastering tasks AI can't easily replicate. But Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and economist Gary Shilling shared a more pessimistic view, that many entry-level roles could disappear before new ones emerge, and that younger generations will need to hustle to succeed in the AI era. Goldman Sachs data from August showed rising unemployment among young tech workers, with the jobless rate for 20- to 30-year-olds in the sector up nearly 3 percentage points since early 2024 \u2014 more than four times the increase in the overall rate.

Samsung has long been known to be working on a new tri-folding form factor for foldable phones, and while the company has already showcased the Galaxy Z TriFold once, it looks like Samsung has finally set an official launch date for the device. Samsung officially showcased the Galaxy Z TriFold at the APEC 2025 conference in Korea. However, that showcase was limited, with the device displayed behind glass and no media or attendees allowed to go hands-on. Samsung also did not reveal any additional details about the device at the conference. Now, it appears the company is ready to launch the device in the market. According to the Korean outlet Chosun Biz (via @UniverseIce on X), Samsung is planning to host a launch event for the Galaxy Z TriFold on December 5, 2025, in Korea. The report states that sales will begin shortly after in China and Korea and could include other Asian markets in the initial rollout. However, Samsung is expected to keep availability limited, reportedly producing only 20,000 to 30,000 units in the first phase. As for the specifications, the Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to feature a 6.5-inch outer display with an inner folding screen that unfolds into a 10-inch panel. While it may not be as thin as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it will measure 4.2 mm when unfolded and about 14 mm when folded. The device will reportedly be powered by a 5,600 mAh battery. It'll also include a 200-megapixel primary camera, similar to the one on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Nonetheless, we finally have a date for the Galaxy Z TriFold launch. This marks the first time in years that Samsung will introduce a new smartphone form factor. Due to its complex design and structure, the price is expected to be quite high (~$3,000), similar to the competing Huawei Mate XT. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android It remains unclear whether the U.S. market will be part of the first batch of countries to receive the Galaxy Z TriFold, but rumors suggest that Samsung does plan to launch the device in the States.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Pay Dirt is Slate\u2019s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. (It\u2019s anonymous!) Dear Pay Dirt, I am 66, and my wife is 61. Our goals are to leave our three children (32, 28, and 27) as much as possible while continuing to live our lives. I want clarification on the best way to do this. We own our home and another that we rent to a friend for what section 8 pays her. We have about $1 million in mortgages. I have $5.8 million in retirement, and my wife has $1.5 million. I am still employed ($330,000 salary) for at least another couple years. Our burn rate is approximately $300,000 per year. When my 94-year-old mother dies, I will inherit approximately $2.5 million. I expect to pay off the mortgages when my mother passes. We have no other debt. At some point, we will collect $9,000 per month in social security. We shell out for a $1.5 million last-to-die life insurance policy to cover assisted living expenses. All of my retirement is in stock (Tesla, Apple, Google, etc.). I have done very well with it. I know everyone (the New York Times, Charles Schwab, ChatGPT, etc.) strongly advises putting a significant amount of money in bonds, funds, etc. and drastically decreasing what is in stock. My wife thinks so, too. But I see the charts and historical recounting about how the best possible investment over time is stock, and nothing else (again, over time) does nearly as well.So my question is: If we have enough money to weather a massive correction (say, a bucket placed in bonds that would cover two years expenses), doesn\u2019t it make sense to keep everything in stock?\u00a0What am I missing? \u2014Everyone Should Have These Issues Dear Everyone Should, You\u2019re right that stocks have historically outperformed bonds over long stretches. But at your age, the risk isn\u2019t whether stocks eventually recover, it\u2019s whether you\u2019ll need to sell during a downturn to fund living expenses or meet obligations. You might have the reserves to weather a downturn, but the risk still exists. It\u2019s called sequence\u2011of\u2011returns risk: Bad timing can erode your wealth faster than you expect, especially if your goal is to preserve it for your kids. You probably already know all this, but a quick rundown for everyone else: Think of bonds and cash as insurance. They don\u2019t beat stocks, but they give you stability and liquidity when markets are volatile. Having \u201ceverything in stock\u201d leaves you exposed to the possibility of a deep correction right when you might need the money, forcing you to sell low. Like you said, you\u2019ve got the money to weather even a massive correction, but the question becomes: Why risk your wealth if you don\u2019t need to? Even if one or two of your holdings drop in price, that could have a big impact on your portfolio. On the other hand, you have a solid point if you\u2019re planning to pass some of this wealth down to your kids. It might make more sense to keep that inheritance in the market for long-term growth. Are you talking to a wealth advisor? Because they can help you plan all of this in a way that makes the most sense for your situation. Articles, blanket advice and chatbots aren\u2019t going to give you the personalized, generational wealth building plan that an advisor will.        Please keep questions short (<150 words), and don\u2018t submit the same question to multiple columns. We are unable to edit or remove questions after publication. Use pseudonyms to maintain anonymity. Your submission may be used in other Slate advice columns and may be edited for publication.      Thanks! Your question has been submitted. Dear Pay Dirt, My husband is balding like many guys in their 30s. He\u2019s never had any major appearance hangups\u2014weight, clothes, working out, he\u2019s all fine if it comes and goes. But the hair is a big deal to him. He loves his hair, and with it thinning, he feels like he suddenly looks in the mirror and sees his deadbeat dad. For the past few years he\u2019s been doing prescription treatment. But this year he decided on a hair transplant. We make OK money but no frills, and divide our budget into shared expenses, savings, and personal fun money every month. He\u2019s been strict with saving his fun money, and my gift for his birthday this year was a chunk of my fun money towards this procedure too. But it\u2019s going slower than he wants, especially because costs are rising faster than expected. He floated taking a side gig to get to his savings goal more quickly. I feel like a bad spouse but I don\u2019t want him to. We\u2019re parenting twin toddlers, and we both work full time, so daily life is a chaotic balancing act. I know there are lots of hyper-competent people out there, but if I have to manage\u00a0more\u00a0of our kids or household solo while he\u2019s at a second job, we might drown. How do I balance helping my husband solve this thing that\u2019s very important to him with the practicalities of our household? I want to talk with him about getting it done overseas as a potential cost saving, too, but he\u2019s convinced he\u2019ll end up in a place where he can\u2019t speak the language with a botched procedure. \u2014Hair Raising Problem Dear Hair Raising, Hair loss can bring up a lot of issues for people beyond appearance\u2014issues about aging, identity, even mortality. Plus, men aren\u2019t exactly encouraged to deal with their feelings in a healthy way, so it\u2019s easy to see why your husband might be hyperfocused on this. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to let this whole thing take over your lives. It\u2019s starting to affect your family, which is not okay. Parenting twin toddlers is already a marathon, and assuming you\u2019re in a traditional, cisgender marriage, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re already running the bulk of it. If your husband takes on a side gig, that could make things straight up unsustainable for all of you. It might seem like overkill to suggest therapy, but even a support group or online forum could help him deal with the bigger issues. That doesn\u2019t mean he needs to abandon his transplant goal, but having some kind of support can keep it from taking over everything else. He might be aware of these resources already\u2014ask him about it. Let him know you understand how much this matters to him, and that you want him to feel good about himself. But you also want to make sure your household is fully functioning. You\u2019ve already been plenty supportive, but that support cannot come at the expense of your own bandwidth and mental health. Set a boundary. Let him know that you want to help him fund this, but the chaotic balancing act can\u2019t sustain him working more hours. You can try to come up with some practical solutions, like looking at a different timeline for saving, or trying to find areas he can cut back on instead of taking a second job. The bottom line is that he\u2019s entitled to his personal goals, but it can\u2019t come at the expense of his family. Framing this as a shared challenge \u2014 how do we make this work without hurting the family?\u2014it will help you stay on the same team. This question was also submitted to our Good Job column. Check out Doree Shafrir\u2019s response.  \u2014Kristin My father is severely mentally ill and suffers from Parkinson\u2019s disease and moderate cognitive impairment. He is currently living in an assisted living facility across the country from my sister and me. He used to be very wealthy and has not worked for almost all of my life. My parents divorced when we were kids, and my dad was a verbally abusive parent, although he was loving too. Later on, he became violent toward his girlfriend of 20 years, and she eventually left him. Now he has run out of money and can no longer afford the assisted living facility.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"This comes after the treasury secretary appeared to cast doubt on payments. President Donald Trump remains \"committed\" to sending each American a $2,000 dividend check to be distributed from tariff revenue, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday. White House officials are exploring ways to execute the plan put forward by Trump in a social media post over the weekend, Leavitt added, but she did not provide details about specific options. \"The president made it clear he wants to make it happen,\" Leavitt told reporters at the White House. \"So his team of economic advisers are looking into it.\" The firm stance from the White House comes days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to cast doubt on Trump's proposal, saying the payout could merely refer to tax savings enshrined by Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill legislation. A tariff dividend may come \"in lots of forms,\" Bessent told ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, adding that he had not spoken with Trump about the proposal. \"It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility on auto loans. Those are substantial deductions that are being financed in the tax bill,\" Bessent added. Some economists have questioned whether the dividend is achievable with available tariff funds. Trump announced the policy proposal in a brief message on social media on Sunday morning, focused on tariff-related tax revenue. \"People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER,\" the president wrote. \"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\" The message did not specify who would qualify for the payout or how the policy would operate. Two pandemic-era stimulus checks authorized by Trump were made available to individuals bringing in as much as $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000. Beyond those benchmarks, higher earners were eligible for smaller payments. If Trump were to make the dividend payments available to anyone earning $100,000 or less, the policy would reach about 150 million Americans, amounting to roughly $300 billion in dividends, Erica York, a policy expert at the Tax Foundation, said in a post on X. As of Sept. 30, the federal government had generated $195 billion in tariff-related revenue, according to the Treasury Department. By that math, the estimated $300 billion cost of the dividend check proposal would far exceed the amount of currently available tariff revenue. In theory, however, the Trump administration could promise to pay the dividend from anticipated tariff revenue. The Treasury Department has forecast $3 trillion in tariff revenue over the next decade. Should the Trump administration choose that route, the dividend payments would add to the federal debt, which currently stands at over $38 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Can Valve's new Steam Machine avoid the rising costs of memory and storage, or will it launch with a higher price than expected?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Valve, the company that owns the immensely popular Steam storefront and that kicked off the handheld gaming craze in 2022 with the Steam Deck, just covertly announced three new Steam devices today. The entr\u00e9e is an all-new Steam Machine powered by a six-core AMD Zen 4 CPU and a semi-custom RDNA 3 GPU, together capable of delivering \"4K gaming at 60 FPS\" when using AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR). It's sort of like a console, except it has access to Steam's gigantic library of PC games and it runs on SteamOS. This is actually a revival of Valve's earlier small-form-factor devices, which debuted in 2015 but mostly fizzled out by 2018. Will this second attempt at making it work gain more traction? That's anyone's guess, but the immense success that the Steam Deck has enjoyed suggests that Valve really knows what it's doing with its hardware and ecosystem. Joining the Steam Machine are a new Steam Frame VR headset and a new Steam Controller to tie everything together, with compatibility across all of Valve's modern devices and regular PCs. One piece of data that's missing from Valve's announcements is pricing. Valve is targeting a Spring 2026 launch for its new hardware, so there are a few months left for tariffs and supply chain breakdowns to muck things up. However, by looking at similar hardware and Valve's competitive nature, we can surmise as to what the Steam Machine might cost when it finally debuts.      Valve hasn't yet set a price for the Steam Machine, so I'll preface this by reminding you that it's all speculation. Jumping back to the Steam Deck's launch in 2022, Valve focused on attractive pricing and a tight ecosystem with its custom OS and massive collection of games rather than raw power. The Steam Deck's custom AMD chip wasn't cutting edge, and its display was rather ordinary. You could pick up an introductory model for $399, though, which was too good a deal for many gamers to pass up. I'm expecting to see a similar situation with the Steam Machine. Valve has opted for a Zen 4 processor and an RDNA 3 GPU to power the device, both of which are a generation behind the latest Zen 5 and RDNA 4 architectures from AMD. Regardless, Steam says the Machine should provide more than six times as much performance as the Steam Deck. Here's a quick look at the raw specs of the Steam Machine. Feature Specifications Models 512GB model and 2TB model. Can ship bundled with or without a Steam Controller.  CPU Semi-custom AMD Zen 4, 6C \/ 12T, up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP GPU Semi-Custom AMD RDNA3, 28 CUs; 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP; Supports 4K gaming @ 60 FPS with FSR; Ray tracing supported; Over 6x more powerful than Steam Deck. Memory 16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM Storage 512GB & 2TB SSD models; microSD card slot for expanded storage \/ portable catalog.  Power Internal PSU, AC 110\u2013240V DisplayPort 1.4 Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K @ 60Hz; HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining HDMI 2.0 Up to 4K @ 120Hz; HDR, FreeSync, CEC Networking Ethernet 1 Gbps; Wi-Fi 6E (2x2); dedicated BT antenna USB USB-C 10 Gbps (3.2 Gen 2); 4\u00d7 USB-A ports (2\u00d7 USB 3 front, 2\u00d7 USB 2 rear) Controller Radio Integrated Steam Controller 2.4GHz radio Compatibility Works with other controllers, accessories, and PC peripherals Wake Function Wake with Steam Controller OS SteamOS (like Steam Deck); Gaming-first UX; Fast suspend\/resume; Steam Cloud saves + full Steam features.  LED Bar Customizable colors & animation; Reflects system status (downloads, booting, updating) There's also not really one standout feature that I can see will drive the Steam Machine's price up, other than the option for 2TB of storage. There are no Thunderbolt licenses required from Intel (nor any USB4 for that matter), no Windows 11 licensing fees, no display, no wacky case design, no built-in controls, and basic performance specs. Considering you can currently buy a new Steam Deck with an OLED display, four-core Zen 2 CPU, RDNA 2 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage space for $549, I wouldn't be surprised to see the new Steam Machine debut somewhere between $650 and $750. It's worth mentioning that the Xbox Series X Digital Edition now sells for $599.99 in the US, jumping to $649.99 for a version with a disc drive. The PS5 Pro costs a whopping $749.99, but you can pick up the standard Slim edition with a disc drive for about $550. It's expected that the next console generation will be more expensive as Microsoft attempts to further bridge consoles and PCs, but that's still a way out. I wouldn't be surprised to see the new Steam Machine debut somewhere between $650 and $750. This makes it extra important for Valve to set the Steam Machine's price at something both console and PC gamers can appreciate. Too expensive, and console gamers will simply wait for the next Xbox. Too expensive, and PC gamers will build their own system for less or check out the growing selection of great mini PCs already on the market. Steam says it plans to sell the Steam Machine alone or bundled with its new Steam Controller. With long battery life, magnetic TMR thumbsticks, and dual touchpads, I'd wager that the Steam Controller should cost somewhere between $100 and $200. Whether or not you'll see a discount with a bundle remains to be seen.      Something that might get overlooked is the value that Valve's ecosystem delivers. Like the Steam Deck, and Steam Machine will run SteamOS, a custom Linux-based operating system that's stripped back to focus on performance and ease-of-use. Valve's Steam store, the largest vendor of PC games in the world, is also a huge boon. There are countless PC-exclusive games that I wish my console gamer friends could enjoy, and the timely sales events often drive prices to unbelievable lows. Steam's ecosystem also includes powerful social tools, making it easy to game with your friends. Best part? There's no monthly fee to get online and play, which is a requirement for console gaming.      The tech market has been under siege from tariffs, supply chain breakdowns, and component shortages for months, and the future isn't exactly looking bright. I can't predict what global trade will look like next year, but I do know that AI could cause a problem. One of the biggest issues I see affecting the Steam Machine's Spring 2026 launch is memory and storage pricing. There is a massive DRAM shortage right now caused by the frantic buildout of AI infrastructure, and it's not expected to end anytime soon. The same surge is now affecting hard drive prices. I have no idea what Valve's supply chain looks like, but it's hard to imagine it can escape the same squeeze that is driving $100 RAM modules for your PC up to $500 and beyond.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. 16 hours ago  The Samsung Galaxy S26 series is expected to be powered by Snapdragon or Exynos processors. But which model will you be getting in your country? Well, a Korean news outlet has revealed some details. ET News reports that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset globally. This isn\u2019t exactly a surprise, as we recently heard that there wouldn\u2019t be an Exynos version of the Ultra phone. Don\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Meanwhile, the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus are reportedly set to use both the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and Exynos 2600 chips, depending on the region. The outlet reports that North America will receive the Snapdragon variants, while Korea and Europe will receive the Exynos models. \u201cThere were many concerns because the Exynos 2600 was the first 2-nanometer AP [application processor \u2013 ed] to be attempted, but it delivered satisfactory performance thanks to factors such as the application of the Heat Pass Block. However, I understand that supply was limited due to yield issues,\u201d a source told ET News. It\u2019s believed that Snapdragon variants will account for 70% of total S26 series shipments. This arrangement would be in line with the Galaxy S24 series, as the Galaxy S24 Ultra used the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chip in all markets. By contrast, the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus were available in both Exynos and Snapdragon flavors. The Exynos phones were available in EMEA markets and Korea, while the Snapdragon variants were available in North America. This news might annoy some Samsung fans, as the Exynos versions have traditionally lagged behind the Snapdragon models when it comes to performance. In saying so, we found that Exynos versions of Galaxy phones could deliver longer battery life than Snapdragon variants. Recent Exynos chips also support Google\u2019s Linux Terminal app for Android, but it turns out the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 doesn\u2019t support this feature.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"You can basically get the Classic LTE upgrade for the same price as the Bluetooth model on Amazon, making it cheaper than the Pixel Watch 4 45mm LTE.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When it comes to the best LTE smartwatches, Samsung, Google, and Apple each have their upsides. Apple Watches have 5G connectivity, while the Pixel Watch 4 LTE has satellite SOS support; Samsung's upside is that it typically charges half as much as its rivals for the cellular upgrade. Right now, you can essentially get the 4G LTE upgrade for the Watch 8 Classic for \"free.\" On Amazon, the standard Bluetooth Watch 8 Classic is $469 ($30 off), while the Watch 8 Classic LTE is also $469 ($80 off), an all-time low according to Camelcamelcamel. You'll find a similar $80-off discount on the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025), which includes LTE, if you're willing to spend another $100 for a titanium case and longer battery life for cellular tasks. But the Classic is the more affordable option, with better controls and similar perks. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has the most striking design of Samsung's 2025 watches, with a rotating steel bezel that's more exact for One UI Watch navigation than the normal Watch 8's touch bezel. And at $80 off, it's not too much more expensive than the $400 Galaxy Watch 8 LTE, if you want a more \"classic\" design, doubled storage, and a third button for shortcuts. \u2705Recommended if: You prefer Galaxy Watches in general for their four years of updates, seamless One UI 8 Watch Tiles and tools, and Samsung Health insights; you prefer physical controls and traditional style, and don't mind the extra weight required for them. \u274cSkip this deal if: You want faster 5G connectivity or satellite connectivity in cellular dead zones; you'd wouldn't mind picking a lighter, cheaper model without the same chic, or a pricier model to get an extra day or two of battery life.      We may end up seeing a cheaper Galaxy Watch 8 Classic deal once Black Friday or Cyber Monday rolls around, but this deal is worth jumping on if you've been waiting for a good LTE smartwatch. The only real question for Android phone owners is if the Pixel Watch 4 LTE is a better fit. Our Pixel Watch 4 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic guide offers an in-depth comparison, but the gist is that Google's watch is less rugged, heavy, and \"classically\" styled, with a crown instead of a bezel. Both have Wear OS 6, but Google's stock version focuses more on stylish transitions and magnified content at the center of the domed display. It performed surprisingly well in our LTE battery life tests, and the emergency SOS feature is a nice bonus. The Pixel Watch 4 LTE costs about the same as this Galaxy Watch 8 Classic deal, but we'd recommend the more expensive 45mm option, which is $499 at full price. So if you'd prefer Google's option, you may want to wait until Black Friday for its first major discount.

Skims is now worth more than some of the world's largest undergarment, athleisure, and beauty companies. Kim Kardashian's company has raised a new round of financing \u2014 $225 million \u2014 at a valuation of $5 billion, the company confirmed to Business Insider. That means the brand, which started as a shapewear line and has since expanded into activewear through a partnership with Nike, is now larger than its competitors, Victoria's Secret and Under Armour, combined. Victoria's Secret has a market capitalization of $2.86 billion, and Under Armor is worth $1.98 billion. Skims plans to use the new funds to expand its physical presence \u2014 currently, it has 18 stores in the US \u2014 and diversify into new categories, including beauty. Earlier this year, Skims acquired Kardashian's beauty brand SKKN by Kim from the founder and Coty. This month, the company made headlines by hiring Diarrha N'Diaye, formerly the founder of viral beauty line Ami Col\u00e9, to run the newly branded Skims Beauty. Skims, which launched in 2019, initially focused on shapewear and intimates. It quickly gained popularity, reaching $145 million in sales during its first full year in business. Growth has been steady, and this year, the company said net sales are expected to reach $1 billion. The most recent fundraising round, which was led by Goldman Sachs Alternatives with participation from BDT & MSD Partners, increased Skims' valuation by $1 billion since its last fundraising round in 2023. The company is the most highly valued celebrity brand ever. Headphone brand Beats by Dre previously held that title; the music mogul sold his company to Apple for $3.2 billion in 2014.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"While it was rumored that Apple planned to release new versions of the HomePod mini, Apple TV, and AirTag this year, it is no longer clear if that will still happen. Back in January, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said Apple planned to release new HomePod mini and Apple TV models \"toward the end of the year,\" while he at one point expected a new AirTag to launch \"around the middle of 2025.\" Yet, nothing so far. There are reasons to believe that at least one of the products could be updated imminently, but there are also signs that Apple might hold off until next year. For starters, HomePod mini inventory is running low at many of Apple's retail stores, and the speaker is completely out of stock at select resellers. That would typically be a sign that a hardware refresh is imminent, but it is already mid-November, so it is getting late in the year. Apple just updated its online store for the holiday season, and it even highlights the existing five-year-old HomePod mini as a gift idea. \"We are excited to be sharing our most extraordinary lineup of products as we head into the holiday season,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a press release at the end of October. Did he mean no more new products this year? Maybe. Maybe not. Apple rarely launches new products in the second half of November or December, but it has happened a few times. For example, the original 16-inch MacBook Pro was announced in November 2019, and the AirPods Max were unveiled in December 2020. So, anything is possible. Just keep your expectations low. All in all, the reality is that nobody seems to know if the HomePod mini, Apple TV, and AirTag will be updated this year anymore \u2014\u00a0at least until the next rumor surfaces. If the HomePod mini and Apple TV do not end up being updated until 2026, it could be the result of Apple delaying its more personalized version of Siri until next year, as Gurman expects both devices to support the revamped assistant. The improved Siri is currently expected to launch as part of iOS 26.4 in March or April. It is possible that Apple would want to show off the new-and-improved Siri at the same time as the first new devices that will run it, including the company's long-rumored smart home hub. The current HomePod mini was unveiled in October 2020, while the latest-generation Apple TV 4K was released in October 2022. It is harder to explain why the AirTag has not been updated yet. Apple unveiled the current version of the accessory in April 2021. Below, we have recapped rumored features for each product: What do you think?

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":" Steam Machine  In a world where video game consoles are largely becoming PCs for your TV, it makes sense that Valve would be jumping back into the console market with a new Steam Machine. The original Steam Machine launched in 2015 and let you play your PC games on your TV, but the project was short-lived. Valve stopped selling the thing in 2018, but hasn\u2019t stopped trying to bring PC gaming and the SteamOS to new formats. Just take a look at the Steam Deck. Now, the Steam Machine is back with a new model for a new era. Will the public be more receptive this time around? We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a price or release date for the new Steam Machine just yet beyond a 2026 window, and the cost will likely color how folks react to the device overall. We do know that the cube-like computer is around six times more powerful than the Steam Deck is. The six-inch tall box has a sleek, lowkey design that the PlayStation 5\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Seto-Kaiba-ass popped collar could learn from, and its controller has traditional analog sticks on top of the signature trackpad that made the original\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controller an oddity. It also doubles as a full-blown PC you can install non-gaming apps on. If Valve makes it a reasonable price, I could see it popping off, especially with the libraries of many consoles being nearly indistinguishable from that of the PC these days. A PC you play on your TV could easily become a viable alternative to buying a PlayStation or Xbox down the line. When the new Steam Machine launches, Valve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital storefront will be adding a new indicator for games that perform optimally on the device, similar to the Steam Deck verification games go through now. IGN says that the Steam Machine is about as powerful as a last-generation PC, which means some modern games may have some performance struggles, but their experience with the device was an overall positive one. \u00e2\u0080\u009cValve says it intends for the Steam Machine to be able to play all current games at 4K with FSR upscaling, but there are going to be plenty of games \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially ones running on Unreal Engine 5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to lower settings to get it running at a smooth frame rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jacqueline Thomas writes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltimately, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to get it in the lab to benchmark it to see exactly what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be capable of, but I have little doubt this PC will be running most things \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that the quality settings are definitely going to vary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For now, the device is giving people a lot to speculate about, from the impact it could have on the console market to what kind of faceplates they can slap on the side of the thing to just how much it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually going to cost. Valve just casually dropping a complete game changer for the console space with their own home console, the Steam Machine. This is going to be a gigantic shake-up for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox. Hard to compete with the Steam platform. I expect they dreaded this. https:\/\/t.co\/8uVjIisABU \u2014 Ryan T.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"     Apple is choosing Google over Anthropic because of cost, per report.    Google's Gemini to power the next version of Siri, according to a new report. Apple is inking a deal with Google to make a custom Gemini AI model to power the next version of its virtual assistant Siri for spring 2026, according to a Nov. 2 report by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A subsequent report on Wednesday states Apple will pay $1 billion a year for this new 1.2 trillion parameter model.\u00a0 Apple reportedly was evaluating whether to use Google or AI competitor Anthropic for the next version of Siri. While Apple will pay Google $1 billion a year, it would have cost $1.5 billion per year with Anthropic, according to another Bloomberg report.\u00a0 Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. This custom Gemini model will run on Apple's private cloud computer servers. Apple's own models will continue to run on devices for personal data, while Gemini will operate on servers for more complex tasks. Apple doesn't plan to highlight Google's involvement in the company's marketing, Bloomberg reports. Google declined to comment. Apple and Anthropic didn't respond to requests for comment.\u00a0 With major tech companies pivoting toward AI, Apple has largely been left behind. The tech company was slow to adopt the technology and\u00a0hasn't been able to develop competitive AI models. It instead turned to companies like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, to help add generative capabilities on top of existing Apple systems.\u00a0 (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.) Even so, the promise of a truly agentic Apple Intelligence has failed to materialize, although it has improved. Apple CEO Tim Cook also hasn't ruled out the possibility of acquiring an AI company. As to why Apple hasn't made significant strides in AI despite being one of the richest companies in the world has likely to do with prioritization. Apple, as a company, focuses on privacy for its customers. Given how data intensive AI systems rely on cloud servers, Apple has been more keen on local AI models, ones that can run on a device. The problem is that AI is computationally intensive and smaller local models simply can't compete with server stacks. Training foundational models also requires a lot of expertise and expenditure. While OpenAI hasn't given exact numbers, estimates put the training cost of GPT-5 to be over $1 billion. AI researchers also command high salaries and like to openly publish their research. For Apple, partnering with existing AI companies to integrate their technology better aligns with its culture.\u00a0 Apple also has a close relationship with Google. The search giant pays Apple $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine on Apple devices. It's a relationship that nets Apple money and prevents it from building a competitor to Google Search, a claim Apple denies. This arrangement was a key factor in the Department of Justice's case against Google, in which a judge ruled\u00a0that the company was operating an illegal monopoly.\u00a0 Despite falling behind on AI, Apple is doing well financially. Last month, it surpassed a $4 trillion market cap.\u00a0","label":0}

A startup wants to give attorneys a crystal ball to forecast whether a lawsuit will settle and at what amount. Theo Ai is building a \"predictive engine\" tool, aimed at law firms and large corporations, that it says takes the guesswork out of pricing a lawsuit. The company tells Business Insider it has raised $3 million in new funding from Run Ventures, bringing total backing to more than $10 million. Most civil cases settle out of court before a trial. There's no public repository of settlement terms or amounts. That opacity makes it hard to train reliable artificial intelligence models on case outcomes, said Patrick Ip, Theo Ai's cofounder and CEO. \"The magic number is what two parties need to get to,\" he said, before settling. Theo Ai lets law firms and businesses use their own history as training data. It builds a bespoke model for each client that plugs into the systems lawyers already use, such as case management systems and file-sharing tools. When a new case lands, the model finds look-alikes in that history and returns a settlement likelihood and range. The company, founded in 2024, first sold to litigation funders \u2014 firms that finance legal cases in exchange for a share of settlement payouts \u2014 because they live and die by case selection. That proved an eager early market, Ip said. The fastest-growing segment, he added, is now large enterprises. Retailers, cruise operators, and hotel groups get sued regularly \u2014 over wrongful termination and wage claims, injuries on properties, and data-breach allegations. The settlement is only one line item. Months of lawyer fees, discovery, and experts can push the cost of fighting a case through the stratosphere. Knowing the \"magic number\" to settle in advance, Ip argued, would help in-house counsel decide when to engage outside firms and when to settle privately. Ip said Fortune 500 companies now represent the vast majority of its sales pipeline. To support that push, the startup created a general counsel advisory board that includes attorneys from DocuSign, HP, eBay, Regal Cinemas, and US Bank, among other companies. Ip isn't the first to chase predictive analytics in law. Pre\/Dicta and Bench IQ model how specific judges rule, and LexisNexis has a tool that pulls together public verdict and settlement data for benchmarks. Theo Ai leans on a client's own data instead. Investors are piling into legal tech, right as skeptics question whether demand matches the hype. Critics argue that many legal work platforms can be swapped out for general-purpose AI models. Ip counters that Theo Ai's moat comes from how deeply it models legal outcomes. He says clients may use Theo Ai's settlement number and complete the work in a platform like Harvey or Legora, or even ChatGPT \u2014 making the product effectively platform-agnostic. Here's a look at the pitch deck Theo Ai used to raise $3 million in fresh seed funding, just six months after its initial $4.2 million seed announcement. Three slides have been removed to allow the deck to be shared publicly. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"The Delhi High Court Wednesday refused Johnson and Johnson subsidiary JNTL Consumer Health (India) Pvt Ltd interim relief to clear its stock of ORSL-labelled beverages while orally remarking that it cannot permit the same as it is a \u201cserious public health concern\u201d. The Centre, through the regulatory body Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), issued orders on October 14, 15 and again a reasoned order on October 30, prohibiting sale and manufacture of ORS-labelled products that do not adhere to the WHO standards of ORS. In a fresh petition, taken up before a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela, JNTL Consumer Health (India) Pvt Ltd is seeking a stay on the operation and implementation of the three FSSAI orders as an interim measure and that they be allowed to exhaust their stock, which according to senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the firm, amounts to Rs 100 crore at the moment. Senior advocate Rohatgi submitted, \u201cWe have stopped manufacturing. About 50% of the goods are in the market, we can\u2019t get that back. We are willing to rebrand. But I don\u2019t want to lose Rs 100 crores worth of stock. It will be unfair to treat this as an adulterated drug. All we want is that what is in the market is not recalled.\u201d Additionally, the consumer health firm is challenging the constitutional validity of the Food Safety and Standards (Food Recall Procedure) Regulations-2017, regulation number 5, which deals with food recall procedure and pins the responsibility for such recall on the food business operator. It is also seeking the three FSSAI orders from October be quashed. The Centre vehemently opposed JNTL Consumer Health (India)\u2019s plea Wednesday with ASG Chetan Sharma saying the company had challenged the FSSAI\u2019s October 14 and 15 orders in an earlier round of litigation and another manufacturer (Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratory) challenged the regulation as well, and thus the plea won\u2019t be maintainable, for agitating the same issue a second time. The court disagreed, noting challenge by one manufacturer to a regulation does not bar another manufacturer from challenging the same when the issue has remained undecided, and also added that the manufacturers had not challenged the October 30 order either. The court was, however, firm that it will not grant an interim relief to JNTL to exhaust its stock. US House Democrats on Wednesday released emails revealing Jeffrey Epstein's claim that Donald Trump spent time at his house with one of his victims, suggesting Trump knew more about Epstein's sex-trafficking operation than he admitted.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"The technology industry is one of the highest-paying in the U.S. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual salary in the tech industry is $105,990; more than twice the median for other occupations. Yes, even with the uncertainty of whether artificial intelligence will start taking jobs, especially in the technology industry, you still stand a chance of earning more than your peers in other fields, according to BLS data. If you're seeking a well-paying career, it might be worth considering tech.\u00a0 Naturally, if you want to pursue a career in the industry, there are many\u00a0specializations to choose from. You can become a software engineer, network engineer, cybersecurity analyst, machine learning engineer, web developer, technical program manager, and more. However, not all specializations have the same earning potential, especially in an\u00a0industry where learning is continuous, and salaries are dictated by what employers consider most valuable at the moment. In 2025, these are the highest-paying tech jobs if a good salary is important to you. Principal software engineers are among the best-paid tech workers in 2025. As such, it comes with a hefty set of responsibilities and requirements. Since it's a higher-level position compared to that of a software engineer, the day-to-day tasks of a principal software engineer include a wide variety of tasks and responsibilities.\u00a0 For instance, a principal software engineer can lead the development process for software products, and also take part in the entire process by designing the architecture, writing code, and debugging. As a principal software engineer, you'll also be responsible for supervising other software engineers, training and coaching your team of engineers, and collaborating with other team members, like technical project managers.\u00a0 To become one, you need at least a bachelor's degree in fields such as computer science and computer engineering, plus proficiency in multiple programming languages, such as C, C++, and Python. Additionally, since this is not an entry-level job, you certainly need a few years of experience working as a software engineer. Principal software engineers make an average annual salary of $244,500, and\u00a0you may earn more or less depending on factors such as experience, skills, and employer. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in 2025; no wonder machine learning engineers are among the highest-paid professionals in the tech industry. What does a machine learning engineer do, and what do you need to become one? Well, their range of responsibilities includes creating machine learning systems, training, testing, deploying, and continuously improving them to address weaknesses and to add new capabilities.\u00a0 Similar to principal software engineers, they also work closely with other team members, such as fellow machine learning engineers and project managers, to map out the roadmap of creating new AI systems (or improving existing ones). Deliverables for a machine learning engineer can include creating systems that power driverless vehicles, chatbots, product recommendations on sites like Amazon, or even research-based tasks like locating previously undiscovered coral reefs. Job requirements for machine learning engineers include a bachelor's degree in a technology-related program such as computer science, data science, artificial intelligence, or machine learning.\u00a0Strong mathematical skills are desired for creating algorithms; degrees in math and statistics are also accepted.\u00a0Programming skills and proficiency in machine learning frameworks are also necessary to become a machine learning engineer. The average salary for a machine learning engineer is $206,000. However, demand for these engineers is high, and we've seen reports of how Meta is offering crazy offers to poach AI talent from rivals. A software engineering manager's responsibility mainly centers around leadership. Like any other managerial role, one of the key responsibilities of an engineering manager is managing people; in this case, software engineers. An engineering manager leads a software engineering team and ensures the project stays on track by addressing any issues that may threaten development plans, such as staff shortages and software bugs. Other responsibilities of an engineering manager include creating project plans, hiring engineers, providing training and coaching, holding both team and one-on-one meetings, as well as providing individual reviews for team members. They also coordinate with other teams and departments to ensure that the set goals (whether individual or collaborative) are achieved. Engineering managers also lead the technical aspects of the product that the team is working on, including architecture, security, and code quality. Keeping in mind the management nature of this role,\u00a0you'll need various skills beyond technical expertise. You also require leadership, communication, project management, decision-making, and\u00a0problem-solving skills. Additionally,\u00a0you need a bachelor's degree in an engineering-related field and several years of engineering experience. The average salary for an engineering manager is $203,000. Staff and senior software engineer positions are also among the top-paying tech jobs. While the two roles are related, they are not the same, with the main difference being the scope of the work. Staff engineers are involved across technical departments, while senior engineers work in one or multiple teams. Some of the responsibilities of a staff software engineer include software quality control, collaborating with other teams and departments to meet collaborative goals, leading the design and architecture of new software or additional features, managing projects, and ensuring code written by juniors meets set technical standards. Senior engineers may share similar responsibilities with staff-level engineers, but their scope is limited to a particular team. To become a senior software engineer, you may need an associate's degree in engineering-related fields at a minimum, but with several years of experience under your belt.\u00a0 However, a bachelor's degree is preferred, with a minimum of five years of experience. In addition to that, you'll require both technical and leadership skills.\u00a0For a staff software engineering role, you'll need a bachelor's degree and several years of experience, which may range from 7-15 years. And most importantly, you need a few years of experience working as a senior engineer. Technical proficiency is a must, and you also need to possess the necessary soft skills, such as communication. The average annual salary for both senior and staff software engineers is $186,500. As the name suggests, this role primarily involves working with data.\u00a0A data scientist's main function is to help businesses make data-driven decisions. That's a simplistic description of this role because, before a data scientist can extract insights from data to help businesses make decisions, there's a lot that needs to be done. First, they're responsible for collecting, cleaning, and validating data. Then there's storage, creating algorithms to extract specific insights from data, analysis, and, when they have results, presenting the findings to the relevant parties. With all these obligations in mind,\u00a0a data scientist's job requires a wide variety of skills, including programming, statistics, mathematics, machine learning, and data visualization.\u00a0Education-wise, you'll need a bachelor's degree in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and related fields to become a data scientist. Additionally,\u00a0this role requires soft skills, so you'll need to be great at communication, analytical and critical thinking, and be curious. While the average annual salary for a data scientist is $183,000, just like other roles, you'll be paid more or less depending on your experience, skill set, and location. We've ranked the highest-paying jobs in tech according to a compilation by\u00a0Business Insider\u00a0via the\u00a0University of Cincinnati. The list includes a total of 18 high-paying roles, and we selected the top five based on average annual salary, from highest to lowest. The average annual salary for each job was calculated by adding the highest and lowest recorded salaries for each job covered by Business Insider, then averaging the salary range together.","label":0}

YouTube TV subscribers are dealing with one of the longest blackouts in recent history, but there's reason to believe the Disney-Google beef could end soon. Disney and YouTube haven't budged in a standoff over how much TV networks like ESPN and ABC are worth. Both sides are playing the blame game, with Disney accusing Google-owned YouTube of abusing its market power, and YouTube saying the Mouse House is pushing rates that will force it to hike prices again. This blackout is now on its 13th day, which ties the Disney-DirecTV stalemate in 2024 for Disney's longest dispute. Disney had previously taken its channels off Charter's Spectrum for 11 days in 2023 and Dish Network for a few days in 2022. The longest major carriage dispute in modern history was a nearly three-year showdown between HBO and Dish, which lasted from November 2018 until July 2021. Otherwise, Nexstar's affiliate stations were off DirecTV for over two months in 2023. Both Disney and YouTube TV have reasons for confidence in the hands they're holding, and gripes about unfair advantages the other has. Disney controls several top alternatives to YouTube TV, like Fubo and Hulu + Live TV, while YouTube TV is backed by $3.5 trillion Alphabet. Some media analysts suspect the fight won't last much longer, given its steep cost. Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners said he thought there would be a deal before Disney's earnings report on Thursday. \"I can't imagine Disney going into earnings on Thursday without a deal,\" Greenfield told Puck's John Ourand on Monday. Greenfield added that the TV business \"is such a big part of ESPN's revenues and profits,\" so he \"can't fathom getting on the earnings call and being dark still.\" Joe Bonner from Argus Research told Business Insider on Monday that he was \"a little surprised\" that there hadn't been a deal. The Disney-YouTube TV deadlock has blown past key events that typically end these carriage disputes, like two weekends of college football and a pair of \"Monday Night Football\" games. \"The prospect of missing an NFL game typically creates enough subscriber discontent to bring parties to the table, though that doesn't seem to be happening in this case,\" Bonner said. Disney CEO Bob Iger had a chance to give an update on negotiations with YouTube TV in an appearance on Peyton and Eli Manning's altcast of ESPN's \"Monday Night Football.\" But neither former NFL star put Iger on the hot seat. If there's no deal with YouTube before Disney's earnings call on Thursday at 8:30 ET, analysts certainly won't give the same courtesy. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Garmin has stubbornly stuck to Up\/ Down buttons for years, pleasing the anti-crown crowd. Now it could drift to the mainstream, like it did with AMOLED displays.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  \"Would you buy a Garmin watch with a crown?\" That's the question long-time Garmin fans may have to answer soon, based on a report suggesting that \"ongoing Garmin hardware work\" is in progress toward a rotating crown with a magnetic sensor. Gadgets & Wearables shared this news, explaining that the Hall effect sensor wouldn't rely on mechanical parts or a physical connection, making it easier for Garmin to preserve its watches' water resistance. For context, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic uses a Hall sensor for its rotating crown. Garmin's main fitness and smartwatch rivals have used crowns for years, which made Garmin's button-heavy designs a point of pride and comfort for its fans. They're slower to press but more dependable than sweaty touchscreen swipes, without the finicky accidental turns you get when a crown bumps into something; they're also more accessible for left-handed athletes.      The alleged design would sport two left-side buttons and a single right-side crown. Assuming the above mockup is accurate, it would be similar to a Pixel Watch 4's or Suunto Race 2's centered crown, rather than the top-right placement you get on a COROS or Apple Watch. There are dozens of Garmin watch subbrands, and even if this report is accurate, there's no guarantee Garmin will ditch Up\/ Down buttons on its Fenix, Forerunner, or Instinct watches. Garmin may only use them on its \"mainstream\" lineups, aka updating the two-button Venu 4 or Vivoactive 6 with crowns. On the other hand, we've seen how AMOLED displays started with the Venu series and then took over most Garmin watches over the past few years, despite the outcry from MIP display fans who took pride in Garmin's use of this less-popular tech. The MIP vs. AMOLED debate had passionate athletes on both sides, whereas I'm not certain how many Garmin watch fans have been clamoring for a crown. If this report proves accurate, we may see our first Garmin watch with a crown relatively soon; the reaction will depend on which lineup gets the crown. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android      Putting a crown on a Garmin watch would have some upsides. When it comes to map navigation, I prefer COROS watches because zooming in and out is significantly easier with a crown than with buttons. The COROS NOMAD and APEX 4 are excellent hiking companions, whether I'm following a route or just checking what trails are nearby. Of course, only premium Garmin models like the Fenix 8 and Forerunner 970 even have maps, and hardcore Garmin\/ button fans are the most likely to buy these. If the Garmin Fenix 9 introduces the crown next year, that could be a big risk, considering Garmin's stock took a big hit because, among other things, Fenix 8 Pro sales were lower than anticipated. Let's assume Garmin does give its flagship watches a crown. I think it would only work if Garmin accompanied it with a significant processor or memory boost. Garmin watches, packed with features while optimized for long battery life, have felt a bit laggy this generation, especially when scrolling through maps, and speedier crown scrolling would expose this. Ideally, Garmin would take this opportunity to boost performance a bit, while maintaining the same battery life that Garmin fans expect.      As a runner in a warm-climate area, I don't have the same issues with a crown as other athletes will. Turning a crown is harder with gloves in cold-weather regions, and if it juts out too far, it can interfere with certain bodyweight or gym exercises. Even if buttons are more deliberate to press, they're a safer choice, one Garmin has relied on for a decade. So why would Garmin ignore your likely ambivalence to a crown? Because Garmin already has your business. It needs to satisfy shareholders by continuing to grow its audience, stealing them away from Apple and Samsung. And quite simply, those users might be more comfortable with a crown than buttons. It's the same reason AMOLED displays have become the norm. We shouldn't get too riled up by a single unconfirmed report, and Garmin watches may stick to five-button layouts for years to come. But the report is plausible, and it wouldn't shock me if we see our first Garmin crown in 2026. Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

A balanced diet is key to your overall health, but your kidneys in particular will love these superfoods. Our kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining various aspects of our health. They may be small, but kidneys filter all your blood every 30 minutes, while also removing waste, managing your blood pressure and more. A recent study revealed that chronic kidney disease is now the number nine leading cause of death worldwide.   Though no food can cure a disease, it doesn't hurt to eat a balanced diet full of the nutrients. Eating well allows your body's organs to properly do their jobs. The same goes for the kidneys, and the following superfoods can provide them with that support. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.  Add CNET  as a preferred Google source on Chrome. This\u00a0nutrient-dense vegetable\u00a0is low in potassium and sodium while containing fiber, vitamins C and K and more. Plus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more. Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids.\u00a0Omega-3 fats\u00a0may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the\u00a0National Kidney Foundation. If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has\u00a0a chart you can use\u00a0to determine the levels in specific types of fish. Even with this information available, it's alway best to consult with your doctor when considering any health and wellness changes. Like cabbage, bell peppers pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants, too. You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to meals. Cranberries help\u00a0prevent\u00a0urinary tract infections. Although these usually stay in your bladder, they can travel to your kidneys, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation. Plus, cranberries have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table. We've discussed some of the best foods for the kidneys, but you can take it a step further. What foods help repair kidneys? Blueberries\u00a0deliver. Blueberries are healthy, with high levels of antioxidants and loads of vitamin C and fiber. They can also help reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD. There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get key vitamins and minerals, plus immunity-boosting benefits. Greens can contain a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet. Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost overall wellness.\u00a0A Harvard University\u00a0study found that it may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer. Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose virgin or extra virgin unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil. Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic contains a specific compound called allicin. For people with CKD, allicin \u2014 an active compound found in garlic \u2014 worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list. Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt. From the same family as garlic, onions\u00a0are another excellent, salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper. They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Cauliflower\u00a0provides crunch and plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, which is a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work. Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake. Egg whites are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis. Arugula is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types. You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example. Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help keep cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They also have plenty of antioxidants. Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.","label":0}

Most people don\u2019t have $2,000 sitting around for a MacBook and frankly, you might not even need that kind of firepower for everyday computing. HP\u2019s 14-inch AI 2025 laptop just hit an all-time low of $379 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,099 price tag. The kicker is that Windows 11 Pro and a year of Office 365 come pre-installed, and those two software packages alone would normally cost you close to what you\u2019re paying for the entire laptop at this discount. See at Amazon The Intel N150 processor keeps things running smoothly whether you\u2019re browsing the web, editing documents or streaming videos without the lag that\u2019s so common in cheaper laptops. This chip isn\u2019t going to render 4K video projects in seconds but it launches apps quickly and handles multiple browser tabs without grinding to a halt. You get responsive performance during video calls and enough processing muscle to run Office applications alongside your email and a dozen Chrome tabs. This laptop features 16GB of DDR4 RAM which makes a big difference when you\u2019re jumping between applications: you can have email open and edit a presentation while streaming music in the background, running antivirus scans, without everything slowing to a crawl. It really means that Windows 11 runs the way Microsoft intended it to with smooth transitions and instant app switching. The storage setup combines 128GB of universal flash storage with a 256GB microSD card for a total of 386GB. The UFS storage handles your operating system and most used programs quickly thanks to its high read and write speeds, while the microSD card is there for documents, photos, and media files. In this way, this two-storage solution will keep your system running fast and gives you space for thousands of documents. Unlike the Home edition, Windows 11 Pro includes enterprise-level security features and offers remote desktop capabilities. The Pro version lets you encrypt your hard drive with BitLocker, join corporate domains, and access your computer remotely when you\u2019re traveling. You\u2019ll also get Office 365, which gives you the full Microsoft productivity suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneDrive cloud storage, right out of the box. That subscription generally costs $99 per year alone, while Windows 11 Pro typically adds $199 to a laptop\u2019s sticker price so you\u2019re basically getting the hardware for $80 after accounting for the software value. A dedicated AI key for Copilot puts Microsoft\u2019s AI Assistant just a button-press away. You can ask it to draft emails for you, summarize long documents, generate creative content, and even give tips for troubleshooting without opening a browser or digging through menus. This integration speeds up the workflow when you need fast answers or want to automate repetitive tasks. The Sky Blue finish adds some nice personality to what\u2019s otherwise a sea of gray and black finishes in the market. It also saves you from having to buy peripherals separately because it includes a Redragon mouse, and it is remarkably lightweight, easy to carry from home to office or coffee shop. You get a full computing package with the $379 asking price, capable of handling daily productivity tasks, coming loaded with premium software and even putting in modern features like AI integration and Wi-Fi 6.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"  Home \u00bb Revved-Up Rundowns There\u2019s something magical about breathing new life into a classic muscle car. These vehicles represent a golden era when Detroit was pumping out powerful, affordable machines that could smoke their tires at will. The muscle car formula was simple: take a mid-size family car, drop in the biggest V8 you could fit, and price it so the average working person could afford one. Today, many of these classics are surprisingly accessible for restoration projects, offering enthusiasts a chance to own a piece of automotive history. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned restorer or contemplating your first project, the right muscle car can provide years of satisfaction and potentially solid returns on your investment. Let\u2019s explore some of the best candidates that combine availability, parts support, and that unmistakable rumble that makes every gearhead\u2019s heart skip a beat. The Chevelle SS remains one of the most popular muscle car restoration projects, and for good reason. Chevrolet produced these in healthy numbers, which means you can still find project cars ranging from basket cases to nearly complete examples. The aftermarket support is exceptional, with virtually every part available as a reproduction, making it possible to build a complete car from catalog orders if you\u2019re so inclined. The 396 and 454 big-block models are highly sought after, but even the 350-powered versions offer plenty of performance potential. Values have remained relatively stable, making the Chevelle a solid investment that won\u2019t break the bank to acquire. Plus, there\u2019s something deeply satisfying about the Chevelle\u2019s proportions \u2014 it just looks right from every angle. The E-body Barracuda, especially the 1970-1971 models, represents Mopar muscle at its finest. While the Hemi and Six-Pack cars command premium prices, the more common 318 and 340 models offer an accessible entry point into restoration. These cars have aggressive styling that still turns heads today, with their long hood and that proud look. The aftermarket has caught up in recent years, though parts availability isn\u2019t quite as comprehensive as GM offerings. Finding a solid starting point is key, as rust can be particularly problematic in the rear quarter panels and trunk floor. The Barracuda restoration community is passionate and helpful, which makes navigating your first project easier than you might expect. The GTO is often credited with launching the muscle car era, and these second-generation models represent the nameplate at its peak. Pontiac offered a range of engines from the 350 all the way up to the legendary Ram Air IV 400, giving buyers plenty of performance options. Production numbers were strong enough that project cars remain available, though clean examples command premium prices. The parts reproduction market is excellent, with most components readily available from multiple suppliers. The styling strikes a perfect balance between aggressive and elegant, with those iconic stacked headlights and aggressive stance. Restoring a GTO means working on the car that essentially defined the entire muscle car formula, which carries a certain pride of ownership that\u2019s hard to match. The Nova SS is the unsung hero of muscle car restorations, offering genuine performance in a compact package. These cars flew under the radar for years, which means they\u2019re often more affordable than their Chevelle cousins despite sharing many of the same powertrains. The smaller size makes them easier to store and work on, a real advantage if you\u2019re dealing with limited garage space. The 350 small-block models are plentiful, while the big-block 396 cars are rarer but still attainable. There\u2019s something appealing about the Nova\u2019s sleeper status \u2014 it doesn\u2019t scream for attention, but it can definitely get it when you hit the throttle. The second-generation Charger is an icon of American muscle, instantly recognizable from its fastback roofline and hidden headlights. These cars have seen values climb in recent years, partly thanks to their starring role in popular culture, but project cars are still available. The unibody construction requires careful rust inspection, particularly in the rear frame rails and trunk floor. Mopar enthusiasts are dedicated, and the parts reproduction industry has responded with improving availability, though some trim pieces remain challenging to source. The 440 and 426 Hemi models are investment-grade vehicles, while the more common 318 and 383 cars offer a realistic restoration path. Few muscle cars deliver the same presence on the road as a properly restored Charger. The Monte Carlo SS represents the luxury muscle car approach, combining performance with a more refined interior. The 454 cubic-inch big-block delivered impressive thrust in a package that was equally comfortable on long highway cruises. These cars have remained somewhat undervalued compared to other Chevrolet muscle offerings, making them smart choices for restorers seeking something different. The parts availability is good, with many components shared across GM\u2019s A-body platform. The distinctive styling with its long hood and opera windows gives the Monte Carlo a unique presence. Restoring one of these feels like preserving a piece of automotive elegance that happened to have serious power under the hood. The Cyclone is Ford\u2019s mid-size muscle car that doesn\u2019t get quite the same attention as its Mustang and Torino siblings. The Spoiler and Spoiler II models with their aerodynamic modifications are highly collectible, but the standard Cyclone GT models offer accessible restoration opportunities. Ford\u2019s 428 Cobra Jet engine provided serious performance in a package that was slightly more upscale than the Torino. Parts can be more challenging to locate than mainstream Ford offerings, but the dedicated Mercury community has helped improve reproduction availability. The relative rarity means your restored Cyclone will stand out at shows without breaking into six-figure territory. These cars represent good value for enthusiasts who want something distinctive without being obscure. The 442 badge stands for four-barrel carburetor, four-speed transmission, and dual exhaust, and these Oldsmobiles delivered a refined take on muscle car performance. Production numbers were healthy, providing a decent pool of project cars to choose from today. The styling is distinctive without being overly aggressive, appealing to enthusiasts who appreciate subtlety. Parts availability is solid, especially for the more popular years, with the GM parts bin providing many interchange opportunities. The 455 cubic-inch engine in later models offered tremendous low-end torque that made these cars effortless performers. Restoring a 442 means working on a car that was engineered with genuine sophistication, not just raw power. The Javelin represents the independent spirit of AMC taking on Detroit\u2019s big three in the muscle car market. These cars have remained relatively affordable, making them accessible projects for enthusiasts on realistic budgets. The 360 and 401 cubic-inch AMC V8 engines were genuinely powerful, and the handling was surprisingly competent for the era. Parts availability is the main challenge, though the AMC community has worked hard to improve reproduction offerings. The styling is distinctive, particularly the 1971-1974 models with their more aggressive front end. Restoring a Javelin means joining a tight-knit community of enthusiasts who appreciate the road less traveled. The Cougar was Mercury\u2019s upscale answer to the Mustang, offering more luxury and refinement in a similar package. The sequential turn signals and hidden headlights gave these cars a distinctive appearance that still looks fresh today. While not produced in Mustang numbers, Cougars are available enough to find suitable project cars. Parts availability benefits from Mustang interchangeability on many mechanical components, though some Cougar-specific trim pieces require patience to locate. The 390 and 428 models delivered genuine muscle car performance with a more sophisticated personality. These cars appeal to enthusiasts who want performance without sacrificing comfort and style. The Road Runner was Plymouth\u2019s budget muscle car solution, stripping away luxury to focus purely on performance and value. The cartoon bird mascot and \u201cbeep beep\u201d horn might seem gimmicky, but these cars were seriously quick right off the showroom floor. The 383, 440, and 426 Hemi engines provided escalating levels of performance to suit different budgets and courage levels. Project cars are available across the value spectrum, from rough starting points to nearly complete examples. Parts reproduction has improved significantly, though some specific trim items remain challenging. The Road Runner\u2019s straightforward approach to muscle car design makes it an honest restoration project that celebrates pure performance. Buick\u2019s entry into the muscle car wars brought sophistication and massive torque to the segment. The limited production GSX models with their bold graphics are highly collectible, while the more common GS 455 models offer similar performance at more accessible prices. The 455 cubic-inch engine produced incredible torque that made these cars devastatingly quick in straight-line acceleration. Parts availability has improved as these cars have gained appreciation, though they\u2019re not quite as well-supported as Chevrolet models. The build quality was typically excellent, which often means finding project cars with solid foundations. Restoring a Buick muscle car means working on something that combined performance with genuine luxury touches. Choosing the right muscle car restoration project comes down to balancing your budget, skills, and personal preferences. The golden era of American muscle produced an incredible variety of options, from budget-focused performance machines to luxury cruisers with serious power. Parts availability and community support should factor heavily into your decision, as these resources can make the difference between a smooth restoration and a frustrating experience. Values have generally trended upward for well-restored examples, though the market can fluctuate based on various factors. The real reward isn\u2019t just the finished car \u2014 it\u2019s the journey of bringing a piece of automotive history back to life. Whether you choose a popular Chevelle or a more unusual AMC Javelin, you\u2019re preserving an important chapter in American automotive culture that deserves to be celebrated and enjoyed.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"By\u00a0         Ayana Archie                        An employee walks past pallets of nonperishable food at a warehouse of the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 6.                                                           Mark Schiefelbein\/AP                                       hide caption  Democrats and Republicans are closer than ever to reaching a deal to end the federal shutdown, which has interrupted SNAP benefits and delayed food assistance to millions of Americans. But the recipients and local safety net programs that have been affected by the interruption of SNAP could need more help long after the government reopens. Radha Muthiah is the CEO of Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C. Since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the nonprofit has been offering five additional food distributions a week for furloughed federal workers. CAFB says those distributions have been seeing between 1,500 and 2,000 families a week. The organization will provide 1 million more meals this month for those who haven't received their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, she said.\u00a0 Muthiah said some of the area residents the food bank serves are pulling from their long-term savings and retirement accounts, and reconsidering where their children will go to college because of the disruption to their incomes and benefits. \"People are borrowing against their futures to be able to pay for basic necessities today, and that really shouldn't be the case,\" Muthiah said. The Trump administration said the Department of Agriculture would run out of money on Nov. 1. Since then, there has been a lot of legal back and forth over whether the administration must issue full SNAP benefits for November.  The Trump administration has continued its appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing the government currently can only afford to give recipients 65% of this month's SNAP allotments. On Tuesday evening, the court extended an order to temporarily block full payments.  Some states have begun issuing full payments anyway, but there are generally few answers on when SNAP benefits will be distributed, how much recipients will receive, or if their benefits will be backdated.  \"There may be roller-coaster rides, as we're seeing between the administration and the courts,\" Muthiah said. \"But people need to eat everyday \u2026 and so the need has not changed.\" The shutdown, which has been the longest in U.S. history, has compounded the demand the CAFB had been seeing due to the reductions in force at various federal agencies. Because of this, the CAFB has anticipated it will need to distribute 10% more meals during this current fiscal year, Muthiah said. But now, it's not just federal workers who need food assistance. People across industries have needed more help, she said. \"There's a whole downstream effect of people who may not be getting as much, in terms of wages, and might be either newly food insecure, or just need more support from the emergency food assistance network,\" Muthiah said. One of the people CAFB serves is Rabitah Moses, who lives in Rockville, Md. She is disabled and cannot work. She said she has not received any SNAP benefits this month and has had no direct communication from any government agencies about when she can expect them, or how much she will receive. She said she has relied on news outlets and press releases from Maryland Gov. Wes Moore for information. \"We're told that 'You should just get a bunch of beans' and really stretch it,\" Moses said. \"You can only stretch but so much.\" Moses is the only person in her household, and said she typically receives a little over $100 a month through SNAP. While that money is not enough to cover all her food expenses, not having it at all has mental and physical implications for people in circumstances like hers, she said.  \"Most medications you have to take with food,\" she said. \"If you don't have food, you can't take medication, and if you can't take your medication, you're gonna just get more and more sick.\" Moses has turned to food banks, including the CAFB, but recognizes they may be overwhelmed with the volume of people they're tasked with serving. Amid the surge, tailored needs like dietary restrictions may go unmet, she said. Muthiah said strong financial support from local residents has fueled the Capital Area Food Bank through these periods of instability. One dollar donated to CAFB can fund two meals, as the organization sources its food from wholesale markets, and has its own stock of donations, Muthiah said. \"Our ability to really ramp up and do more for the community is directly correlated with the generosity and care of so many of our community members who really want to take care of their neighbors in need,\" Muthiah said. The food bank now needs volunteers more than anything, Muthiah says.  \"We provided [our partners] with a lot of food. They need more volunteer support to just help manage the lines,\" she said.  For those who want to lend a hand to their local food bank, many cities, counties and states have directories on their websites. There are also national directories, such as Feeding America.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. AMD\u2019s stock jumped by more than 9% on Wednesday after CEO Lisa Su said revenue could grow 35% annually over the next five years, as Su anticipates a \u201cnew era of growth\u201d for the chipmaker while it positions itself in what she said could become a $1 trillion market.  Shares of AMD soared 9.5% to around $260 as of noon Wednesday, rebounding from a 2% slump in the previous trading session. Su said during AMD\u2019s financial analyst day event in New York on Tuesday that the market for the company\u2019s data center chips could rise to $1 trillion by 2030, largely driven by \u201cinsatiable\u201d demand for AI chips, and that AMD could achieve a \u201cdouble-digit\u201d share in the data center market over the next three to five years. AMD\u2019s overall revenue growth could expand to roughly 35% annually over the same period, finance chief Jean Hu said, with earnings projected to rise to $20 a share. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote they believed Su\u2019s projections for AMD\u2019s growth are possible, but only if the chipmaker grows in scale, keeps costs from increasing too quickly and makes more profit from each sale.  Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon called AMD\u2019s targets \u201csomewhat aggressive,\u201d however, and questioned whether AMD could compete for a larger market share as \u201cthe jury remains out on that, but management is clearly going on the offense with the narrative.\u201d Su, who holds roughly 4.7 million AMD shares, had her net worth increase by $123 million (7.9%) to $1.7 billion on the chipmaker\u2019s stock jump.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"     Earn Golden Keys galore in Borderlands 4 when you use these SHiFT promo codes now.    Kit out your Borderlands 4 vault hunters with a new selection of legendary loot. The biggest looter shooter of the year, Borderlands 4, is out, and players are already taking the fight to the Timekeeper on Kairos. If you want to put the beat down on someone strong enough to control an entire planet, you're going to need an arsenal of powerful weapons and equipment. However, developer Gearbox Software is willing to lend a helping hand. Instead of having to farm every piece of legendary equipment in-game, you can roll the dice on some loot with Golden Keys unlocked by SHiFT promo codes -- right now, there are even codes that will add multiple Golden Keys to your account at once. If you're already swimming in more loot than you know what to do with, some SHiFT codes also unlock special cosmetic looks for your favorite vault hunters. Special in-game challenges have already unlocked promo codes for Amon, Rafa and Vex vault hunter skins, with a Harlowe skin unlocking soon. Here's how to use the latest SHiFT codes in Borderlands 4. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. You can hunt down SHiFT codes on social media, but we'll keep all of the active promo codes in one place for ease of access. Below, you'll find a chart that contains every active SHiFT code for Borderlands 4, what it unlocks and its expiration date: While SHiFT codes are totally free rewards for you to accumulate, you must\u00a0make a SHiFT account to input any active codes in-game. SHiFT is a service that Gearbox integrates into its biggest games, and making an account unlocks forums and exclusive beta participation. It's also necessary to create an account to turn in any promo codes, which is what most fans care about. While Vex's fearsome Siren powers control the battlefield, it never hurts to have a legendary weapon in your holster. Once your account is created, you can enter your SHiFT codes in two separate places. Within your SHiFT account settings, you can find a Rewards tab with a field to enter any Borderlands promo codes. Once you enter the codes, any unlocked items will be added to your account the next time you open the game. However, an easier way to input your SHiFT codes is within Borderlands 4 itself. Within the game's pause menu, you can access a SHiFT. Select the Rewards tab from the resulting menu, input your codes and the unlocked items will be immediately available on your save. SHiFT codes are released frequently on Gearbox and Gearbox-affiliated social media channels. For the best chance at catching every new SHiFT code that gets released, you should follow Gearbox on X and on Facebook. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford also releases promos on his X account, so if you're brave enough to follow him, despite his frequent outbursts toward fans, you can find SHiFT codes there as well. Hold off on using your shiny new Golden Keys until you've reached the Borderlands 4 endgame. SHiFT codes are promo codes that Gearbox occasionally releases that reward players with loot and cosmetics in Borderlands games. The main SHiFT code reward is a Golden Key, which opens the Golden Chest in most Borderlands hub areas. But don't spend them immediately -- it's worth saving your Golden Keys until you reach the level cap and are playing on the hardest difficulty, as the loot rewards will scale to your character accordingly. This is a great way to quickly and easily farm some endgame legendaries.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"The new Steam Frame is coming next year and is Valve's first all-in-one headset running SteamOS, powered by a Snapdragon chip.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Valve has announced its first all-in-one VR headset, dubbed the Steam Frame, which runs SteamOS and is powered by a 4nm Snapdragon SoC. The headset is the first Snapdragon-based SteamOS device on the market, meaning Valve is supporting Arm with the SteamOS platform, perhaps laying the foundations for an Arm-based gaming handheld future. Up until now, pretty much all PC gaming handhelds on the market are powered by AMD chips. Even the latest Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are powered by AMD chips, instead of Qualcomm's own. So far, all official SteamOS devices are also x86 only, with no official support for Snapdragon-based PCs. That might soon be changing now that the Steam Frame is official. The Frame is Valve's first Snapdragon-powered SteamOS device, running a 4nm Arm SoC paired with 16GB RAM. The chip will power the entire experience, from the OS to the games and the displays.      It's unknown what chip Valve is using exactly, but we know Qualcomm offers OEMs a range of specialist XR chips such as the high-end Snapdragon XR2+ Gen2 SoC, which would be the right call for a fully-fledged gaming VR headset like the Steam Frame. Of course, a wearable headset isn't a gaming handheld at all, but that doesn't mean foundations aren't being laid with this device. Now that SteamOS officially supports Arm via the Snapdragon XR SoC, it's only a matter of time before we see SteamOS running on a gaming handheld that's also powered by a Snapdragon SoC. Weight 190g core, 435g with headstrap Processor 4nm Snapdragon ARM Memory 16GB Unified LPDDR5 RAM Storage 256GB \/ 1TB UFS, microSD slot Connectivity Wi-Fi 7 (2x2), Dual 5GHz\/6GHz streaming Optics Pancake optics, 2160x2160 LCD per eye, 72\u2013120Hz (144Hz experimental), up to 110\u00b0 FOV Tracking 4x external monochrome cameras, 2x internal eye-tracking cameras, IR illuminator Wireless Adapter Included, Wi-Fi 6E, low-latency PC link Foveated Streaming Eye-tracking driven resolution targeting Audio Dual speaker drivers per ear, dual mic array Passthrough Monochrome camera passthrough Expansion Port 2x 2.5Gbps camera interface \/ Gen4 PCIe Battery 21.6 Wh rechargeable Li-Ion OS SteamOS (sleep\/wake, cloud saves, Proton) Controllers 6-DOF tracking, IMU, capacitive sensing, magnetic thumbsticks, haptics, AA battery (40hr), optional straps It's quite unlikely that this will be the only Arm-based SteamOS device going forward. With NVIDIA rumored to be launching its N1X chips next year, it's reasonable to expect we'll see NVIDIA-powered Arm-based gaming handhelds in the near future too, and SteamOS will be well prepared to support it. Although not directly, this should also benefit Windows on Arm. All Windows-powered gaming handhelds to date run an x86 processor, even though Windows has fully embraced Arm over the last handful of years. Qualcomm is eager to enter this market, and there's no reason why an OEM couldn't make a Snapdragon-powered Windows gaming device today. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. But with SteamOS now beginning to support Snapdragon, perhaps OEMs will take a second look at the architecture. It'll be interesting to see how games perform on a Snapdragon-based SteamOS device, especially with Proton in the mix. In most cases, x86 gaming handhelds run better with SteamOS compared to Windows 11, so it'll be interesting to see if the same happens when both OSes are powered by Arm.      Valve hasn't announced pricing or exact availability for the Steam Frame, though it has said to expect it to arrive sometime in the first half of next year. The Steam Frame is a clear competitor to Apple's Vision Pro and Samsung Galaxy XR headsets, both of which are premium high-end headsets, though Valve's will have an edge in gaming. Of course, Microsoft only just recently threw in the towel on any and all XR efforts. It was first to market with AR glasses with HoloLens in 2015, followed up with a successor in 2019 that was even more capable. Unfortunately, Microsoft has scrapped plans to release any more XR headsets, conceding the market to Google, Apple, Valve, and Meta. Alongside the Steam Frame, Valve has also announced a new Steam Machine \"console,\" with an AMD processor. The company says it's 6 times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and is competing directly with Xbox, PlayStation, and Windows PC gamers. It also runs SteamOS and is a clear attack on Microsoft's vision to turn Xbox into an ecosystem.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home \u00bb Retro Computing \u00bb What happened to Transmeta, the last big dotcom IPO Transmeta was the last big IPO of the dotcom era, launching Nov 7, 2000. Some analysts call its $273 million IPO the last successful tech IPO until the Google IPO in 2004. Transmeta didn\u2019t completely fit in to the dotcom era, because they were a hardware company. But they were still a technology company, and if their plans had gone well, they would have sold their product to dotcoms, but it didn\u2019t work out that way for them. In this blog post we explore what happened to Transmeta.  I\u2019ve heard Transmeta called the last successful IPO of the dotcom era, or the last of the big dotcom IPOs. But it\u2019s an oversimplification to say there weren\u2019t any successful technology IPOs between Transmeta and Google. One very notable exception is Paypal, who ran an IPO in February 2002 that raised $70.2 million.\u00a0The Register even hailed Paypal as the return of the Internet IPO. And it wasn\u2019t just that dotcom IPOs grew scarce after November 2000. On February 7, 2002, Forbes stated that only 34 IPOs in total launched between September 11, 2001 and February 6, 2002, compared to 87 in the same-year-earlier period, and 240 between September 11, 1999 and February 6, 2000. That date is significant. Any\u00a0bad news can spook investors, and the 9\/11 attack did, in fact, spook investors. So where the dotcom-era ended is a fuzzy line, but it makes sense to draw the line at Transmeta. Technology IPOs and particularly Internet IPOs became much more scarce after Transmeta, and the size of the IPOs shrunk too. The distinction of Transmeta being a technology stock, rather than an Internet stock, also suggests investors were already cooling on Internet stocks by November 2000. Transmeta was a CPU company. But they may be better known for their most famous employee than for any of their products. When Linus Torvalds completed his degree, there was a great deal of speculation where he would take his day job. Transmeta was not the place most technologists expected him to land. But it allowed him to continue his work on the Linux kernel while staying close to a key part of the hardware, the CPU. In the year 2000, the CPU wars were cooling down. A few years earlier, there had been four companies not named Intel producing Socket 7 CPUs. But only two of them survived to compete in the next generation, and only AMD was able to compete at anything other than the entry level. And even though the Cyrix name survived, it was the competing IDT technology under the hood. Transmeta wanted to take a different approach. They were going to produce an x86 compatible CPU, but they were going to use a translation layer to do it. They would design a very efficient CPU, and in theory, they could place any translation layer in front of it that they wanted. Emulating PowerPC or ARM would have been possible if they saw the need to do it. But the popular yet inefficient x86 architecture was a more inviting target. AMD was doing something similar, essentially translating x86 instructions into RISC instructions for efficiency, but they did it in hardware rather than software like Transmeta did. AMD never had any designs on putting any different translation layer in front of it. Transmeta did ship two CPUs, but weren\u2019t able to reach the same levels of performance AMD and Intel were reaching. Its first CPU, Crusoe, could run at Pentium III-like speeds but was about 30% less efficient, so a 700 MHz Crusoe ran like a 500 MHz Pentium III. Transmeta didn\u2019t have fabrication plants of its own, so IBM handled manufacturing of its first-generation CPUs. The Transmeta Efficieon, released in 2004, competed with the Pentium 4 but peaked at 1.7 GHz. With the Pentium 4 reaching 2.4 GHz speeds, the Efficieon had trouble competing. And AMD\u2019s release of the Athlon 64 didn\u2019t help matters. Selling 32-bit CPUs in a 64-bit world was going to be tough. TSMC and Fujitsu handled manufacturing for the Efficieon. Transmeta CPUs saw use in low-power laptops, thin clients, and embedded applications. The Bluecoat web filtering appliance used them for a while. But if you owned a computer at that time, it\u2019s much more likely to have had an AMD or Intel CPU in it. If you used one at work, it was even more likely to have an AMD or Intel CPU in it. Even though Transmeta was the last big dotcom era IPO, they were not among the survivors. Torvalds resigned from Transmeta in June 2003. What happened to Transmeta was that in 2005, Transmeta shifted to licensing intellectual property rather than selling CPUs. And in January 2009, Transmeta sold itself to Novafora, who in turn sold the patent portfolio to Intellectual Ventures, a private equity company. Novafora ceased operations in August 2009, just seven months later. Intellectual Ventures licenses the Transmeta intellectual property to other companies on a non-exclusive basis. Transmeta ended up being more like Netscape or VA Linux than Red Hat. Today, Transmeta hardware is rare enough to be interesting as a collectible. But there aren\u2019t a lot of people nostalgic for it, and that probably keeps prices low. David Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author. He has written professionally about computers since 1991, so he was writing about retro computers when they were still new. He has been working in IT professionally since 1994 and has specialized in vulnerability management since 2013. He holds Security+ and CISSP certifications. Today he blogs five times a week, mostly about retro computers and retro gaming covering the time period from 1975 to 2000. What happened to Via x86? I know Intel Corp purchase the engineers will Via Or zhaoxin ever create a new x86\/x64 for USA ? I remember Transmeta being a CPU company, but the very first thing that pops into my mind is them hiring Linus Torvalds. Almost like a Medici sponsorship in the Renaissance: \u201cHere\u2019s money. You live and do your thing. Glory will reflect onto us.\u201d He\u2019s still doing well \u2013 much better than Transmeta. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Per Apple\u2019s website: Eligible products at the Apple Store Online that are received between November 12, 2025 and December 25, 2025, may be returned through January 8, 2026. Please note that all other terms and conditions provided in the Apple Store Online Sales and Refunds Policy are still applicable with respect to such products purchased. iPhone purchases that are carrier-financed with T-Mobile or Verizon are not eligible and are subject to standard return policy. All purchases made after December 25, 2025 are subject to the Standard Return Policy. Normally, Apple Store purchases offer a 14-day window for returns. But during the holiday season, Apple institutes a much longer return period. If you buy a new product at the Apple Store today, thanks to the new January 8 deadline, you would have nearly two full months to return it. Of course, the intent is that holiday shoppers can start buying gifts with no worries about the recipients being unable to return the products as needed.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"British electric drive specialist Helix builds some of the most power-dense electric motors in the world. Now it's working to springboard that compact, power-packed design into a marine drive ecosystem it believes will help change the face (or at least underbody) of everyday recreational and utility boating. The company's all-new Pod Cartridge brings the e-drive components necessary to make 360-degree pod drives a widely available solution capable of increasing efficiency and boosting maneuverability across a huge market of vessels.  Evolved from the azimuth thruster systems dating back to the mid-20th century and beyond, electric pod drives serve as a flexible, decentralized form of marine propulsion that increases efficiency, improves maneuverability and frees up space in a ship's hull. Instead of relying on a large central engine to run a propeller via an extended driveshaft, and a separate rudder system for steering, these units integrate all of those powertrain and running gear components into a horizontally gimbaled subaquatic pod installed on the keel of the ship.  The pod then serves as both a propulsion and steering mechanism that includes 360-degree rotational capabilities made possible by the slip rings that deliver electricity. This full rotation allows each pod to direct thrust precisely where it's needed to move in the desired direction, making a separate rudder system unnecessary while vastly improving maneuverability to the point of giving massive ships the ability to turn in place, much like a torque-vectoring electric car does on land.  Beyond increased maneuverability, pod drives also boast improved efficiency, using their full rotational capabilities to direct thrust in the most efficient way for the current direction of travel and conditions while also smoothening out energy-sapping vibrations and eliminating the added drag of rudder components.  According to Swedish-Swiss multinational ABB Group, which now markets the Azipod \u2013 the very first electric pod drive launched in the early 1990s, open-water vessels commonly enjoy energy consumption reductions between 5 and 15 percent when propelled by an Azipod system, with decreases as much as 20 to 25 percent possible.  That's no small savings when talking about something like a cruise ship that sucks up hundreds of thousands, even millions, of gallons of fuel when pushing from port to port. A few years back, a study by Deltamarin found Azipod-driven ferries could save up to US$1.7 million in annual fuel costs.  That suite of advantages has established the pod drive as a popular solution for some of the largest seagoing vessels \u2013 cruise liners, container ships, tankers and ferries, to name a few. We've previously looked at how a pod's ability to rotate directional propulsion 180 degrees between a \"pulling\" orientation and a \"pushing\" orientation has been a particular boon to polar-ready icebreaking ships.  But Helix believes pod drives have loads of untapped downmarket potential, explaining that they have long been limited to use in large vessels because of the power density shortcomings of conventional electric motors. In order to achieve the high levels of power required to propel a ship, it's been necessary to install huge motors inside even huger underwater pods, inducing high levels of drag. It's only in the very large megawatt+ range that drag, as proportionate to power, decreases enough to realize the efficiency gains of pod propulsion. In smaller pods, the proportional drag becomes too high to overcome. Helix is ready to shift the entire equation via its rapidly evolving electric motor topography, which creates high levels of power and torque from tiny, ultra-lightweight packages. While Helix's top-tier 25-kW\/kg SPX177 motor was developed by its experimental division for a hypercar prototype, not optimized for mass market use, the SPC177 radial flux motor it plans to use for its marine pod ecosystem still offers a high density up to 9.7 kW\/kg, putting out 300 kW of continuous power from a 31-kg (68-lb) package.  At that type of power density level, the drag induced by the pod body becomes trivial at sub-megawatt sizes, Helix reasons, opening the door for the efficient propulsion of small to midsize boats. In fact, the company goes so far as to say its small, powerful motor construction will allow shipbuilders to cut 70 percent of the drag as compared to traditional (massive) pod drives.  Rather than developing complete pods, Helix intends to create modular flexibility by supplying what it calls Pod Cartridges to builders of sub-megawatt, small to midsize recreational, commercial and passenger vessels. Each cartridge will be a plug-and-play set of pod internals for shipbuilders and propulsion systems manufacturers to fit within their own subaquatic pod structures and pair with propellers, battery systems, electric generators, and control software solutions specced for the specific requirements of the vessel in question.  Each of the launch cartridges will include an SPC177 motor packaged with an Xtrac gear reduction system, CAN bus interfaces, bearings and seals, and available Helix inverter.  \"By freeing up deck space previously reserved at the transom for outboard motors, or interior space reserved for engine compartments and propeller shafts, our\u00a0Helix\u00a0Pod Cartridge offers the industry a generational chance to revisit how it designs vessels,\" Helix's chief marine engineer James Edwards said during last month's announcement, \"all while unlocking more efficient travel and helping marine in its journey towards net zero emissions.\" Helix gives examples of using the extra hull volume to make a trawler more comfortable and functional for fishermen or a yacht more relaxing and enjoyable for leisure customers.  Three sub-megawatt Pod Cartridge sizes will be available at launch: 100, 200 and 300 kW. The 100 and 200 models will be offered in both low- and high-torque variations, and Helix plans to eventually expand out the lineup to output sizes between 480 kW and 3 MW.  Given the limited ranges of battery-powered electric boats, you might be wondering how exactly marine operators power a conventional multi-megawatt electric pod motor. It isn't by mere battery, requiring an onboard electrical generation system using the likes of diesel fuel or hydro generation.  Similarly, Helix notes that Pod Cartridge customers will be able to develop their own power systems, whether comprising purely batteries or a series hybrid setup that develops electricity from a diesel generator or alternative source. Unsurprisingly, the company expects customers to skew toward hybrid systems in the initial stages.  Source: Helix ","label":0}

Copenhagen has an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when it comes to high-quality living. This year, the Happy City Index ranked Copenhagen as the world's happiest city, based on factors like health, mobility, and environment. Plus, the World Happiness Report named Denmark the second-happiest country in 2025. After spending a week there on a solo trip getting a small taste of the Danish city and talking with locals, I think I understand why. Here's what I learned from Danish culture that inspired habits I brought back home with me to California. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities, with dedicated cycling lanes and an infrastructure that supports bike safety. Throughout my trip, I saw far more bicycles than cars on the streets. So much of the city's population bikes to work, and I'd never seen so many swarms of cyclists in business attire pedaling through rush hour. Walking is also a popular way to get around the city. There are several pedestrian-only streets in Copenhagen, including Str\u00f8get, a nearly 1-mile stretch dotted with shops. During my trip, I easily walked more than 10,000 steps daily, which is hard to do in Los Angeles, where cars are the main mode of transportation. However, since I returned, I've begun making a conscious effort to walk or bike for errands or coffee runs whenever possible. New Nordic cuisine, popularized by chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi's three-Michelin-star restaurant, Noma, is rooted in sourcing local and seasonal ingredients from the region. During my trip, I dined at many places that seemed to share that same ethos, like Oens Have, La Banchina, and Apotek 57. For example, La Banchina, a seafood restaurant located along the harbor, prioritizes ingredients produced in Denmark \u2014 so its meals don't use imports like lemons, olive oil, or black pepper. That felt like a bold move for a seafood restaurant, and I was skeptical at first; however, the food was simple yet delicious. This inspired me to prioritize fresh, local ingredients when I cook at home. Now that I'm back in California, I try to shop at the local farmers market every Sunday. When I'm at the supermarket, I read labels carefully and prioritize buying California-made ingredients, including California avocados, honey from Ojai, and fresh produce from local farms. Saunas and cold plunges (especially paired together) are cornerstones of Scandinavian culture, in part because of their potential health benefits. Saunas can increase blood circulation and relax muscles, while cold plunges constrict blood vessels and may reduce inflammation and pain. Research suggests that cold exposure can support muscle recovery, and both practices may help improve sleep quality. Finland was among the first northern European countries to popularize hot and cold therapy, but it has since spread to other Nordic countries, including Denmark. Saunas are prevalent in hotels throughout Copenhagen and the city as a whole. La Banchina even had one in the restaurant's garden that guests could reserve. I enjoyed experiencing varying warm temperatures of saunas and thermal baths, and even tried a cold plunge during my trip \u2014 though I didn't last long. Since returning home, I try to start my mornings with very cold showers to mimic the effects of a cold plunge. I feel like I've already noticed a positive difference in my energy levels throughout the day I've also started seeking out saunas at my local wellness studios. Copenhagen is considered a global leader in sustainability, and I could feel the local respect for Mother Nature woven into daily life. The emphasis on walking and cycling, two eco-friendly transportation options, is just one example. Copenhagen is also working to convert all of its bus lines to zero-emission electric ones. Recycling bins were common and clearly labeled throughout the city. Streets felt clean and trash-free. I was also impressed by the green architectural choices, from solar panels to multi-purpose buildings, like CopenHill \u2014 a waste-to-energy plant that produces heat and electricity for homes and is also topped with a recreational center. I've always recycled in my home, but my trip inspired me to try to step up my sustainability efforts. These days, I try to eat a plant-based meal at least once a week and have been changing my shopping habits to reduce my plastic consumption. America is known for being particularly fond of excess, from large portion sizes being the norm at many restaurants to flashy cars being a symbol of success. However, Danish culture embraces different values, prioritizing modesty, practicality, and simple pleasures \u2014 a key component of the Danish concept of \"hygge.\" Restaurants, hotels, and shops I visited tended to reflect Scandinavian minimalism, featuring few pieces of functional furniture, limited clutter, and simple color palettes. Many local fashions appeared to be fairly simple and practical, rather than overly flashy and fussy. I noticed stores carrying a lot of quality basics and functional pieces in neutral colors, such as wide trousers, crisp shirts, and tailored blazers that can easily fit into a year-round capsule wardrobe. Fleeting fashion trends seemed less prevalent than what I'm used to seeing in other major Western cities. I left truly believing this emphasis on intentional living can help people develop a deep sense of contentment and gratitude while fostering a higher quality of life. When I returned from my trip, I decluttered as much as I could, keeping only things I had used within the last six months and donating almost everything else. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 has officially outsold every Xbox console individually, including the top-selling Xbox 360, marking a dramatic shift from the era when the Xbox ruled the gaming world.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  In Sony\u2019s latest financial report, the PlayStation 5 has now shipped more than 84.2 million units, putting it just ahead of the Xbox 360 by roughly 200,000 units. It also places the PS5 close behind the PlayStation 3, marking it as one of Sony\u2019s fastest-selling consoles despite a more challenging market. What makes that figure even more impressive is that Sony increased hardware prices this generation and introduced cost-saving revisions, such as smaller internal storage. Yet, the PS5 continues to build momentum. Xbox, meanwhile, has also raised prices but struggled to maintain the same traction with its Series X | S hardware. Looking across PlayStation\u2019s full history tells an even clearer story. The PS1 sold 102.4 million, the PS2 reached 160 million, the PS3 hit 87.4 million, and the PS4 finished at 117 million. Combined, that\u2019s around 551 million PlayStation consoles shipped worldwide versus 196 million units across all generations for Xbox. Of course, that number doesn\u2019t represent half a billion unique players. Much of it comes from fans upgrading within the ecosystem each generation \u2014 a reality that Xbox seems to acknowledge. Microsoft\u2019s \u201cXbox everywhere\u201d strategy reflects its belief that the console market has plateaued and that real growth now lies in expanding the broader Xbox ecosystem beyond traditional hardware.      If you\u2019re like me and have fond memories of the Xbox 360, you\u2019ll know just how much of a cultural impact that console had. Xbox Live shaped an entire generation of online play, setting the standard for friends lists, voice chat, and multiplayer matchmaking. With games like Halo, Gears of War, Fable, Call of Duty, and GTA IV defining its era, it\u2019s no wonder the Xbox 360 was the closest Xbox that ever came to the sun, selling around 84 million units during its lifecycle. That success, however, was short-lived. Under Don Mattrick, the Xbox One launched with a heavy focus on non-gaming features like TV, entertainment apps, and DRM policies\u2014paired with a higher price tag than the PlayStation 4. It was a fumble that handed momentum straight to Sony, and Xbox has never fully recovered from that misstep. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Mattrick\u2019s tenure had its share of controversy. He allegedly axed the in-development Halo MMO, Titan, to protect a personal bonus \u2014 a move that could have cost Xbox a billion-dollar opportunity, and one I\u2019m still bitter about. Even so, the Xbox One still sold a respectable 58 million consoles, but it was a far cry from the 360\u2019s peak. Thanks to Phil Spencer and others within Xbox, the brand slowly regained trust through initiatives like backward compatibility, the Xbox One X, and a renewed focus on player choice. Those efforts laid the groundwork for the Xbox Series X and S, which carried that philosophy into the current generation. The Xbox Series X and S are, for all intents and purposes, fantastic hardware. Some might even argue that Xbox is the only company this generation that truly innovated. Features like Quick Resume, extensive backward compatibility, and Game Pass show how Microsoft built a genuinely player-friendly ecosystem (or at least they did before price hikes). But even with all those strengths, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Xbox Series sales sit at around 30 million units, a far cry from Sony\u2019s momentum. With Microsoft\u2019s third-party publishing push and exclusivity fading across the industry, it\u2019s become harder than ever to convince players to join the ecosystem. I maintain that the Series X and S are fantastic consoles, but Xbox\u2019s biggest hurdle is marketing\u2014or rather, its lack of it. Anyone in Europe will notice the difference immediately. PlayStation and Nintendo dominate billboards, buses, and phone booths, while Xbox is barely visible despite a strong release slate with Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, and Ninja Gaiden 4. To the average consumer, many of these games barely exist or are even connected to the Xbox as a brand, and that\u2019s a shame for hardware this good. I could point to Xbox\u2019s Activision acquisition, which has arguably created as many problems as it solved, accelerating its shift toward third-party publishing \u2014 but at this stage, that feels like beating a battered corpse. Instead, it\u2019s worth looking at how Xbox seems almost allergic to putting its branding on its biggest IPs, from Minecraft to Call of Duty. The Minecraft movie nearly grossed a billion dollars at the box office, yet there wasn\u2019t a single hint of Xbox branding anywhere. For a company trying to sell an ecosystem, that feels like the most obvious opportunity in the world to miss.      If leaks and rumors are to be believed, Xbox is betting big on the next generation, aiming to reshape what people consider a \u201cconsole.\u201d In some ways, it\u2019s already begun doing that with devices like the Xbox Ally, its first handheld built in collaboration with ASUS. Creating a true console\u2013PC hybrid could be a significant step forward, but it might not be enough if Xbox can\u2019t effectively market its hardware and convince players that this is the best value for their money. The next generation will demand not just innovation, but visibility \u2014 and that\u2019s where Xbox still needs to prove itself now more than ever. PlayStation 5 has shipped more than 84.2 million units worldwide. Yes. With over 84 million units shipped, the PS5 has surpassed the lifetime sales of every Xbox system, including the Xbox 360, which previously held the record at around 84 million units sold. Estimates put lifetime sales roughly at 24 million for the original Xbox, 84 million for the Xbox 360, 58 million for the Xbox One, and around 30 million for the Xbox Series X | S, bringing the total close to 196 million units across all generations. Not necessarily. Xbox has pivoted toward services like Game Pass and cloud gaming, but in terms of console sales, PlayStation is far ahead. It\u2019s possible, but it would require a major hit exclusive, stronger hardware adoption, and a shift in global market perception.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Erica Hay, 53, underwent the operation in September 2020 before being told the mass in her lung had, in fact, been caused by pneumonia \u00a0Kay Roxby \/ Alamy Stock Photo  A British woman had part of her lung removed following a suspected cancer diagnosis, only to be told two weeks later that she didn't actually have the disease.   Erica Hay, 53, from the Doncaster suburb of Balby in South Yorkshire, England, was told by doctors that they were \"99.9% certain\" that she had cancer, after she went to the Doncaster Royal Infirmary hospital in July 2020 with pains in her shoulder and across her chest, per the BBC.   Hay underwent multiple tests before the suspected lung cancer diagnosis; however, a biopsy couldn't be carried out due to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions at the time, the outlet noted.   The mother of three recalled to the BBC, \"I had to go home and tell my children and parents that I had cancer. I tried to be strong for them, but I just fell to pieces,\" adding, \"You hear the word cancer and you automatically think you're going to die.\"  Mark Kelly \/ Alamy Stock Photo  Hay ended up having an operation in September 2020 to remove the lower lobe of her right lung, according to local outlet Doncaster Free Press, which listed Hay's name as Erica Flatley.   However, two weeks after the surgery, she was told that she didn't have cancer, and the mass in her lung had been caused by pneumonia, the publication reported.   She said, \u201cAt my two-week review, the surgeon told me I was in the one percent of people who didn\u2019t have cancer, and that it was likely to have been an infection,\" according to the outlet.   Hay, who has worked in the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS) for over 30 years, continued, \u201cI was just as shocked to find out I didn\u2019t have cancer as I was when they first told me I did. At the end of the day, an infection can be treated with medication, I didn\u2019t need life-changing surgery,\u201d per the Doncaster Free Press.   She claimed that the operation has left her with breathing difficulties, telling the BBC: \"I've had asthma since I was 17, but my respiratory problems have increased unbelievably since the surgery,\" adding, \"It's completely floored me. Just talking or walking into the kitchen can set my symptoms off.\"   \"Sometimes I feel like my lungs are too heavy for my body, other times my breathing difficulties are so bad it's like I've had the operation again,\" Hay added to the outlet. \"I am so very, very grateful that it wasn't cancer, but I had to go through all of that and know this is probably never going to get any better now.\"   \"It affects my work, my daily living, and at times it makes me feel inadequate as a [mom] and a wife,\" she continued.   Hay, who works as a neonatal nurse assistant at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, is now considering early retirement on health grounds, per the Doncaster Free Press.   Hay has since pursued a clinical negligence claim with Sheffield-based law firm Medical Solicitors, and the case was resolved with a settlement, a spokesperson for the company said, per the BBC. A spokesperson for Medical Solicitors noted that the hospital trusts involved hadn't admitted liability or causation.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Wall Street broker Bernstein said the U.S. has taken a decisive step toward becoming the world\u2019s crypto capital with the rollout of a comprehensive regulatory framework.  The GENIUS Act, now law, accelerated the stablecoin market, pushing U.S. dollar\u2013backed supply beyond $260 billion, the broker said in a Wednesday report. The forthcoming CLARITY Act, expected in late 2025, will establish the first cohesive market structure for digital assets, clearly dividing responsibilities between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and resolving years of regulatory uncertainty, it said. According to analysts led by Gautam Chhugani, the centerpiece of this transformation is SEC Chair Atkins\u2019 Project Crypto, the most ambitious effort yet to fuse securities markets with blockchain technology.  The initiative aims to restore innovation by classifying most crypto assets outside securities law, enabling tokenized stocks and bonds and licensing broker-dealers to handle both traditional and digital assets under a single regulatory umbrella.  It also seeks to modernize infrastructure for onchain trading and 24\/7 settlement, cutting costs across tokenized securities, stablecoins and crypto assets, the analysts said. This clarity has lowered the sector's risk from political turnover and unlocked new institutional participation.  Crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now hold $160 billion in assets, the report noted, with institutions making up roughly a quarter of spot ETF investors. Bernstein said the digital asset IPO market roared back this year, raising $4 billion since January, while the market value of publicly traded crypto firms has surged from $80 billion in early 2024 to $380 billion, with Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) now part of the S&P 500 stock index. A new, more sustainable crypto cycle is taking shape, powered by clear rules, institutional capital, and blockchain\u2019s deeper integration into the financial system, the report added.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":" Meta's (META) chief artificial intelligence scientist, Yann LeCun, plans to leave the company to launch his own AI start-up, marking a major shift inside Meta as CEO Mark Zuckerberg doubles down on \"superintelligence\" initiatives to compete with OpenAI and Google, according to people familiar with the matter. LeCun, a Turing Award-winning pioneer of modern AI, has begun early fundraising discussions for his new venture, which will focus on developing \"world models,\" next-generation systems designed to learn from visual and spatial data rather than text. These models aim to replicate human reasoning and understanding of the physical world, a project LeCun has said could take a decade to mature. LeCun's exit comes amid an internal overhaul of Meta's AI strategy. Zuckerberg has shifted Meta's Fundamental AI Research Lab - FAIR, which LeCun founded in 2013, away from long-term research toward commercial AI products and large language models - LLMs. The move follows the underwhelming release of Meta's Llama 4 model, which lagged behind rival offerings from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. To accelerate progress, Zuckerberg recently hired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, paying $14.3 billion for a 49 percent stake in his company and appointing him to lead Meta's new Superintelligence division, to which LeCun now reports. The CEO also formed an elite team called TBD Lab, offering $100 million pay packages to lure top AI talent from competitors. LeCun has publicly disagreed with Zuckerberg's heavy reliance on LLMs, calling them \"useful but fundamentally limited\" in their ability to reason and plan like humans. His upcoming start-up will extend his FAIR research into \"world models\" that could ultimately enable machines to think more like people.      LeCun's planned departure adds to a series of AI leadership shake-ups at Meta. In recent months, Joelle Pineau, vice-president of AI research, left for Cohere, and the company laid off 600 employees from its AI division. Meanwhile, Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT, joined Meta as chief scientist of the Superintelligence Lab. The upheaval follows investor pressure after Meta's shares plunged 12.6% in late October, wiping out nearly $240 billion in market value, when Zuckerberg indicated that AI spending could exceed $100 billion next year. LeCun's move signals both a philosophical and structural rift within Meta's AI program, and the emergence of a potential new rival in the race toward true artificial general intelligence. Tuesday META closed at $627.08, down 0.74%, and is trading after hours at $627.00, down 0.01% on the NasdaqGS.

The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, increased 0.6 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"     Choosing the right AI has become part of the creative process, like picking the right camera lens or paintbrush.    Picking the right AI model for specific creative tasks may help you. AI image and video models aren't human, but they do have distinct \"personalities,\" according to the creators who use them. The new phenomenon is a reaction to the rapidly expanding generative AI industry, highlighting how creators manage a dizzying number of choices. Generative AI has experienced a massive surge in growth over the past few years, but it wasn't until 2025 that\u00a0AI image,\u00a0video\u00a0and other generative media models took center stage. Like how chatbots have redefined text generation, these creative AI models are transforming content creation and creative work, for better or worse. Google and OpenAI have long been leaders in the AI race. Prior to this year, they were known for their Gemini and ChatGPT chatbots. Now, Veo 3, nano banana and Sora 2 have put the tech titans firmly at the head of the pack among creative AI models. New AI innovations from Adobe and AI creative start-ups, such as\u00a0Runway, Pika and Luma, have also bolstered the field this year.\u00a0 For AI companies to stay competitive in a crowded market, generative media has evolved from a niche offering to a must-have necessity. Companies are focusing on upgrading their AI models to maintain an edge and attract new users. Improvements typically involve creating content that is detailed, at a higher resolution and, for video, includes sound and extends the duration of clips. Hallucinations, or errors, are disappearing with every model update, which is part of why it's becoming increasingly difficult\u00a0to spot AI-generated content.\u00a0 Altogether, there have never been so many options for creating AI content. When creators have to choose a model to use, it's no longer about which model will produce serviceable results. Now, it's a debate about which will be the best fit for a specific project or task. As a result, each AI model now has its own personality. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.\u00a0Add CNET\u00a0as a preferred Google source. Creators use the term \"personalities\" colloquially -- AI models aren't human and therefore don't have personalities. The term really refers to a model's ability to handle specific tasks and its reputation for excelling in particular areas. It also refers to each model's individual style at a baseline.\u00a0 \"Creators are humanizing these tools. They call them 'the creative one' or 'the detailed one' because they're building actual relationships with their AI. It's not just software anymore,\" said Tiffany Kyazze (@TechTiff), founder of the AI Flow Club, which teaches people how to use AI tools. \"These personalities help creators build trust with their tools, work through creative blocks, and find workflow comfort.\" For creators who use AI tools daily, selecting the right model has become an integral part of the creative process, much like choosing the right camera lens or paintbrush. \"Each model interprets the world differently; some lean cinematic, others more surreal or dreamlike,\" said Dave Clark, director and chief creative officer at Promise AI, an AI production studio. \"The key for me is knowing how to take my creative vision and translate it into visual language prompts that allow me to achieve the artistry I want.\" There's a learning curve to discovering each model's personality. Sometimes, it isn't even determined by the company creating it; it varies between images and videos, and between different generations of the same model. Part of that is due to how the models are created. \"Part of what we're learning when we train our own models is at the tail end of the training process, you can show the model a particular style, and the model will overfit to some extent, or adapt, to that style and basically gain the personality,\" said Alexandru Costin, vice president of generative AI at Adobe. \"So we see very opinionated models that do that. Others try to be more neutral.\" The training data that's used to create and refine a model also plays a role in developing each model's baseline style. For example, Adobe's Firefly models were trained using licensed Adobe Stock imagery, which is why Firefly-generated content often has a stock-like appearance. (Costin said the company is working on fixing that to create more realistic outputs.) I've spent a lot of time with these AI models, and the creators I spoke with had similar ideas and experiences to my own when it came to each model's personality. Here are some of the most popular models' personalities. You'll notice distinct personalities among chatbots, too. ChatGPT is known for its affectionate, personable tone (sometimes annoyingly so), whereas Claude is a go-to research tool, and Gemini is a convenient choice for Google users. However, the different personalities of AI image and video models -- styles, aesthetics, innate preferences, etc -- are much more immediately obvious.\u00a0 While you can create nearly any scene with AI image and video generators, they aren't the \"everything machines\" that chatbots can be. Creators who use AI creative tools for professional work often need to leave them with a specific piece of content. Understanding each model's personality is crucial. The idea of bouncing between AI models and programs might not seem appealing at first, but there are benefits to expanding your AI roster.\u00a0 Clark and his team used a variety of AI models for a new short film he directed named My Friend, Zeph. This method of hybrid filmmaking, as Clark calls it, involved the team using AI tools such as Adobe Firefly, Google's Veo 3.1 and Luma's Ray3, as well as Adobe's traditional software, including Photoshop and Premiere Pro. \"By blending multiple models, you get creative range and precision, almost like having a team of specialists,\" said Clark. \"We can visualize the world of a story much earlier, iterate faster, and make stronger creative choices before we ever step on set.\" Some creators are loyal to specific AI tools and platforms and might be hesitant to branch out. This idea of AI loyalty is slightly misguided, Kyazze said. The creators getting the best results are \"tool-agnostic and goal-focused.\"\u00a0 \"The real benefit of multimodel workflows is that you're not forcing one tool to do everything. You're leveraging each model's actual strengths. That's not just more efficient. It gets you better results because you're using the right tool for each specific part of your project,\" said Kyazze. The concept of AI models possessing personalities is relatively new, thanks to the recent surge in models available to creators. But they aren't static labels; a model's reputation and personality can change over time. As new updates roll out, models once known for being terrible at a specific task might be improved.\u00a0 This trend is yet another sign that AI is playing a growing role in creative work. That's not true for all creators, as there are many who are opposed to AI and don't want to use it. But for those who are interested, there have never been more choices.\u00a0 Creating distinct personalities for AI image and video models is one way, or solution, to help them pick the right tool to achieve better results -- without wasting too much time and money on AI tools that aren't the best fit. While generative media models have improved a lot, they still aren't perfect. Adapting to each model's strengths and weaknesses is a smart workflow design, Kyazze said. Remembering that AI models are just tools is important, too, Clark said. \"The human expression of the artist -- our personality and creative point of view -- is what truly drives the outcomes,\" said Clark. \"It's not about replacing the traditional process; it's about expanding what's possible and bringing imagination closer to the screen than ever before.\" (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)","label":0}

SoftBank Group\u2019s shares slumped sharply on Wednesday, a day after the Japanese tech investment giant announced it had sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia to fund its investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and other bets on artificial intelligence. Softbank\u2019s Tokyo-listed shares slipped by as much as 10% on Wednesday, hitting a near-one month low. The stock recovered some of its losses and ended the day at \u00a521,910 ($141.50), down 3.46% from the previous day, despite the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s benchmark Nikkei Index rising 0.43%. The slide comes amid concerns about a potential market bubble, while SoftBank presses forward with more than $30 billion in AI investments. The company\u2019s Vision Fund 2 will invest $22.5 billion in OpenAI, while the company also agreed to acquire chipmaker Ampere Computing for $6.5 billion and electrical equipment manufacturer ABB\u2019s robotics division for $5.4 billion. During the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto said he didn\u2019t think he could answer \u201cwhether this is a bubble or not.\u201d According to our estimates, Softbank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son\u2019s current net worth is $69.4 billion, down from $72.2 billion on Tuesday.

{"date":"2025-11-12","content":"Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are the company's newest flagship earbuds, featuring AI smarts like interpreter mode and voice detection. With 10.5mm dynamic drivers paired with 6.1mm planar drivers, sound quality will be top-notch. But a redesign that resembles Apple's AirPods is the headlining change here, and Samsung has used this to enable new swipe and pinch gestures for the series. You can't really go wrong with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro if you're looking for a solid pair of wireless earbuds. While they might not be the most talked about, they do deliver a solid experience that will leave you plenty satisfied. When we reviewed them, we really liked the sound they produced, even beating out the AirPods Pro. They also featured a revamped design which made it easier to use, specifically when it came to controlling your listening experience. And while they come in at a fair price at $250, it doesn't hurt to be able to get a discount when you can if you're in the market. Right now, popular retailers are dropping the price by as much as $70.  Samsung took a big leap with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, changing the design from the previous model. While we'd love to say it was all for looks, the stalks introduced a more reliable way to interact with the earbuds, which was a small problem with the previous design. In our testing, we didn't really feel as though the interactions were really all that precise, but it is an element that you can adjust in the software settings.  When it comes to the sound of these earbuds, it's pretty good out of the box. But if you're someone that likes to fine-tune the experience, that's an option to use the equalizer found in the app. The earbuds also feature pretty good ANC. It isn't the strongest in its category, but it is enough to cancel out the environmental sounds you experience in your day-to-day life. The earbuds also deliver great sound when you're on a call, making it easy for your audience to hear your voice clearly. As far as battery life, you can expect up to 30 hours or a little less with the ANC on. The charging is pretty simple, you just pop the earbuds into the case, and you can recharge them while you're on the go. You can also plug in the case to charge or use a wireless charging pad to recharge the whole setup in its entirety. If there is one major caveat we have to point out, it's that the earbuds work best when paired with a Samsung Galaxy device. Just to be clear, you can pair these earbuds with any product with Bluetooth, but Samsung only unlocks the entire experience when connected to its own devices. So if this sounds like the pair of earbuds you've been searching for, grab them right now for a good price ahead of Black Friday. ","label":0}
