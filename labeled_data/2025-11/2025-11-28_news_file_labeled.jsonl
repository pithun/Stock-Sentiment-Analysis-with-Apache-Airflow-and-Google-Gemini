This year marks a turning point in Apple\u2019s historically rigid pricing strategy where discounts remained rare and controlled. At $219, down from $249, the AirPods Pro 3 that launched just months ago join Apple\u2019s unprecedented Black Friday selloff happening exclusively on Amazon rather than through official channels. The entire AirPods lineup received aggressive discounting including the AirPods Max at $399, AirPods 4 with ANC at $99, standard AirPods 4 at $69, and these flagship Pro 3 models. Apple appears determined to clear inventory quickly but discreetly through Amazon\u2019s platform rather than diluting brand perception on their own website where premium pricing remains intact. See at Amazon With the real-time translation feature, you can talk to people who don\u2019t speak English face-to-face. The earbuds translate speech right away and show the text on your paired iPhone: Ordering food, asking for directions or doing business in a foreign language is less scary when AI can help with these things. The feature works for phone calls as well and translates both sides of conversations in real time for international calls with coworkers, family or business contacts who don\u2019t speak your language. The heart rate sensor turns AirPods from simple audio devices into health monitoring tools that can keep track of heart health metrics during workouts without the need for chest straps or wrist-worn devices. The optical sensors measure blood flow through the ear canals and send heart rate data to Apple Health so you can keep track of your fitness in real time. Runners can see their heart rate zones in real time while they train without having to wear an Apple Watch. The hearing aid feature is a huge step forward in accessibility because FDA-approved hearing aids can now work through regular earbuds instead of expensive medical devices. The feature runs built-in tests to figure out your hearing profile, then boosts certain frequencies where you have hearing loss while keeping the sound quality natural. People with mild to moderate hearing loss can get help with everyday tasks without the stigma or cost of traditional hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars. Active noise cancellation works better now because the processing has been improved to sample background noise and make anti-phase sound waves that are more accurate. The noise of airplanes, people talking in the office and traffic all fade away into silence and let you fully concentrate on music, podcasts or work without any outside noise. The adaptive transparency mode lets in background noise when you need it for conversations or to be aware of your surroundings \u2013 and it changes automatically based on how loud the noise is around you. With dynamic head tracking, Spatial Audio makes three-dimensional soundstages where sounds seem to come from certain places in space around you. Directional audio cues that put dialogue in the center of the screen and sound effects that pan left and right make movies and shows more immersive than flat stereo can. More and more music producers are using spatial audio which means that artists mix tracks specifically for this format to make immersive experiences where instruments are in different places. If you want Apple\u2019s most advanced earbuds, this record-low price represents the best value available. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Portable monitors solve specific problems that laptops and tablets cannot address alone, particularly for gaming scenarios where you want larger screen real estate without lugging full-size displays. Nintendo Switch players confined to the 7\/8-inch handheld screen gain dramatic improvement through 15.6-inch external displays that transform mobile gaming into living room experiences during travel or temporary setups. The KYY 15-6-inch portable monitor costs $66 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $99, and hits a record-low price that undercuts competing 1080p portable displays typically selling between $80 and $120 for identical specifications. The 34% discount makes secondary displays accessible at pricing approaching basic phone accessories. See at Amazon The 15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 makes images clear and readable, and games show sharp detail instead of the blurry compromises that lower-resolution portable monitors make. When you look at the screen from the side or share it with others, the 178-degree viewing angles keep the colors and contrast true. What\u2019s more, HDR support improves the dynamic range of compatible content by showing more detail in shadows in dark scenes and keeping highlight information that SDR displays clip. The two USB-C ports with full functionality let you connect a single cable to a laptop or phone that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery. You don\u2019t need separate power adapters or HDMI converters that make cable clutter to connect modern MacBooks, Windows laptops and flagship smartphones: They all work with simple USB-C cables. The Mini-HDMI port works with devices that don\u2019t have USB-C video output, like gaming consoles, older laptops, and desktop computers. The monitor is truly portable because it is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs only 1.7 pounds. The dimensions fit into laptop bags with other gear without needing special carrying cases or taking up too much room in luggage while traveling. Business travelers get presentation screens for working in hotel rooms, digital nomads set up dual-monitor workstations in cafes or coworking spaces, and students use laptop screens to do research-heavy assignments that need multiple document windows. The included smart cover is made of PU leather and protects against scratches while being transported.The magnetic attachment makes it easier to attach and remove the cover than cases that need straps or closures, and the frameless design keeps it as small as possible. The grooves in the stand make it easy to find a comfortable viewing angle, whether you\u2019re typing on a laptop or watching something hands-free. The built-in dual stereo speakers let you listen to music without headphones or external speakers, but the sound quality is only okay because of physical limitations. The 3.5mm audio jack lets you connect headphones or external speakers when you need better sound, but it also keeps things flexible for different uses. When sound quality isn\u2019t as important as convenience, the speakers are good enough for video calls, watching videos, or playing games. The landscape and portrait orientation support lets you work in different ways such as coding with vertical text display, reviewing documents in their native orientation, or editing portrait photos. You can change the brightness, contrast, color temperature, and input selection on the screen without having to use software or complicated button combinations. The Black Friday price of $66 is the lowest ever, which means that KYY\u2019s portable monitor costs a lot less than other 1080p displays that cost between $80 and $120 and have similar specs and build quality.

If you\u2019re looking to enjoy your favorite tracks on the go, having a solid portable Bluetooth speaker is a must. The market is filled with a ton of options, so picking the right one for yourself can get overwhelming fast, but that\u2019s where we come in. Our shopping team has been working hard to find the best Black Friday discounts out there, and those looking for something under $50 should consider grabbing the Sony SRS-XB100 speaker. It\u2019s now down to $43, after a whopping 34% discount. Multiple color options are discounted, including black, white, and the stunning orange. Keep in mind that Black Friday discounts move fast, so if you spot something you like, it\u2019s best to grab it sooner rather than later. See at Amazon The super-portable XB100 features a basic, no-fuss design and comes with an engineered strap that makes it quite easy to travel with. Wrap it around your arm, attach it to your backpack, or toss it into a cupholder and get going. Don\u2019t let the size fool you, though.\u00c2\u00a0The improved driver, paired with a full-range speaker, enhances low-end tones while boosting the bass. Sound is spread across the room with the Sound Diffusion processor, creating a cinema-like, 3D listening experience. Vibing to the latest Coldplay album or just catching up on your favorite audiobook as you finish boring kitchen tasks, audio comes through with great detail and clarity. When streaming movies, you\u2019ll be able to hear dialogues just as well, making it an all-rounder. There\u2019s a built-in microphone that lets you take calls directly from the speaker, absolutely hands-free. The echo-canceling technology, as the name suggests, removes echo from your calls, meaning the other person won\u2019t hear their own voice coming back. Catch up with friends, and take quick meetings on the go right from it. An IP67 rating makes the speaker resistant to both dust and water, while a new UV coating prevents it from harsh sunlight. This year-round durability makes it easy to carry it with you anywhere you want, literally. Take it to a fun beach trip with friends, by the pool on a hot, sunny day, and even in the shower for a private jamming session with the songs you\u2019d rather gatekeep. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair two of these for a larger, more immersive setup. Just ask a friend to bring theirs, and have your very own mini concert right there in your backyard. Battery life is just as solid. You\u2019re looking at around 16 hours of playtime on a single charge, which is enough to go at least a couple of days without plugging it in. You won\u2019t have to rush to grab a charger mid-party or hunt for an outlet when on the go. Top it up the night before, and dance to your favorite tunes like never before. There\u2019s a lot more to like about this speaker, but to wrap it up, if you\u2019ve been on the lookout for an audio solution that brings your favorite music to life without blowing your budget, this deal makes that possible. The speaker is easy to carry, delivers powerful sound, and offers a reliable battery life. It\u2019s now down to just $43, after a nice 34% discount. There are no complicated coupons or long checkout steps to worry about; just add the speaker to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Stock up on this pair of anti-inflammatory classics to give your diet a healthy boost.  Anna Puzatykh \/ Getty Images Spinach and pomegranates are top picks for reducing inflammation, thanks to their rich nutrients and antioxidants. For a healthy boost, enjoy spinach fresh and pomegranate seeds instead of juice to maximize their benefits. If these aren't your favorites, broccoli and tart cherry serve as excellent anti-inflammatory alternatives.  Following an anti-inflammatory diet has major health benefits, helping to both reduce the risk of developing chronic conditions like heart disease and alleviating symptoms if you currently are dealing with them\u2014along with potentially slowing the aging process altogether. But while there's a whole slew of anti-inflammatory foods to choose from, which ones offer the biggest bang for your buck?   We put the question to two nutritionists, and got their picks for the anti-inflammatory foods they'd eat every day. Here are their picks\u2014plus ideas for how to work them into your daily meal plan.   \"Spinach has to be my favorite!\" says Christa Brown, MS, RDN, LD, a dietitian in New Jersey. This superfood is packed with vitamins, fiber, and nutrients\u2014and has been linked in studies to plenty of other health benefits, too.   \"There have been strong links to improvements in blood sugar by reducing diabetes risk by 26 percent,\" Brown says. \"Also, just a half cup of cooked greens per day can improve cognition by 11 years in the elderly. In addition, research has suggested that consuming one cup of leafy greens per day reduces biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer.\"   Spinach can be served either hot or cold\u2014but Brown recommends uncooked spinach for its health benefits. \"Uncooked spinach\u2014fresh, frozen, or canned\u2014provides the highest level of lutein, which is an antioxidant that reduces inflammation related to cognitive decline, cardiovascular health, and cancer.\"   \"Pomegranate seeds are a small but mighty way to support your body's inflammatory response,\" says Mascha Davis,\u00a0MPH, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author of\u00a0Eat Your Vitamins. You can thank the ellagitannins in pomegranate seeds\u2014bioactive polyphenols that have\u00a0anti-inflammatory effects\u00a0on cells in the body, she says.\u00a0   Davis likes pomegranates in particular because they offer additional benefits beyond the anti-inflammatory response\u2014and because you can get big benefits from only a small amount of pomegranate seeds. \"Pomegranate seeds are rich in fiber\u2014about 4 grams\u00a0per half-cup\u2014which is beneficial for digestive health. Plus, they provide antioxidants and polyphenols that may support\u00a0heart health, improve blood circulation, and even\u00a0enhance skin health.\"   To get the benefits, Davis recommends eating about a half cup of pomegranate seeds per day\u2014but even smaller amounts will be beneficial, if you aren't that into the fruit.  To get the most benefits from your pomegranates, opt for the seeds over the juice. A half-cup of seeds has 7 grams of fiber, compared to just .2 grams in pomegranate juice. The seeds also contain more vitamin C\u2014a potent antioxidant vitamin.  Both spinach and pomegranates can be worked into a slew of recipes, from smoothies and salads to main dishes\u2014and yes, even desserts. Here are some of our favorite ways to enjoy the anti-inflammatory benefits of these key foods.  CAITLIN BENSEL  This tasty dish features both spinach and pomegranate juice to get a two-in-one shot of anti-inflammatory goodness\u2014alongside another anti-inflammatory favorite, sweet potatoes.  Victor Protasio  Not every anti-inflammatory dish has to be completely virtuous. So why not indulge in a decadent dessert that's delicious? Both pomegranate arils and juice are used in this creamy and elegant treat.  Greg DuPree\u00a0  This simple dinner or brunch recipe is a healthy delight, packed with spinach and anti-inflammatory favorites like avocado and salsa verde.   Get your greens in one quick drink with this vibrant green smoothie. It features nearly a full day's worth of spinach, along with healthy favorites like pineapple, apples, and hemp seeds.  Jen Causey, Food Stylist: Rishon Hanners, Prop Stylist: Julia Bayless  This fall salad features pomegranate\u2014and the kale in it can be swapped out for baby spinach instead. Plus, the sweet roasted acorn squash features carotenoids and vitamins that make it another anti-inflammatory addition to this tasty dish.   If you don't love spinach or pomegranate, our nutritionists offered two similar alternatives that could still give you that boost of anti-inflammatory goodness: broccoli and tart cherry.   \"Broccoli is usually the next option I would suggest since it\u2019s part of the dark leafy green family,\" Brown says. \"When tossed with a little olive oil and fresh garlic, it\u2019s delicious.\"   \"Tart cherry juice has been shown to help\u00a0reduce muscle soreness\u00a0and inflammation, making it particularly beneficial for recovery after exercise,\" Davis says. \"Cherries are rich in anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants that can help fight inflammation and protect cells from oxidative damage. They also promote sleep, thanks to their natural melatonin content, adding an extra layer of benefit for overall health.\" ","label":0}

The Trump family's foray into the smartphone business has seemingly hit a snag. Months ago, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump \u2014 the president's two oldest sons \u2014 announced the creation of \"Trump Mobile,\" a new line of Trump-branded smartphones. The duo made the announcement on June 16, the 10-year anniversary of President Donald Trump's first presidential campaign launch. Among the new company's offerings: The T1, a gold-colored smartphone that largely resembles Apple's iPhone and that was originally advertised as being made in the USA. There was also the \"47 Plan,\" which would offer users services like unlimited texting, calling, and data, roadside assistance, and even tele-health services, all for $47.45 per month \u2014 a reference to Trump's status as both the 45th and 47th president of the United States. Since then, there have been some adjustments. Within days of the launch, the \"MADE IN THE USA\" wording was struck from the Trump Mobile website. The phone is now simply described as \"brought to life right here in the USA\" and made with \"American hands.\" More significantly, the company has missed its original launch date. The phone was originally set to be released in August, according to the company's June announcement. A spokesperson later told USA Today that the phone would launch in October. It's now late November, and the Trump Mobile website simply says the phone will be available \"later this year.\" Trump Mobile did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Meanwhile, Trump Mobile's X account has laid dormant for months \u2014 the last post the company made was on August 27.

The AI boom is only just beginning \u2014 and it may prove the most lucrative cycle in venture-capital history, even as it also leaves behind a wave of startups. That's according to Mel Williams, cofounder and partner at TrueBridge Capital Partners, a fund-of-funds manager with $8 billion under management that has backed firms such as Founders Fund, Thrive, and Sequoia. While VCs pick startups, Williams' job is to pick the VCs \u2014 giving him a rare, ecosystem-wide view of what's coming. His outlook: AI will create enormous value over the next decade, but a number of startups won't make it out alive. \"We think we're at the leading stages of an AI wave,\" Williams said during an interview on Jack Altman's \"Uncapped\" podcast released on Tuesday. \"We're going to see a lot of carnage over the next 10 years. And we will see more value created over the next 10 years than we've seen in the venture industry,\" he said. Williams described the early-stage AI environment as overheated. Founders with the right r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2014 often with experience at OpenAI or top labs \u2014 can raise massive rounds at lofty valuations with little proof their product works. \"At the earlier stages of the formation stages, where there's less evidence of a product market fit, you do see founders with credibility, founders who could check a couple boxes raising large pools of capital at very high valuations,\" he said. Growth-stage deals, he added, look more reasonable, with valuations closer to public-market levels as investors focus more on real revenue. Williams believes AI is accelerating the power-law pattern that already defines venture capital: a tiny handful of companies drive nearly all the returns. \"The magnitude of the winners is even greater today than it has been in prior cycles,\" he said. It \"is going to be outsized in this market.\" He pointed to three forces intensifying that trend: The result: companies that get product-market fit could become market leaders quickly, while those that miss may stumble.  Williams said the frenzy is largely confined to the field of AI. Outside of this, valuations remain reasonable, and capital still moves around milestones and revenue, he said. The broader venture market, in his view, looks attractive compared to the overheated AI landscape. But AI now accounts for 50% to 60% of all venture activity, he said \u2014 and that imbalance is setting the stage for a harsh correction. Even if non-AI categories stay rational, Williams believes the sheer amount of capital flooding into AI will create a long trail of \"carnage\" as companies miss product-market fit or fail to justify their sky-high valuations. \"We're in the early stages of that. There's evidence that it's working,\" he said, but he added, \"at the same time, it feels like a very frothy investment environment.\" Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Elon Musk's Starlink has gained yet another airline customer as the ultra-high-speed WiFi service continues to gain popularity. On the first day of this month's Dubai Airshow, Emirates announced that Starlink will be available for free, starting November 23. Business Insider previously tested Starlink on Qatar Airways' first flight with it last October. The connection speed peaked at 215 megabits per second, more than enough for a lag-free video call, and faster than many cable-based internet services. Starlink functions thanks to a constellation of over 7,000 satellites, which allows internet connections in remote locations, such as flying over an ocean. The satellites are in low-earth orbit, which means faster internet speeds \u2014 but also disrupts astronomers. Starlink isn't the only game in town, however. JetBlue has signed up for Amazon Leo, which functions similarly, but has only launched 150 satellites so far. Another in-flight WiFi rival is Viasat, which is used by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. It only has a handful of satellites in a geostationary orbit, which have a longer time delay. While it has rivals, Starlink wants to cement its dominance. As Starlink grows in popularity, it could be that more carriers sign up to Starlink to keep up with competitors. All airlines with Starlink offer it free of charge, although some require passengers to sign up for their loyalty programs. As of the Emirates announcement, here are all the airlines that have publicly announced plans to launch Starlink: The Irish flag carrier is part of International Airlines Group, which announced its Starlink deal in early November. It's set to roll out Starlink from early 2026, but plans are still being finalized across the conglomerate. Latvia's airBaltic flies around Europe and the Middle East only using Airbus A220 jets. It was the first European airline to adopt Starlink, and hopes to complete installation on all its planes by the end of the year. The French flag carrier announced its Starlink deal last September, available to Flying Blue loyalty members. Installation began across its fleet, including regional planes, this summer. Air New Zealand first said it was working with Starlink two years ago. It then rolled it out on two domestic aircraft in June, saying that it was \"currently in the test phase.\" After merging with Hawaiian Airlines \u2014 the first major carrier to offer Starlink \u2014 Alaska Airlines announced its deal in August. It says it will first be available next year and will be rolled out across the fleet by 2027. The UK flag carrier is also part of IAG. BA said it would start rolling out Starlink next year and that it would be available free of charge to all its passengers. Dubai's airline is starting to roll out Starlink this month and plans to add it to all 232 in-service aircraft by mid-2027. It's also set to operate the first double-decker Airbus A380 with the service. The Emirati budget airline also announced its Starlink deal during this month's Dubai Airshow. It only operates Boeing 737s and plans to install Starlink on 100 of them from next year. The Spanish flag carrier is also part of IAG. The conglomerate said it would roll out Starlink across its fleets from 2026. JSX is a charter airline and was the first carrier to equip Starlink back in 2023. Its fleet is mostly made up of regional Embraer jets. Level is a budget airline based in Barcelona and is part of IAG. The airline's parent company said it would roll out Starlink from 2026. Qatar Airways outpaced its regional rival, Emirates, by announcing Starlink back in May 2024. As of November, it operates the most wide-body aircraft with the service, numbering over 100. Starlink is installed on all Qatar's Boeing 777s and is being rolled out to its Airbus A350s. Scandinavian Airlines, or SAS, is the flag carrier for Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. It announced Starlink in January and said the rollout would begin at the end of the year. Passengers would need to sign up for its EuroBonus loyalty program for free access. United Airlines was the second US airline to announce a Starlink deal, but the first of the Big Three. It has installed the service on over half of its regional planes, and is continuing to roll it out across its whole fleet. The airline says customers will get a notification before their flight if it is equipped with Starlink. Passengers need to sign up for its MileagePlus loyalty program for free access. Virgin Atlantic was the first UK airline to announce its deal with Starlink, which it did in July. Installation is planned to start in the second half of next year. Passengers will need to sign up for the airline's Flying Club loyalty program to use it. Another IAG subsidiary, Vueling is a Spanish budget airline. Its parent company said it would roll out Starlink from 2026. Canada's WestJet started installing Starlink in February, and it's now equipped on over 100 of its Boeing 737 jets. It plans for all its 737-800 and 737 Max 8s to have Starlink by the end of the year. Free access requires signing up for its loyalty program.

Vlogging cameras, especially those offering incredible stability and quality video, both day and night, usually sit well over $800. DJI makes some of our favorite vlogging and action cameras out there, and all thanks to Black Friday, picking up one today doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. We just spotted the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 creator combo going for $669 on Amazon right now. It typically sits around $979, so you can save more than $300 on it if you act right now. The deal is available to all shoppers, whether you\u2019ve got the Prime subscription or not. See at Amazon It\u2019s a tiny, travel-friendly vlogging that fits in your palm and slips into your pocket for easy portability. Superior stability comes from Pocket 3\u2019s advanced 3-axis mechanical stabilization, while ActiveTrack 6.0 keeps you in focus at all times. Trying out a new dance move or chasing a furry friend around, you can bid shaky, headache-inducing footage goodbye. The camera even locks onto your subject, which can come in handy when filming some action-packed sequences. The built-in 2-inch full-color OLED rotatable touchscreen moves both horizontally and vertically to give you the perfect shots. When it comes to picture quality, the camera records in 4K resolution at an impressive 120fps. There\u2019s a 1-inch CMOS sensor to capture clear highlight-shadow details, meaning you will be able to show the world what you\u2019ve been up to even after the shadows fall. It\u2019s smart enough to fine-tune exposure for different skin tones on its own, giving you a glow like never before. Pair this with background bokeh that makes the subject stand out, and you\u2019ll have stunning, professional videos ready to be uploaded on YouTube right away. Speaking of YouTube, you can also use the camera to live stream on different platforms, and even use it for online meetings as a webcam. Basically, it takes care of all your video needs, both personal and professional, like a pro. Sound quality is another strong selling point. Pocket 3 actively reduces background noise to capture what you\u2019re saying clearly, even in noisy, chaotic settings. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair the camera with a compatible DJI microphone for a more premium experience. Battery life is impeccable. A single charge lets you film in 1090p\/24fps for over 2.5 hours; perfect for longer journeys where you want to take your online family along. Recharging won\u2019t take long either, as Pocket 3 hits 80% in just 16 minutes. Best of all, tweaking settings and editing the content won\u2019t be a hassle, thanks to the dedicated smartphone app. The platform lets you play around with filters, plus convert 3-second videos into photos on iOS devices. Included in the box are the Osmo Pocket 3 starting set, the DJI Mic 2 Transmitter, battery handle, Osmo mini Tripod, and more. The battery charger, however, is sold separately. All things considered, if you\u2019ve been on the lookout for a portable camera that makes it easy to record your adventures and share your everyday life with the world, the Pocket 3 Creator Combo is an excellent option to consider. On a regular day, it would run you around $979, but this rare Black Friday deal drops the price to just $669.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":" This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.       We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.      Black Friday has arrived in all its glory, slashing rates across a wide range of categories right, left, and center. We\u2019re spotting tons of items hitting their lowest ever prices, and even some of the latest releases getting surprise discounts. It\u2019s basically a great time to pick everything you\u2019ve had your eyes on for less, whether it\u2019s a MacBook, a pair of premium Bose headphones, or even an air fryer to finally start eating healthy. If you rely on multiple devices to get through the day and are done dealing with cord clutter, a multiport charger is the way out. Right now, you can snag the 3-port 65W Anker USB-C charger for $24, after a whopping 40% off its usual price of $40 at Amazon. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the retailer is also throwing in 2 free months of Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more. Both Prime and non-Prime members can grab it, but subscribers will enjoy free shipping, so they\u2019re saving a few bucks on that front, too. See at Amazon This compact charger is roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and the plugs fold in for easy portability. The smooth, scratchproof surface handles everyday wear and tear well, making it easy to take it with you on the go without worry. There are three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) to charge up to three devices at the same time, whether it\u2019s your smartphone, tablet, or even a laptop. 65W ultra-fast charging is enough to juice a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 35 minutes, or a Google Pixelbook to about half in a little over 40. You\u2019ll get maximum power when using a single port, but when multiple devices are plugged in, the charger automatically spreads the output intelligently. For instance, when topping three devices up at the same time, the top USB-C port can output 40W, while the second USB-C port and USB-A port can deliver 12W each. You can connect your power-hungry devices to a USB-C port, while other essentials to the rest. Despite this power, the charger stays calm and cool while it works. GaN II technology makes for higher energy efficiency and upgraded heat dissipation in a compact frame that is around 53% smaller than your regular, everyday blocks. The box comes with the Anker 735 Charger, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for some extra peace of mind. To wrap it up, you\u2019re saving a massive 40% or $16 on this compact, but powerful charger that\u2019s easy to use and makes any workspace more efficient. It plays nicely with a range of devices, so you can use it to top up your earbuds, smartwatches, smartphones, tablet, laptop, and even consoles.\u00c2\u00a0You\u2019re also getting a free 60-day Audible trial on top of that, which typically costs $15 a month. Audible gets you access to a huge library of podcasts, audiobooks, and Audible Originals that include documentaries, comedy shows, and more. You can purchase titles, enjoy on-demand streaming, and even enjoy offline access to your favorites! Both the offers, however, are expected to expire soon, so it\u2019s best to get your orders in quickly. Once these are gone, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll be back. This is also a great time to grab other tech gadgets for less. We\u2019re covering the top deals here at Kotaku, so don\u2019t forget to check back for the latest drops and some exclusive offers.

The Meta Quest 3 established new VR standards when it launched but its premium pricing kept virtual reality aspirational rather than accessible for mainstream buyers. Meta addressed this barrier by releasing the Quest 3S as a lighter and more affordable variant that maintains core functionality while cutting costs through strategic compromises that most users won\u2019t notice during actual gameplay. Right now, the Quest 3S costs $249 for the 128GB model during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299, which makes this the best entry point into modern VR without the $499 Quest 3 investment. The aggressive pricing combined with complete wireless freedom and instant access to 40-plus games creates exceptional value that explains why the 3S outsells its premium sibling. See at Amazon Qualcomm\u2019s newest XR-specific silicon is optimized for the unique computational needs of virtual reality and it gives the processor twice the graphical processing power of the previous Quest 2 generation. Games load quickly so you don\u2019t have to wait around like you did with older headsets and complex scenes render smoothly at high frame rates, which is important for avoiding motion sickness. The next-generation graphics make the visuals almost as good as those on the PlayStation 5 and they do it in standalone wireless headset form factors, which means you don\u2019t need a gaming PC like you did with older VR systems, which were expensive and hard to use. The performance is good enough for demanding games like realistic simulators, fast-paced shooters and detailed adventure games that would stutter or crash on hardware that isn\u2019t powerful enough. The 8GB of RAM is 33% more than what most budget VR headsets offer: This makes it easier to switch between VR environments, load textures with more detail without pop-in, and generally make the game more responsive. With more memory, developers can make more ambitious experiences with bigger worlds, more things on screen at once, and better graphics without having to make the trade-offs that come with limited RAM. The freedom of wireless technology gets rid of the cords that made early VR systems so annoying: Players had to always be aware of where the cords were so they wouldn\u2019t trip or pull on the headsets while playing. During room-scale VR experiences for instance, you can move naturally through physical spaces. In shooters, you can spin 360 degrees to track enemies from all directions. This makes setup much easier and lets you use VR anywhere, not just in dedicated gaming rooms. The two RGB color cameras let you see everything in full color and mix virtual objects with your real-world surroundings through mixed reality experiences. You can see your real furniture, walls, and surroundings in color, and virtual objects look like they belong there. This lets you play games that interact with real spaces. With passthrough, you can clearly see the real world instead of the grainy black-and-white feeds that made earlier systems confusing. The Gorilla Tag bundle gives Quest 3S buyers special in-game items and 1,000 shiny rocks currency: This makes the social VR game even more valuable, and it\u2019s become a huge hit. Instead of using traditional joystick controls, Gorilla Tag uses arm-swinging locomotion to simulate how gorillas move. This gives the game a unique physicality that makes it very popular even though the graphics are simple. The included three-month trial gives you instant access to more than 40 games which means you won\u2019t have to pay for software right after you buy new hardware. You can try out different types of VR experiences, like action games, creative tools, fitness apps, and social platforms, without spending hundreds of dollars on software before you know what types of games you like. The battery lasts for more than two hours which is enough for most gaming sessions without needing to stop and charge in the middle of a game, which breaks immersion. However, for longer marathon sessions, you\u2019ll need to use a power bank or take breaks to charge. The runtime is long enough for most people who play for 30 to 90 minutes, which is about the same as the average attention span for active VR gameplay, which is more physically engaging than passive screen entertainment. Meta\u2019s current-generation VR technology costs less than many game consoles at the record-low price of $249 on Black Friday. If you\u2019ve been curious about virtual reality but didn\u2019t want to pay a lot for it, this deal makes modern VR possible at prices that make it worth it to try.

They specifically wanted one that was affordable, capable, and included a graphic equalizer so they could simply hook it up to a regular amplifier and dial in the perfect sound. When they couldn\u2019t find such a device, they decided to build their own. The build is based around a Raspberry Pi Pico, chosen for its feature set that makes it easy to configure as a USB audio device. It\u2019s paired with a Waveshare Pico Audio module, which is based on the PCM5101A stereo DAC and slots neatly on top of the microcontroller board. An SPI-controlled LCD screen was also fitted in order to display the graphic equalizer interface that [shiura] whipped up. The project write-up explains the code required to implement the equalizer in detail. A four-channel equalizer was possible on the original Pi Pico (RP2040), while upgrading to a more powerful Pi Pico 2 (RP2350) allowed implementing eight channels in total. If you\u2019re looking to build a digital audio system with the ability to do some equalization to suit your listening room, this might be a project of interest to you.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Apple's iPhone 17 lineup was the clear driver of smartphone growth during China's \"Singles Day\" shopping festival, according to new industry data. Apple was the top-selling smartphone brand throughout this year's month-long Singles Day period in China, accounting for 26% of all smartphone sales, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research shared by Reuters. Overall smartphone sales rose just 3% year-over-year, and Counterpoint says the iPhone alone prevented the market from seeing what would otherwise have been a 5% annual decline. Counterpoint's data indicates that demand for \u200ciPhone 17\u200c models was particularly strong throughout the festival, which ended on November 11. The rebound continues a trend seen over recent months, during which Apple has steadily outpaced the wider Chinese smartphone market after years of cooling demand. Data provider Syntun told Reuters that total Singles Day sales across all major e-commerce platforms reached 1.70 trillion yuan ($240 billion), up from 1.44 trillion yuan last year, which had a shorter promotional window. In its most recent earnings call, Apple said it anticipated what could be its strongest December quarter on record.  Huawei recorded the steepest decline among major brands, with its share dropping to 13% from 17% a year ago. Its new flagship Mate 80 launched too late to participate meaningfully in the festival. Xiaomi held the second-largest share with 17%, though its sales also declined year-over-year due to the earlier release timing of the Xiaomi 17 series. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"The EU has begun looking into whether Apple Maps and Apple Ads should be designated as \"gatekeepers\" and subject to greater regulation (via Reuters). The App Store, iOS, and Safari were classified as gatekeepers two years ago, triggering strict requirements in the EU such as support for alternative app marketplaces and third-party payment options. Under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), any platform with more than 45 million monthly active EU users and a market valuation above \u20ac75 billion is presumed to be a gatekeeper, subject to obligations designed to curb self-preferencing and increase interoperability. The European Commission has now confirmed that \u200cApple Maps\u200c and Apple Ads satisfy the user-base thresholds that mandate a review. Regulators now have 45 working days to decide whether either service should formally join Apple's existing list of designated platforms. If confirmed, Apple would then have six months to bring each service into full DMA compliance. Apple has apparently already submitted formal rebuttals arguing that the criteria should not apply. The company argues that Apple Ads represents only a \"minimal share\" of the EU online advertising market, especially compared to dominant players such as Google, Meta, TikTok, Microsoft, and X. Apple also insists that its advertising business neither relies on cross-service data privileges nor exerts the level of market influence implied by the DMA thresholds. The company is making similar arguments regarding \u200cApple Maps\u200c, claiming that the service has \"very limited usage\" in the EU relative to Google Maps and Waze. Apple says Maps does not provide the kind of \"critical intermediation functionality\" that would allow it to act as a dominant gateway between businesses and consumers. A gatekeeper designation for Apple Ads could have significant consequences. Compliance may require Apple to loosen restrictions introduced under App Tracking Transparency, provide interoperability for third-party ad networks, or eliminate any perceived self-preferencing advantages. For Maps, it is unclear what specific operational changes the DMA might require, but obligations could include expanded third-party access or reducing any privileged integrations within the system. iOS 18.4 already enabled the ability to change the default maps app from \u200cApple Maps\u200c to alternatives like Google Maps or Waze in the EU.

How Nordstrom aisles are spaced so they seem quiet, but spawn swarms of people carrying the branded bags. How many teenagers \u2014 a gaggle of boys! \u2014 are here on a school night, actually shopping, loaded with bags. As a teen, Thomas had worked and hung out at Ross Park Mall. Now it's where she does reconnaissance as a retail expert. Part anthropologist and part oracle, Thomas leads the Kearney Consumer Institute, a think tank inside a consulting firm used by some of the biggest retailers and brands. Her job is to divine what our shopping habits tell us about our economy and our future. \"Are you shopping today just for fun? Holiday shopping?\" Thomas asks a woman carrying bags from Madewell, J.Crew and White House Black Market. She learns it's a bit of both \u2014 the woman has a new pleather jacket for herself and sunglasses for her daughter. As Thomas peers into her crystal ball \u2014 a muddle of government and corporate data, surveys and research, things she sees and hears from shoppers and retail workers \u2014 she has put her finger on a new driving force of the American shopper. \"What it actually all goes back to is control,\" she says. \"They're trying to figure out what they can control in a world where they feel a sheer loss of control.\"                  Shoppers walk around Ross Park Mall. Retail spending continues to grow, even as consumer sentiment hovers near historic lows.                                                           Nate Smallwood\/for NPR                                       hide caption  Lurched from a worldwide pandemic into surging inflation, then tariffs, a historic government shutdown and an unstable world order, people are finding agency in their own spending. And it's changing how they shop this holiday season and into 2026. \"I'm calling it the frugal consumer,\" says Thomas. Not frugal in the old-fashioned penny-pinching and reusing-grandma's-tinfoil sense, she explains, \"but I mean, we're seeing exhaustion that extends far beyond the wallet. Where am I spending my money, my time, my energy \u2013 how am I distributing that in a world that has felt so exhausting lately?\" The longing for control and agency shows up in different ways. There are the shopper boycotts \u2014 think of the crises at Bud Light and Target, among the biggest ones in recent years. There's the refusal to pay higher prices for name-brand groceries as shoppers of all incomes switch to store-brand items they never used to buy, including chips and candy. And there's a growing shift in aesthetic. The pandemic had us cocooning in neutrals and comfy-cozies, fueling the millennial obsession with \"quiet luxury,\" beiges and pastels. But now color and maximalism have roared back into our homes and closets, with bold prints and plushies dangling on purses. \"We want to be loud. We want to be individuals. We want to feel seen,\" Thomas says. \"I've even heard from employees in this mall,\" she says, gesturing down the festively lit, echoey hallway, \"people are spending on the 'wow' piece, not the basic \u2014 something fun.\"                  Colorful water bottles are on display at Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh. Bright tones and bold prints are starting to edge out the popularity of muted colors and pastels.                                                           Nate Smallwood\/for NPR                                       hide caption  Splurging on the \"wow\" piece is difficult to slot into the common narrative about the American shopper: that consumers are cautious, on edge, tightening their budgets. That's because two seemingly contradictory things are happening in the economy. Consumer sentiment \u2014 a gauge of how people feel about the financial situation in the U.S. and in their own homes \u2014 is near the lowest it's been since the pandemic. Yet retail spending continues to grow, with holidays expected to set another record. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts our holiday spending will, for the first time, top $1 trillion. Thomas's forecast is less exuberant, but still higher than ever. \"I think we often miss the psychological piece of it,\" she says. \"It's not just where are consumers spending their dollars? It's the why and the how.\"                  Thomas is interested in the psychological motivation that drives shoppers.                                                           Nate Smallwood\/for NPR                                       hide caption  The \"why\" right now is the season of celebration and gift-giving, a search for joy as a reprieve from the dim economic outlook people tend to share with pollsters. And shopping offers a tinge of control and normalcy: Thomas found that in the depths of pandemic shutdowns, going out to shop was among the top things people reported missing the most. And the \"how\" right now has to do with who's shopping and with what money. Most of the spending has been propped up by wealthier people, many of whom might be invested in the strong stock market or seeing the value of their homes rise. But others are shopping, too. While it's been harder to find a new job in the past several months, unemployment is not skyrocketing, and wages have been growing faster than inflation. Still, there's a caveat. Shoppers are being choosy and laser-focused on deals, as retailers from Walmart to Macy's to Dick's Sporting Goods have repeated all year. \"Guests are choiceful, stretching budgets and prioritizing value,\" Target executive Richard Gomez told investors last week. For the holidays, Thomas is noticing shoppers second-guessing and skipping some of the extras \u2014 just one more stocking stuffer or a little treat as a self-gift \u2014 that people might have dropped into their baskets without much thought during the late-pandemic shopping sprees.                  Thomas is noticing a pullback on some of the extras among shoppers this holiday season.                                                           Nate Smallwood\/for NPR                                       hide caption  Thomas's gut-check-the-extras theory quickly proves itself on her recent stroll through Ross Park Mall, as she talks with the shopper carrying Madewell and J.Crew bags. Shea Harmison, who's visiting from West Virginia, thinks about how her holiday spending might differ this year. \"I'll probably just try not to buy as much nonsense stuff,\" Harmison says. \"Not spending money on things that I don't think are going to be useful or they might not use\u2026 Stuff to buy just to buy, you know?\" And Thomas predicts \u2014 in a forecast that's shared by online-spending trackers such as Adobe Analytics \u2014 this means stores may have to offer deeper discounts than they'd anticipated this holiday season, to try to shake loose that urge for control.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Cars' headlights have come a long way since charming yet potentially dangerous acetylene headlamps debuted in vintage automobiles. The later halogen headlights are still around, but the world has since moved on to high-intensity discharge (HID or xenon) and\u00a0light-emitting diode\u00a0(LED) headlights, both of which possess advantages over the old-school halogen bulb. Modern LED lighting technology is better in almost any aspect than HID, but there are variables to consider. LEDs sip less energy to produce a brighter light output and, in most cases, they last tens of thousands of hours and may never need replacing during the car's life. Moreover, LEDs are bright the moment you turn them on, while HIDs need a few seconds of warming up to deliver their full potential. But are LEDs really better than HIDs? Considering that 75% of 2023 car models have standard LED headlights, why on earth did only 51% of new cars tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in 2025 have highest-level Good ratings in headlight tests? IIHS didn't consider whether the cars had halogen, HID, or LED lights in its testing, but it should have, if only to find a definitive answer to whether LEDs are indeed better. In our book, LEDs are better than HIDs, but we're referring to original-equipment or stock LED headlights with dedicated housings and electricals, since aftermarket LED upgrades are shoddy at best when fitted inside reflectorized headlight housings\u00a0not designed to accommodate new-age LED bulbs. And why, you might ask, are we stopping you from slapping on those Amazon-bought LED headlight bulbs you got cheap? First, they may be illegal to use on public roads, since \"no LED light source is currently permitted to be used in a replaceable bulb headlamp,\" says the\u00a0National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (If you insist on going the LED route, note that the Department of Transportation doesn't regulate fog lights and fog lamp bulbs, so they could be legal when in compliance with state and local laws.) Secondly, there's some science to back up an aftermarket-LED ban, since reflector headlights are designed to focus light from a 360-degree light source like halogens or HID bulbs. Aftermarket LED bulbs only have chips on specific points of the assembly, and this creates glare or dark spots when illuminated in a reflectorized housing. Unless manufacturers come up with LED bulb designs that resemble HID and halogen bulbs' omnidirectional capabilities, retrofitting them inside a reflector housing just won't work.\u00a0 The storyline changes if your car has projector headlights, since LEDs are more suitable in a projector housing to distribute light evenly without unsightly glare.\u00a0However, conversion could prove tricky since aftermarket LED bulbs have large heat sinks at the bottom, which might interfere with installation. Those light-emitting chips in an LED bulb may emit less heat than halogens or HIDs, but their electronics produce a lot of heat, necessitating heat sinks or fans. Yeah, LEDs are stomping all over HIDs for all the right reasons, but HIDs do have stellar points to consider. HID headlights outperform other bulbs in brightness and range, and they come in many color temperatures from candlelight yellow to white to blue and even purple.\u00a0Then again, the only\u00a0road-legal headlight colors for\u00a0cars in the U.S. are white and yellow, so keep that in mind.\u00a0 Nevertheless, HIDS are more energy-efficient than halogens, and they're not as hot as glowing halogen bulbs. They also last longer than halogens, with some reaching up to 5,000 hours before burning out. HIDs don't last as long as LEDs, but they have a longer lifespan than halogens. The other question here is the cost. Halogen bulbs are the cheapest, typically costing $10 each. LED headlight assemblies on most new cars are the most expensive, and the cost can reach thousands if there's damage and replacing the entire headlight is necessary. However, aftermarket LED bulbs are not that expensive and typically cost around $27 to $50 per pair. HID headlight bulbs are the middle ground, typically going for\u00a0$50 to $200 per pair before labor costs but not needing that big price bump if repairs are required.","label":0}

Portable power stations solve critical problems across seasons, providing backup electricity during winter power outages while enabling summer camping trips and outdoor events requiring modern conveniences far from outlets. The good news is that the Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W) power station costs $349 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from the $429 recent pricing\u2026 and dramatically reduced from the $799 launch price still visible on Jackery\u2019s official website. This record-low makes serious backup power accessible at costs approaching battery banks lacking the capacity to run actual appliances. See at Amazon The ability to fully charge in just one hour through emergency mode activated by the Jackery app changes the way you prepare for storms that are expected or restore backup power during short windows of grid restoration. When weather forecasts give you little notice or rolling outages don\u2019t give you enough time to recharge between power cuts, traditional power stations that take 6 to 8 hours to fully recharge leave you vulnerable. In regular mode, the system automatically sets the charging time to 1.7 hours to maximize battery life for everyday use. The 1,500W continuous output and 3,000W surge capacity can handle real household appliances like window air conditioners that keep rooms cool during summer blackouts, full-size refrigerators that keep food fresh during long winter outages and electric kettles that keep hot drinks hot when gas stoves aren\u2019t available. This level of output sets apart serious power stations from big battery banks that can only charge phones and power LED lights. The 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery gives essential appliances a practical amount of time to run without the huge capacity and cost of whole-home backup systems that cost thousands of dollars more: A full-size refrigerator can run on a single charge for about 13 hours, a laptop can charge 20 times, and LED lights can run for days before needing to be charged again. This sweet spot for capacity strikes a balance between usefulness, portability, and cost, avoiding both too-small units and too-large systems that cost too much. With three AC outlets, two USB-C ports with 100W Power Delivery, one USB-A port, and one DC car port, this device can charge a wide range of devices, from big appliances to small electronics, without needing more than one charging solution. The 100W USB-C fast charging works with modern laptops and tablets at full speed without the need for power adapters that make emergency kits bulkier. The 23.8-pound weight and foldable handle make it easy to carry from room to room during power outages or load it into a car for camping trips without the weight that makes bigger power stations stay in one place. The Jackery app lets you manage power smartly by letting you choose a charging mode: These modes include emergency fast charge, quiet overnight charging (which runs at a whisper-soft 30dB), and energy efficiency mode which optimizes consumption based on the loads that are connected. The real-time monitoring shows power draw, estimated runtime, and battery health through smartphone interfaces that make management easier than basic LCD displays. Amazon\u2019s aggressive market positioning means that this portable power station costs less than half of what Jackery is asking for it on their website, even though the Black Friday price is $349, which is a record low. This deal makes advanced portable power available at prices never seen before, so you can get it before the stock runs out.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth More than $16 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options are set to expire on October 31, 2025, at 8:00 UTC on Deribit. This marks one of the largest monthly crypto derivatives events of the year. This expiry surpasses last week\u2019s $6 billion event due to the monthly rollover of October contracts. Traders and investors should closely watch max pain levels and positioning, both of which could impact short-term price action. Today\u2019s expiring options are for the month, which makes them significantly higher than the $4 billion seen last week. Bitcoin is trading at $91,389\u00a0as of this writing, heading into expiry, while the maximum pain point sits at $100,000, suggesting the market is heavily skewed toward the upside despite recent turbulence. At this strike price, option holders will experience the most losses. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s price tends to move toward the max pain zone as expiry nears, a result of market makers hedging their positions. During this expiry, 145,482 contracts worth $13.28 billion will close. The put-to-call ratio is 0.54, signaling more traders are betting on gains than on losses. Nevertheless, Deribit data\u00a0shows\u00a0that the call open interest of 94,539 contracts exceeds put open interest at 50,943. According to analysts at Deribit, the recent market pullback played a critical role in shaping positioning. They say traders who were long puts took profit (TPd) when Bitcoin hit the $81,000 to $82,000. \u201cAfter a 35% plunge from $126,000, Put longs TPd vs $81,000-82k while still keeping cautious protection v long Spot BTC with 80-85k Strikes. But the dominant trade of the week was a bullish EoY Dec 100-106-112-118k Call Condor initially 12k, ~$6.5m premium, looking for a Santa rally,\u201d wrote Deribit analysts. This large call condor, an options structure designed to capture upside within a defined range, has been the standout trade both in size and sentiment. 2) Initially buying started v 865xx, and up to 88k for the original 12k blocks, with follow-on copycat and buybacks adding 2.5k volume in the same strategy.If running to expiry, the buyer targets 100k+ by Dec26, with an ideal final settle between 106-112k, with 10:1 max payoff. pic.twitter.com\/cR2e9Yvpho Such aggressive end-of-year positioning suggests that, even after the correction from all-time highs, a subset of traders is still betting on a strong rebound in December. At the same time, other market participants have been actively capping upside through overwriting strategies. \u201cHidden beneath the Call condor volume were persistent and familiar Call over-writers on the Dec100k and Jan 100-105k Calls. These and the general relaxation of downside fear have dampened IVs, but with RV still performing and 2-way Put (+spread) action, much is inconclusive,\u201d the analysts wrote. Overall, BTC\u2019s options board shows a tension between long-dated bullish conviction and near-term caution. These conditions often set the stage for heightened volatility in the settlement window, which is 08:00 UTC on Deribit. Ethereum is trading at $3,014, with a max pain level of $3,400 for today\u2019s expiry. The asset has 387,010 calls open versus 187,198 puts, totaling 574,208 contracts and a put\u2013call ratio of 0.48. ETH options account for $1.73 billion in notional value, making it the second-largest component of today\u2019s expiry. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH\u2019s positioning is less extreme. The downside skew is lighter, and open interest is more evenly distributed across major strikes. With traders watching ETH\u2019s consolidation relative to BTC, much of today\u2019s influence may come from whether Bitcoin volatility spills over into the broader market. With billions in open interest unwinding, liquidity conditions could shift quickly across both BTC and ETH. If spot prices drift toward max pain levels, market makers may exert dampening effects; if volatility spikes, these expiries could act as accelerants. Either way, today\u2019s settlement arrives at a pivotal moment, with traders split between defensive hedging and bold year-end bullish bets.

We are not responsible for them in any way.  Will China lead the way on basic income, too? If you apply \"old school\" industrial automation to a partly manual process, then getting 40% more worker productivity is hardly surprising.  China, despite its rapid growth, is still in the final stages of industrializing.  There's still lots of efficiency to be had.  The US has been putting robots in factories since the 70's, so most of the low hanging fruit is already automated. Also, beware what people are calling AI.  In the industrial automation space, every vendor has been calling their product \"AI\" for the last 5 or 10 years.  When you press them on it, it's often no more advanced than a PID controller or a few if\/then statements.  Our plant is more willing to take on new ideas than most, but the only real AI that I've seen installed on a plant floor over the last decade were some advanced vision-enabled picking systems.  I'm sure someone has hooked an LLM to a plant-floor system somewhere, but I've not seen it yet.  Nor have I seen a humanoid robot or a robot dog pay for itself.  Even cobots only have mediocre uptake (but we are using them). And finally, take stories out of China with a grain of salt.  Yes, there's massive industrialization going on there, and the engineers working there are smart and motivated, but the government interferes heavily in the market.  For instance, I've heard first-hand accounts from people on business trips there, where a truck was offloading several brand new CNC milling machines at a manufacturer, and the story was that these were just machines that the government had purchased and provided the company with the idea, \"here, put these to good use.\"  There's constant top-down subsidies being handed out, and it results in huge over-production problems.  There are parking lots full of brand new EVs that dealers have written off because they can't sell them all.  There are fields of solar panels producing power that can't get to market because there isn't enough local demand, and the power lines to the major centers aren't big enough to support the whole load. Agree to all of that. While, say, a machine-learning enabled gripping tool is \"AI\" in some sense, it is not the current hype AI, but an entirely different breed that you can actually rely on, no hallucinations or other crap. The other thing is that China tries to push its industry, and for good reasons. But eventually, this will need to be reduced and then they become another regular player. The question is who of the other players will be left standing at that time. It will not the ones that maximize short-  ... then see how well your economy performs when you have mass civil unrest. And all the tech bros who BS about paying people to do nothing using AI profits - yeah, people on benefits always find constructive things to do with their time, they never get depressed due to lack of purpose and end up on drinks, drugs or in prison. How come my brother had a good corporate job, but it just made him so depressed he killed himself? humans automate everything, then get wiped out. yet the robots just keep going. \"Nobody is going to redistribute wealth [...]\" What if you print the money or get it from a sovereign wealth fund (same as the rich do), and index the economy fully so nominal inflation becomes invisible (as Israel did successfully for decades)? If you are working and resent others who don't work but have the option not to work yourself, and if you keep working but you pay nothing for non-tax-funded basic income because your wages are inflation-proofed (COLAs), will you have any reason to be resentful anymore  We all know China is only competing successfully with us by using slave labor. Why would they need robots? Whether you want to call it AI or not, the reality is China is rapidly automating its manufacturing and has been for a while. In that environment, if you are building a new factory are you going to design it around human workers or robots?  There is a danger in believing your own propaganda. We are saddled with existing legacy technology, legacy companies and the legacy jobs associated with them. China is not worried about \"lost\" jobs because they are still producing a lot of new jobs. Not enough of course, but they see  robots as moving them ahead faster, not looking back over their shoulders to see if they are catching up. You can define AI any way you like, but the reality is China is implementing it broadly across their economy. In the United States its controlled by a small number of legacy companies with limited existing business models to replace or protect. And an existing monopolies to maintain.  We all know China is only competing successfully with us by using slave labor. Why would they need robots?Because the Uyghurs have too much support from the various global NGOs.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"THE NOTIONAL VALUE TRAP Foreword Just as growth in the \u201creal\u201d economy of material products and services has been decelerating towards contraction, so aggregates of financial wealth have carried on increasing relentlessly. Since the widening disequilibrium between the monetary and the material must eventually crash the financial system, the probability is that notional wealth will reach its peak at the same moment at which the monetary system collapses. We can see this unfolding effect in microcosm in the United Kingdom, where the most recent official calculation put national \u201cnet worth\u201d at a near-record \u00a312.2 trillion, or 450% of GDP. Yet you don\u2019t need SEEDS analysis to know that the British economy itself is at an advanced stage of disintegration. Two key factors explain the apparent paradox between soaring wealth and the onset of increasingly chaotic economic decline. First, every failed effort made to stem material economic decline using monetary tools increases wealth, as it is measured financially. Second, most of this wealth is purely notional, in the sense that none of its aggregates are capable of conversion into material value. Put another way, very little of the world\u2019s supposedly enormous wealth actually exists in any meaningful sense. A very possible final scenario is that, after an initial correction caused by a dawning realization of economic crisis, asset markets will rebound to a last peak before entering outright collapse. To make sense of these issues, we need a clear understanding of the nature of money and wealth in relation to material economic supply. 1 As many readers will know, there\u2019s no great mystery about the ending and reversal of material economic expansion. Briefly stated, the \u201creal\u201d economy of physical goods and services is only proxied \u2013 and with ever-diminishing fidelity \u2013 in the published aggregates of financial flow. Far from being a measure of the supply of material value to the system, gross domestic product is nothing more than a summation of transactional activity taking place in the economy. It\u2019s perfectly possible, indeed commonplace, for money to change hands without any material economic value being added. The way in which material value is supplied to society is, in principle, comparatively straightforward. In a continuous process of creation, consumption, disposal and replacement, energy is used to convert other natural resources (including minerals, non-metallic mining products, biomass and water) into products, and into those artefacts and infrastructures without which no worthwhile service can be supplied. This is a dual equation in which, as energy is used for the conversion of raw materials into products, so energy itself is converted from a dense to a diffuse state. This makes energy-to-mass density, and the portability of energy, important considerations in the resource conversion process of economic supply. Given that energy is used in the creation, operation, maintenance and replacement of energy-supplying infrastructures, we can state that \u201cwhenever energy is accessed for our use, some of this energy is always consumed in the access process, and is not available for any other economic purpose\u201d. This proportionate \u201cconsumed in access\u201d component is measured in SEEDS as the Energy Cost of Energy. ECoEs have long been on an exponentially climbing trend, and have risen from 2.0% in 1980 to 11.3% today. Renewables, and for that matter nuclear power as well, cannot materially slow, let alone reverse, the relentless rise in ECoEs caused by the depletion of oil, natural gas and coal. Neither can technology halt this trend, since the potential of technology, far from being infinite, is bounded by the limits imposed by the laws of physics. The other determinant of the supply of physical economic value is the rate at which non-energy raw materials are converted into economic value through the use of energy. This conversion ratio is on a gradually declining trajectory, because resource depletion is occurring at a rate slightly more rapid than that at which the broad swathe of conversion methodologies can advance. On this basis, global material prosperity has grown by 25% since 2004, which is nowhere near claimed \u201cgrowth\u201d of 96% in real GDP over that period. Moreover, the 25% rise in aggregate prosperity has been matched by the rise in population numbers over those twenty years. The ongoing rate of deceleration is such that aggregate material prosperity is projected to be 17% lower in 2050 than it is now, which is likely to make the \u201caverage\u201d person about 31% poorer than he or she is today. At the same time, the costs of energy-intensive necessities \u2013 including food, water, accommodation, domestic energy, essential transport and distribution \u2013 are rising markedly. The \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d, far from being the temporary phenomenon that the word \u201ccrisis\u201d is intended to imply, is a firmly established trend. Since all of these process are both knowable and incapable of being \u201cfixed\u201d, why is monetary value continuing to increase? The answer lies in the fundamental nature of money, and of how the monetary relates to the material. 2 As we know, no amount of money, irrespective of its format, would be of the slightest use to a person stranded on a desert island, or cast adrift in a lifeboat. If this castaway had an extremely large amount of money, his or her only (and very dubious) comfort would be the prospect of \u2018dying rich\u2019. That\u2019s an appropriate analogy for a world destined to experience financial collapse at the moment of record paper wealth. The financial system, like our castaway, is going to \u2018die rich\u2019. There\u2019s an instructive twist that we can add to the narrative of the castaway. At his or her greatest extreme of privation, a package is seen descending on a parachute. Opening this package with avid hopes of food or other life-saving material supply, the castaway finds only very large quantities of banknotes, gold coins and precious stones, all of which are wholly valueless in his or her predicament. Decision-makers in society have made this exact same mistake, pouring huge amounts of money into a world whose deficiencies are material. They have done this, not out of idiocy or dishonesty, but because, whilst they cannot be seen to be \u2018doing nothing\u2019, no other possible policy response exists. Governments and central banks can create money and wealth in almost limitless quantities, but they cannot similarly conjure energy, or any other material resource, into existence at the touch of a key-stroke. The essential point, of course, is that, as our castaway swiftly discovers, money has no intrinsic worth. It commands value only in terms of those physical goods and services for which it can be exchanged. Money is thus an \u201cexercisable claim\u201d on the material. Warren Buffett alluded to this when he said that \u201c[t]he way I see it is that my money represents an enormous number of claim checks on society. It is like I have these little pieces of paper that I can turn into consumption\u201d. Various conclusions follow from this principle of money as claim. One of the most important, as regular readers will know, is the imperative need to think conceptually in terms of two economies. One of these is the \u201creal\u201d economy of material products and services, and the other is the parallel \u201cfinancial\u201d economy of money, transactions and credit. Another is the absolute futility of any attempt to explain the economy by disregarding the material and concentrating entirely on money. This fallacious line of thinking leads inevitably to the deranged proposition of \u2018infinite, exponential economic growth on a finite planet\u2019. 3 None of this means, though, that money is \u201cunimportant\u201d, or that a collapse of the financial system would have no adverse consequences for material economic prosperity. The most effective approach to economics doesn\u2019t involve the disregard of the material or of money. Rather, what we need to do is to calibrate the physical economy such that we can benchmark the monetary against the material. This enables us to avoid the futility of measuring the monetary only against itself. It\u2019s true that, at the moment when the monetary system collapses, we will still have the same amounts of the energy and other natural resources which are the basis of material economic prosperity. But money is a critical enabler in the processes by which we use energy to convert raw materials into products, artefacts and infrastructures. This is why not even the poorest person can view the impending collapse of the financial system with equanimity. Without money, how can nations trade products and resources, and how can the individual conduct his or her daily affairs? Since money \u2013 unlike energy and raw materials \u2013 is a human construct, it\u2019s perfectly possible, at least in theory, for us to create a new (and perhaps more intelligently-designed) form of money to replace the old. But the chaos that monetary collapse will cause is hardly capable of over-statement. 4 Within our overall understanding of the principle of money as claim, money itself divides into two functional categories, which are the flow of money in the economy and the stock of monetary claims set aside for exercise in the future. This \u201cstock of claims\u201d further subdivides into two components. One of these is immediate money, which can be spent without having to go through any preliminary enabling process. Most of this \u201cimmediate\u201d money exists as fiat currencies, since it\u2019s difficult to buy our groceries or pay our electricity bills using precious metals or cryptocurrencies. But by far the largest component of the stock of claims is inferred rather than immediate. This \u201cinferred\u201d money exists as stocks, bonds, real estate and numerous other asset classes. Before this claim value can be spent, it must be monetised \u2013 converted, that is, from an inferred to an immediate state. This means, simply stated, that the assets which comprise inferred value must be sold before they can be spent. 5 The aggregates of these inferred forms of wealth are enormous. Global stock markets, for instance, currently stand at about 160% of world GDP, which is far higher than this metric was in 2007, on the eve of the global financial crisis (114%). Total debt is about 240% of global GDP, and broader financial assets, in those countries which report this information, are about 470%. If, to these, were added other asset classes, including real estate, promised pensions, precious metals, cryptos and derivatives, we could undoubtedly calculate that global wealth is at all-time record highs. All of this is a very far cry from the oil crisis years of the 1970s. In 1975, stock markets equated to only 27% of world GDP. At its nadir, in January of that year, the S&P averaged just 72.6, from which point the index has advanced almost continuously \u2013 with few and brief interruptions \u2013 to a level today of about 6850. Fig. 1 This has, in fact, been a near-uninterrupted, fifty-year progression. This road from \u201conce-in-a-lifetime cheap\u201d to the vastly higher valuations of today certainly merits some reflection. It transpires that very little of this accession of paper wealth has happened by accident. Starting in 1975, the initial advance in stock markets did follow processes that can be ascribed to market forces alone. In that year, the astute investor had little to lose, and much to gain, by putting his or her money, itself subject to severe inflation, into stocks. Together, an economic rebound from the oil-crises-slump of the 1970s, the gradual taming of inflation and the euphoria created by the policies of the new \u201cneoliberal\u201d incumbencies combined to help to drive markets sharply higher during much of the \u201cdecade of greed\u201d of the 1980s. But everything changed in October 1987. On \u201cBlack Monday\u201d, the markets crashed, with the Dow losing 508 points, or 22.6%, in a matter of hours. What was really significant, though, was that the authorities stepped in to shore up the markets. One of the most important players was the Federal Reserve, which had itself been created in 1913 in response to another such crash, the Knickerbocker crisis of 1907. 6 The authorities might well have been wise to have intervened as they did in 1987, but, in doing so, they conveyed the strong impression that, if ever things once more went badly enough wrong, they could again be counted upon to ride to the rescue like the fabled 7th Cavalry. This back-stopping \u2013 variously known over the years as the \u201cGreenspan put\u201d, the \u201cBernanke put\u201d, the \u201cYellen put\u201d or, more generically, the \u201cFed put\u201d \u2013 remained implicit until 2008. Then, with the swift, no-holds-barred response to the global financial crisis, the authorities made their support for the market explicit. Some felt at the time that these interventions were necessary and proportionate, others that they \u201cbailed out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street\u201d. Both points of view had their shares of validity. But the most astute observers fretted instead about what is called moral hazard. In the normal course of events, as envisaged by free market purists, the authorities do not intervene in the markets. If things go well, the wise (or simply fortunate) investor makes big profits but, if things go badly, the reckless (or unlucky) investor gets wiped out. Thus the antithetical forces of \u201cfear and greed\u201d are kept in balance. Intervention dangerously upsets this balance. An investor rescued once naturally assumes that, if things go badly enough wrong again, another bail-out is certain to follow. This provides an enormous incentive to risk-taking, and undermines the important restraint exercised, through prudence, by fear. 7 Behind all of this, though \u2013 and seldom noticed by observers \u2013 lies the fact that all \u201cvalues\u201d routinely ascribed to wealth aggregates are fundamentally bogus. At no point can any of the reported aggregates of wealth be monetized. The only people to whom the stock market could ever be sold in its entirety are the same people to whom it already belongs. The same applies to the global or national housing stock, and to every other asset class. Whenever we\u2019re told that huge amounts of value \u2013 in October 1987, for instance, $1.7 trillion \u2013 have been \u201cwiped out\u201d by a market fall, we\u2019re being asked to disregard the fact that at no point, either before or after the event, could the whole market have been sold at its supposed value. The same applies to any statement of how much wealth billionaires have \u201cgained\u201d through rises in the market. The \u00a312.2tn official calculation of British aggregate \u201cnet worth\u201d is similarly meaningless, in the absence of anyone who actually has \u00a312.2tn to spend (and is also daft enough to invest it in Britain) The fatal error made here is that of using marginal transaction prices to put a \u201cvalue\u201d on aggregate quantities of assets. We might think that, were all global stock markets to fall to zero, about $180tn of wealth would have been eliminated. In fact, that supposed \u201cvalue\u201d was only ever notional, and never existed in any meaningful form in the first place, because at no point was it ever capable of monetization. 8 This inability ever to monetize even a significant proportion of this inferred wealth enables commentators to write lurid, fact-free articles about aggregate wealth being \u201cdestroyed\u201d or \u201cboosted\u201d. But it also enables the authorities to pursue their cherished \u201cwealth effect\u201d without much danger of all of this largesse being converted into immediate monetary value, and then spent in ways that trigger runaway inflation in the economy. Central banks\u2019 use of QE is a case in point. So long as this liquidity injection was contained within the capital markets, it could not cross the boundary into spendable money and trigger severe inflation. During the pandemic of 2020, though, when QE was channelled not into the markets but directly to households, severe consumer price inflation did indeed follow. 9 What we have been exploring here is a paradox that is no paradox at all. The world will keep setting new wealth records until the financial system collapses. Investors have lived with supportive intervention from the authorities ever since 1987, which means that very few of them have ever experienced anything else. Throughout this period \u2013 and certainly since official support became explicit in 2008 \u2013 the \u201cmomentum trade\u201d has been the only game in town. It\u2019s been like gambling in a casino where the house stacks the deck in favour of the punter. So ingrained has this thinking become that there are likely to be many still determined to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d even as the financial system goes finally into the blender. This, in short, is why wealth is destined to collapse \u2013 swiftly, not gradually \u2013 from an all-time peak. Our necessary insight here is that, since any value contained in money exists only as a \u201cclaim\u201d on a material economy that is now contracting, there must come a point of fatal disequilibrium between claim and substance. The sheer scale and complexity of the aggregates of claim stock are now so extreme that the authorities will be powerless to backstop the next big crash. It\u2019s scant consolation to know that these enormous aggregates never, in any meaningful sense, actually existed in the first place. Thus understood, it might not seem to matter all that much if aggregate (and individual) values collapse. Your house, for instance, will still fulfil its essential function of providing somewhere to live, even if its supposed value slumps from $1m to $200k. Even if you\u2019d decided to sell at the highest price, buying a replacement would have been equally costly. But this comfort only applies if you hadn\u2019t used the property as security for a large mortgage. And the financial system as a whole has done exactly that. The entirety of the system is enormously cross-collateralized, and this is where the destruction of \u201cmeaningless\u201d aggregate asset values becomes enormously meaningful. The real comfort, if any is to be found, is that anyone who can find a way of preserving value will have the opportunity of buying utility value at pennies on the dollar. The term \u201cutility\u201d is the watch-word here, because essentials will remain essential even as society is picking over the wreckage of discretionary sectors. Fig. 3 Max Kaiser on Fiat Collapse and Bitcoin I\u2019ve Never Seen ANYTHING Like This\u2026 \u2013 Max Keiser Bitcoin This is worth reading for those of us who see energy as the motive force in an economy (or a plant or animal or human brain).  Because Kaiser isn\u2019t much concerned about energy.  His claim has been, for as long as I have known him,  that \u201ca Ponzi can\u2019t be tapered\u201d.   The first thing I saw on the internet this morning was Scott Bessant claiming the everything in the US is \u201cperfect\u201d, having recovered from the terrible days of Joe Biden.  The second thing I saw was Sean Foo showing with data that everything is falling apart.  What Keiser brings to the party is the claim that we are watching the collapse of a Ponzi\u2026a Ponzi goes up with intermittent dips but then collapses.  So, like the blind men and the elephant, people can always find some data somewhere which supports their claim. Among other predictions, Kaiser predicts the end of nation states.  Given their current behaviors, how much would you be willing to spend to support your nation state? Don Stewart David! Hideway explained it better than me, today on undenial (with regard to Tim Watkins article): \u201cHe goes a long way in describing all the worlds problems, then comes up with MMT as a part solution. Let\u2019s leave money totally out of the situation entirely for a minute, so yes another fairy tale world. Humans all get along and trust in barter and each other. We mine and produce everything we do today. We have increasing population, increasing energy cost of energy and lower grades of all the ores we mine. Providing we increase total energy extracted, metals and minerals all is well as the increase in overall production and efficiency gains in the increasingly complex world are still overcoming the increase energy used in both energy gathering and ore grade decline. We reach a point where the energy production increases and efficiency gains cannot overcome the increased energy costs of energy collection and the lower ore grades. People on average start to have living standard declines. We reach another point where total energy gathered starts to decline. The energy cost of energy is still going up, while the ore grades are still declining, living standards start to accelerate their decline. The civilization as a whole can no longer maintain the vast complexity it had so starts to lose the most complex aspects, that are also the most expensive in energy and material terms. A lot of these complex aspects are used in the food, energy and material gathering sectors, so without them or as their availability declines, so does the efficiency of those sectors. Production rates of energy, food and materials decline rapidly making everyone worse off, and the feedback of less energy, materials and food accelerates the continued decline in complexity, which leads to more rapid decline in production as in reinforcing the feedback loops. At some point the falling living standards cause social problems, which have their own feedback loops of less production of complex aspects. Some critical tipping point is reached in the process and production of everything reliant upon any complexity collapses, civilization over.. All without any money, no matter what form or whether it has growth attached to it or not. I notice that Tim Watkins assumes a new money system after collapse and vastly higher death rates. He somehow assumes we will still be able to mine metals minerals and energy as if all the machinery and parts we need to do this were available somewhere. They wont be, so no recovery except for a few local areas based on local tools, mostly hand tools that physically exist to do basic farming, for those that survived the collapse and aftermath of collapse. There will be no need for any \u2018money\u2019, until humans try to re-establish trading with other groups, possibly generations down the track. Most likely gold and silver. This of course assumes we don\u2019t starve ourselves to extinction by eating every mammal we can catch during the collapse, which IMHO is possible. Money is not the problem or solution, there is no solution, money is just what we humans conjured out of thin air so we had something tangible to trust the word of other, unknown to us, humans.\u201d Saludos el mar \u201cWe reach a point where the energy production increases and efficiency gains cannot overcome the increased energy costs of energy collection and the lower ore grades. People on average start to have living standard declines.\u201d I agree!! but not everywhere uniformly, it will vary by country and region, with Europe leading the way with declining living standards. \u201cWe reach another point where total energy gathered starts to decline. The energy cost of energy is still going up, while the ore grades are still declining, living standards start to accelerate their decline. The civilization as a whole can no longer maintain the vast complexity it had so starts to lose the most complex aspects, that are also the most expensive in energy and material terms.\u201d I agree!! Europe first, maybe in the 2030s, USA\/Canada maybe 2050s, China\/Russsia maybe 2070s. the end of IC is absolutely certain. the West can go pedal to the metal over the cliff, but I am sure China\/Russsia are doing everything they can to separate their economies from the West, which will enable them to continue IC in Asia for many more decades. https:\/\/un-denial.com\/2025\/11\/09\/ai-on-collapse\/comment-page-2\/#comment-115000 Thanks, interesting. \u201cGiven the cumulative constraints we have discussed\u2014the\u00a0fast biophysical collapse\u00a0(5-10 years to hit the Net Energy Cliff), the\u00a0collapse cascade\u00a0(financial failure leading to urban anarchy), and the\u00a0permanent degradation of the ecological resource base\u2014the likelihood of total human extinction is\u00a0low, but the likelihood of civilization\u2019s collapse and a severe, multi-century population bottleneck is nearly 100%.\u201c from the beginning stage of \u201cbiophysical collapse\u201d to the end stage of the \u201ccollapse cascade\u201d could be many decades. it would have been even more informative if AI was asked if China\/Russsia working together could extend their IC even as the West hits this \u201ccollapse cascade\u201d. I think so. China\/Russsia surely see all too well how they need to disconnect from the West to enhance their chances of retaining IC longer. Thought About Money Consider a wooden wagon pulled by a mule.  What makes the wagon move?  Is it the mule straining it\u2019s muscles to get access to the stored energy which came from the food with carbon bonds which ultimately came from photons from the sun? Or is it the axle grease which reduces energy resistance and allows the wheels to turn on the axle? If we see money as axle grease, it\u2019s evident that both energy and the grease which reduces energy resistance are essential. Don Stewart The proper analogy in your mule example is that money is the roundness of the wheel.  Money is an immaterial concept that helps organize transactions of goods and services. Roundness is the immaterial characteristic of the wheel that helps it roll. \u201cYou can print all the money or create all the credit you want, but try stuffing paper bills down your gas tank and see how far you go.\u201d? JPM is calling for Brent in the $30s by late 2027. https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/G6ikU81aEAALOtr?format=jpg&name=900\u00d7900 DRF is calling for Brent in the $60s by late 2027. If that happens, the breakdown won\u2019t take long. Even the integrated oil producers like Chevron and Exxon can\u2019t break even at $30.  Production will plummet. What is DRF?  JPM is probably JP Morgan, a bank, but when I look up DRF the most common answer is Daily Racing Form. DRF, my initials, is a weak attempt at humor. oil staying around $60 sounds reasonable. David, implicit in your belief is that oil production will decline gradually. The modern economy is an oil phenomenon. If oil were to cease abruptly the whole edifice collapses, almost overnight. Everything that we have is dependent on oil; the present population of ~8 billion, food production, shelter, transport, all subsidised by oil. Until now. Oil is running out, not because the deposits are exhausted but because the oil is becoming inaccessible in energy terms i.e. the whole system energy cost of extraction greater than the energy value obtained. If there is no energy return on oil, it can\u2019t be extracted and might as well be on the moon. This is a scenario for an abrupt change, not a gradual transition, like an engine that runs out of fuel, chuntering along until it stops. Of course, one can argue about the meaning of \u201ccollapse\u201d and \u201cabrupt\u201d in the context of a vastly complex social economy but it is clear that the timescale will be a lot quicker than the rise of the oil age. \u201cOil is running out, not because the deposits are exhausted but because the oil is becoming inaccessible in energy terms i.e. the whole system energy cost of extraction greater than the energy value obtained.\u201d this is wrong, according to the very site you are posting on. average oil is now produced at 11% ECoE, the other 89% of the energy within the oil is freely available to run IC, which it is still doing very well as can be seen by OUR abundance and prosperity which we share with a few billion other people. \u201cIf there is no energy return on oil, it can\u2019t be extracted and might as well be on the moon. This is a scenario for an abrupt change, not a gradual transition, like an engine that runs out of fuel, chuntering along until it stops.\u201d I disagree, ECoE is slowly rising, about 0.5% per year, and when daily oil volumes begin to decline, I expect a similar slow rate of decline, at least for a decade or two, definitely NO abrupt drop in the 89% surplus energy from oil. \u201cOf course, one can argue about the meaning of \u201ccollapse\u201d and \u201cabrupt\u201d in the context of a vastly complex social economy but it is clear that the timescale will be a lot quicker than the rise of the oil age.\u201d true! the rise in surplus energy flowing through IC has been ongoing for 300+ years. the end could reasonably be expected to be 30 to 50 years from now. in my opinion. David, it is the thermodynamics of the whole system that is determining, not bits of it. I disagree. it is the thermodynamics of FF that have come to matter by far more than anything else to determine the productivity and prosperity of humans. 89% freely available energy to run IC, that is not \u201cbits\u201d. what other thermodynamics matter much at all? there was a discussion here the other day about the massive energy equivalent to human labor within one barrel of oil. Buckminster Fuller long ago realized that we have 100 \u201cenergy slaves\u201d to work for each of us daily. even 50% ECoE oil will still provide massive economic value. 11% ECoE now and rising 0.5% per year, oil has a few decades of massive value ahead. surplus energy dominates the world. There are other ways of looking at that, David. A bbl of oil contains, as human labour equivalents, multiple thousands of dollars of energy value \u2013 so why aren\u2019t we prepared to pay more than $60 for it? I think of it like this. We offer somebody a brand new Maserati for $500, which is an incredible bargain, but he turns us down \u2013 why? \u2013 Maybe he simply doesn\u2019t have $500 \u2013 Maybe  he couldn\u2019t afford to run it, even if he got it for free \u2013 Maybe somebody has already offered him a Ferrari for $400. \u201cA bbl of oil contains, as human labour equivalents, multiple thousands of dollars of energy value \u2013 so why aren\u2019t we prepared to pay more than $60 for it?\u201d in my opinion, your metaphor doesn\u2019t help to see more clearly the reality of the oil markets. I know oil doesn\u2019t sell always and everywhere for the WTI and Brent prices that can be read daily. there are discounts that sellers offer for lower quality oil, and premiums that buyers will pay for higher quality oil. as far as I know, every single barrel of oil gets sold. the buyers pay enough and the sellers sell. the oil markets seem to be working very well lately, and perhaps have worked well no matter what the price. I would guess that oil will remain in this low-end price range of about $50 to $80 for the rest of this decade, and production will be barely lower by 2030. time will tell. Global Oil Depletion | Alister Hamilton A British academic interviewed on Planet Critical.  They have applied the thermodynamic model used by Hill\u2019s Group to the North Sea, Norway, and Alaska (places where the data is available).  Basically, the UK passed the boundary where new oil becomes a drain on energy rather than a source of energy a decade or so ago. I think that what they are identifying is the point at which oil which has a positive energy return peaks.  It doesn\u2019t mean that existing wells will stop producing.  AI and other methods of extracting more of the oil in the ground may still be economical, which may extend the decline phase.  If declining oil and natural gas are inconsistent with a debt fueled economy, then bad things will happen.  Don Stewart \u201cThe proper analogy in your mule example is that money is the roundness of the wheel. Money is an immaterial concept that helps organize transactions of goods and services. Roundness is the immaterial characteristic of the wheel that helps it roll.\u201d Exactly right Joe, and thank you Don, for pointing out that BOTH (energy and money) are ESSENTIAL. And what \u201cgave\u201d us the wheel?  Human intelligence -applied.  \u201cThe laws of thermodynamics do not allow for de-growth\u201d. \u2018To grow OR not to grow\u2019, seems to be our TOTAL fixation. What about re-grow? Isn\u2019t this what life is all about. If life runs into a dead-end, it figures out a novel way of getting out of it. Furthermore, lets not forget the \u201cgrowth\u2019 we are referring to is nothing more than gaining \u2018numbers stored on a computer\u2019, and de-growth is \u2018loosing numbers\u2019. Is that stupidity, all we are capable of? Is it not time for a \u201cnew wheel\u201d? \u2026..Now that our Debt based \u201cmoney\u201d system, combined with declining energy, has reached a dead end. \u2026..After thought. Life has done a pretty remarkable job of \u201cgetting out of dead ends\u201d, over the last 13 billion odd years. It\u2019s certainly not going to stop any time soon! As David likes to say, \u201cit\u2019s nothing to worry about\u201d humans did a pretty remarkable job of surviving for tens of thousands of years before IC. they can give it another try after about the year 2100 or so. \u201cWhether they will manage 2000km on a tank depends entirely on the size of the tank\u2026\u201d Not true, as by your own admission, HEV\u2019s are essentially EV\u2019s, so the range ultimately depends on the continuous improvement of the \u201cmagic\u201d that happens within the cells of the battery, not the fuel in the tank! Roundness of Wheels, etc. This structured my thinking about wheels and travois (lash some poles together and drag them to move weight) and axle grease: \u201cEnergy. @MitoPsychoBio and I began this conversation series by asking what energy is and how its resistance shapes biological function, perhaps even health itself. Next week on X Space, we\u2019re excited to have Alan Cohen ( @cohenaginglab), co-director of @cusciofhealth introduce us to an emerging framework: Intrinsic health. How do energy and information shape the state we call health, and do their dynamics help us define it more clearly? Join us next Tuesday at 12 PM ET. See you there & join in on the discussion! Drop your thoughts, questions down below \u2013 let\u2019s shape the conversation together.\u201c You can find the tweet on Martin Picard\u2019s X site.  He uses a triangle consisting of energy, structure, and information.  If we look deeply into physics, we can find scientists who think that everything is energy.  Matter is simply frozen energy.  Some think information is energy.  I\u2019m not qualified to pontificate on the definition of energy, other than to accept the common statement that it is the ability to do work.  I would describe thermodynamics as the science of the ability to do work.  Exactly how we conceptualize the different manifestations of energy and label them depends on how deeply into energy we want to delve.  One psychologist I know who wanted to use energy to explain a lot was warned that \u201cscientists don\u2019t know how to define energy\u201d.  Lacking Parkinson\u2019s \u201ctotal integrated concept\u201d, we resort to what is useful. The Plains Indians in the US either did not think of wheels or else did not have the technical ability to make them and use them.  They did, however, know about friction\u2026and they used travois.  Martin Picard and company have floated the idea of \u201cenergy resistance\u201d as a key role in the construction of physical bodies.  For example, a photon originating in a distant galaxy doesn\u2019t experience time until it hits resistance (time doesn\u2019t exist at the speed of light).  But the resistance it encounters has some mysterious relationship to the original explosion of energy in the Big Bang. When it comes to \u201cPeak Ability to Do Work In An Industrial System\u201d, we can do worse than to count the ability of fossil fuels to do work.  What the Hill\u2019s Group and the similar work done for the North Sea tells us is that the ability to do work in an industrial system has already peaked in many countries.   How that relates to the money system is that what the economic system is ultimately able to pay for is net work capacity.  If the net work capacity in an industrial system has peaked, then it will decline\u2026rapidly or slowly.  Financial concepts such as 50 year mortgages or perpetual fiscal deficits are incompatible with the concept of peak net work capacity.  We can still trade existing oil and gas and the infrastructure which uses energy from oil and gas to do work, but the idea of \u201cforever\u201d has to be seen as a mirage.  Wars motivated by the fight over control of what remains are likely.  Collapse of the debt based financial system seems to me inevitable.  I\u2019ll not rule out a conversion to nuclear\u2026but time is probably not on our side. Don Stewart Don \u2013 have you tried https:\/\/greenpt.ai\/ \u2013 Barry Thanks, I will check it out. Don Stewart Art Berman: The Nuclear Golden Calf Art shows us financial payback curves for nuclear which are consistently negative in the West, and barely breaking even in Asia.  If recent history in the US (e.g. Plant Vogtle in Georgia) is any indication\u2026it\u2019s money down the drain.  I don\u2019t completely rule it out, but I wouldn\u2019t bet on it either. Which brings up a point I should have made about Hill\u2019s Group and similar efforts.  I said we have passed the point at which new oil and gas will yield a positive return \u201cin an industrial economy\u201d.  But how to define an \u201cindustrial economy\u201d?  Hill\u2019s Group got around that by using a time series of oil prices and measures of economic activity.  It\u2019s like looking at the Keeling curve and concluding that humans are never going to willingly restrict the use of hydrocarbons. Logically, history doesn\u2019t prove that something which has never happened before won\u2019t happen in the future.  But it should make us skeptical about relying on \u201cmiracles\u201d.  One apparent miracle was featured recently in Inside China Business.  China has make vast fish farms under floating solar panels.  The solar panels absorb more energy than surfacer water which tends to reflect sunlight.  The increased energy in the water under the panels results in more fish..which can be harvested to feed humans. That\u2019s the sort of innovation that peasant farmers would learn to use.  An example I read years ago was the digging of trenches in Ukraine to gather solar energy and increase crop yields.  The city of Paris had elaborate gardens which served to feed the people.   So those of you who are justifiably skeptical about anything I say should be asking: \u201cbut can\u2019t we change the definition of \u2018industrial'\u201d?  I think the answer is \u201cyes\u201d.  But the next generation is going to have to get busy. Don Stewart \u201cWhich brings up a point I should have made about Hill\u2019s Group and similar efforts. I said we have passed the point at which new oil and gas will yield a positive return \u201cin an industrial economy\u201d.\u201d the average ECoE is now about 11%. new oil and gas will definitely be higher. even 22% ECoE on new FF resources would add lots of surplus energy to \u201cIndustrial\u201d Civilization. surplus energy dominates the world. David if ECOE goes to 22% then that means 22% of all human output and effort is going towards energy extraction and the rest of the civilization is only using 78% of all human effort and output. If we assume the population and total energy have both grown over this period along with much greater efficiency\/technology gains, to more than compensate for the lower percentage of energy available for \u201ceverything else\u201d, is the only way for there to be more surplus available.  We\u2019ve been doing this for decades, with efficiency gains declining as we have used up all the easy ones.  Plus hidden in the background is lower mineral and metal grades, deeper deposits, more remote locations and harder ore indexes, that make the situation much worse, as more of the declining energy has to go there. It\u2019s not a simple linear increase in ECOE that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s really an exponential problem as one whammy is rising ECOE, with the other metal and mineral problems being a multiplier to the simple ECOE number. The background rate for copper production (as in for a constant amount mined) is 1.1% p.a. increase in energy required to mine a tonne of copper, but that is only for the 2003-2013 period where Calvo and Mudd et al measured.  It\u2019s an exponentially increasing number, which means basing anything off just a single input of ECOE will underestimate the rate of change in energy available for the rest of civilization (Sorry Dr Tim)\u2026 As they state in the ads, but wait there\u2019s more!! With less energy available for the \u2018everything else\u2019 sector, the complexity of this has to fall. It\u2019s a simple law of physics. However we require the total range of our complexity, as in the entire system to function normally, to mine the lower grades of metal and mineral ores and the oil and gas remaining.  This brings with it a third multiplyer or a cubing of the acceleration of the combined problems.  So once energy gathering starts to fall instead of grow, especially oil, then we rapidly get into a cubing of the downslope percentages, or put simply, rapid collapse. It\u2019s the same in every complex system that operates on myriads of inputs, they all collapse at the end with the largest of any type collapsing fastest. You\u2019re correct, there is nothing to worry about, it\u2019s inevitable\u2026  \u201cDavid if ECOE goes to 22% then that means 22% of all human output and effort is going towards energy extraction and the rest of the civilization is only using 78% of all human effort and output.\u201d to be clear, I meant to say that adding 22% ECoE of \u201cnew\u201d oil and gas would be far better than not adding any. 78% surplus energy freely available to do other things is still fantastic. but yes, as well as ECoE rising, FF production declining will reduce surplus energy further, and diminishing returns on all other resources, not just FF, will take an ever-larger portion of the surplus energy. \u201cAs they state in the ads, but wait there\u2019s more!! With less energy available for the \u2018everything else\u2019 sector, the complexity of this has to fall. It\u2019s a simple law of physics. However we require the total range of our complexity, as in the entire system to function normally, to mine the lower grades of metal and mineral ores and the oil and gas remaining.\u201d the short-term mitigation for this is that complexity will be gradually reduced by a growing unaffordability of discretionaries. There is massive non-essential complexity that will be shrinking year after year. \u201cSo once energy gathering starts to fall instead of grow, especially oil, then we rapidly get into a cubing of the downslope percentages, or put simply, rapid collapse. It\u2019s the same in every complex system that operates on myriads of inputs, they all collapse at the end with the largest of any type collapsing fastest.\u201d the complex system of IC has humans who will not just do nothing, there will be a continual downsizing of discretionary complexity, not voluntary for most people, and this continual economic adjustment has a very good chance of preventing rapid collapse. otherwise, I don\u2019t see that IC has to undergo rapid collapse everywhere all at the same time. national borders are strong barriers. if there is to be some rapid collapse, I expect it in the energy poor countries and regions first, such as Europe. and last in Asia, mostly due to vast Russsian resources. I expect the first severe economic downturns to be in Europe in the 2030s. In a complex economy, David, a very high proportion of available energy is required for system upkeep. My analysis suggests that the rise in trend ECoE from 2% in 1980 to 5% by 2004 was enough to put an end to growth in the West. Now, with ECoEs above 11%, growth in most EM economies, too, has come to an end. ECoE is on course to reach 13% by 2029. Growth has already gone into reverse, and we\u2019re faking \u201ccontinuity\u201d using credit expansion and huge fiscal deficits. We are now at the point of inflexion, and we can\u2019t \u201ctaper a Ponzi\u201d. David, Dr Morgan\u2019s previous point about the oil price and subsequent analogy illustrates the financial symptoms of the gathering collapse. Oil is absolutely vital to the modern social economy and therefore priceless, so why has the price been falling for years when output per capita is flat to declining? I look at thermodynamics. I\u2019ve always said that it is the total picture that must be considered (hence, I do not believe, to paraphrase, that complex conversion contraptions return the total energy converted to construct them). Louis Arnoux & his associates have spent many years looking at the total picture and I think you should look at their conclusions. In order to extract oil a vastly complex real economy of energy conversion is required, not just that of the immediate oil infrastructure. This has been explained by Hideaway many times here. Once stasis is reached this interconnected support starts to disintegrate piecemeal and thus the ability to continue is negated by a debilitating cascade of shutdowns. Arnoux describes it as a self-organising criticality, like an avalanche. It\u2019s the old idea of \u201cfor want of a nail\u201d made manifest. I take your point about discretionary contraction but simplification is operating against the very complexity that maintains the present total system. The situation can\u2019t be compartmentalised. Perhaps all we are discussing here are timescales. I tend to think these will be fairly short, moreover, unless politicians fess up, unexpectedly brutal by the 2030\u2019s. Exactly as I see it, Dr J. Dr J, yep\u2026 David, I continually asked Brandon on these threads what he would call discretionary items. Is it computers, I phones, lawn mowers, cruise liners, cars, passenger jets, etc, etc yet never received an answer. This is because there is none, because the parts in all of these are also the same types of parts in mining trucks, farm tractors, semi-trailers dragging food to cities, ships, oil rigs, etc, etc.. We only have the complexity of our machines because of the scale of the market for billions of parts put together in a vast variety of arrangements. If you get rid of half the uses, then you can\u2019t maintain all the separate factories. It\u2019s not like you can close down half and the other half will make everything available. That\u2019s not how the world works, plus would take nearly as much energy anyway, so no real savings.. People forget we have one civilization, not many separate bits of civilization. You can\u2019t hand wave away the incomes of 80%+ of the people in discretionary fields and expect no social consequences, nor can you put them to work in the essentials fields as that lowers the efficiency of those essential areas anyway. Less complexity is guaranteed with less energy, which has a myriad of feedback loops that further deteriorate efficiencies in a spiral downwards. No-one has to believe it, but you will live it when it happens\u2026      Perhaps all we are discussing here are timescales. This is absolutely correct for those who think that collapse (and dieoff) is inevitable. Even DRF thinks it\u2019s coming, just more gradually than others. (There are those who think that if there is enough political will, industrial civilization can be saved and the ecosphere protected. I am not one of them.) David is in good company though. Greer, the Honest Sorcerer, and others think it will take decades or even centuries for the winding down of industrial civilization. Greer discusses \u201ccatabolic collapse\u201d at length in his many publications. He believes that by scavanging from previously built infrastructure it will be possible to slow down the rate of complexity decline and ensure that collapse happens more gradually. I\u2019m in the fast-collapse group. I have yet to see any realistic plan for gracefully rewinding technological complexity. I think the old saw about our \u201csawing off the lower rungs of the technological ladder\u201d as we have adopted newer technologies is correct.  We\u2019re not going to be able to revert to landlines and fax machines instead of the internet, for example, especially in an energy constrained economy. We\u2019re not going to replace freeways with light rail or trolly systems, refrigeration with ice boxes, heat pumps or gas furnaces with wood stoves, combined cycle powerplants with simpler steam engines, electric light with gas lights, etc., etc. Perhaps others here have seen papers on how technological complexity can be simplified gradually. If so, please let us know. \u201cDavid, I continually asked\u2026 would call discretionary items. Is it computers, I phones, lawn mowers, cruise liners, cars, passenger jets, etc, etc yet never received an answer. This is because there is none\u2026\u201d in my opinion, that is a blatannt and grosss exaggeration. some IC discretionaries: hospitals, all expensive drugs, lawn mowers, vacuum cleaners, cruise liners, yachts, passenger planes, most airports (not military), all arts\/supplies\/materials\/equipment, all music (AI music!!) and instruments, concerts, theaters, arenas, stadiums, sports teams and leagues, personal sports equipment, radios, TVs, books, magazines, hotels motels bars restaurants, racetracks, amusement parks, fashion, cosmetics, hair care products and equipment, razors, eyeglasses, contacts, advertising, insurance\u2026 most of these could be considered good by some people, and will not go away voluntarily, but will gradually go away due to the relentless decline in affordability of modern life. There is currently a lively discussion about \u201ccrowding out\u201d.  Capital is being dissipated by investments in data centers and speculation in AI companiy stocks.  The trillions which the bubble wants to devote to Ai and data centers is not available for less sexy investments which might actually create more economic activity involving both production and consumption. Your list of \u201cdiscretionaries\u201d provide an income for some people.  If there is a popping of the debt bubble, we are likely to see a replay of the Great Depression and the collapse of governments. If that happens, I simply don\u2019t know how it could happen slowly and with any finesse.  The collapse of the Soviet Union gave us a glimpse into how a country rich in resources could suffer from malnutrition and drinking oneself to death. Don Stewart forgot education, the other huge mostly non-essential along with medical. most schools are not essential. beyond basic math and reading and writing, IC probably only needs a few % of people to be educated for engineering, computers, communications, electricians plumbers\u2026 professions not essential for IC include most teachers and professors, doctors and nurses, lawyers, economists, journalists, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, artists\u2026 there is a good chance that IC will eliminate most non essentials and become a bare bones civilization. then things will get worse.  \u0394 ","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"It's hard to find home office furniture that looks great at a palatable price. That's why you'll find Branch's products among our top recommendations in many of our guides. Whether it's an office chair or a standing desk, the company's products look good, work well, and are reasonably priced. That makes its Black Friday Sale of the Year all the more appealing. From now through December 3, you can snag 15 percent off sitewide at branchfurniture.com, and 20 percent off bundles (like if you pair a desk and chair together). You may need to make sure you add code BFCM to your cart, though it should be there automatically. Not sure where to start? I've tested several Branch products over the years; here's what's worth the cash. Check out our Absolute Best Black Friday Deals for more bargains. Updated November 28: We've mentioned Branch's daily doorbuster deal and vetted prices. Branch Branch Amazon The Container Store This is my top recommendation for most people in my Best Office Chairs guide. There are dozens of cheaper chairs on the market, but it's hard to find an option under $500 that's comfortable and highly adjustable while also being attractive and offering various style options (Branch now even offers it with boucl\u00e9 upholstery). The headrest is optional\u2014I don't think you need it\u2014but you can adjust the seat depth, the lumbar support can be aligned and pushed inward, and you can tilt the seat forward, too. Branch Branch Amazon On a tight budget? You won't find a better chair at this $300 mark. The Ergonomic Chair has many of the same adjustment points as the Pro, including seat depth, and has a similar design. Some of those finer adjustments aren't available, like pushing in the lumbar or the upright seat tilt. It generally won't keep your back as upright as possible, but if you like to recline a bit, this is a great buy at this price. Branch Branch Amazon I think the Branch Ergonomic Chair Pro is the better buy, but the Verve is arguably more stylish. It doesn't have all the adjustment capabilities as the Pro, and my biggest gripe with it is the fixed arms. It's comfy, but not a great option for folks who need a wider seat. Branch Branch Like to cozy up in a chair on a crisp fall day and read a book? That's pretty much what the Softside feels like. The arms are fixed, and they box you in, and there's not much to adjust on the chair, but it's very cushy and comfortable. It's decently built for the money, but if you're prone to back pain or generally want to improve your seating experience, you may want to look at the ergonomic options above. Branch Branch I've tested several active chairs, and I don't think they're worth the money. The experts I spoke to also said you're better off just going for a walk than spending your time on one of these wobbly chairs. However, don't think of Branch's Saddle as an active chair or as \u201cposture-improving.\u201d Just think of it as a really nice stool. I like how the sides slope down, allowing your thighs to rest on them; it's one of the most comfortable stools I've tested. You may not want to spend hours on the Saddle, but if you're at a desk for a short time, this is a nice alternative, and it takes up very little room. Branch Branch Standing desks can be a little ugly due to their standard T-shaped legs. This Branch Four Leg Standing Desk breaks the mold with an attractive design that makes it look like any other desk. The telescoping legs have motors that smoothly move the desk up and down Branch Branch Amazon West Elm Branch says it'll have a special doorbuster deal each day over the next few days, and on Black Friday itself, the Duo earns the honor of a 25 percent off discount. You'll see the full discount in your cart. It's a great compact desk if you're limited on space, though the company now has more size options. I like that Branch has several accessories tailor-made for this desk, including the desk tray, desk hook, headphone stand, desk perch, and even a drawer. Raising and lowering the desk via the paddles is easy, but setting up the height presets can be clunky. Branch Branch Amazon A desk for your laptop, this Branch Adjustable Laptop Stand is our top recommendation in our Best Laptop Stands guide. It can lift your screen as high as 7 inches above the desk, can be adjusted to almost any viewing angle, and it's sturdy, so the laptop doesn't bounce or shift during use. Adjusting the angles and height requires a bit of effort, but that just makes it more stable. Outside of desks and office chairs, Branch has several accessories to kit out your workstation. It also doesn't just sell its own goods on its storefront. You can find items from other smaller companies as well. Here are some other goodies I've tested and like that are also on sale. Branch Branch Why fish around for outlets underneath your desk when you can have them readily accessible on the desktop? Branch's Clamp-On Power is an easy add to any desk or shelf. You get three AC outlets, a USB-A port, and a USB-C port. It's UL-certified, has a six-foot cord, and comes in black or white. Branch Branch West Elm The Container Store If you need to store physical files or just want some under-desk storage for various odds and ends, the Small Filing Cabinet from Branch doesn't take up much room. The wheels make it easy to place in a room, and assembly doesn't take very long.  Branch West Elm You might need a large empty space for this desk caddy because it's much bigger than it looks, but it's also amazingly attractive. There are four little areas for your pens and pencils, then a cavernous room for notebooks and papers you want to store on the front and back. It's like a toolbox for your desk! It's made from aluminum with a white oak handle and comes in several fun colors.  Branch (Standard) Branch (Lowdown) Branch (Midi) Mustard Made's metal lockers are on the pricey side, but they're fairly easy to assemble (just a little time-consuming). I've tried several sizes and designs of these lockers, and they're stylish! There are several colors you can choose from, and there's plenty of space inside to house all your home office gear (aka board games). Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Last year, Apple opened up its MagSafe standard to the Wireless Power Consortium, allowing third party companies to officially utilize MagSafe \u2013 at up to 15W. Earlier this year, the standard expanded with Qi2.2, making 25W MagSafe charging available to third party manufacturers.  Many manufacturers have come to market with fantastic 25W Qi2.2 chargers, and this ESR model is one of them. For Black Friday, you can get this ESR 3-in-1 for just $89.99, making it one of the more affordable Qi2.2 options on the market. First and foremost, this charger is a 3-in-1, so you can charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all on one convenient charger. I\u2019ve been using it as my primary desk charger, and it\u2019s great. Other 3-in-1 chargers tend to offer a design where the Apple Watch and iPhone are side by side, which is fine I suppose. It just takes up more space. With the ESR offering, the Apple Watch charger is behind the MagSafe ring, making it pretty low profile. You can also separate the Apple Watch charger if you\u2019d like to, that way you can plug it into a MacBook or such for a simple charge. Another great detail is the fact that the ESR 3-in-1 includes a 50W charging brick and USB-C cable in the box \u2013 which isn\u2019t always the case. Everything you need simply comes with the product. I\u2019d say the best thing about this charging is the built in cooling, which ESR calls CryoBoost. To reach peak 25W speeds while wireless charging, your phone can easily get too hot. However, this charger combats that with its built in fan.  Overall, if you\u2019re in the market for great MagSafe chargers for your iPhone, this ESR 3-in-1 is a nice option to add to your desk or nightstand for quick 25W charging. It\u2019s all inclusive, fast, and works like a charm.  An iPhone 16 or iPhone 17 model is required to take advantage of Qi2.2. You can pick up the ESR 25W CryoBoost 3-in-1 for $89.99 on Amazon for Black Friday. It comes in black and white, though the white variant is currently more expensive.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":" By Joe Wilkins    \t\t\t\t\tPublished\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\tNov 28, 2025 6:45 AM EST\t\t\t\t  With so much AI buzz coursing through the air these days, there are plenty of sensationalist claims about the tech\u2019s affect on the job market. One prevailing narrative \u2014 and arguably the driving financial incentive behind AI \u2014 is that AI is set to automate everyone\u2019s jobs, or at least a huge portion of them. Whether that would be for better or worse is another question, as scholars have observed that mass joblessness combined with monopoly capitalism isn\u2019t exactly a recipe for utopia. Still, more optimistic voices \u2014 those of tech CEOs, investors, and other market players \u2014 argue that AI automation will kick off an era of unimaginable prosperity for humankind.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, for example, seems to think AI productivity gains will completely change everyone\u2019s relationship to work in the near future. Unlike some of his fellow tech billionaires though, Huang says AI will leave everyone with more work than ever. At the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington DC this week, Huang said that \u201ceveryone\u2019s jobs will be different\u201d as AI ushers in a wave of new business concepts and projects. \u201cIf your life becomes more productive and if the things that you\u2019re doing with great difficulty become simpler, it is very likely because you have so many ideas you\u2019ll have more time to pursue things,\u201d the CEO suggested. As an example, Huang pointed to radiologists, who he says are now \u201cmore efficient\u201d workers thanks to AI, processing more scans than ever before. (In reality, increased workloads are likely the result of a massive shortage of trained radiologists in the US, the kind of crisis which privately owned AI companies hope will bring immense profits.) Also in attendance at the conference was Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who with his characteristic wit suggested work will be optional in the future, like sports or video games are today. \u201cIf you want to work, you know, in the same way, you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables or you could grow vegetables in your backyard,\u201d Musk explained. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s every evidence that we will be more productive and yet still be busier because we have so many ideas,\u201d Huang responded. \u201cIt is my guess that Elon will be busier as a result of AI. I\u2019m going to be busier as a result of AI.\u201d Whether either mogul\u2019s vision sees reality remains to be seen, but one thing\u2019s for sure: with their immense wealth, they\u2019ll be fine even if the lives of ordinary people are thrown into chaos.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"If you're in the market for a new 2-in-1 Windows tablet, the flagship Surface Pro 11 13-inch is hard to pass up at $699.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Black Friday is here, which means there are some incredible deals to be had on some of the latest PCs and tablets in the PC space. Right now, Microsoft's iPad Pro killer, the flagship Surface Pro 11 (13-inch) is now available for just $699, that's almost half price over its usual $1,199 price tag. You don't want to miss this! Microsoft's flagship Surface Pro 11 (13-inch) is now just $699 and includes a 120Hz LCD touchscreen, 16GB RAM, 256GB storage, and the incredible Snapdragon X Plus chip which balances great performance and efficiency.  Many say that the Surface Pro set the narrative for the 2-in-1 form factor over 10 years ago. Today, the Surface Pro is in a league of its own, with a design that has been fine tuned to almost perfection. It's complete with a built-in kickstand that sits flush with the body, an incredible 120Hz display, and now great performance and battery life thanks to the latest Snapdragon chips. In fact, I'd go so far as to say the Surface Pro was so influential, it eventually forced Apple to change the iPad Pro into something that more resembles a laptop. That's how good the Surface Pro is, and right now it's just $699 for Black Friday. This is Microsoft's own iPad Pro, and if people think the iPad Pro is good, the Surface Pro is obviously better. Especially at this price. Its 13-inch 120Hz touchscreen panel is simply beautiful to look at. While this specific SKU doesn't include an OLED panel like the iPad Pro, it's still a very high-resolution panel with a high refresh rate just like the iPad Pro. It also supports touch and pen, and for $699 it's the next best thing to the iPad Pro's (or higher-end SKUs of the Surface Pro 11) OLED panel. The built-in kickstand is something that Apple has failed to copy, which is just another bonus for the Surface Pro. The kickstand is so useful and versatile, letting you prop the tablet up on any surface (pun intended) whenever you need to go hands free. Paired with a keyboard, and this kickstand transforms the Surface Pro from a tablet into a fully fledged laptop. It also gets all day battery life, and has incredible performance thanks to the Snapdragon X Plus which balances performance and efficiency better than any Intel chip in previous Surface Pro devices.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"The best wireless headphones AND earbuds just came out, but they're now up to 28% off for Black Friday.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  After spending years mixing up AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and Sonos Ace as my go-to wireless headphones and earbuds, I finally gave Sony and Bose a shot in 2025. I tried the Sony WH-1000XM6 and WF-1000XM5, and even the latest AirPods Pro 3 for good measure. But none could hold a candle to Bose's second-generation QuietComfort Ultra headphones and earbuds. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones and earbuds only recently came out, but they're already seeing major discounts for Black Friday. You can snag the headphones as low as $399 and the earbuds for only $216 \u2014 I think the latter is the best earbud deal of the Black Friday season. Here's why anyone in the market for new earbuds or headphones should take advantage of these Bose deals. Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 take the best-sounding ANC earbuds and make them even better, with upgrades like wireless charging and improved call quality. They're also the most comfortable and secure-fitting earbuds I've ever worn. At only $216, these are finally cheap enough to recommend for the masses.  Price comparison: Best Buy - $216 | Bose - $249 \u2705Recommended if: you want excellent ANC and sound quality; you need a secure fit and comfortable feel; you want an excellent companion app with custom EQ profiles. \u274cSkip this deal if: you need more than six hours of earbuds battery life on a single charge; you want smaller earbuds; you have the QuietComfort Earbuds Gen 1 already. Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones nail comfort while delivering industry-leading sound quality and top-notch ANC. They fold flat for easy traveling, and support both USB-C audio and listening while charging. These are excellent all-rounder wireless headphones that anyone will love.  Price comparison: Best Buy - $399 | Bose - $399 \u2705Recommended if: you want light and comfortable wireless headphones; you need detailed sound quality and hi-res audio support; you want strong bass. \u274cSkip this deal if: you need headphones that work as a mic in wired mode; you want LDAC-supported headphones; you already have QuietComfort Ultra Gen 1 headphones. We have quite a few audiophiles here at Android Central \u2014 myself, contributor Tshaka Armstrong, and editor Harish Jonnalagadda \u2014 and we all agree that Bose's new headphones and earbuds are the best of 2025. That's high praise, and it goes to show just how good the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones and earbuds are. I've tested all of the best earbuds, but none are as well-rounded as the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2. These earbuds provide standout active noise-canceling modes and the strongest bass I've ever heard a pair of earbuds reproduce. That's all while adding excellent call quality and a surprisingly-comfortable feel. They're on the larger side of wireless earbuds, but intuitive design and extra silicone stabilizers ensure they stay secure in your ears. Up until now, the one gripe I had was with the earbuds' price. At $299, they were ahead of the AirPods Pro 3 and Sony WF-1000XM5. Now, at $216 for Black Friday, they're actually lower than those earbuds at MSRP. It's a similar situation for the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones. I still give a very slight edge to the AirPods Max in terms of raw noise-canceling power, but Bose crushes Apple \u2014 and every other brand \u2014 in the other areas. That's why, for the first time, I brought the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones with me for my Thanksgiving cross-country travel. I haven't been disappointed. They're comfortable, detailed, and compact, with better sound quality and ANC than any pair of headphones not named AirPods Max. At $399 for a limited time, the price is very easier to stomach. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headphones undercut the best from Apple, Sony, Sonos, and other top brands with this deal. So, if you're in the market for a new pair of earbuds or headphones \u2014 or want a great gift idea for an audio lover \u2014 Bose is the way to go.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"After one of her make-up products \"went viral\" on social media, people assumed Zoe Trigwell was an overnight success and a millionaire. The truth was, the business owner was paying herself a small wage to get by having been through a lot of lows. One academic said social media success stories can mask the harsh realities women  in business face, and they lack a platform to complain about how little money they make for fear of looking \"greedy\". The Welsh government said its specialist advice service Business Wales was committed to supporting female entrepreneurs. Zoe, who has two children, started Trigwell Cosmetics in 2020 after her make-up academy business shut during the Covid pandemic. Initially she bought a few products to sell to friends, family and clients, funding them by running online make-up tutorials for \u00a32 a ticket. \"I had no idea... investment was a thing, but I had no idea where to turn to or who to ask. I don't think there's that much information out there on how to actually get investment for small businesses,\" she said. The 31-year-old said when one product went viral in 2022, people wrongly assumed she was an overnight success and millionaire. \"I paid myself a small wage just so that we could live and get by but I didn't take any massive chunks of money, especially in those days when we started go viral, because every single penny that was made had to be reinvested to keep up with the demands,\" Zoe said. She said she feels that there's a lot of pressure for female founders to be perfect and to always make perfect decisions \u2013 something she tries to challenge online. \"It's really, really important, especially for people that are wanting to become entrepreneurs, to show that it isn't all highlights and not everything is rosy, and you don't just sell out instantly.  \"There's a lot of hard work and a lot of downs and negatives that do come with it,\" she said. Entrepreneur Lauren Bell said it took four years before she was able to take a salary from her business, Cosi Care. The 33-year-old created a gadget to help her brother cope with eczema, which he has had throughout his life. Lauren said: \"It's so challenging to get the big cheques. People don't support women. People almost don't believe that women can achieve what men can achieve. \"They see me in a pink suit with a nice Welsh accent, and they just don't believe that you can reach those levels.\" The entrepreneur said that while she's really proud of what she's achieved as a woman in a STEM industry, it's a \"shame\" she didn't have more support in the early days. Lauren, a design graduate, has recently won a million-pound investment and will be moving the entire business to the US soon. \"I'm moving all of our employees there. I'm manufacturing in America and moving everything over to America, which is a real shame, because I did really try and do it in the UK, but there just wasn't the same scale of support for female-owned businesses,\" she said. Dr Sarah Marks from Swansea University agreed business owners are under pressure to present themselves as successful online. \"For people to really be successful and to really consider themselves as a successful entrepreneur, they actually need to be generating quite a lot of income, and my research suggests that actually the vast majority of women do not generate anywhere near what will be a market equivalent income for themselves,\" she said. The lecturer in the school of management said her research showed entrepreneurship often doesn't provide sustainable living for women, with many giving up. \"Women are actually denied a kind of platform in which to complain about how little money they're earning... they don't want to be seen as greedy; they don't want to be seen as ungrateful and that can be a real pressure for women and a real burden,\" she said. A report published last month by the Women and Equalities committee found that female entrepreneurs face significant disadvantages in accessing finances, investment networks and support systems. The cross-party group of MPs found that while numerous programmes have been established to address the issue, they have had limited effect. A spokesperson for the UK government said it was \"putting women at the heart of its grown agenda to make the UK the best place for women-led businesses by tackling barriers and unlocking opportunities for them\". \"The Invest in Women Taskforce has secured over \u00a3500m in funding for women-led businesses over the past 12 months and investment in female entrepreneurs began in August this year,\" they said. The Welsh government said since May 2021, Business Wales had supported 2,301 start-ups led by women which is \"56% of all start-ups supported\". \"The Development Bank for Wales supports female entrepreneurs via many projects, including the Women Angel of Wales syndicate which increases the activity of female angel investors\" they added.

Reading time 4 minutes        There are robot vacuum sales, and then there are Roborock robot vacuum sales. The difference? Few if any competing manufacturers can go toe-to-toe with Roborock when it comes to groundbreaking tech, smart navigation features, ease of use, and overall cleaning performance. Roborock\u2019s Black Friday deals have just dropped, and we haven\u2019t seen this kind of lineup at these kinds of prices since Prime Day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in fact, these might be even better. The range of Roborock cleaning machines that\u2019s available for up to 53% off from now through Dec. 1 extends from the elite flagship Saros 10R autonomous vacuum\/mop combo to the wizardry of the F25 GT, a standup model that tackles dry dirt and wet messes at the same time. If you\u2019re ready to upgrade from a lumbering traditional push vacuum to an robotic vacuum\/mop combo, or from an older or lower-tier robot to one that truly checks off all of the cleaning and autonomous performance boxes, Roborock\u2019s Black Friday sale is their biggest and best sale of 2025. No, you\u2019re not looking at a robot vac that\u2019s hopelessly stuck on a threshold between rooms, although that is a logical assumption to make considering how commonly that happens. This is Roborock\u2019s Saros 10R, and it\u2019s making quick work of that bump in the road thanks to its AdaptiLift chassis, which enables it to scale obstacles over 1.5 inches tall. Other obstacles like shoes, charging cables, dog toys, or anything else left on the floor are handled by its industry-best StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 intelligent navigation, with superior mapping and obstacle recognition abilities that make the Saros 10R perfect for homes with lots of people and\/or pets, or ones with a convoluted layout. This 38% off Black Friday deal is your best chance to bring all of the advanced features of the Saros 10R into your home for an outstanding price. It\u2019s just $999, or a savings of $600. See Roborock Saros 10R at Amazon The Roborock F25 GT is, as you can see, not a robot. But it\u2019s far more than your traditional standup vacuum \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u2019s a wet-dry powerhouse (and possibly one of the best vacuum mops in 2025) that brings 20,000Pa of suction to bear on dry dirt and debris and a streak-free wet vac with a roller that spins at 450 RPM to eradicate both wet messes and the watermarks that can mar an otherwise clean floor. Best of all, it does both with one stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no more doing the dry vac and then having to go back for the wet stuff. The Roborock F25 GT can also lay completely flat to reach beneath furniture, and it comes with SlideTech 2.0 upgraded maneuverability to make your job of guiding it along your floors easy. Put the F25 GT back on its charging base and it also cleans and dries the roller automatically, making it one of the most human intervention-free manual wet-dry vacs we\u2019ve seen. All of this, amazingly enough, comes for just $199 during Roborock\u2019s Black Friday sale. Using the code RRF25GTF25GT, you can save 5% more on this Roborock vacuum mop, meaning you can get it for a record low of $189. See at Amazon A surprisingly common excuse we hear from people still reluctant to make the move to a robot vacuum is that they\u2019re turned off by the idea of having a large, unattractive recharging base messing up their beautifully designed home. Roborock must have heard their complaints when they went to the drawing board and came away with the Qrevo CurvX. The elegantly curved design of the Multifunctional Dock 3.0 and the sleek look of the robot itself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at just 3.14 inches tall it\u2019s Roborock\u2019s slimmest ever \u00e2\u0080\u0094 earn it a place in any home. That and, of course, the fact the Qrevo CurvX is an absolute beast when it comes to cleaning, with 22,000Pa of HyperForce suction and hot-water self-cleaning for its mop heads. Reactive AI Obstacle Recognition and Roborock\u2019s amazing Dual Anti-Tangle System that renders hair and fur knots moot. The Qrevo CurvX is both pretty and pretty powerful, and for Black Friday it\u2019s also a total steal at just $849 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a huge $650 price drop that\u2019s good through Dec. 1. See Roborock Qrevo CurvX at Amazon Every great lineup has one performer who gets it done day after day, yet somehow flies under the radar while the superstars get all the attention. That\u2019s the Qrevo Edge S5A, which earns high marks across the board, but especially for its performance attacking stubborn dust and dirt that clings to baseboards and corners. (Hence the \u201cEdge\u201d name.) The Qrevo Edge S5A combines its potent 18,500Pa of suction power with the FlexiArm technology that allows it to extend its side brush to leave corners and edges as dirt-free as the rest of the floor. The FlexiArm is also part of the mopping process, with the same effect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 corners, baseboards, and edges are left sparkling clean. Already a competitively priced high-end robot vacuum-mop combo at full price, the Qrevo Edge S5A is one of the best Black Friday deals on the board at 45% off, leaving it with a $549 price tag that it vastly outperforms. See at Amazon The biggest discount of Roborock\u2019s Black Friday sale is the massive 53% deal on the Q10 S5+. It\u2019s odd to call this an entry-level price, only because the Q10 S5+ is much more than an entry-level robot vacuum and mop. Odds are the robot vacuum you\u2019d be upgrading from when you buy the Q10 S5+ had a bigger price tag and wasn\u2019t nearly as effective or packed with features. A formidable 10,000Pa of HyperForce suction combined with the Dual Anti-Tangle system makes the Q10 S5+ probably the best $260 robotic floor cleaner on the market for pet owners. That alone is worth the dramatically reduced price of admission, but then there\u2019s the Reactive Tech obstacle avoidance (also great for pet owners since robot vacuums and napping dogs are not a great combination), and the VibraRise 2.0 mopping system. We thought the Q10 S5+ was a great deal at $549, but at just $259, it\u2019s flat-out unbeatable.

Retailers are responding to the affordability crisis this holiday season. In recent earnings calls, Target, Walmart, and Sally Beauty Holding addressed the cratering consumer sentiment and discussed their pricing strategies as the busiest time of year for shoppers approaches. Consumers are feeling the pinch. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped only by a score of 50 in June 2022. Mark Cohen, the former director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said that retailers are responding by investing more in lower-priced items and \"adjusting their assortments\" to give their customers the opportunity to buy from them at a lower price. \"Retailers have been getting more and more promotional for years in the main, but now they're doing it with their feet standing on thin ice because they don't know what to expect,\" said Cohen. \"The last thing they want is to have overhang inventory for the holidays when the season is over, so they have been discounting frantically.\" In Target's third-quarter earnings call, Rick Gomez, the executive vice president of Target, said that because consumer sentiment is \"at a three-year low amid concerns about jobs, affordability, and tariffs,\" shoppers are looking to \"celebrate with loved ones without overspending.\" \"Guests are choiceful, stretching budgets and prioritizing value,\" said Gomez. \"They're spending where it matters most, especially in food, essentials, and beauty, while looking for trend-right deals in discretionary categories.\" \"Given our focus on affordability, we recently lowered prices on thousands of everyday food and essential items to help families further manage their budgets,\" Gomez added. Target is struggling with declining sales and had to cut its profit guidance for the end of the year, but companies that are faring better have similar concerns. In their respective Q3 earnings calls, Home Depot said that \"consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing\" is driving down demand for larger home improvement projects, Lowe's is expecting comp sales to remain \"roughly flat\" due to \"a cautious consumer,\" and Sally Beauty Holdings said it saw shoppers \"leaning into value a bit more,\" especially for those with low-income. \"The disparity in wage growth between those cohorts was as large as it's been in almost a decade,\" said John David Rainey, CFO of Walmart, during the company's Q3 earnings call in reference to the relatively stagnant wage growth for low-income households. \"If pocketbooks are being stretched and consumers are being choiceful and value seeking, it stands to reason, if there's more pressure on the consumer, they're only going to become more so,\" Rainey added, citing the value Walmart provides as a reason why the company is gaining market share in this economic environment. The Federal Bank of New York wrote in its latest report that total household debt has reached a record high this year, totaling $18.59 trillion from July through September. Compared to the end of 2019, before the pandemic, overall debt levels have increased by $4.4 trillion. Not every retail company is feeling equally cautious this holiday season. Best Buy hiked its sales forecast on \"better-than-expected\" sales in the third quarter because of strong results across computing, gaming, and growth in wearables. Gap Inc., in its Q3 earnings call, said that external data points to \"macro pressure on the low-income consumer,\" but the company raised its full-year guidance. Dax Dasilva, the CEO of Lightspeed Commerce, a retail analytics company, told Business Insider that shoppers now are \"highly price-savvy\" and drawn to transparency in pricing and offers that are easy to understand. A consumer sentiment survey from Lightspeed Commerce found that of the 1,500 respondents in the US market, almost one in four of the surveyed individuals said they will use Black Friday only for everyday essentials, such as groceries and household basics, while 13% said they weren't planning to spend at all. \"The brands winning right now are those showing empathy, not extravagance,\" said Dasilva. \"Messaging that celebrates practicality like 'shop smarter,' 'stretch your dollar' resonates far more than indulgent tones like 'treat yourself.'\" Dasilva added that despite low consumer sentiment, sectors like bike, outdoor, sports, and self-care are still performing resiliently, which gives some indication toward what consumers are currently willing to invest in. Jean-Pierre Dub\u00e9, professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said that retailers are developing strategies to offer deals without permanently lowering prices, in fear that this may \"recalibrate consumer price expectations\" to be lower. \"Retailers like promotional discounts because they are temporary in nature, facilitating a necessary price reduction without leading the consumer to expect the lower price to persist,\" said Dub\u00e9. Dub\u00e9 pointed to the rise of the \"everyday-low-price\" model, now widely used by chains like Walmart and T.J. Maxx, which he said is experiencing surprisingly good results because of the guarantee of consistent low prices within a specified period, without needing to wait for a big annual sale. \"Depending on how much inventory retailers acquired for the holiday season,\" Dub\u00e9 added, \"I anticipate some exceptionally aggressive discounts and promotions.\" Jump to","label":0}

Here\u2019s how it works.  The Black Friday Samsung deals are here in full force, but while most shoppers are heading to straight to sites like Amazon and Best Buy, you can win big by heading straight to the source. Pick up the Galaxy Z Flip 7 (256GB version) from Samsung before the Black Friday sale comes to an end and you'll be eligible for up to $600 off with trade-in OR a straight $300 off if you skip the trade-in process altogether. The weird part is that the $300 off discount doesn't always appear. Sometimes the no-trade-in discount appears as $200, but then you refresh the page a few times and an additional $100 is added. For the life of me, I can't figure out what's causing the bonus discount. Is it a bug? An incentive for folks who have used the Galaxy Reserve program? Is it based on region? All I know is that it beats Amazon's Black Friday sale by a full $100, so if you see this record-smashing price drop on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, act on it. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99 From $499.99 with trade-in | $799.99 without at Samsung Head to Samsung during the site's big Black Friday sale and you'll be eligible for up to $600 off the Galaxy Z Flip 7 when you trade in an old or broken phone. Skip the trade-in process altogether and you might get $300 off, which is a record-smashing discount for the popular foldable. Don't see the $300 off? Refresh your page a few times to see if it appears. Buying from Samsung also gets you access to exclusive color variants that you won't find anywhere else! Price check \ud83d\udcb2: Amazon - $889.99 | Best Buy - $899.99 \u2705Recommended if: you want to score a historic discount on an eye-catching clamshell smartphone with powerful performance, a nearly-creaseless build, and all of the latest AI features. \u274cSkip this deal if: you don't care about flip phones; you'd rather buy the device through your wireless carrier; you can get a better deal on our number-one favorite flip phone, the Motorola Razr Ultra. Putting it simply, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is pure luxury, boasting an ultra-lightweight build, two AMOLED displays, and a nearly-invisible folding hinge. Under the hood you get the Samsung Exynos 2500 with 12GB of RAM, plus an upgraded 4,300mAh battery, seven years of OS and security upgrades, and all of the latest AI-boosted software features.      If I had to nitpick, it is worth mentioning that the Z Flip 7 didn't receive any significant camera upgrades over its predecessor, charging is relatively sluggish, and the Motorola Razr Ultra might offer the better experience if all you care about is using the world's absolute best flip phone. Still, going with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is hardly a sacrifice, as the device offers one of the best foldable phones experiences on the market, and the ultra-lightweight build is simply unmatched in this space. Throw on a historic (albeit confusing) Black Friday discount and I can say with confidence that there's never been a better time to buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. Why wait?

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"You can save 25% on the brand-new Google Nest Cam Indoor with Gemini support.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Google just released a new Nest Cam Indoor (third-generation), and it includes a few highly-requested features: 2K video recording and AI-based camera detection. I've been eying an smart home camera upgrade to go with my Nest Doorbell, and the third-gen Nest Cam Indoor checks all my boxes \u2014 and it's on sale for Black Friday. This camera only came out last month, and it's already $25 off for Black Friday, bringing the Nest Cam Indoor down to only $75. It's such a good deal that I'm buying more than one Nest Cam Indoor at this price. If you're deep in the Google ecosystem with Pixel or Nest devices, the Nest Cam Indoor is a great way to expand your smart home while improving security. Here's why Google's best indoor security camera is a can't-miss deal at 25% off. Google's latest Nest Cam Indoor finally upgrades the camera's resolution to 2K, and fully supports the AI-based camera detection features offered with Gemini for Home. Plus, the design is very homey with Snow, Hazel, and Berry color options available.  Price comparison: Best Buy - $74.99 | Google - $74.99 \u2705Recommended if: you need a Google-connected, in-home security camera; you want Gemini for Home camera and motion detection; you want hi-res video feeds and 24\/7 recording. \u274cSkip this deal if: you don't want to pay for a subscription for advanced features; you need a camera with end-to-end encryption. There's one thing I absolutely love about Google's Nest Cam Indoor, and it's the security camera's design. For an indoor camera, it's important that the design feels homey and blends into your kitchen, living room, or bedroom. Google gets this right with the Nest Cam Indoor \u2014 it's unassuming and blends in with Snow (white), Hazel (gray), and Berry (red). I went with the Berry model, as it'll look more like an accent piece than a scary security system in my home. Then, you have the upgraded hardware. Nest Cameras formerly had a 1080p video-resolution limit, which paled in comparison to the swath of 2K and 4K models on the market. Now, the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd-gen) has a 2K resolution (2560x1440) and a 152-degree field of view. There's also 6x digital zoom support for when you need to crop in close. You also get 30 FPS video recording and HDR2 support, ensuring your security footage is always crisp. And, a night vision feature means you can see clearly inside your home, even when it's dark. Some might view the internet-connected nature and subscription model of Google's Nest cameras as a drawback, but I look at it as a feature. You can always pop in and look at your Nest Cam Indoor feed from anywhere using the Google Home app, completely free. Up to six hours of event recording is included, too. With a Google Home Standard or Premium subscription, you can get up to 24\/7 video recording, plus Gemini descriptions and object detection. Overall, Google added everything you might want to the Nest Cam Indoor (3rd-gen). If you're looking to build out your Google ecosystem and home security setup this Black Friday, there's no better buy.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, now for just $129.99  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The Black Friday smartwatch deals have landed, and they're even more impressive than we expected. For one, Best Buy's Black Friday sale includes $120 off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, which is easily one of our favorite last-gen smartwatches on the market. Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch 7 with an improved processor and overall performance, as well as an upgraded heart rate sensor that's more accurate than previous versions. It also features useful gesture controls such as the double pinch and knock-on gestures, while users also like reports such as the medication interaction warnings, energy scores, and more. Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 (40mm): $249.99 $129.99 at Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 just dropped $50 at Best Buy as official Black Friday deals start to go live. This particular deal is for the slightly smaller 40mm version of the watch, which includes a 1.3-inch AMOLED display, compared to the 1.5-inch display included with the 44mm version. \u2705Recommended if: you're looking for an affordable way to get into smartwatches and you don't need the latest release; you have other Samsung Galaxy devices and you want a watch with the utmost compatibility possible; you're looking for a watch with heart rate monitoring, GPS, sleep tracking, and other common modern smartwatch features. \u274cSkip this deal if: you'd rather spend a little more to access the upgrades included on the Galaxy Watch 8; you prefer a super thin and lightweight fitness band-style watch for comfortable use while sleeping; you're looking for a watch with industry-leading battery life. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 was our favorite Android smartwatch upon release for more than one reason. It offers a good-looking AMOLED display, a wide range of health and fitness features, useful gestures, and the easy-to-use Wear OS that's suitable even for those who are new to the smartwatch game. The differences between the Samsung Watch 7 and Watch 8 are somewhat subtle, with the latter-gen smartwatch featuring a marginal battery upgrade, new health tools and AI features, and a few other improvements. However, it's also worth noting that it sports the same Exynos W100 CPU, display specs, and sensors, meaning it's not so different from the newer model. It also includes 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, as well as the Samsung BioActive sensor which features an Optical Bio-signal sensor, an Electrical Heart Signal sensor, and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. Add in dual-band GPS, Bluetooth, NFC, and up to two days of battery life, and you've got a pretty solid smartwatch for casual users at this $200 price point.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"     What's the secret to a very un-merry shopping season? A brand new, unusable drone.    It could soon be incredibly difficult to get your hands on a DJI drone.\u00a0 With Thanksgiving wrapped up and the Black Friday shopping sales here, if a DJI drone is on your holiday wish list, you might want to hit \"buy\" immediately. The company has issued a stark warning: Its drones could be banned from sale in the US, and the deadline is looming.\u00a0 The\u00a0Federal Communications Commission voted 3-0\u00a0at the end of October to \"close loopholes\" that allow tech deemed a \"national security risk\" to be sold in the US. In plain English, the US government is clearing the path to give DJI the same treatment it gave Chinese phone-maker Huawei, effectively banning its products from the American market. The US government has deemed DJI, which is based in China, a security risk. It's also considering a separate ban on\u00a0TP-Link routers. DJI is already sounding the alarm, posting on Instagram that a \"deadline that could decide DJI's fate in the US is just 43 days away\" (now 19 days away). The company is warning that without an audit, its products could face an \"automatic ban.\" The US government has long labeled the Chinese drone maker a security risk, and it looks like the hammer might finally be coming down right before the holidays. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. The vote isn't the end of the road, however. Future bans would need to target specific products and would require a period of public consultation. But it appears the groundwork is being set for the FCC to block sales of future and some existing DJI drones from US shores, as well as products that use DJI technology. The government has called for a DJI audit by the end of the year, but if that doesn't happen, DJI drone products could be banned for sale by default under a national security law. A representative for DJI told CNET that while the FCC vote references a rule change that doesn't currently apply to DJI specifically, the National Defense Authorization Act deadline in December would put Chinese companies like it on the FCC's ban list, \"without any evidence of wrongdoing or the right to appeal.\" Adam Welsh, head of global policy at DJI, said the company has repeatedly said it would be open to audit, but that \"more than 10 months have now passed with no sign that the process has begun.\"\u00a0 \"The US government has every right to strengthen national security measures, but this must go hand in hand with due process, fairness, and transparency,\" Welsh said. Welsh said DJI is urging the government to start the audit process or grant an extension. Because the ban would apply to new sales, not drones that have already been sold, a DJI drone you already own would still be legal to use -- at least under current rules.\u00a0 Government agencies, however, are prohibited from purchasing or using drones from Chinese companies, including DJI. DJI's drones consistently rank high in their product category. In January, they\u00a0dominated CNET's list of best drones for 2025. But some of the company's newest products,\u00a0such as the DJI Mavic 4 Pro, haven't been available for sale in the United States. Even DJI products that are not yet banned may be hard to find. The website UAV Coach has posted a guide to the bans and reports that, due to inventory issues, most DJI drone models are sold out at retailers regardless of future FCC action.\u00a0","label":0}

Sarah Beckstrom, one of two West Virginia National Guard members who were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, has died. President Trump announced the 20-year-old's death during a Thanksgiving call to service members. Beckstrom and the other Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, were on patrol a few blocks away from the White House when the alleged gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, opened fire. Wolfe remains in critical condition. In the wake of this shooting, the Trump administration is launching a comprehensive \"reexamination\" of thousands of refugees and migrants who have been admitted to the U.S. and granted green cards.                  This photo combination shows West Virginia National Guard Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe (left) and Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, who were injured in Wednesday's shooting in Washington, D.C.

This is one of the region's deadliest blazes in decades, and authorities have indicated that the death toll may continue to rise. The police have arrested three men for alleged manslaughter in connection with the fire. Here's what else we know. Hey folks \u2013 Andrew Limbong here, host of NPR's Book of the Day podcast. I'm tapping in this week to let you all know about our annual recommendation engine, Books We Love. If you wanna come and hang and keep chatting about books stuff, subscribe to the books newsletter! This week, NPR dropped its massive year-end book recommendation tool, Books We Love. It's not quite a year-end list, 10 best or whatever, seeing as there are more than 380 books included. Instead, it's a way of saying: Here's a bunch of books. There's something in here for you. But I get it \u2014 380 is a daunting number, even with Books We Love's handy-dandy filter tag system. So here's just a small slice, a sliver, a taste of a few of the books several of our staffers and critics were into this year. \ud83d\udcda The Dream Hotel by Laila Lalami \u2014 You know that spooky feeling you get when you make small talk with someone about needing a new TV, and your phone then just happens to send you the latest TV deals? This dystopian novel is like that but scarier. Emily Kwong, host of NPR's Short Wave, writes, \"I found The Dream Hotel instructive for navigating a society beset by mass surveillance \u2014 where the only escape can be found in shouldering risk together.\" Again, this is just a tiny fraction of the hundreds of books we've got on this year's edition of Books We Love, as recommended by our staffers and critics. But if you're into this and want to read about books all year round, subscribe to the books newsletter!                  It's gift-giving season, and some consumer and child advocacy groups are raising concerns about the latest buzz-worthy AI toys                                                           Elva Etienne\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  The nonprofit children's safety organization Fairplay is urging gift-givers to refrain from purchasing AI toys for kids this holiday season. In an advisory, Fairplay and other child and consumer advocacy groups highlight the potential dangers of toys such as interactive dolls and children's robots designed to mimic human behavior and engage with kids as if they are friends. The advisory points out that these toys exploit children's trust\u00a0and can disrupt human relationships, among other negative effects. Muralist Maxx Moses is putting the \"Black\" in Black Friday. For the second year in a row, he's hosting the Black Friday Artists Market at the Graffiti Gardens in San Diego. Moses painted the walls of the studio, which he uses to partner with local organizations. The market will feature a diverse group of emerging and established local artists, aiming to celebrate Black culture, community and economics. (via KPBS) This holiday shopping season, expect deep discounts as retailers aim to encourage cautious shoppers to splurge. The National Retail Federation predicts a record-breaking season, with Americans projected to spend over $1 trillion\u00a0on gifts, food, and decorations, reflecting a growth rate of about 4% \u2014 similar to last year. Now that the Thanksgiving excitement is over, it is time for millions of Americans to make that long trek home. For some, the trip means dealing with car sickness. If you are one of those people, don't fret, NPR's How To Do Everything podcast has the guidance you need to make the ride better.

If you buy something through links on our site, Gizmodo may earn an affiliate commission.                             Reading time 5 minutes        The \u201cCyber\u201d in Cyber Monday means it\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0the day for tech deals, and that includes smart devices for your home. If you\u2019re one of the millions of people who have spent months casting envious looks at some of the best and most advanced robot vacuums and smart floor-cleaning systems, with Cyber Monday circled on your calendar as the day to swoop in and score one for an unbeatable price, Dreame is here to grant you up to four wishes. Dreame\u2019s stellar lineup of advanced cleaning devices \u00e2\u0080\u0094 featuring two autonomous robots and two highly advanced machines that still need a push \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is at the top of the Cyber Monday list thanks to huge markdowns of up to $800. Dreame\u2019s machines may cost more than much of the competition, but they do way more than their robot cleaners, and they put them to shame when it comes to state-of-the-art technology that\u2019s both incredibly advanced and exceptionally easy to use. Cyber Monday might be the last time we see these four powerhouses at prices like this, so don\u2019t let the opportunity pass. As second chances go, this is one to be truly thankful for. Dreame\u2019s X50 Ultra \u00e2\u0080\u0094 their hyper-advanced flagship robot vacuum\/mop combo, and one of the best consumer-market autonomous cleaning machines of all \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is still at its Black Friday pricing for Cyber Monday. That\u2019s a stellar 50% off deal that takes $800 off the price of the X50 Ultra and makes it hands-down the best $800 floor cleaner available anywhere. The X50 Ultra delivers true hands-off cleaning to your carpets and hard surfaces, thanks in no small part to Dreame\u2019s highly innovative ProLeap System. That\u2019s a motorized swing arm triggered by dual sensors which detect steps and thresholds of over 2.3 inches in height, virtually eliminating those times when your supposedly autonomous robot vacuum gets marooned and calls you for help. Other potential obstacle hangups are neutralized by the X50 Ultra\u2019s VersaLift Navigation, which uses a DToF (Direct Time of Flight) LiDAR system bolstered by AI to perform 360-degree room scans from varying heights. That means it can detect not only obstacles, but also accurately measure low furniture and other tight spots to correctly decide whether or not it will fit. Dreame\u2019s industry-best Dual Flex Arm MopExtend gives the X50 Ultra a four-inch reach into corners and against baseboards and around chair and table legs for truly comprehensive cleaning range, and the HyperStream Detangling DuoBrush should push the X50 Ultra to the very top of your robot vac wish list if you\u2019re living in a multi-pet home. Put an asterisk next to it for one more day, before the 2025-best $800 price goes away once and for all. See X50 Ultra at Amazon When is it OK to finish in second place? When you\u2019re a robot vacuum-mop combo and you\u2019re coming in behind the truly revolutionary Ultra X50. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find Dreame\u2019s L50 Ultra, which would almost certainly occupy the top slot in any competing lineup. Everything about the L50 Ultra is premium, flagship-quality performance and technology, and it ducks in well below flagship pricing for Cyber Monday with a 39% price drop to $850. When we say everything about the L50 Ultra is top of the line, we\u2019re including the very same ProLeap retractable leg system and HyperStream Detangling DuoBrush it shares with the X50 Ultra. Remarkably, it also includes what may be the best docking system in the entire category, Dreame\u2019s AceClean DryBoard. This highly advanced dock goes way above and beyond just emptying the robot\u2019s dirt container (into a big 3.2L bag that only needs to be changed every 100 days). The AceClean DryBoard is an automatic washer and dryer that deploys powerful streams of hot water to the mop head to leave it sparkling clean, and then warm air to dry it. A robust 19,500Pa of Vormax suction means the L50 Ultra is every bit as effective on carpets as it is on hard surfaces, and it truly excels in the most important category of all for any autonomous floor cleaner: It is truly\u00c2\u00a0autonomous, thanks to its advanced navigational and obstacle-scaling skills. Set it (with the Dreame app) and forget it, and do so for 39% less than retail when you buy the L50 Ultra on Cyber Monday. See L50 Ultra at Amazon Leave it to Dreame to completely reinvent something as basic and ancient as the act of floor mopping. Even other autonomous robot mops have until now missed one very basic point \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a mop should stay clean while it\u2019s cleaning. Dreame\u2019s AquaRoll real-time fresh-water mopping feature delivers a constant stream of clean water to the rollers as it flushes out the dirty water. The result \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a constantly clean mop head that does a vastly superior job as opposed to machines that run the same dirty mop head over your floor. Need more new mopping tech to be convinced? The Aqua10 Ultra Roller also has a FluffRoll counter-rotating module that gets deeper into textured floors and even tile grout. Parents of little spill-prone kids are going to want to put the Aqua10 at the head of their list too, because of its combination of superior mopping power and Astrovision NVIDIA-trained obstacle intelligence to help it avoid running over all the many toys left on your floors. Not a small detail during the holidays, to be sure. See Aqua10 Ultra Roller at Amazon Wet-dry vacs are hardly a new innovation, but ones that are this lightweight, this effective, and self-cleaning? That\u2019s worth a very long look, especially when it\u2019s attached to a 37% off deal for Cyber Monday. That\u2019s the Dreame H15 Pro Heat, which redefines what a wet-dry vac is truly capable of thanks to its self-heating, self-cleaning, and one-pass cleaning power. Fill the H15 Pro Heat\u2019s water tank and it rapidly heats it up to 185 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to cut through greasy, sticky, or gooey messes. One single pass is all you need to suck up loose dry debris, blast the sticky stuff with cleansing hot water, and extract the dirty water and mess. No more multiple forward-backward push-and-pull action with a far heavier and less effective machine. It\u2019s not robotic, but its AI-powered arm is, which can be deployed into edges, corners, and baseboards. When the cordless H15 Pro Heat goes back to its charging base for a refresher, it\u2019s not just the battery getting a boost. The dock brings literal boiling water (212 degrees Fahrenheit) to bear on the mop roller, and then warm air to dry it out and get it ready for action again. Smaller homes and apartments, larger ones with huge areas of hard-surfaced floors, and homes with little ones prone to spills and messes will benefit most from the H15 Pro Heat, especially at its Cyber Monday price of just $570. See H15 Pro Heat at Amazon The stick-vacuum category might be the most crowded of them all during Cyber Monday, so finding truly standout units is a challenge. The Dreame Z30 is a lightweight, cordless beast that stands out in every way imaginable, not the least of which is its 60%-off price \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just $200 thru Dec. 1. The Z30 is an absolute monster, powered by a 150,000 RPM TurboMotor that creates suction of 310AW, far outperforming pricier models. All of the dirt and debris it sucks up stays contained, as the built-in HEPA H14 filtration system keeps particles as tiny as 0.1 microns trapped with an efficiency of 99.99% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 allergy-sensitive homes and homes with people with respiratory issues should take note. The Z30 is also a smart stick vacuum, which is virtually unheard of. It can detect the levels of dirt and dust and automatically adjust its cleaning intensity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both the suction and the speed at which the two CelesTect brush modules move. That\u2019s not just efficient cleaning, it\u2019s efficient use of its rechargeable battery, and thus runtime of up to 90 minutes on a single charge. If there\u2019s a better $200 stick vacuum out there on Cyber Monday, we haven\u2019t seen it.

Whether you\u2019re upgrading worn-out batteries or investing in pro-level power tools, the markdowns on Milwaukee\u2019s most popular M18 lineup\u2014including kits, high-output batteries, and jobsite must-haves. Our favorite deal is the Milwaukee M18 REDLITHIUM XC5.0 Battery Starter Kit for just $129 (was $397!), which includes two 5.0Ah batteries and an M18\/M12 charger for less than the cost of a single battery at full price.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"You can grab yourself a fully kitted out Copilot+ PC for half price, just $349 at Best Buy right now. It's the ASUS VivoBook 16, powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 chip!  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  It's Black Friday time, which means I just came across a laptop that might be one of the cheapest Copilot+ laptops I have seen to date. This is the ASUS VivoBook 16, paired with an AMD Ryzen AI 5 chip, a huge 16 inch display, 16 GB of DDR5 memory, and a 512 GB SSD for storage. There is a lot more on offer here, but considering the large drop in price it's hard not to recommend, dropping from $749.99, down to $349.99 on Best Buy. This ASUS VivoBook 16 deal includes AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 5 330 processor with a 50 TOPS NPU for Copilot+ features, 16 GB of DDR5 memory, and a 512 GB SSD. It also has a glorious a 16-inch Full HD Display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and an anti-glare finish. For $349, you can't go wrong. Up until now, most Copilot+ PCs have been $600 or more. Every now and then, we may have seen a laptop fall under $600 during a sale event like Black Friday, but we've never seen one for as low as $349. For $349, this laptop is an absolute no brainer. You get a massive 16-inch 1080p display that's more than big enough for movies, gaming, and productivity work. It also has 16GB RAM which is more than enough for most people, and 512GB storage for all your apps and documents. Under the hood, it's powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 330 chip, which is officially certified for Copilot+ capabilities. That's because it has an NPU that outputs 50 TOPS of power, making it eligible to run features like Click To Do and Windows Recall. These features are exclusive to Copilot+ PCs, so buying this device is netting you access to additional Windows OS functionality that isn't available to most people. You also get integrated Radeon graphics for everyday tasks and even light gaming, as well as Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, and a full set of ports including USB C, USB A, HDMI 2.1, and a headphone jack. Because of its 16-inch screen, we also have a full sized keyboard and trackpad, complete with a number pad, making for a great laptop for typing on. The overall design is also super sleek, especially for $349. Features of the Asus Vivobook 16. Showcasing the build and frame of the ASUS Vivobook 16.  Specifications for the ASUS Vivobook 16. Yes, this laptop is an official Copilot+ PC, which means it has exclusive access to features like Windows Recall, Click To Do, and more AI features.

If you watch the news, you have undoubtedly seen the stories of well-known companies closing stores or raising doubts about their ability to continue operating. Earlier this month, S&P's data tracking company seemed to confirm our worst fears, reporting that 2025 bankruptcies were nearing levels not seen since in 15 years, or since 2010, when the economy was still recovering from the Great Recession. Scary, right? Not so fast. While the trend is definitely pointed upward, it's not all doom and gloom. Here is what's happening in 3 charts: S&P Global Market Intelligence reported some 68 bankruptcies in October, bringing the 2025 total to 655 for the first 10 months of the year. Assuming the trend continues through November and December, 2025 will end the year with 792 bankruptcies. That's more companies having filed for bankruptcy protection than any year since 2010, when S&P tracked 828 corporate bankruptcies. S&P, which only tracks companies of a certain size, said it's seeing the most bankruptcies in the industrials sector (think manufacturing), followed by consumer discretionary (think fashion). This year's high-profile bankruptcy filings have included electric truck maker Nikola, Spirit Airlines, and fashion accessory retailer Claire's. While 2025 bankruptcies are now on track to reach their highest levels since 2010, they are still expected to be significantly lower than the levels reached at the height of the Great Depression. In 2008, the year Lehman Brothers failed, leading to massive bank bailouts, S&P tracked 5,335 bankruptcies. The next year, it tracked 5,026. By contrast, bankruptcies were relatively low leading up to the Fed's recent spate of rate hikes \u2014 hitting a nadir of just 372 in 2022, according to S&P's data. Bankruptcies have been rising since 2023, as the cost of borrowing has increased. (The Federal Reserve began slowly raising interest rates in 2022 in an effort to tamp down inflation.) Even so, 2025's bankruptcies could still come in below 2010. There are two common types of bankruptcy filings: Chapter 7 liquidation and Chapter 11 reorganization. The first usually signals that the filing company plans to shutter its doors and go out of business. A company that turns to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, by contrast, does so to hammer out plans to repay its creditors under court supervision. Under this scenario, a company may look to cut costs, including by closing doors; however, the goal is to emerge from bankruptcy as a healthier and stronger company. There have been periods when liquidations have been on par with or even exceeded reorganizations, including between 2021 to 2023, when S&P tracked 744 liquidations to 667 reorganizations. That trend appears to have reversed in the last two years, however. This year, the S&P has tallied 412 reorganizations versus 269 liquidations, suggesting more companies are turning to bankruptcy court as a way to reduce debt rather than close their doors.

This year, there's a new topic to argue about at the Thanksgiving table: What is a professional degree? It's a question that President Donald Trump's Department of Education recently addressed in its overhaul of student-loan repayment. That's led to criticism from groups that are not included in the department's narrower degree definition. The crux of the issue is new borrowing limits. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation that he signed into law in July included new borrowing caps on professional and graduate student loans, aiming to curb excessive borrowing: $20,500 a year for graduate students or $100,000 over a lifetime, and $50,000 a year for professional students or $200,000 over a lifetime. In addition to the caps, the department also reclassified what constitutes a professional degree, narrowing it down to 10 programs, including dentistry, medicine, and law. Some advocates said the department's professional degree definition could strain student-loan borrowing access to those in the healthcare profession seeking post-graduate training, like nurses, although the changes won't affect undergraduate borrowing. \"At a time when healthcare in our country faces a historic nurse shortage and rising demands, limiting nurses' access to funding for graduate education threatens the very foundation of patient care,\" Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, said in a statement. The Department of Education said that the new definitions only reflect which programs qualify for higher loan limits and are \"not a value judgement about the importance of programs. It has no bearing on whether a program is professional in nature or not.\" How will the changes to student-loan borrowing caps and professional degrees impact you? Share your story with this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com. The Department of Education said 10 post-graduate programs will be counted as professional degrees and will be eligible for the higher student-loan cap: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry, and theology. Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the conservative think-tank the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a Monday blog post that Congress \"legislated only broad guidelines as to how graduate programs should be classified,\" and the distinction between professional and non-professional programs was left to the discretion of the Education Department. When it comes to nursing programs, Cooper said that the \"new caps will affect only a small number of programs charging exorbitant prices.\" The Department of Education said that, based on its data, 95% of nursing students borrow below the new student-loan cap. The average cost of a master's degree in nursing in 2020 ranged from $15,030 to nearly $43,000, per the National Center for Education Statistics. The borrowing caps could strain other professions and cause some students to either forgo their advanced degrees or turn to the riskier, private lending market. For example, the Association of American Medical Colleges found that the median cost for four years of public medical school was $286,454 for the class of 2024. For law school, the average total cost was just over $217,000. The $200,000 lifetime cap would be insufficient to cover those tuition amounts. While negotiations on the changes have concluded, the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposals early next year before the department moves toward final implementation. The department said that it \"may make changes in response to public comments.\" Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-28","content":" This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.       We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.      With Black Friday happening, retailers have push the go button in the backend of their websites to have all their deals go live right now, ahead of schedule. If you\u2019re still hunting for the right gift this holiday season for a friend, family member, or loved one, right now seems to be the best time to do so. Amazon happens to have Google\u2019s latest noise-cancelling premium earbuds\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Pixel Buds Pro 2\u00e2\u0080\u0094 on sale for its lowest price yet. The in-ear headphones and charging case normally clock in at $229, but ahead of November\u2019s massive sales days, the price has come down to just $169. That 26% discount ends up saving you a whole $60 for a limited time. The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in five different color option, three of which are lucky enough to be part of the ongoing early Black Friday sale. You can chose between hazel, peony, or porcelain. Wintergreen and moonstone are either out of stock or absent from the discount. The color you choose only affects the buds themselves, as all color options come with the same white case with black interior. See at Amazon These earbuds are being toted by Google as its most comfortable earbuds yet. They are small, light, and have a secure fit in any ear size or shape. You can use a twist-to-adjust stabilizer which locks your earbuds in place which is great for a high-intensity workout. Then twist the other way to loosen them a bit for all-day comfort. What separates the Pro model from the standard Pixel Buds is support for noise cancellation. The Buds Pro 2 are able to silence unwanted sounds from your surroundings so you can focus in only hearing only what you want to hear, be it music, a podcast, or audiobook. Active noise cancellation is enhanced further with the help of Googles Silent Seal 2.0 which is able to cancel up to twice as much noise as the original Buds Pro. Now what happened when you don\u2019t want to eliminate those environmental sounds anymore? Like maybe you\u2019ve been waiting in line for Starbucks\u00e2\u0080\u0094kicking it to \u201cRadio\u201d by Bershy on loop, which you discovered from the awesome soundtrack of Dispatch\u00e2\u0080\u0094and now you\u2019re up next to order. The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are equipped with Conversation Detection. This will automatically pause your music and switch your earbuds to transparency mode when you start talking. Transparency mode basically filters in outside sounds in through the in-ear speakers, and you can activate it just by speaking. That means you don\u2019t have to take out you earbuds, nor do you even need to awkward hold or tap while trying to strike up a conversation.

LG is the leader in the OLED TV market because of decades of experience with display panels that competitors can\u2019t match. They stay on top even though Samsung, Sony, and Chinese manufacturers are always trying to take them down. Every year, the company comes out with new generations of TVs but some models become bestsellers that last longer than the yearly refresh cycles because they offer great value by balancing performance and price. Right now, a 48-inch OLED C4 TV is currently on sale for $876 on Amazon on Black Friday, and it is a 45% drop from its original price of $1,599 which makes flagship OLED technology available at mid-tier LED prices. The pricing proves so aggressive that Amazon displays it as \u201chidden price\u201d requiring cart addition before revealing the actual cost. Amazon explains this policy through manufacturer agreements: \u201cBecause our price on this item is lower than the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, the manufacturer does not allow us to show you our price until you place the item in your shopping cart.\u201d See at Amazon The main benefit of OLED is that the self-emissive pixels can turn completely off to make true blacks: This gives OLED TVs infinite contrast that LED TVs with backlights bleeding through LCD panels can\u2019t match. LED TVs with local dimming come close to this with backlight zones but blooming and haloing around bright objects on dark backgrounds show the compromise that OLED gets rid of completely with per-pixel control. The Gen7 \u00ce\u00b19 AI processor looks at each frame of content to improve picture quality by recognizing scenes, reducing noise and upscaling lower-resolution content to near-4K quality. Firmware updates keep the processor learning and getting better which means that picture quality will always be better than what the hardware can do at the time of purchase. With VRR and HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and a 120Hz refresh rate, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles can take full advantage of next-gen features and perform at their best. The near-instantaneous response time stops ghosting during fast motion, the high refresh rate lets you play competitive games at 120 frames per second, and variable refresh rate synchronization stops screen tearing that breaks immersion. Dolby Vision IQ automatically changes the brightness of HDR based on the amount of light in the room which is measured by built-in sensors. This keeps the picture quality at its best no matter what time of day or how bright it is. Different tone mapping is used for bright daytime viewing and dark evening viewing and makes sure that content looks the way it was meant to, not washed out by sunlight or too dim in the dark. Dolby Atmos audio processing makes three-dimensional soundscapes through the TV\u2019s built-in speakers which act like overhead and surround channels. The webOS smart platform makes it easy to navigate through thousands of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Prime Video, and more, all from one interface that doesn\u2019t lag. Using the Magic Remote with pointer control is like using a mouse instead of having to deal with directional buttons that make typing hard. You can use voice commands to search for content, control your smart home, and ask questions through the built-in Google Assistant and Alexa. The record-low Black Friday pricing at $876 versus $1,599 launch makes LG\u2019s OLED technology cost approach premium LED TVs delivering fraction of the picture quality through inferior backlight-based contrast. If you want OLED picture quality without waiting years for depreciation or accepting smaller sizes, this hidden price deal makes flagship display technology accessible at unprecedented Black Friday costs.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"From tracking your fitness to keeping you connected wherever you go, Apple Watch is a must-have this holiday season. For Black Friday, we\u2019re tracking huge savings on the entire Apple Watch lineup. This includes the cheapest Apple Watch SE 3 and the flagship Apple Watch Series 11. Plus, last year\u2019s Apple Watch Series 10 is still on the market as an excellent middle ground option. We\u2019re also tracking a $100 savings on the rugged Apple Watch Ultra 3, with its multi-day battery life in tow.  Whether you\u2019re a newcomer to the Apple Watch ecosystem or looking to upgrade your aging wearable, there\u2019s a deal in here for you.  Apple Watch Series 11 arrived in September, and is almost certainly set to become the best-selling model in the current-generation lineup (if it isn\u2019t already). Now sitting down at the lowest prices we have tracked to date across just about every configuration save for a couple of the very high-end Titanium configs with the Milanese band, even if the base models drop any lower between now and holiday shipping cutoff times, it won\u2019t be by much. Some might argue an Apple Watch Series 10 at $249 makes the new SE 3 dead on arrival (obsolete), and I\u2019m, frankly, having a hard time taking a position to the contrary. They are functionally quite similar as far as the sorts of features most folks will actually make use of on regular basis, and you can score the SE 3 for $50 less right now, but the Series 10 is (not) arguably a nicer looking piece of high-tech Apple wrist fashion and it\u2019s now starting at $100 less than the new Series 11 for Black Friday \u2013 the lowest price it has ever been offered for online. While I remain a staunch Apple Watch Ultra user, Apple even had me thinking twice about the new SE3 after it announced the always-on display, gesture support, and the S10 chip at the heart of the operation here. I still prefer the Ultra cushion-meets-squircle case, but (on the technical side of things) the SE 3 admittedly does everything I\u2019ll even need an Apple Watch to do, and it does it for $600 less right now with Black Friday pricing in full swing. The Apple Watch SE 2, which I\u2019m pretty sure stands for Super underwhelming Edition 2 at this point, actually delivers some serious bang for your buck at the $129 Black Friday price. No, it\u2019s very much not a Series 11, not even a Series 10, and it doesn\u2019t have those sweet upgrades Apple injected into the new SE 3 model we just highlighted above. But for the kids or super casual users, this is an Apple Watch for under $130 that does deliver on the basic key feature set at a seriously reduced price right now. Note: The more valuable GPS + Cell models are at the same price as the base edition, but the colors are far more limited. Apple Watch Ultra \u2013 the most gorgeous wrist computer computing on anyone\u2019s wrist anywhere if you ask me. This thing is very much an investment with that $799 list price, whether you\u2019re looking to save a buck or two on the previous-gen Ultra 2 Black Friday deals or strap up with the latest Ultra 3, but if you\u2019re going to pull the trigger on one now\u2019s the time to do it.

Cruising Amazon for the best Black Friday deals is a hunting expedition for those red digits next to the price \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the negative numbers with the percentage sign that guide you to the biggest price drops. It was -13% that led us to the deal on the Crucial X10 1TB Portable SSD, but it was the Crucial name and the features of this awesome drive that led us to click \u201cbuy now.\u201d The new $85 Black Friday price on the Crucial X10 is well worth jumping on. The 1TB capacity of this model of the X10 is enough to serve as a secure backup for tens of thousands of irreplaceable files. It\u2019s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, and many gaming consoles. The Crucial X10 transfers data at a fast 2,100MB\/s, and it has advanced dust, water, and drop resistance built in. Crucial might not have as recognizable a name as SanDisk or Samsung or some of the other big tech companies, but the reputation and the performance are impeccable. See at Amazon When you click over to Amazon to check out the Crucial X10 the first thing you\u2019ll notice is how much smaller it is than most other portable SSDs. Just 2.55 by 1.96 inches square and a truly remarkable 0.39 inches thick, it\u2019s probably the most pocket-sized 4TB drive on the market. Even so, you don\u2019t have to treat it with kid gloves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Crucial X10 has IP65 dust and water resistance ratings, and drop resistance of nearly 10 feet. With that kind of rugged construction combined with the 1TB capacity and outstanding speed of data transfer make the Crucial X10 a prime candidate for anything you would use a portable SSD for. Add 1TB of storage to your gaming console \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it works with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and bring the extra games with you on the road. It\u2019s a perfect Time Machine drive for automatic Mac backups, and as storage or transport for huge files like hi-res photo and video files, it\u2019s a massive amount of space in a tiny package, and it can move the files back and forth to your editing station with great speed. Students, remote workers, and frequent business travelers have mostly relied on USB thumb drives for ferrying their files. They\u2019re pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and inexpensive, so that tracks. But the Crucial X10? Pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and for a exceptionally fast, nearly universally compatible, massive-capacity drive, inexpensive. And unlike those thumb drives, the Crucial X10 can take a little bit of abuse, and isn\u2019t going to glitch out on you like those cheap thumb drives. It\u2019s a worthy investment in keeping your irreplaceable files safe and secure, especially during this Amazon Black Friday sale with the fat 13% price drop that makes the Crucial X10 one of the best portable SSD buys of the day at just $230.

There are countless reasons to invest in a quality pair of headphones\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially ones equipped with active noise cancellation. Being able to shut out the world and immerse yourself in what you actually want to hear makes a huge difference, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuck on a long, noisy flight or trying to concentrate in a busy workspace. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the market for a stylish and capable option, the Nothing headphones are worth a look. With their distinctive transparent design and sleek, technical aesthetic, they stand out visually. Currently, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re available at a 20% discount. Normally priced at $299, you can pick them up now for $239, saving $60 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. These headphones feature advanced, intelligent noise cancellation technology. Using next-generation processing and adaptive microphones, they continuously analyze your surroundings and automatically adjust the level of noise reduction. The over-ear design further enhances isolation by forming a secure acoustic seal around your ears. The result is a listening experience free from interruptions\u00e2\u0080\u0094perfect for music, audiobooks, or podcasts. When you need to re-engage with your environment, you can switch it over to Transparency Mode which lets outside sounds pass through naturally. This is especially helpful when walking through busy areas or responding to a coworker without removing your headphones. See at Amazon See at Amazon  The Nothing headphones conveniently offers an onboard control system that minimizes the need to reach for your phone. A dedicated side button allows quick access to apps like Spotify, letting you launch your audio without digging into your pocket. On the opposite earcup, a paddle lets you skip tracks or jump ahead in podcasts. Holding it down allows you to scrub through your audio with precision. Above this, a roller gives you intuitive control over volume, playback, and toggling between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Altogether, the controls are designed to keep your listening experience smooth and uninterrupted. Battery life is reliably long. With ANC turned off, you can enjoy up to an impressive 80 hours of listening time\u00e2\u0080\u0094enough for several days of use without recharging. Even with ANC enabled, the headphones still deliver around 35 hours of playback, which is more than sufficient for long workdays, commutes, or travel. And if the battery does run low, a quick 5-minute charge provides about 5 hours of additional listening time, ensuring you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rarely stuck without sound.      Comfort is equally important for long sessions, and Nothing has put real thought into the design. The ear cushions are made from memory foam wrapped in PU material, which resists oils and makeup to stay clean over time. The reinforced aluminum core adds durability while keeping the headphones lightweight, making them suitable for extended wear. For a limited time, you can grab the Nothing headphones at a $60 discount on Amazon. With them, you get style, comfort, and premium noise cancellation in one package. Makes for a great gift for any music lover this holiday season. See at Amazon See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips. Sign up for our free newsletter.

Cheap robot vacuums that bump randomly around rooms, miss entire areas and get stuck constantly serve no purpose beyond cluttering the market and disappointing buyers who conclude that robot vacuums fundamentally don\u2019t work. These failures damage the category\u2019s reputation while advanced models demonstrate what\u2019s actually possible when engineering takes priority over cost-cutting that creates barely functional products. The Roborock Saros 10R represents ultra-premium robot vacuum technology that handles everything, and it is now available at $999 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $1,599. The $600 reduction brings this flagship model to pricing closer to Roborock\u2019s mid-tier offerings before this sale, and makes the best autonomous cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment. See at Amazon The new slim 3.14-inch profile gets rid of the raised LiDAR towers that stop regular robot vacuums from getting under furniture with low clearance, where dust builds up without being disturbed. Cleaning beds, sofas, cabinets, and coffee tables is now possible instead of having to manually vacuum or let dust build up all the time. The 22,000Pa suction gives it cleaning power that rivals high-end upright vacuums\u00c2\u00a0and the robot itself is small and can move around on its own. This powerful suction pulls out pet hair that is stuck deep in carpet fibers that weaker robots can\u2019t reach, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines, and picks up fine dust from hardwood floors in one pass without needing to clean again. The DuoDivide main brush and FlexiArm Riser side brush don\u2019t get tangled up so they can handle hair up to 40 cm long without the problems that other robots have. The FlexiArm Riser technology is the first of its kind in the industry: It lets both the side brush and the mop automatically reach corners and edges that fixed-position cleaning heads can\u2019t get to. Watch the arm swing out when it gets close to baseboards. It cleans all the way up to the walls instead of leaving the one-inch dirt lines that regular robots leave along the edges. The AdaptiLift chassis has wheels that can be adjusted independently and can climb over things up to 4 cm high like door thresholds, thick rugs, and cable runs that stop regular robots from working without help. The system changes the height of each wheel based on the terrain, keeping the robot stable as it goes over obstacles that would tip or beach standard robots with fixed chassis heights. The dock does all of the maintenance work such as removing the mop automatically for vacuum-only modes, washing the mop with 176\u00c2\u00b0F hot water to get rid of tough stains, drying it with 131\u00c2\u00b0F hot air to stop mildew, collecting dust automatically every 60 days, refilling the tank automatically, dispensing detergent automatically, and cleaning the hot water dock itself. Roborock\u2019s best technology costs $999 on Black Friday which is the lowest price ever and it saves you $600. Their mid-range models don\u2019t have the ultra-slim design, FlexiArm extension, AdaptiLift chassis, or full dock automation that their best models do. If you want to really get rid of manual floor cleaning with technology that works, this is the deal for you. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"This healthcare worker deals with losing a parent and immediately hits a wall with management, who tries to deny the full bereavement leave clearly stated in the union handbook. Five days entitled becomes one day offered, and every extra bit of time will require calling off as if grief operates on a schedule approved by the staff rota. Handbook rules look less like policy and more like folklore passed around in the break room; every plea for relief is met with \"I'll check the handbook\" and a shrug. Management prefers to interpret union agreements as loose guidelines, parsing compassion like limited stock in the backroom. Even with a physical copy and clear language about eligibility, the response is a familiar game of delaying tactics and half-promises of future answers. Standard procedure means offering condolences and then instructing staff to call in sick if comfort requires more than a shift or two. Image is representative only and does not depict the actual subjects of the story. Image is representative only and does not depict the actual subjects of the story. Reality is far from handbook ideal. Time off depends on how insistent someone can be, not how the rules read. Experience in this workplace means learning that even the simplest concessions must be spun into tactical negotiations. Losing a family member tests endurance, but so does battling bureaucracy armed only with a page number and a tired group chat. In some jobs, empathy never quite makes the schedule.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"The PSVR 2 just got its steepest discount ever, and it still comes with the award-winning Horizon Call of the Mountain for free!  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Black Friday 2025 is the best year for VR headsets to date, offering deep discounts on all the best headsets you can buy today. But the most impressive discount might be the $100 off PSVR2 bundle with Horizon Call of the Mountain included. At $299, this is a stellar deal that includes one of the best PSVR 2 games available, giving you a AAA VR gaming experience from the moment you unbox it. PSVR 2 requires a PS5 to play, but since nearly 100 million people already own one, you're likely set to enjoy one of the finest VR headsets to date without much fuss. So long as you've got that PS5, everything else you'll need is in this box. The PSVR 2 has hundreds of games to play, including big names like Resident Evil 7 and 8, Gran Turismo, Hitman World of Assassination, and many more titles you're going to love. PlayStation VR2 Horizon COTM bundle: $399 $299 at Amazon Unlock the power of your PS5 with the PSVR 2 and jump INTO your games. Horizon Call of the Mountain is included in this bundle, which ensures you get a top-notch AAA gaming experience the moment you unbox the headset, now at its lowest price ever! Price comparison: Best Buy - $599 | Walmart - $299 \u2705Recommended if: You're a PlayStation 5 gamer who is all about immersive graphics, wants a VR headset with a great OLED display, and is ready to play some of the biggest-name VR games on the market. \u274cSkip this deal if: You don't have a PS5, don't like using headsets that require a wire, or are more interested in some of the Meta-exclusive games like Batman or Deadpool. If you're choosing between the PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 3 this holiday season, there are some pretty substantial differences between the two experiences. Sony's edge is in its top-tier components, which include an OLED display, eye tracking, and advanced haptic feedback in both the controllers and headset. Plus, there are a handful of exclusive games you can only get on the PSVR 2. Aside from the Sony-related IPs you might expect (like Horizon and Gran Turismo), the PSVR 2 features games with better graphics than the Meta Quest 3 can offer since it's powered by the PS5. Some exclusive titles, like Synapse, even use the PSVR 2's eye tracking to great effect, giving you kinetic powers that you can aim with just your eyes. It's unreal! But there's no denying how good the Meta Quest 3S is, all at an even cheaper $199. To make that deal even sweeter, you don't need another console or PC to power a Meta Quest: it's a completely standalone VR console that doesn't use wires or limit your play space, and it has even more exclusive games than the PSVR 2. Meta Quest 3S 128GB: $299 $249, plus $50 gift card, free game, and more at Best Buy The Meta Quest 3S is currently on sale via multiple retailers for Black Friday, but Best Buy is one-upping the competition by throwing a $50 gift card into the mix. This free credit goes on top of a straight $50 discount, three months of Meta Horizon Plus, and a free copy of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. $140 of savings with an already-affordable VR headset? Sign me up.  Need more storage? Upgrade to the 256GB version of the Quest 3S at Best Buy to score a $70 discount along with all the goodies mentioned above (note that the included free game with this configuration is Batman: Arkham Shadow, not The Walking Dead).  Price comparison: Amazon - $249 (Gorilla Tag bundle + $50 Amazon credit) | Walmart - $249 (Batman Arkham Shadow bundle) Meta has made a name for itself in the VR space with a massive library of exclusive games. The recently released Deadpool VR can only be played on the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, and the same goes for last year's Batman Arkham Shadow. And because of the Meta Quest's popularity, you'll find tons of people to play with online. Games like Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons are perfect in VR, and with color mixed reality vision, you can even put the board on a real table and play with your headset on. The PSVR 2 only has black & white passthrough vision, which means no mixed reality content to be had. Either route you choose, though, VR gamers are eating good this year, and with steep $100 off discounts for each of these headsets, it's the perfect year to finally jump into next-generation immersive gaming!

Black Friday\u2019s main day arrives with Amazon delivering massive discounts across every product category to maximize shopper satisfaction. iPhone 17 models are still absent from Amazon\u2019s catalog but flagship Android devices receive substantial markdowns including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Google Pixel 10, and OnePlus 13. The OnePlus 13 costs $799 in its 512GB configuration during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $999 and hits a record-low price that explains its bestseller status. The 20% discount makes flagship specs (including Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 6,000mAh battery, 120Hz QHD+ display and Hasselblad camera system) accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier phones. See at Amazon The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the best Android mobile silicon out there. It has maximum clock speeds of 4.32GHz and is made using cutting-edge 3nm technology which gives it desktop-level performance, and it can handle demanding games at their highest settings, professional photo and video editing, and extreme multitasking across dozens of apps without the slowdowns that happen with less powerful processors. The 6.82-inch ProXDR display has a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels and an adaptive refresh rate of 120Hz that smoothly switches between 1Hz for static content and 120Hz for scrolling or gaming. The LTPO technology makes this variable refresh possible while also making the battery last longer by automatically adjusting based on the type of content, and the ProXDR name means that the screen is brighter with a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits for HDR content. Dolby Vision support makes video from Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ look amazing by giving it a lot of contrast. The 10-bit color depth shows over 1 billion colors, so there are no banding issues with smooth gradients, and the display is just as good for work as it is for play with clear text and detailed spreadsheets, bright colors, and deep blacks. The huge 6,000mAh battery is one of the biggest in flagship phones and really lasts for two days of normal use, not just the optimistic marketing claims that say you need to use airplane mode and not much else. Heavy users who stream video, play games and use apps all the time can go full days without worrying about their batteries dying. Moderate users can go two evenings before needing to charge their phones. The 80W SuperVOOC wired charging fully charges the battery in about 35 minutes\u00c2\u00a0so you don\u2019t have to wait until the next day to charge it. Instead, you can charge it during your lunch break or morning routine. The 50W AirVOOC wireless charging is as fast as many wired charging options and lets you charge your phone at your desk or nightstand without having to deal with cords in the dark. The fifth-generation Hasselblad camera system has three cameras with 50MP sensors on the main, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses, and gives you a lot of options for shooting. The main sensor captures incredible detail thanks to its large 1\/1.4-inch size, which lets in more light than smaller sensors in other phones. This makes it work better in low light and gives it a shallower depth of field. The ultra-wide lens handles wide-open spaces with little edge distortion, and the telephoto lens lets you zoom in on things that are far away without losing quality, which is a problem with phones that only crop. Hasselblad\u2019s color science makes pictures that look real with accurate skin tones and balanced saturation, instead of the over-processed look that phones that try to look good on social media have. OnePlus\u2019s custom interface for Android 15 with OxygenOS combines the clean look of stock Android with useful features like gesture navigation, gaming mode, and a wide range of theme options. The interface stays fast and responsive because it doesn\u2019t have much bloatware and manages resources well, which keeps it from slowing down like heavily skinned Android versions do. OnePlus promises to give the phone four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches. The 512GB model is on sale for a record-low price of $799 on Black Friday, down from the usual price of $999. This makes OnePlus\u2019s flagship specs competitive with mid-range phones that cost about the same but have much better performance, display quality, battery life, and camera capabilities.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"CME blamed the outage, which halted trading for more than 11 hours, on a cooling failure at a data centre in Chicago. By Reuters Share Save Global futures markets were thrown into chaos for several hours after CME Group, the world\u2019s largest exchange operator, suffered one of its longest outages in years, halting trading across stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies. By 13:35 GMT on Friday, trading in foreign exchange, stock and bond futures as well as other products had resumed, after having been knocked out for more than 11 hours because of an outage at an important data centre, according to LSEG data. CME blamed the outage on a cooling failure at data centres run by CyrusOne, which said its Chicago-area facility had affected services for customers, including CME. The disruption stopped trading in major currency pairs on CME\u2019s EBS platform, as well as benchmark futures for West Texas Intermediate crude, Nasdaq 100, Nikkei, palm oil and gold, according to LSEG data. Trading volumes have been thinned out this week by the United States Thanksgiving holiday, and with dealers looking to close positions for the end of the month, there was a risk of volatility picking up sharply later on, market participants said. \u201cIt\u2019s a black eye to the CME and probably an overdue reminder of the importance of market structure and how interconnected all these are,\u201d Ben Laidler, head of equity strategy at Bradesco BBI, said. \u201cWe complacently take for granted that much of the timing is frankly not great. It\u2019s month-end, a lot of things get rebalanced.\u201d \u201cHaving said that, it could have been a lot worse; it\u2019ll be a very low-volume day. If you\u2019re going to have it, there would have been worse days to have a breakdown like this,\u201d he said. Futures are a mainstay of financial markets and are used by dealers, speculators and businesses wishing to hedge or hold positions in a wide range of underlying assets. Without these and other instruments, brokers were left flying blind, and many were reluctant to trade contracts with no live prices for hours on end. \u201cBeyond the immediate risk of traders being unable to close positions \u2013 and the potential costs that follow \u2013 the incident raises broader concerns about reliability,\u201d said Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at trading platform IG. A few European brokerages said earlier in the day they had been unable to offer trading in some products on certain futures\u00a0contracts. Regulators are tracking the situation, with both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission confirming they are aware of the issue and conducting ongoing surveillance. CME is the biggest exchange operator by market value and says it offers the widest range of benchmark products, spanning rates, equities, metals, energy, cryptocurrencies and agriculture. Average daily derivatives volume was 26.3 million contracts in October, CME said earlier this month. The CME outage on Friday comes more than a decade after the operator had to shut electronic trading for some agricultural contracts in April 2014 due to technical problems, which at the time sent traders back onto the floor. More recently, in 2024, outages at LSEG and Switzerland\u2019s exchange operator briefly interrupted markets. CME\u2019s own shares were up 0.4 percent in premarket trading.

TV is an endangered species. People aren't watching it, and don't want to pay for it. And the companies that own TV networks are trying to find someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 to buy them. But not that long ago, lots of us were reveling in the \"Peak TV\" era \u2014 a time when inventive TV programming was plentiful and, crucially, popular. A time when you could watch \"The Sopranos\" on HBO, \"Friday Night Lights\" on NBC, and \"The Shield\" on FX. This was also a time when Kevin Reilly had great jobs in TV, where he steered programming at networks including NBC, FX, Fox, and Turner \u2014 and had his hands on all the shows I just mentioned. That run ended in 2000, when Reilly was re-orged out of what was then called WarnerMedia. Today, Reilly is in AI, of course: He recently became CEO of Kartel, a startup that's supposed to help big brands use the tech. But in a recent episode of my Channels podcast, I talked to him about life during TV's latest (and possibly last) golden age \u2014 and whether he thinks it will ever come back. (Spoiler: There's a reason he's in AI now.) You can read an edited excerpt from our conversation below, and listen to the whole thing here. Peter Kafka: You got to be a TV executive in what we now call the Peak TV era. What was that like? Kevin Reilly: When I got to network television, there were still these rules, like \"the good guy always wins\" and \"people don't want to watch depressing things on television.\" And then cable, when I went to FX, that was really one of the most fun chapters of my career because it was the very early days of basic cable. All of a sudden, we started doing \"The Shield\" and \"Nip\/Tuck\" and doing these things that the press had labeled \"HBO for basic cable.\" Prior to this, basic cable was mostly infomercials and reruns. Kevin Reilly: I was sitting there talking to great creators, and I was telling them we were HBO for basic cable. And on the monitor above my head was \"Cops\" running 24 hours a day, keeping the lights on. I was like, \"Don't look at the monitor.\" But all of a sudden, we were able to do stuff that really wasn't fit for broadcast by being very particular and being a little bit more forward. Around the same time, streaming popped up, and Netflix debuted \"House of Cards\" in 2013 as an explicitly HBO-style show. There was a lot of fascination with streaming but also dismissiveness: Jeff Bewkes, who was running Time Warner at the time, famously dissed Netflix as \"the Albanian army.\" Did you believe that back then? I think Jeff is an extraordinary leader, and I loved working for him. At the time, though, I think he had to do what he needed to do. You don't think he was really dismissive of Netflix? It was just something he had to say? I think at that point, throughout the entire business, everyone was dismissive of Netflix. \"We're picking these guys' pockets. They're gonna go out of business. We're selling them all the stuff that we can't sell. They're idiots.\" But at the same time, Netflix was all anybody was talking about, all day long. I remember flying to Detroit to talk to a big [advertising] client for one of our series. It was going to be a $50 million, $60 million transaction. And all they were talking about was Netflix. They were buying advertising, and then telling me how all their kids are only watching things on their phones all day long. And I was like, \"Isn't this ironic that you, an advertiser, are talking about a non-advertising-based service and how your kids don't watch TV anymore?\" What did you think? I thought they would experiment and do stuff, but maybe not at scale. I mean, they don't have the system for that, and it's really hard. Well, first of all, they did what we did (at FX) \u2014 they took a page out of the HBO handbook: Fire the money cannon and say, \"Hey, we'll just dream. Bring us in your dreams. Do what you wanna do.\" Your last job in TV was at what was then called WarnerMedia, which had been purchased by AT&T, and there were a bunch of different justifications for that deal, but the real one turned out to be \"maybe Wall Street will give us a Netflix stock multiple,\" which never happened. Did you think that combination was going to work? I mean, the product itself works and has been a success. But to take the entirety of Time Warner, and then it was going to be a one-product system that we would single-handedly launch and build an ad play around it, and all of a sudden compete with Google and Netflix \u2026 I don't know that even Wall Street ever bought that narrative, no matter how hard we sold it. Two of your former employers \u2014 Comcast and WBD \u2014 are bidding for Paramount. Netflix is bidding too. There's going to be some kind of consolidation no matter what. Do you think that when all of this gets done that there's a future for traditional television, or do you think it becomes, in the end, a subset of a bigger tech platform? I'd love to be able to just give you the knee-jerk answer, \"Of course, there'll always be traditional television.\" I think unfortunately, everybody waited too long to figure out how we were going to prop it up. So will it have a very long tail on it, like radio? The heyday of radio went away and we still have radio. I believe it will be around in some fashion. And as some of these assets get shed or reinvented \u2014 yeah, they might end up having a little bit more life in some ways than we thought they did. And radio became podcasts\u2026 Exactly. So there's always new expressions of it. But retooling traditional businesses, especially while you've got to pull the profit out from underneath, is really difficult. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Whatever the phrase refers to, a group of Finnish lawyers want control of it for video game purposes A trademark for Control Resonant has been applied for in Europe by a law firm who've represented Alan Wake developers Remedy on numerous previous occasions. This application's been lodged not long before The Game Awards and is to permit the phrase to be used in relation to games, but at the moment it's still a mystery what exact sort of Control-related thing it refers to. The trademark, spotted by MP1ST, was applied for yesterday - November 27th - through the European Union's Intellectual Property Office. If granted, the mark would allow Control Resonant to be used by the new holders in relation to video game software and hardware, as well as \"audio, video and multimedia production\" (something that covers the likes of TV series and films). Some likely merch-related bits including clothing, lanyards, printed books, and posters are also part of it. The trademark doesn't list Remedy's name directly, but it has been filed by the Finnish branch of a law firm called Nordia. A search on Nordia's website shows they've acted on Remedy's behalf numerous times in the recent past, including advising on the company's stock exchange listing and helping negotiate the partnership Remedy shook hands on with Annapurna Pictures in 2024. Control 2's development's been underway for a little while, so there's a chance this trademark could be related to that. However, the fact the listing covers TV and film adaptations, something Annapurna got permission to pursue with both Control and Alan Wake in that partnership deal from last year, means that this listing could also be about something along those lines. Either way, you'd expect there to be plenty of merch to buy, so that aspect doesn't help point in either direction. Beyond that, there's not much to be read into Control Resonant as a potential name, at least from where I'm sitting. Resonant almost certainly has something to do with the resonance, that being what the Federal Bureau of Control dub the strange energy which powers all of the game's paranatural weirdness. All that really tells us is that this Control thing will be a Control thing. Breaking news. You heard it here first. For now, we'll just have to sit tight and see when Remedy whip out an explanation or reveal for this trademarked thing. Maybe hold off on buying a new lanyard until they do.  Control   PS4,              Xbox One,              PC   Control 2   PS5,              Xbox Series X\/S,              PC           Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in                 Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.        \u00a9 2025 Rock Paper Shotgun, an IGN Entertainment, Inc. brand. 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

{"date":"2025-11-28","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. 17 hours ago  Samsung is expected to launch a dual-folding foldable, informally dubbed the Galaxy tri-fold, before the end of the year. We\u2019ve previously seen price-related leaks, but the latest rumor suggests an even lower price. Don\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Korean blogger yeux1122 reported on Naver that the Galaxy tri-fold device will retail for roughly 3.6 million won (~$2,446) in its home market. That would be significantly cheaper than recent leaked pricing, which hinted at a 4 million won ($2,718) price tag. The blogger suggested that this info may have come from an \u201cinternal sales channel announcement,\u201d but didn\u2019t provide any more details regarding the source. So we\u2019d still recommend taking this latest pricing claim with a pinch of salt. This rumored price would still be a significant premium over the already pricey Galaxy Z Fold 7, which costs ~$1,616 in Korea. However, this would be an easier pill to swallow than a near-$3,000 price tag. In any event, the new Galaxy foldable is expected to have a 10-inch dual-folding screen, a 6.5-inch cover display, a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and a ~5,600mAh battery. It\u2019s also believed that the foldable could have the same rear camera setup as the Z Fold 7, namely a 200MP main camera, 12MP ultrawide lens, and 10MP 3x telephoto camera.
