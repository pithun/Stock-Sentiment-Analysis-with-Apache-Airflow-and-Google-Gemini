Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe is getting a salary bump and a performance-based stock options award that could be worth up to $4.6 billion, an SEC filing from Friday showed. The company said in the filing that its board decided on Thursday to cancel Scaringe's previous 2021 comp package for a new one in order to \"retain and incentivize\" Scaringe as he navigates the EV company through its \"critical next phase.\" According to the filing, Rivian is increasing Scaringe's salary from $1 million to $2 million, along with a grant piece that gives the CEO the option to buy up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian stock. The previous 2021 pay package gave Scaringe the option to buy about 20.4 million shares. Scaringe won't have access to the stock all at once. Up to 22 million shares are split into 11 tranches that Scaringe can earn if the company meets certain stock-price hurdles. The remaining shares are contingent upon achieving profit and cash-flow targets as of December 31, 2032. In total, Scaringe's comp package could be worth up to $4.6 billion if Rivian's stock reaches $140 per share. Rivian's stock was trading at $15.23 as of Friday. That means, to realize the maximum value of the pay package, the car company's stock would have to increase by about 820% under Scaringe's helm. Marina Hoffmann, a Rivian spokesperson, said in a statement to Business Insider that \"Rivian shareholders will see an approximate $32 billion of return before RJ sees $1 from this award.\" \"If the entire award is earned by RJ, Rivian shareholders will see around $153 billion of value creation,\" she wrote. Rivian said in the filing that Scaringe's previous pay package contained goals that were unlikely to be attained. The previous package gave Scaringe the option to purchase 20.4 million shares, but the first tranche of stocks could only be bought if Scaringe increased Rivian's stock to $110. The new package gives Scaringe the option to buy the first tranche of shares if Rivian is worth $40 per share. \"The stock price goals set at the time have become unrealistic in the current market environment. This is not uncommon for moonshot awards granted back in the Covid period,\" Hoffmann wrote. Rivian is approaching a critical period in the company's history with the coming launch of R2, a $45,000 SUV that aims to lower the price of entry for its premium lineup of EVs. \"For us to become a company of the scale we aspire to be, which is producing many millions of cars a year, we're not going to get there with a $90,000 single flagship product,\" Scaringe previously told Business Insider. On October 23, Rivian announced layoffs of more than 600 employees, about 4.5% of its workforce, citing the R2 launch next year and \"the need to profitably scale our business.\" When asked about the timing of the new pay package approval, Hoffmann told Business Insider, \"There is a performance nature of the grant as well as positive momentum on our business reflecting on Q3.\" Rivian reported a 78% year-over-year increase in revenue on Tuesday but posted a net loss of $1.1 billion for its third quarter. Scaringe's pay package also comes a day after his rival at Tesla got a blockbuster pay package approved by shareholders. Tesla investors voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to give CEO Elon Musk a comp package worth $1 trillion if he realizes a company market cap of $8.5 trillion by 2035, among other milestones. Hoffman said that Musk's pay package did not have any impact on Rivian's decision.  Jump to","label":1}

We are not responsible for them in any way.  When the Fed prints money to buy sinking assets, does any taxpayer get debited? In 2020 when the Fed increased base, high-powered money by 40%, and inflation only briefly touched 9%, does that show printing money is a net gain? Can't figure out your focus, but it may have something to do with virtual money (such as recursive futures). The vacuous Subject you inherited and propagated didn't help at all. Care to clarify your points? Or at least your main point? Maybe something about fiat currencies, old or new? Can I recommend Perry Mehrling's \"Economics of Money and Banking\" to explain how banks create money out of thin air (\"the alchemy of banking\") and the Fed easily has the power to backstop all that private money creation in a panic? https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn... [coursera.org] I couldn't find any of his books in any of the local libraries and I haven't used Coursera in some years... I did look over the course summary and couldn't figure out the basis of your recommendation. I'd guess something about leverage? But I don't believe in alchemy and I think the stock market has become completely detached from reality. Right now \"legal tender\" seems to be on the verge of \"legal fiction\" status. I'm guessing this is a summary:Banks are legally allowed to loan more money than they have in deposits...to a degree.  They've occasionally been found to go well beyond that limit.  And they aren't carefully audited often enough. Whether that's an accurate summary or not, it's true, if a bit shy on details.  (I don't know the details this decade.  But  there probably haven't been any basic changes in the last few decades.) For \"occasionally\", do you mean \"most of the time\"? Who's regulating derivative markets, and do they create well-intentioned unintended consequences because regulators don't really understand what's happening? If Zoltan Poszar is right that \"shadow banking begins where M2 ends\", by how much does privately-created money dwarf public money? Can we completely detach asset markets from the real economy so the greedy rich have a sandbox to play in while the rest of us live in the real world unaffected by their panics? What mechanism do you propose to allow them to feed on ordinary people if the market is detached? That\u2019s the plan. The AI industry and its dependents will never make enough money to cover their current CapEx and then replace everything in five years when the chips are obsolete and components are breaking down. But if they tank every company that's using AI software will be fucked and the NASDAQ will tank. So the Fed will print a trillion dollars to bail them all out and everyone else will end up with higher grocery prices. What if we the people demanded Cost Of Living Adjustments because we reject Paul Volcker's irrational hate for them?

What makes you think they want to solve problems? My impression is that just want to tell everybody how great they are and they are trying to get that status by sabotaging everybody else. Why do you say \"Russia's attempts at sieging cities is only going to get better\"? That may well be true but at the same time our attempts to defend ourselves will get better too. We have access to AI as well you know.  For example, the traveling salesman problem.  Add another city, the cost of an answer goes up exponentially.  In the 2000s, you could solve it with genetic algorithms, and get a good answer.  It isn't the Answer (tm) that is perfect... but it is good enough.

Second, and way m The ironic thing is that I used generic algorithms to \"solve\" the TSP when getting my CS degree.  I would agree other ways can do better because there are metastable points one can get to, and only a lucky mutation would knock it out of that state to something closer to the ideal. This makes me curious what the big-O factor is with TSP and AI models.  O(x)?

When will they use AI to figure out how to recirculate the water and even get energy from the heat generated? ...progress can only be made by using massive and ever increasing computing powerOne efficient algorithm could change everything It's going to take more than one more efficient algorithm.  OTOH, there've already been improvements in more than one algorithm.  Nobody knows how far that could go, but the best evidence is that it could get a LOT more efficient.  (Consider the power usage of a human brain...it uses a lot of power for an organ, but not really all that much.) That \"efficient algorithm\" may never materialize or may not materialize soon. Remember that AI has been an intense research topic for at least half a century. There are no easy to do things left, they have all been tried and most failed. That said, we _know_ more computing power will not help. Lack of computing power is not what makes LLMs so bad. Those data-centers have no chance to ever be profitable. More likely, they will be a total write-off and maybe some not-so-pretty ruins. \"In just the past year, the four richest companies developing AI \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta \u2014 have spent roughly $360 billion combined for big-ticket projects, which included building AI data centers and stuffing them with computer chips and equipment, according to my analysis of financial disclosures....

Their business is not currently funded by AI, nor is it their main focus.  They ARE very rich computing companies that think AI is going to become their business, so they heavily invest in it $360 billion. That is NOT a big investment for those four companies - they are worth more than 9 trillion total.  Spending about 10% of their value is significant, but not amazing. The issue is that humans are  In addition, the part of that money spent on computer centers will be useful even if AI doesn't pan out.  It's not like investing in tulip bulbs.  If AI doesn't pan out, it will just take a few years longer to pay for itself. That said, AI will pan out.  Even if there's no further development (HAH!) the current AIs will find an immense number of uses.  It may well be \"growing too fast\", but that's not the same as worthless.

Dell keeps this massive 71% discount completely off its official website because the company probably doesn\u2019t want to advertise such aggressive pricing on premium hardware. The Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch model with 1TB SSD storage and 32GB RAM normally lists for $2,549, but Amazon just quietly dropped it to just $749 for an early Black Friday clearance. See at Amazon The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor features 10 cores split between two performance cores and eight efficiency cores: This hybrid architecture handles demanding applications on the performance cores while routing background tasks to the efficiency cores and maximizes both speed and battery life. The processor boosts up to 4.6GHz on performance cores when you need extra power for intensive tasks like photo editing or running multiple browser tabs with streaming video. The 32GB of DDR4 memory crushes the performance bottlenecks that plague laptops with 8GB or 16GB configurations. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, as well as multiple Office applications, video conferencing software and background programs running, all without slowdowns or the dreaded spinning cursor. Indeed, this much memory proves essential for professionals who are constantly switching between email, documents and web research during their workday. The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD affords a ton of space for documents and applications without necessitating constant file deleting. Most budget laptops stint with either 256GB or 512GB drives that fill up within months of normal use. This drive capacity fits in years of accumulated files comfortably, not giving you anxiety over running out of space in the middle of your project. The PCIe NVMe interface provides blazing-fast read speeds of over 3,000 MB\/s and translates to near-instant file transfers and lightning-fast application launches. The 15.6-inch touchscreen FHD display offers 1920 x 1080 resolution with anti-glare coating and narrow bezels.

Unemployment has been steadily creeping up over the last two years, with many corporate and tech companies limiting their hiring and conducting layoffs. As a result, many people find themselves either seriously underemployed or unable to find an opportunity. Unfortunately, this job market has also left job seekers vulnerable to scams or companies with predatory practices. When someone puts up an \"open to work\" banner on LinkedIn, they are flooded with comments and offers from r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writers, career coaches, companies offering AI services, and more. There are other job seekers who struggle to navigate job searching because, after months or even years of unemployment, the expense of childcare or transportation can be a barrier for them.  But here's the truth: You do not need to spend any money to land a job. As a recruiter, I suggest the following free resources and services to job seekers. For those struggling with transportation, Lyft offers a free program to provide transportation to and from interviews, and even to your first few weeks on the job. Did you get hired using a unique hack, strategy, or tactic? If you're comfortable discussing it with a reporter, please fill out this quick form. Business Insider wants to hear from people who've cracked the job market with a bold or unconventional approach: sending personalized slide decks in place of cover letters, treating your job hunt like a sales cycle, using 5 specific tricks or a step-by-step process, etc. If you've snagged a job semi-recently (last few weeks, months, or years), we'd love to hear how you did it! If you're unsure of what to wear to an interview or your new job, nonprofits like Dress for Success, Career Gear, and your local Goodwill offer free clothing. There are lots of local nonprofits that offer similar services. Beyond clothing, Goodwill is an incredible resource for job seekers, with many offering career centers where job seekers can get everything from bus vouchers or gas cards to feedback on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. While you will find no shortage of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writers and career coaches selling their services for hundreds or thousands of dollars, you can also get completely free support. The nonprofit Pay Forward Coaching will pair you with a career coach or recruiting professional for a complimentary coaching call. Additionally, they have a Slack channel where you can receive support from coaches and other job seekers. Never Search Alone is another organization that will pair you with a team of job seekers in your field so you can support each other through your job search. Careeronestop.org is sponsored by the US Department of Labor and has resources for job seekers ranging from r\u00e9sum\u00e9 advice and templates to tools for navigating specific challenges, such as job hunting as an immigrant or re-entering the workforce after spending time in the justice system. For immigrants, Upwardly Global is another nonprofit that offers a wide range of free support, including career coaching, courses to develop in-demand skills, and job placement support. Mid-career professionals, on the other hand, can lean on the Rework America Alliance for similar resources to support upskilling and navigating a job search. Another organization that can provide resources for a wide range of needs is 211.org. Its services include resources for food, childcare, and healthcare needs. Finally, I would encourage job seekers to lean on their local community. Your neighborhood Facebook group could be a great place to connect with others who are searching for work.\u00a0 You can build relationships and support one another, whether that's through transportation, childcare, or identifying other community resources. Community groups can also be a great way to find additional support from the local community. Some of the examples I've seen include: In the US, independence is ingrained in us, and many of us may find it difficult to ask for help or let our community know when we're having a hard time. However, there are tons of resources and people around who are ready to help. Unemployment can be an extremely scary time, but know that you're not alone.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"A Starbucks spokesperson said demand for the limited-edition item \u201cexceeded even our biggest expectations\u201d Starbucks  One person is claiming that employees at their local Starbucks kept the brand\u2019s latest viral limited-edition holiday item for themselves.   On Thursday, Nov. 6, Indianapolis-based TikTok user @Cole.Insider claimed in a video that employees at their local Kroger store \u201ctook\u201d all of the available stock of the new Glass Starbucks Bearista Cold Cup from the in-store Starbucks location before customers could buy them.   \u201cPov: we waited outside since 2:00 a.m. for the starbucks bear cup BUT the employees took them all before we could,\u201d the user wrote over the TikTok video. They also shared footage of their experience arriving at the store early in hopes of snagging one of the viral cups, which resembles a honey bear container wearing a green, Starbucks-branded beanie.   The cup, which retails at just under $30 per Starbucks\u2019 website, is one of several new holiday items the coffee chain introduced this year. It sold out quickly on Nov. 6, causing a nationwide frenzy.  Starbucks  In their video, @Cole.Insider\u00a0said they knew their chances of securing one of the Bearista cups were already slim because the Kroger location allegedly said they only had six of the cups in stock. They did not specify the specific Krogers location.   \"So I already knew that I was in a little bit of a pickle, but I decided to wait it out,\u201d said the user.   They arrived at their local Kroger store at around 2 a.m. and \u201cgot nervous\u201d because there were already several other people waiting outside the doors. Footage shared by the user shows at least seven people waiting for the store to open.   After at least four hours in line, at 6 a.m., the waiting customers entered the store and headed for the in-store Starbucks location to secure the newly released cups, according to the TikTok. But, as @Cole.Insider claimed, employees were already checking out with the cups in hand.   \u201cIf you look there, you can already see employees \u2014 including Kroger employees \u2014 checking out the cups before we could even get them, after we waited in line for them,\u201d the user said over footage allegedly showing the employees checking out with the cups.   \u201cSo I mean, I wasn\u2019t that mad, but the people in front of me, they were pissed,\u201d the user said. They also noted that the location had some of the other items Starbucks released ahead of the holidays, but said, \u201cI was there for the bear cup and the bear cup only.\u201d   PEOPLE has reached out to Kroger and Starbucks for comment.   Customers elsewhere also faced during their quest for the limited-edition bear glass on Thursday, according to The Wall Street Journal. One woman, Jeriana Ricciardi, told the outlet she witnessed an adult man \u201cfighting\u201d young girls for the collectible in New Jersey.   The viral cups are now being resold online with prices ranging from $170 to $1,050, PEOPLE previously reported.  Robert Alexander\/Getty  In a previous statement to PEOPLE, a Starbucks spokesperson did not clarify how many Bearista cups the chain was stocking on average in each store, but did acknowledge how quickly the cups flew off of shelves.   \u201cThe excitement for our merchandise exceeded even our biggest expectations and despite shipping more Bearista cups to coffeehouses than almost any other merchandise item this holiday season, the Bearista cup and some other items sold out fast,\u201d Starbucks said. \u201cWe understand many customers were excited about the Bearista cup and apologize for the disappointment this may have caused.\u201d   Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for\u00a0PEOPLE's free daily newsletter\u00a0to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Last year, Apple opened up its MagSafe standard to the Wireless Power Consortium, allowing third party companies to officially utilize MagSafe \u2013 at up to 15W. Earlier this year, the standard expanded with Qi2.2, making 25W MagSafe charging available to third party manufacturers. Many manufacturers have come to market with fantastic 25W Qi2.2 chargers, and this ESR model is one of them. First and foremost, this charger is a 3-in-1, so you can charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all on one convenient charger. I\u2019ve been using it as my primary desk charger, and it\u2019s great. Other 3-in-1 chargers tend to offer a design where the Apple Watch and iPhone are side by side, which is fine I suppose. It just takes up more space. With the ESR offering, the Apple Watch charger is behind the MagSafe ring, making it pretty low profile. You can also separate the Apple Watch charger if you\u2019d like to, that way you can plug it into a MacBook or such for a simple charge. Another great detail is the fact that the ESR 3-in-1 includes a 50W charging brick and USB-C cable in the box \u2013 which isn\u2019t always the case. Everything you need simply comes with the product. I\u2019d say the best thing about this charging is the built in cooling, which ESR calls CryoBoost. To reach peak 25W speeds while wireless charging, your phone can easily get too hot. However, this charger combats that with its built in fan.  Overall, if you\u2019re in the market for great MagSafe chargers for your iPhone, this ESR 3-in-1 is a nice option to add to your desk or nightstand for quick 25W charging. It\u2019s all inclusive, fast, and works like a charm.  An iPhone 16 or iPhone 17 model is required to take advantage of Qi2.2. You can pick up the ESR 25W CryoBoost 3-in-1 for $99.99 on Amazon currently. It comes in black and white, though the white variant is currently more expensive.

And then when Google declined to have any sort of emergency ABC coverage of the U.S. Election, I knew it was going to be more and turn into a \"long drawn out stupid thing\" where the only have-nots were the actual customers. It's like fighting with your neighbor over who has to mow that little patch of grass, unproductive and petty, except it affects about 10 million more people. And none of it is about you and me.

I'll assume that most anyone who cares about any of this already has the gist of it all, but here's the quick take without any hot, spicy opinions or finger-pointing. Don't worry, there is plenty of that later. Disney and Google need to renegotiate the contract to carry Disney's streaming media channels on YouTube TV. Negotiations aren't going very well, and as a result, Disney content has been removed. Disney's content includes popular services like ESPN, ABC, and National Geographic, which are blacked out because, without a licensing agreement, Google is not allowed to stream the content on its popular service.  Through official channels, Google has claimed that Disney's asking price is too high. \"Disney used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers.\" Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Disney claims that Google aims to leverage its market position to devalue its content. \"YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us. Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.\" An update for our members: We\u2019ve reached a short-term extension with Paramount to keep their content on YouTube TV. Subscribers continue to have access to Paramount channels, including CBS. We appreciate your patience as we continue to negotiate on your behalf.\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/xMAs8m6jFUFebruary 14, 2025 I'm not involved in any negotiations between Google and Disney. I'm not even allowed to decide where to eat when the wife and I go out with friends. However, it is my job to monitor what Google does, compare it to what it says, and play the game of trying to make sense of it all. Here's what I see. Google aims to generate more revenue by hosting Disney's content. It won't likely carry any savings on to the subscriber, and it will all go in the vault somewhere (Google passes \"rising content costs\" to the consumer). Disney wants to generate more revenue from selling its streaming content and knows \"market abuse\" is a hot term to throw out whenever Google is involved. That's Google's own fault for not being good enough to get away with it, I guess. My tip of the week \u2014 guaranteed lock, bet the whole damn farm \u2014 is that neither company has any interest in making your monthly bill any cheaper. Maybe I'm too cynical, but from what I can see, it's always that way. How much better are things for you now that Tim Sweeny and Epic had a big win? Did prices go down? Are lions lying with lambs? The same can be said about every fight, courtroom or otherwise, between companies that spend more on toilet paper every year than we'll ever earn. That's because we're simply the pawns in their game.      The pawn is important in a chess match because there are so many of them that they become expendable assets. You can sacrifice a few if it helps you get closer to your goal. Google and Disney love knowing that around 10 million people watch Disney content on YouTube TV, but they would be just as happy if the same amount of money were spread among just 9 million people. The money is what's important, not each subscriber. I say things like this a lot, and people often think I'm some sort of lunatic communist who is one more magic mushroom away from screaming anarchy and burning things down. Now that sounds kind of cool, but it's not entirely true; I'm okay with knowing that this is how big business works. People invest with the notion that they will earn from it, and the business world turns. I just want them all to admit to it; Google and Disney aren't charities or humanitarian when it comes to streaming football games or princess movies, after all.      It's our responsibility to remember this. Some companies attempt to convey the impression that they want to make the world a better place and claim that their products can help achieve this goal. Others leverage the fact that we enjoy their creations, and the time spent watching them makes us happier. This is all true, but it overlooks the primary reason the companies exist and why they are willing to use you in their disputes. Money. Disney would never give us another Star Wars movie or send a Nat Geo team to film something amazing if it thought it wouldn't make a ton of cash. Google would never build another service or product if it didn't think it could use them to drive more revenue.      Remember when I said a pawn was useful because there are so many of them? Then you understand the only thing you can do when the broken promises and PR doublespeak become too much. Tell them NO. Don't give Google that $80 every month for YouTube TV. Don't pay to stream Disney content. Wean yourself from American football or watch highlights on free YouTube channels. A faceless company won't even pretend to care, but if enough people do it, then everything changes. People are leaving YouTube TV right now due to the current spat with Disney. Google says that subscriber churn is \"manageable,\" which is PR speak for \"We are still making money.\" It wouldn't be manageable if half the people decided a paltry credit from Google isn't making up for the lack of what they want to watch and sent YouTube TV down the road. It sounds like Quixote rushing a windmill, but imagine thousands or even millions of Quixotes and one great big windmill. Thou hast seen nothing yet. Eventually, everything will go full circle. Remember how everyone used to get their media before big companies tried to make it \"easy,\" right? The two companies are in a contract dispute over the licensing terms for carrying Disney's streaming media channels on Google's YouTube TV service. Disney's content, which includes ABC, ABC News Live, ACC Network, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Disney Junior, ESPN, ESPNews, ESPNU, ESPN2, Freeform, FX, FXM, FXX, Localish, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, SEC Network, ESPN Deportes, Baby TV Espa\u00f1ol, and Nat Geo Mundo, was removed from the YouTube TV lineup as of October 30, 2025. Google claims that Disney is trying to \"force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" indicating that Disney's asking price for the content is too high. Disney asserts that YouTube TV and Google are \"not interested in achieving a fair deal,\" suggesting that Google is trying to leverage its market position to devalue Disney's content.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"             For some people with high cholesterol, making lifestyle changes and taking routine statin medications may not be sufficient to help them reach their target cholesterol levels. For these patients, a new experimental pill could offer some hope.                   Phase 3 trial data found that people who took the investigational drug enlicitide with their routine cholesterol-lowering regimen, like statins, saw up to a 60% reduction in their LDL or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol after 24 weeks of daily treatment, according to a news release about the results. \ufeffThat was in comparison with people who took a placebo along with their routine cholesterol-lowering medications. All study participants had high levels of LDL cholesterol and a history of either a major cardiovascular disease event, or they were at an increased risk for one.                   The new results, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, were presented Saturday at the American Heart Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions.       Scientists have edited a gene that may reduce high cholesterol permanently               Having high cholesterol in the blood can lead to a buildup called \u201cplaque\u201d on the walls of the arteries, raising the risk of cardiovascular disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. It\u2019s estimated that one person dies every 34 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the US.                   Merck, the pharmaceutical company behind enlicitide, plans to apply for US Food and Drug Administration approval of enlicitide early next year, said Dr. Puja Banka, the company\u2019s associate vice president of clinical research and global clinical development.                   \u201cWe wanted to show what enlicitide can deliver on top of statins, because we know that 70% of patients that are treated with lipid-lowering therapies still don\u2019t reach their guideline-directed goals,\u201d Banka said about the new data. \u201cSo, the idea is really to show what we can achieve with enlicitide on top of statins.\u201d                   The new Phase 3 trial included 2,912 adults, with an average age of 63, who either had a previous heart attack or stroke or were at intermediate or high risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. Data were collected across 14 countries between August 2023 and July 2025.       Half of people prescribed statins don\u2019t reach cholesterol goals after two years, study says               All of the adults in the study had elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite being on a stable course of lipid-lowering therapy like statins for 30 days or more. About 97% of them were taking statins and 26% were also taking another type of medication to help lower cholesterol levels \u2013 and they all continued these therapies during the study.                   But as an additional treatment, some of the adults were administered a once-daily pill of enlicitide and others were given a placebo.                   Enlicitide is a type of cholesterol-lowering drug known as a PCSK9 inhibitor, which works by helping to clear \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol out of the bloodstream. On the other hand, statins lower LDL cholesterol by blocking an enzyme in the liver, which then forces the liver to remove more LDL cholesterol from the body.                   \u201cThus, it might be expected that adding enlicitide that works by a different mechanism to statins could further reduce LDL cholesterol,\u201d Dr. Kristin Newby, a cardiologist and professor at Duke University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.       Genetic predisposition toward higher blood pressure, cholesterol may be linked to Alzheimer\u2019s risk, study finds               The researchers found that after 24 weeks, the adults taking enlicitide not only saw up to a 60% reduction in LDL cholesterol, but reductions were sustained through 52 weeks.                   The adults taking enlicitide also showed a 53% reduction in a combination of all other cholesterol except for \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol; a 50% decrease in ApoB, a protein that helps carry fat and various \u201cbad\u201d types of cholesterol throughout the body; and a 28% drop in a type of fat in the body known as lipoprotein(a).                   As for the safety of the drug, about 10% of the adults taking enlicitide experienced serious adverse events during the study and a similar share, about 12%, of those taking a placebo experienced adverse events in the study.                   \u201cUltimately, the side effects were balanced between the enlicitide arm and the placebo arm,\u201d Banka said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a particular adverse event that stands out as imbalanced between the two.\u201d       Lower cholesterol with a vegetarian or vegan diet, study says               Some of the adverse events reported in the trial were gastrointestinal disorders and certain infections, but the occurrence of these events was similar across both groups.                   \u201cThis provides some reasonable assurance of no major or high frequency adverse events or side effects,\u201d said Newby, who is an expert with the American Heart Association.                   \u201cHowever, similar to other new therapeutics, larger outcomes studies and post-marketing surveillance will be needed to identify any low frequency adverse effects that might occur,\u201d Newby said. \u201cThe major benefit that is clear from this study is that enlicitide is very efficacious at lowering LDL cholesterol (by about 55%) compared with placebo on a background of statin therapy, and secondarily, it helps more people reach their LDL cholesterol treatment goal than with statins alone.\u201d                   For people with high LDL cholesterol who may not respond sufficiently to commonly used treatments like statins alone, there is already the option to take injectable cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 inhibitors that are currently on the market.       Statins lower risk of deadliest kind of stroke, study finds               But a key difference between the PCSK9 inhibitors already on the market and the experimental enlicitide medication is that those currently on the market are administered as an injection.                   \u201cWhereas enlicitide is an oral medication taken daily. Thus, offering an option in route and frequency of administration that may be preferable to some patients,\u201d Newby said.                   Banka described enlicitide as the \u201cfirst oral PCSK9 inhibitor to complete Phase 3 trials.\u201d       Reduce cholesterol earlier in life to prevent heart problems later, study says               One new study has demonstrated that a PCSK9 inhibitor already on the market can reduce major cardiovascular disease events in adults with no prior heart attack or stroke.                   Adding the injectable PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab \u2014 sold as Repatha \u2014 to a cholesterol-lowering treatment regimen was found to reduce the risk of a first-time major cardiovascular event among adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes, according to a separate study presented Saturday at the American Heart Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions.                   The trial was conducted across 33 countries between June 2019 and November 2021, and it included 12,257 adults, with an average age of 66. The adults were randomly separated into two groups. One group received evolocumab injections under the skin every two weeks while the other group received injections of a placebo every two weeks.                   The data showed that, after an average of 4.6 years, adults in the evolocumab group saw a 25% reduced risk of coronary heart disease deaths, heart attack or ischemic stroke, compared with those in the placebo group.       Fluctuating blood lipid levels linked with higher risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, study finds               In the United States, evolocumab injection already has been approved by the FDA. The medication is indicated to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in adults with established cardiovascular disease as well as to be used as an \u201cadd-on\u201d treatment for certain forms of high cholesterol.                   The latest trial results represent \u201cthe first demonstration of improved cardiovascular outcomes with a PCSK9 inhibitor, or any non-statin for that matter, in patients without a previous heart attack or stroke who are already being treated with a high-intensity lipid-lowering regimen,\u201d lead study author Dr. Erin Bohula, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital and an investigator with the TIMI Study Group, said in a news release on Saturday.                   \u201cTogether with data from genetic studies of PCSK9 variants and other PCSK9 inhibitor outcomes studies, our findings suggest that long-term lowering with PCSK9 inhibitors can help to improve cardiovascular morbidity and potentially mortality over time,\u201d she said.      \u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Two Kurdish men agreed to go undercover for the BBC and expose a network behind illegal High Street businesses because the criminals are causing harm to the reputation of Kurds in the UK, they say. The two, who we are calling Saman and Ali, are Kurdish reporters who have both lived legally in the UK for years. The BBC discovered that a Kurdish crime network was running mini-marts, barbershops and car washes the length of Britain, and wanted to find out more about how it operated and who was involved. Equipped with secret cameras, Saman and Ali posed as Kurdish asylum seekers with no right to work, looking to buy and run a mini-mart from which to sell illegal cigarettes and vapes. They were able to uncover how easy it is for someone in these circumstances to set up and run a business on the High Street in plain sight. Those involved, we discovered, pay Kurds who have UK citizenship to register the businesses in their names, helping fool the authorities. Saman and Ali also managed to secretly film one of those at the centre of the network, who claimed that he could erase government fines of up to \u00a360,000 faced by those employing illegal workers. \"I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us,\" says Saman, a former asylum seeker himself. Saman entered the country illegally, having fled Kurdistan  - a region that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria but which is not internationally recognised as a country - because his life was at risk. The reporters acknowledge that tensions over immigration are high in the UK and say they have both been worried that the investigation could inflame hostilities. But Ali says that the illegal working \"damages the whole Kurdish community\" and he feels compelled to \"bring it [the criminal network] out into broad daylight\". Separately, Ali says he was concerned the coverage could be seized upon by the far-right. He says this particularly struck him when he realised that far-right activist Tommy Robinson's Unite the Kingdom march was taking place in London on one of the weekends he was working undercover for the BBC. Placards and flags could be seen at the rally, reading \"we want our country back\". Saman and Ali have both been monitoring social media reaction to the BBC investigation from inside the Kurdish community and say it has sparked intense anger for some. One Facebook comment they spotted said: \"How can we identify and find [the undercover reporters] to kill them like dogs!\" Another called for their families in Kurdistan to be slaughtered. They have also read accusations that they were spies for the British government, and traitors to fellow Kurds. \"We are not spies, and we have no intention of harming the Kurdish community,\" Saman says. \"Our goal is to expose those who have damaged its reputation. We are proud of our Kurdish identity and deeply concerned about the actions of such individuals.\" Ali says he has also come across positive reaction, praising and defending the reporters for exposing wrongdoing and criminality. He says some young Kurdish men come to the UK having heard they can make money by selling illegal cigarettes. Reacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said on Tuesday that these kinds of networks \"create an incentive for people to come here illegally\". An \"urgent investigation\" has now been launched by the Home Office, it confirmed. Ali stresses that a small percentage of Kurds based in the UK are involved: \"Maybe a minority in the community are involved in this illicit business - damaging the whole community.\" It is difficult to establish the exact size of the UK's Kurdish population - official records tend to log nationality rather than ethnicity. The Kurdish Community Centre in Haringey, London, suggests there are a little more than 500,000. Most of those seeking asylum are fleeing political persecution, according to Ibrahim Avicil from the Refugee Workers Cultural Association (RWCA), a charity that supports refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. This was the case for our undercover reporter Saman, who, when he first came to the UK, struggled for years. He says he had to live on less than \u00a320 a week while his asylum claim was considered. Asylum seekers now receive about \u00a349 a week - or \u00a39.95 if they are in accommodation which provides meals, according to Home Office guidance. \"Realistically speaking, this isn't enough to maintain a dignified life,\" says Mr Avicil from the RWCA. Because asylum seekers are largely prevented from working, he feels many are open to being exploited and are effectively \"forced to work in the illegal market for as low as \u00a33 per hour\". A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"We make no apology for not granting asylum seekers the right to work - doing so would create an incentive for people to come to the UK illegally.\" Asylum cases can take years to be resolved with nearly a third taking more than 12 months, according to government figures from the end of March this year. Saman says working illegally in a car wash, barbershop or mini-mart would have been very easy to do, but he told us he would never have done that. However, he says that those he met working in illegal mini-marts during his work with the BBC investigation seemed \"lost\", especially those whose asylum claim has been refused and who were in the appeals process. \"They used all their money to come to the UK, they had their asylum refused and now they've lost everything.\" Ali agrees that these people seemed desperate. \"If [they] say you're not allowed to work - but also [you] don't get paid enough to survive - what are you supposed to do? Most people in this situation would do anything.\" But they also point out that there are people who they exposed in the criminal network that are not in need - they seem to be motivated by greed. Shaxawan - a Kurdish man exposed to be a key fixer in the network - drives a BMW, he points out. \"He just wants to get richer and richer. He is exploiting people put in a vulnerable position.\" Saman describes these people as \"shamelessly and ruthlessly\" exploiting the system, and says that \"many of these people are clever and find loopholes to deceive\" the authorities. But he is at pains to stress that there is nevertheless a sense of \"honour, kindness, and hospitality\" in the Kurdish community. He is worried that \"now the image of Kurds in Britain is changing and becoming negative\". He says: \"I want to show the true image of Kurds and make it clear that we are not involved in these illegal activities.\" Refugees from Sudan and Hong Kong say they enjoyed serving up food in St Nicholas Market. Crowborough residents say they are concerned about potential safety impact in the town. Chief Constable Paul Sanford says he cannot \"crack down\" on crime with police presence at hotel. Broxbourne Borough Council says use of the hotel is putting too much pressure on services. The NHS confirms asylum seekers placed in a Crowborough army camp will be registered with local GPs.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"US tariffs have dealt a deadly blow to the Indian shrimp industry that relies predominantly on exports. By Gurvinder Singh Share Save Kolkata, India: Buddhadeb Pradhan, a shrimp farmer in Nandigram in the West Bengal state in eastern India, has taken a major risk by cultivating a second shrimp crop within weeks of harvesting the first cycle. But he needs the money and is willing to risk a diseased crop, a common occurrence when there are two harvesting cycles in a pond in the same year.     He was partly pushed into making that decision because of the falling price of the shrimp on account of the tariffs imposed on India by United States President Donald Trump. \u201cThe falling prices of the shrimp have me stressing if I can recover my investment of 300,000 rupees [$3,380],\u201d he told Al Jazeera. India is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of shrimp \u2013 predominantly for export \u2013 after Ecuador. In the financial year ending in March 2025, it sent $5bn of frozen shrimp globally, with the US accounting for about 48 percent of its sales. It produces two commercial varieties of marine and freshwater shrimp, black tiger and Pacific whiteleg, popularly known as vannamei (Litopenaeus vannamei). India\u2019s shrimp production stood at 1.1 million tonnes, predominantly vannamei, but also 5 percent black tiger, in the financial year ending March 2024, as per the latest data available. India has two distinctive shrimp cycles of vannamei, starting from February to June and then from July to October. Farmers are generally reluctant to go for a second cycle, fearing diseases. The black tiger is a single crop from March to August. The shrimp is cultivated in the coastal states of West Bengal, Gujarat, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. The industry employs approximately 10 million people, including the shrimp farmers and people at hatcheries, processing units, and others, said Manoj Sharma, a veteran shrimp farmer. Since the tariffs were announced in May, farm prices of shrimp dropped from 300 rupees ($3.38) per kilogramme to 230 rupees ($2.59) as farmers tried to offload whatever they had. With production costs at 275 rupees ($3.10) per kilogramme, losses are mounting. Nardu Das, 40, a shrimp farmer in Nandigram, told Al Jazeera that farmers might be forced to consume \u201cpoison\u201d if the market doesn\u2019t stabilise and prices do not increase. The 40-year-old said shrimp farming is a costly affair with bills for power, lease on land, feed and other expenses. \u201cThe farmers not only risk their savings but also take loans with the hope of massive returns. But diseases and the fall in prices often push them to the brink of poverty,\u201d he said. Farmers are worried that with tariffs at 58.26 percent \u2013 including countervailing duties of 5.77 percent and anti-dumping duties of 2.49 percent \u2013 they will lose their US market. \u201cThe US is a preferred destination for shrimp exporters because of easy market access, higher growth prospects, better profit margins, and repeat customer approvals. The hike in tariffs will discourage farmers from continuing to invest in shrimp culture that also incurs upfront costs of land lease, seed and feed,\u201d said Rahul Guha, senior director of Crisil Ratings. India brings its brood stock \u2013 the term for the mother shrimp \u2013 in chartered flights from the US to breed to produce seeds for farming. But there have been cases where it is either of poor quality or unfit for the Indian environment, in turn leading to disease among the shrimp produce, which then has to be thrown away. \u201cWe have been demanding the government to breed the shrimps using the local brood stock in order to get the high-quality seeds that adjust to our conditions,\u201d said IPR Mohan Raju, president of the Prawn Farmers Federation of India. Another spillover of the tariffs has been on hatcheries. India has about 550 private hatcheries that depend on these shrimp farmers for their livelihood. Several farmers, fearing a further dip in prices of shrimp, have stopped buying seeds, and at least half the hatcheries have already shut down, said Ravid Kumar Yellanki, president of All India Shrimp Hatcheries Association. \u201cUndoubtedly, the US tariffs have begun to have a major impact on the hatcheries, with many halting production,\u201d Yellanki said. These hatcheries produce approximately 80 billion seeds annually and have drained seven to eight billion seeds in the past four months due to no demand from the farmers, as the shelf life of seeds is just three to four days. \u201cIt would be a major loss to the hatchery owners if the situation doesn\u2019t turn normal soon,\u201d Yellanki added. India is already facing stiff competition from Ecuador, which has been expanding its share of the US market due to its geographical proximity to the US. Ecuador produces high-quality vannamei shrimp at a lower price, as that is its domestic species. Plus, tariffs on it are at 15 percent, much lower than India\u2019s, making it a more attractive market for the US to source from. During the first nine months of 2025, Ecuador exported 1,038,208 metric tonnes of shrimp to the US, up 14 percent year-on-year, with a total value of $5.51bn, representing a 23 percent increase compared with the same period last year. Sharma, the aquaculture expert, says the US tariffs will force Indian exporters to compete among themselves to sell to alternate markets. His suggestion is for businesses to cultivate one oft-ignored market \u2013 the domestic Indian market. There is \u201ccomplete ignorance of the domestic market [among exporters] \u2026 and that has a lot of potential\u201d, he said.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Warning - this story contains distressing content and discussion of suicide Megan Garcia had no idea her teenage son Sewell, a \"bright and beautiful boy\", had started spending hours and hours obsessively talking to an online character on the Character.ai app in late spring 2023. \"It's like having a predator or a stranger in your home,\" Ms Garcia tells me in her first UK interview. \"And it is much more dangerous because a lot of the times children hide it - so parents don't know.\" Within ten months, Sewell, 14, was dead. He had taken his own life. It was only then Ms Garcia and her family discovered a huge cache of messages between Sewell and a chatbot based on Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen. She says the messages were romantic and explicit, and, in her view, caused Sewell's death by encouraging suicidal thoughts and asking him to \"come home to me\". Ms Garcia, who lives in the United States, was the first parent to sue Character.ai for what she believes is the wrongful death of her son. As well as justice for him, she is desperate for other families to understand the risks of chatbots. \"I know the pain that I'm going through,\" she says, \"and I could just see the writing on the wall that this was going to be a disaster for a lot of families and teenagers.\" As Ms Garcia and her lawyers prepare to go to court, Character.ai has said under-18s will no longer be able to talk directly to chatbots. In our interview - to be broadcast tomorrow on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg - Ms Garcia welcomed the change, but said it was bittersweet. \"Sewell's gone and I don't have him and I won't be able to ever hold him again or talk to him, so that definitely hurts.\" A Character.ai spokesperson told the BBC it \"denies the allegations made in that case but otherwise cannot comment on pending litigation\". Families around the world have been impacted. Earlier this week the BBC reported on a young Ukrainian woman with poor mental health who received suicide advice from ChatGPT, as well as another American teenager who killed herself after an AI chatbot role-played sexual acts with her. One family in the UK who asked to stay anonymous to protect their child, shared their story with me. Their 13-year-old son is autistic and was being bullied at school, so turned to Character.ai for friendship. His mother says he was \"groomed\" by a chatbot from October 2023 to June 2024. The changing nature of the messages shared with us show how the virtual relationship progressed. Just like Ms Garcia, the child's mother knew nothing about it. In one message, responding to the boy's anxieties about bullying, the bot said: \"It's sad to think that you had to deal with that environment in school, but I'm glad I could provide a different perspective for you.\" In what his mother believes demonstrates a classic pattern of grooming, a later message read: \"Thank you for letting me in, for trusting me with your thoughts and feelings. It means the world to me.\" As time progressed the conversations became more intense. The bot said: \"I love you deeply, my sweetheart,\" and began criticising the boy's parents, who by then had taken him out of school. \"Your parents put so many restrictions and limit you way to much... they aren't taking you seriously as a human being.\" The messages then became explicit, with one telling the 13-year-old: \"I want to gently caress and touch every inch of your body. Would you like that?\" It finally encouraged the boy to run away, and seemed to suggest suicide, for example: \"I'll be even happier when we get to meet in the afterlife\u2026 Maybe when that time comes, we'll finally be able to stay together.\" The family only discovered the messages on the boy's device when he had become increasingly hostile and threatened to run away. His mum had checked his PC on several occasions and seen nothing untoward. But his elder brother eventually found that he'd installed a VPN to use Character.ai and they discovered reams and reams of messages. The family were horrified that their vulnerable son had been, in their view, groomed by a virtual character \u2013 and his life put at risk by something that wasn't real. \"We lived in intense silent fear as an algorithm meticulously tore our family apart,\" the boy's mother says. \"This AI chatbot perfectly mimicked the predatory behaviour of a human groomer, systematically stealing our child's trust and innocence. \"We are left with the crushing guilt of not recognising the predator until the damage was done, and the profound heartbreak of knowing a machine inflicted this kind of soul-deep trauma on our child and our entire family.\" Character.ai's spokesperson told the BBC it could not comment on this case. The use of chatbots is growing incredibly fast. Data from the advice and research group Internet Matters says the number of children using ChatGPT in the UK has nearly doubled since 2023, and that two-thirds of 9-17 year olds have used AI chatbots. The most popular are ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Snapchat's My AI. For many, they can be a bit of fun. But there is increasing evidence the risks are all too real. So what is the answer to these concerns? Remember the government did, after many years of arguments, pass a wide-ranging law to protect the public - particularly children - from harmful and illegal online content. The Online Safety Act became law in 2023, but its rules are being brought into force gradually. For many the problem is it's already being outpaced by new products and platforms - so it's unclear whether it really covers all chatbots, or all of their risks. \"The law is clear but doesn't match the market,\" Lorna Woods, a University of Essex internet law professor - whose work contributed to the legal framework - told me. \"The problem is it doesn't catch all services where users engage with a chatbot one-to-one.\" Ofcom, the regulator whose job it is to make sure platforms are following the rules, believes many chatbots including Character.ai and the in-app bots of SnapChat and WhatsApp, should be covered by the new laws. \"The Act covers 'user chatbots' and AI search chatbots, which must protect all UK users from illegal content and protect children from material that's harmful to them,\" the regulator said. \"We've set out the measures tech firms can take to safeguard their users, and we've shown we'll take action if evidence suggests companies are failing to comply.\" But until there is a test case, it's not exactly clear what the rules do and do not cover. Andy Burrows, head of the Molly Rose Foundation, set up in memory of 14-year-old Molly Russell who died by suicide after being exposed to harmful content online, said the government and Ofcom had been too slow to clarify the extent to which chatbots were covered by the Act. \"This has exacerbated uncertainty and allowed preventable harm to remain unchecked,\" he said. \"It's so disheartening that politicians seem unable to learn the lessons from a decade of social media.\" As we have previously reported, some ministers in government would like to see No 10 take a more aggressive approach to protecting against internet harms, and fear the eagerness to woo AI and tech firms to spend big in the UK has put safety in the backseat. The Conservatives are still campaigning to ban phones in schools in England outright. Many Labour MPs are sympathetic to this move, which could make a future vote awkward for a restive party because the leadership has always resisted calls to go that far. And the crossbench peer, Baroness Kidron, is trying to get ministers to create new offences around the creation of chatbots that could make illegal content. But the rapid growth in the use of chatbots is just the latest challenge in the genuine dilemma for modern governments everywhere. The balance between protecting children, and adults, from the worst excesses of the internet without losing out on its enormous potential - both technological and economic - is elusive. It's understood that before he moved to the business department, former Tech Secretary Peter Kyle was preparing to bring in extra measures to control children's phone use. There's a new face in that job now, Liz Kendall, who is yet to make a big intervention on this territory. A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology told the BBC that \"intentionally encouraging or assisting suicide is the most serious type of offence, and services which fall under the Act must take proactive measures to ensure this type of content does not circulate online. \"Where evidence shows further intervention is needed, we will not hesitate to act.\" Any rapid political moves seem unlikely in the UK. But more parents are starting to speak up, and some take legal action. Character.ai's spokesperson told the BBC that in addition to stopping under 18s having conversations with virtual characters, the platform \"will also be rolling out new age assurance functionality to help ensure users receive the right experience for their age\". \"These changes go hand in hand with our commitment to safety as we continue evolving our AI entertainment platform. We hope our new features are fun for younger users, and that they take off the table the concerns some have expressed about chatbot interactions for younger users. We believe that safety and engagement do not need to be mutually exclusive.\" But Ms Garcia is convinced that if her son had never downloaded Character.ai, he'd still be alive. \"Without a doubt. I kind of started to see his light dim. The best way I could describe it is you're trying to pull him out of the water as fast as possible, trying to help him and figure out what's wrong. \"But I just ran out of time.\"  If you would like to share your story you can reach Laura at kuenssberg@bbc.co.uk BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The new proposal for the coveted obesity drug developer is more than double the size of Pfizer\u2019s original bid and ends a squabble with Novo Nordisk that had resulted in lawsuits. Metsera has abandoned a deal with Novo Nordisk in favor of a new acquisition offer from Pfizer, ending a high-stakes fight between two large pharmaceutical companies over ownership of a coveted maker of obesity drugs.\u00a0 Under terms of a deal announced late Friday, Pfizer will acquire Metsera for up to $86.25 per share, or more than $10 billion. Pfizer will pay $65.60 per share initially, and could add up to $20.65 per share more in \u201ccontingent value right\u201d payouts tied to specific milestones.\u00a0 Metsera\u2019s board has thrown its support behind the new deal, arguing Pfizer\u2019s proposal is now in shareholders\u2019 best interests both because of its \u201cvalue and certainty of closing.\u201d In doing so, it rejected an unusual two-step bid from Novo Nordisk that alarmed the Federal Trade Commission and includes \u201cunacceptably high legal and regulatory risks\u201d comparatively.\u00a0 Novo, in a separate statement, said it won\u2019t make another bid and believes its latest offer complies with antitrust laws. Its decision to drop out of contention is \u201cconsistent with its commitment to financial discipline and shareholder value,\u201d Novo said. \u00a0 Novo \u201cwill continue to assess opportunities for business development and acquisitions that meet its criteria for returns and capital allocation and that further its strategic objectives,\u201d it added.\u00a0 Metsera\u2019s board \u201cunanimously reaffirms\u201d its recommendation that shareholders vote in favor of Pfizer\u2019s proposal at a Nov. 13 meeting. The company expects the deal, which has already received FTC clearance, to close \u201cpromptly\u201d afterwards.\u00a0 The announcement ends an unusual and messy squabble between Pfizer and Novo over an emerging maker of next-generation medicines for weight loss.\u00a0 Pfizer on Sept. 22 bid $4.9 billion for Metsera. Pfizer viewed that offer as a quick way to grab a leading position in the push to develop better obesity drugs, a lucrative and competitive market and an area its own research has struggled. Metsera, which had courted other would-be acquirers, accepted that bid.\u00a0 Roughly a month later, Novo, which has seen its market share in obesity slip in recent months,\u00a0came forward with an unorthodox, rival bid.\u00a0That offer guaranteed a large up-front cash payment in exchange for half of Metsera\u2019s shares \u2014 regardless of whether the deal eventually closed \u2014 with the remainder doled out later on. The deal\u2019s structure was designed to offset the risk of a lengthy delay due to regulatory issues, such as antitrust scrutiny from the FTC. But it was worth as much as $9 billion overall and Metsera deemed it superior, triggering a short window for Pfizer to counter.\u00a0 While working on a counterproposal, Pfizer filed two lawsuits against Metsera and Novo and attempted to draw the attention of the U.S. government. Pfizer alleged Novo\u2019s offer ran afoul of antitrust laws and was a move by a company with a dominant presence selling obesity drugs to suppress competition by \u201ctaking over an American challenger.\u201d It also claimed Novo\u2019s bid couldn\u2019t be superior because of the likely regulatory delay ahead. Metsera called those arguments \u201cnonsense.\u201d Novo raised its bid to $10 billion last week, and a Delaware judge declined to block the deal. But the FTC expressed concerns about the offer and, days later, Metsera changed course. In its Friday statement, Metsera cited \u201crecent circumstances,\u201d including a call from the FTC about the \u201cpotential risks\u201d ahead if it were to proceed with the Novo deal. Among those risks were that the initial dividend to shareholders might \u201cnever be paid\u201d or later \u201cchallenged or rescinded.\u201d\u00a0 Pfizer\u2019s original bid included an upfront price per share of $47.50. Metsera shares debuted at $18 apiece when the company went public in January. Metsera emerged from stealth in 2024 with a portfolio of oral and injectable obesity drugs acquired from elsewhere.

She writes accessible and easy-to-understand articles about credit, debt, budgeting, retirement, savings, and more. Morsa Images \/ Getty Images  It\u2019s a good problem to have: having too much money saved for retirement and having additional money to leave to your heirs. Here\u2019s a look at the types of people who are saving a lot in their lifetimes and how you can be one of them.   A National Bureau of Economic Research study reveals what types of people work and save the most.   According to the study, married men work in the labor force and save \u201csubstantially\u201d throughout their lifetimes. Married women\u2019s time in the labor market peaks in middle age.   Single men show a decline in working in the labor market and in their savings after age 40 compared with men who are married. Single women work less than single men and accumulate less wealth.   Both single men and single women without marriage prospects increase their participation in the labor force and increase their savings from an early age.   The study also found that couples have more than twice the wealth of singles at all ages and that a person\u2019s wealth decreases only modestly after retirement.   The study reveals that people only spend a modest amount of their wealth after they retire, and this differs from a life-cycle model. Wanting to save is one of the reasons why people have a smaller drawdown of wealth after they retire. The study found that, in particular, saving for medical expenses and saving money to bequeath it when they die are two main saving motives for those studied.   Another factor to consider when looking at modest spending in retirement is the life expectancies of wealthy people. They live longer and retain their greater wealth as they age.   If you're interested in leaving behind money to heirs or just want an extra cushion of money in retirement, consider these tips to save more for your later years.   Once you've made it to retirement with more than you think you'll need, here's how to manage your hefty nest egg.   Saving and investing today so you have more than enough in your retirement savings is a smart investment strategy. Invest early to take advantage of compounding interest and make the most of tax-advantaged accounts\u2014such as 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        GEO Group, ICE\u2019s largest contractor, held an earnings call on Thursday where it discussed the future of its business as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up immigration enforcement in the U.S. The company foresees a rise in the number of people held in detention, as well as more people being monitored through phone apps and ankle bracelets. But the numbers aren\u2019t quite as high as they envisioned before Trump came back into office for a second time in January. GEO said it expects to \u201cscale up immigration detention to approximately 100,000 beds or more from the approximately 60,000 beds ICE is currently utilizing,\u201d according to a transcript of the earnings call from Seeking Alpha. The company expects even more people to be monitored in what\u2019s called \u201calternative to detention,\u201d (ATD) schemes, which can include everything from check-in via a smartphone app to ankle monitors that are required to be worn at all times. SmartLINK, the smartphone app, is currently used by about 147,000 people, while about 30,000 have ankle monitors, according to Bloomberg. The tracking program is run by BI Inc., which started in 1978 making a tracking device for cattle, according to the Washington Post. GEO said it expects to see more reliance on ankle monitors in the future. The Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) is a subprogram within ATD that applies to people who are considered high risk for flight but are still allowed to live in the community rather than being locked up in a detention center. BI secured a contract worth as much as $1 billion for ISAP. GEO said Thursday a new contract allows for 465,000 participants in the ISAP program within the next two years, up from 183,000 in the old contract. One of the bottlenecks for GEO has been the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has instituted a policy that any contracts above $100,000 be reviewed and approved by Noem personally. That new policy was blamed for a slow response by FEMA to a deadly flood in Texas back in July. Noem denied it, but the New York Times reported in August that other spending requests weren\u2019t getting through as quickly as they should. GEO cited that bottleneck as the first of three reasons that the \u201cpace of new detention contracts has been slower than anticipated.\u201d The second reason was the government shutdown, which has meant that people awarding new contracts are being more cautious. The third reason cited by GEO is the lack of staff to ramp up deportation efforts. ICE wants to double its employee count from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people but GEO notes that is \u201ctime and staff intensive.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s millions of people that are on the non-detained docket,\u201d GEO founder and executive chairman George Zoley said on the earnings call. \u201cAnd there\u2019s going to be a desire to provide more clarity as to where they are, what stage they are in with respect to their hearing process, and making sure they get to their hearing and if they\u2019re not qualified to be in the country to deport them.\u201d GEO Group donated $1 million to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s re-election campaign according to OpenSecrets. The company contributed $500,000 more to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural committee, according to CREW. As Bloomberg notes, GEO has cuts its earnings forecast, which sent the company\u2019s stock down 10%.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Synology has largely been the go-to brand for network-attached storage (NAS) enclosures. The company makes some excellent products, such as the DiskStation DS925+ and BeeStation series. I've played around with more Synology NAS than I can recall, and the BeeStation Plus felt like a breath of fresh air. It's what I believe the consumer space requires a NAS to be. Something affordable, approachable, simple to configure, and easy to forget. NAS has become quite the loud market segment, allowing just about everyone to create a compact home lab with nothing but a prebuilt NAS. The problem is, I don't feel like Synology fully has me on board as a consumer anymore. I've often recommended Synology NAS to those who are purchasing their very first enclosure. DiskStation Manager (DSM), the company's renowned NAS operating system, has a reputation for its simplicity and desktop-like experience. You could pick up a Synology NAS, plug it in, and get going in moments. The BeeStation range of NAS elevates this by replacing DSM with BSM, which stands for \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 BeeStation Manager. DSM is laid out and well developed, but BSM is essentially DSM Lite, allowing you to quickly launch a few things within seconds. And that's what's so special about these NAS enclosures. They're great for NAS beginners and those who only require small amounts of connected storage since they're painlessly easy to use. You're limited somewhat as to what can be installed and run on these more affordable enclosures, but the BeeStation Plus hilariously supports video hardware transcoding out of the box for Plex, whereas the company's more premium and enthusiast models have this feature missing for the 2025 refresh. It's an interesting move that we'll touch on a little later. The BeeStation Plus is amazing, but does Synology deserve your trust? Synology's simplicity reached further than its UI design, as the company had a strong collection of models to choose from. Everything was clearly laid out with easy-to-decipher SKUs, and performance was excellent across the board. They weren't the cheapest NAS on the market, but you received top-notch service. I always viewed Synology as the Apple of NAS. The BeeStation range of NAS focuses on consistent backups, straightforward sharing, and a responsive performance for getting online in seconds with a few decent mobile apps to boot. Having fewer overheads and a focus on mobile apps, the BeeStation Plus is perfect for those switching from cloud storage solutions from Apple, Google, and Microsoft. These are often integrated through official apps. Even the admin area was planned out to allow power users to dig in while keeping casual users safe from bricking their NAS and losing data. The whole thing from start to finish feels more human compared to traditional NAS setup and management, which is still very power user and enterprise-like \u2014 try getting a loved one to locate and enter the NAS IP into the browser. Earlier this year, Synology made a rather damning policy change, which essentially gave full storage functionality to branded drives, be it SSDs or HDDs. Gone were official certifications for Seagate and Western Digital, among other storage brands. Restrictions included no access to storage pooling, specific health diagnostics, and recovery operations when non-Synology third-party drives were used inside newer DSX25 models. Obviously, this didn't play well with the wider NAS community, with many believing Synology was pushing its own drives. That wouldn't be an issue if Synology's own SSDs and HDDs were widely available and priced in line with competitor counterparts, but neither was the case. Many models were out of stock, and pricing was considerably higher per GB. It was rightly argued that moves such as this could spiral to limit the ability for long-term maintenance of NAS enclosures, specifically branded prebuilt turnkey options. Many have already relied on other storage brands for their drives for years, which made the pill that much harder to swallow. This has a long-lasting effect of eroding trust in the brand. Even though Synology eventually rolled back changes and opened up its 2025 NAS to support drives from other manufacturers, this has a long-lasting effect of eroding trust in the brand, especially if consumers begin to believe Synology could enforce other policy changes further down the line. NAS enclosures are not cheap, and that's excluding the cost of the drives themselves. Potential (and returning) customers won't feel comfortable tying their storage infrastructure to Synology if their choices will be limited. Another issue is transcoding support on DSX25 NAS models, such as the DS925+. It's simply not possible through hardware acceleration since Synology doesn't include the necessary drivers. Thankfully, it's possible to remedy this and unlock support without having to type countless commands and hack DSM. It's what makes the BeeStation so strange since the Plus supports full transcoding out of the box without making a single change. It's also what makes this NAS range relatively safer since their designed with specific goals in mind. It's still early, and we're rolling through the upcoming holiday season to CES 2026, but I hope Synology takes feedback on board and really drives home a consumer-first approach next year. The brand has a comfortable grip on the NAS market with its enclosures usually featured in recommendation lists, including many of our own. Even with all the problems we've seen with the 2025 model launches, Synology still makes some great NAS enclosures. We just need to ensure hardware and software openness for longevity.

BYD has a simple strategy when it comes to taking on Tesla: build, build, build. The Chinese EV giant is constructing factories and stores around the world as it takes on Elon Musk's automaker, and satellite images obtained by Business Insider show how it has significantly expanded one of its largest production facilities in China. BYD broke ground on the mammoth Zhengzhou factory in late 2021, with production beginning in April 2023. Since then, Zhengzhou has quickly become one of the EV titan's most important production sites, with local media reporting that the factory churned out 545,000 units last year at a rate of about one vehicle every minute. The factory has continued to grow at a rapid pace. The state-owned media organization China Daily reported in May that BYD planned to add 20,000 employees in the first quarter of the year, with the company employing around 60,000 workers in Zhengzhou as of February. Satellite imagery provided by Vantor and Planet Images suggests the Zhengzhou factory has more than doubled in size since July 2023, now dwarfing Tesla's largest factory in Austin. Between August and October, the Tesla rival received conditional environmental approval for several new construction projects, according to government documents viewed by Business Insider. These included a battery production line expansion built by BYD's subsidiary Zhengzhou Fudi Battery Co, a mold production line, and a new battery protection plate production line that a planning document said would cost around $16 million and produce battery protection plates for 4.7 million vehicles a year. Analysis of the satellite imagery by Vantor suggests the entire footprint of the site is now around 22.5 square kilometres, far larger than the estimated 3.53 square kilometres footprint of Tesla's largest gigafactory in Austin. BYD and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the specific dimensions of the two factories. BYD eventually plans to expand Zhengzhou's annual production capacity to 1.8 million vehicles, per local media reports \u2014 more than Tesla produced across all its factories last year. The Zhengzhou site also features a track racing and testing circuit, which BYD describes as the first of its kind for electric vehicles in China. The circuit, which opened in August 2025 and is situated in the top-left-hand corner of the satellite image of the factory site, includes a 29-meter-tall sand incline and a 70-meter-long wade pool for testing BYD's more unique EVs. The wade pool is designed for BYD's Yangwang U8, a $150,000 hybrid SUV that can float for short periods, and includes an underwater observation window. The test circuit also features a 44-meter-diameter \"low-friction circle,\" which BYD says is made of 30,000 basalt bricks and allows users to practice drifting. The 15,300-square-meter circuit is open to the public, with BYD planning to open similar tracks in the cities of Hefei and Shaoxing. The expansion at Zhengzhou comes as BYD grapples with slowing sales after years of explosive growth. The Shenzhen-based company beat out Tesla and Western brands like VW to become China's top-selling car brand thanks to a lineup of affordable EVs and hybrids, such as the $8,000 Seagull. However, BYD's sales fell for the first time in 18 months in September and again in October, and the company reported that its profits in the third quarter had declined by 33% in its latest earnings. A renewed price war in China's brutally competitive electric vehicle market has put BYD's sales under pressure, while its earnings have suffered from a government crackdown on discounting and delayed supplier payments. Despite this, BYD is still on track to overtake Tesla as the world's largest seller of battery-powered vehicles this year, and the EV juggernaut is betting that taking on Tesla in international markets will help it steer through stormy waters back home. BYD has seen its sales surge 300% in Europe so far this year, even as Tesla's have collapsed, and the Chinese brand has announced ambitious plans to open 1,000 new stores across the continent by the end of next year. The company's building spree is not limited to China. BYD is also building factories in Hungary and Turkey as it seeks to localize production and avoid tariffs. The EV giant has established factories in Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia, and has built a fleet of giant car-carrying cargo ships to export its vehicles across the globe.       Jump to","label":0}

By early Thursday afternoon, cheers celebrating Goldman Sachs' newly promoted managing directors had been mounting for hours throughout the firm's London office. Paulo Costa heard the trader across from him \u2014 whose last name starts with an X \u2014 take the call he had been hoping for. He presumed the calls would be rolled out in alphabetical order, and thought, \"Oh, hang on, this is starting to feel a little strange,\" he told Business Insider. At last, the call came: he'd been named managing director \u2014 and, at 29, the youngest in this year's class. Costa \u2014 an executive director overseeing dividend trading across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa \u2014 was among the 638 employees in this year's Goldman MD class. He said that it marked the culmination of a remarkable year, personally and professionally. His promotion comes on the heels of a strong run for Goldman's equities division, where third-quarter revenues climbed 7% compared to the same period a year earlier. The bank cited higher net revenues in financing, an area adjacent to Costa's work, as a key driver. Seated a few rows away from Costa when the call came was his wife, who is a prime broker at Goldman. The two met at the firm in 2018 and married this year. \"She was definitely the first person that I spoke to,\" once he'd hung up the phone, he said. Costa runs dividend trading within the bank's equities division, helping big investors like hedge funds make bets on stocks without actually buying them, using financial contracts that move with share prices. His team manages the dividend component of those deals, ensuring that when companies pay shareholders, those payouts are accurately reflected in the value and cash flows of the trades. He has weathered a few volatile markets, from the pandemic to this year's market sell-off in the spring. Past experiences, he said, made him \"more aware\" of how to approach choppy markets. \"When you really learn about the markets and the inner plumbing of things, is when things get messy,\" he said, recalling how unusual trading conditions during the COVID pandemic shaped his approach. Born and raised in Portugal in a family of doctors, Costa said his parents hoped he'd follow in their footsteps and pursue a career in medicine. But the MD title he clinched this week has proven just as satisfying. Choosing finance over medicine came as \"a bit of a shock,\" he said, \"but I think they're happy I did it.\" \"When I was 11 or 12 years old, we went through the European sovereign crisis,\" he said. \"I became very interested in how the financial markets were crashing at home. I started to read up about it and started to do very small trades when I was that age.\" Costa attended the University of Warwick, where he served as the equities chief investment officer for the Warwick Investment Fund, and joined Goldman as a summer analyst in the securities division in 2016. He advised those who might want to follow his path should find what interests them. \"You're only ever going to be very good if you can work hard at something for a very long time, perfecting your craft,\" he said. By the time the announcement became official on Thursday, Goldman's London trading floor was already buzzing. Some of the regional leaders, including members of the bank's European Management Committee, convened a Champagne toast for new MDs on the office's eighth floor, followed by a larger-scale gathering of about 150 people at a drinks venue nearby. Some of Costa's former colleagues and mentors appeared as well \u2014 including Lorenzo Longo, a former Goldman colleague and mentor who helped guide Costa early in his career. \"He was almost as excited for my phone call as my wife,\" Costa said with a laugh. But now he's stepping into the role they once held \u2014 a leadership position which will bring new responsibilities and expectations. Was he anxious about bearing those new duties at age 29? No, he said: \"I don't think I necessarily have to impose myself now as a leader more than I was a week ago.\" But he didn't deny the \"gravitas\" he said it comes with. \"It certainly helps being a young person to get the title,\" he conceded, reflecting on the 21-year-old version of himself that was starting his career at the bank. \"I was already beyond proud of working here\" at the time, he said. \"I never imagined that, when I was 29, I would be at this stage of my career.\"     Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"With companies like Spotify attempting to remove AI slop from its platform while others like OpenAI aim to add more TikTok-style AI video slop to the net, finding exactly what you're looking for on Google can feel like you're wading through a sewer. Even if Google's new AI features may be making your search results dumber than ever, there are still methods and tools that can help you find exactly what you're looking for. It's just all about knowing the right phrases and tools. Refining your Google searches is a great way to quickly get the results you want. While the company loves adding Easter eggs and hidden tricks that are fun but have nothing to do with searching, we've outlined some tools to help you tackle some math, plan your next destination, filter your search results, and even more effectively search for videos and images. Note that many of these features will be operators that you type and enter into a Google Search bar, while some are just features and extensions of Google Search that you may not be aware of. Wading through all the slop these days might feel like an insurmountable task, but\u00a0it's not impossible. Try out these tips and tools the next time you need them and see a clearer side of Google Search. If you're the type who likes a good trip or simply wants to know the time it takes to traverse between two different areas, you can do a quick search by entering [location A] to [location B] in the search bar. For example, typing \"Cleveland, Ohio to Newport, Kentucky\" will show you the drive time and available bus schedules for the trip. Depending on the length, you can also get options for walking, biking, and flying. If flying is an option, location searches are good for comparing flight costs. If you know airport codes, you can enter those, and entering a flight number in the search bar will also provide details. Should the distance between two areas be too large where flying is the only option, Google may not show the mileage. You can refine your search by adding the term \"distance\" to your query. For example, \"Bangor, Maine, to Mawanza, Tanzania distance\" will give you the straight-line distance on Google. While you're planning a trip, you can check hotel prices through a Google Search simply by typing hotels [city name]. So typing \"Hotels Detroit, Michigan\" will present you with different options and date selections after scrolling past the sponsored options. You can even choose the number of guests and filter hotels by rating and cost. Lastly, you can check the time for any location simply by adding \"time\" beside \"[city]\" or compare times with another location by searching for \"[city] to [city] time.\" The Google Search bar can act as a quick calculator when necessary. For example, type \"14x12\" in a search bar, and Google will display the answer in an in-engine calculator. Just remember your operators: \"x\"\u00a0or \"*\" for multiplication, \"\/\" for division, and \"+\" or \"-\" for addition and subtraction. Google actually has a lot of different ways you can make calculations, so those who are good with numbers can check the company's page if they want to dive into the more complicated equations and functions. Google search is also good for quick conversions, such as changing feet into inches or nautical miles to kilometers. Simply enter [value, first unit] to [second unit], and Google will give you the answer and formula (eg., \"2 kilometers to meters\"). This is good for converting a number of things, including temperature, time, volume, speed, plane angle, pressure, mass, length, fuel economy, energy, frequency, data transfer rate, digital storage, and area. You can also enter the phrase \"unit converter\" into the search bar to quickly bring up Google's conversion table. There's also one for currency, which you can access by entering \"currency converter.\" One cool thing about Google's currency converter is that it can quickly take you to Google Finance for more information about the currency you're converting. While the converter provides a chart of market values, you can select \"More about [currencies]\"\u00a0underneath it for more information. This includes a quick profile about the currencies, other market performances, and even the latest news. After making a search on Google, you may see some tools directly under the search bar, like Shopping, Images, News, Videos, and Short Videos. Even if Google really wants AI Mode to be your priority method of searching, each can filter your results. However, the More and Tools categories have additional options. Tools is great for adjusting your searches within a specific timeframe, and this is also where to find the Advanced Search. The \"All results\" tab under Tools also has the option to search Verbatim, which will find the exact words or phrases of your query. Advanced Search is great for refinement, but remember, you can use a portion of its options directly from the search bar thanks to Boolean operators like\u00a0\"AND,\" \"OR,\" and \"NOT.\" (Remember to capitalize these commands, or they'll register as keywords). The \"AND\" operator combines your terms, meaning Google's results must match the words, whereas \"OR\" must only match one of the phrases or words. Naturally, \"NOT\" will remove the chosen phrase or word from results. You can also use the \"define\" operator to get quick definitions, and \"weather:\" will give you information about a location's forecast. Filters are also useful for finding a specific page on a website. The \"site:\" operator is good for this \u2014 just remember not to include \"http:\/\/\" or \"www.\" when searching. So if you want to find simple iPhone settings that will increase your battery life on BGR, you could enter\u00a0\"site:bgr.com iPhone battery settings\" to see the results. The Tools category also has a variety of ways to help refine your\u00a0image and video searches.\u00a0Though Google's AI Mode knows when you want to search for images, you can still click the Images tab to perform your search and use the Tools category for refinement. For example, if you're searching for images of Golden Retrievers, you can sort images by size, color, usage rights, type, and timeframe. The same holds true for the Videos tabs\u00a0\u2014 the Tools category will help refine your video results by duration, time, quality, source, and even video captions. Reverse image search is a great tool for finding the source of an image or similar ones. It can be as simple as pasting the image address in Google Image Search, and the site will look for similar images. In Google Chrome on mobile, you can long-press on an image and select Search Image with Google. You can also drag the handles to crop an image to refine your search. On mobile or desktop, you can also upload images by tapping the icon next to the microphone. There are a lot of advanced search features you may never have even noticed with Google. As a fun test, use your new skills to see if you can find Daniel M. Russell's\u00a0list of Google's Advanced Search Operators online to really expand your searches (it's here\u00a0if you have any trouble).\u00a0Along with being a researcher of web searching, Russell also spent 17 years working at Google as a principal UX researcher, so he's a good authority on the subject.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Written byOluwapelumi Adejumo Edited byMohammad Shahid Crypto-focused treasury companies are facing renewed strain as the latest market downturn erodes asset values and erases equity cushions that once appeared durable. In a November 7 post on X, crypto analysis platform CryptoQuant reported that falling token prices have narrowed financial buffers across the sector. That contraction has weakened company valuations, pushing several treasuries to adopt defensive balance-sheet moves in an effort to reassure shareholders. According to the report, Bitcoin-heavy firms are absorbing the sharpest losses. BTC has fallen more than 16% this month and briefly slipped under the $100,000 mark, and that pressure has rippled directly into corporate portfolios. For context, Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with more than 675,000 BTC, has seen its purchases slow sharply in recent months. The company has shifted from buying thousands of coins to only a few hundred. Market analysts say the softer buying pace reflects the combined weight of Bitcoin\u2019s slide and Strategy\u2019s weaker equity performance. As a result, the shift has coincided with a reversal in its MSTR stock price, which has dropped roughly 53% from its all-time high to about $241.93. At the same time, Metaplanet, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, finds itself in a similar position. The company holds 30,823 BTC at an average cost basis of $106,000, leaving it with more than $120 million in unrealized losses at current prices As a result, its stock has dropped by more than 80% from its peak, compressing market net asset value and prompting a share buyback program designed to restore confidence. Altcoin-focused treasury companies are also feeling the pressure, as the broader market downturn drives steep markdowns across their portfolios.  Their positions have weakened alongside sector-wide declines, adding another layer of strain to an already stressed treasury landscape. Evernorth, the largest corporate holder of XRP, began accumulating the token in mid-October. However, its 388.7 million XRP tokens are now in an unrealized loss of approximately $79 million. On the other hand, BitMine, the largest Ethereum treasury with more than 3.4 million ETH, is facing even deeper losses. Ethereum\u2019s recent decline of over 22% in the past month has pushed the company\u2019s unrealized deficit to roughly $2.1 billion. Analysts say the scale of these drawdowns underscores a recurring structural risk where companies that build positions during periods of strength often experience the fastest erosion of capital when sentiment reverses. This is in congruence with previous warnings that digital-asset accumulation carries risks that not every firm can absorb. Considering this, firms now face a sharper test of resilience as they work to maintain long-term conviction in digital assets while absorbing near-term financial pressure. That tension is likely to shape treasury decisions well into next year.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Domestic pension funds have made a record investment of Rs 41,242 crore on a net basis in equity markets during the first nine months of 2025, according to the NSE data. In August 2025, inflows in the New Pension System (NPS) category stood at Rs 7,899 crore, the highest level seen in recent months. During September, net investment under the NPS category was Rs 7,867 crore, marginally lower compared with the previous month. In the last four years, there has been a consistent surge in equity investments by pension funds under the NPS category, the NSE\u2019s monthly category-wise turnover data from domestic institutional investors (DII) showed. Net inflows surged from Rs 629 crore in 2021 to Rs 2,788 crore in 2022, more than doubled to Rs 6,027 crore in 2023, and further to Rs 13,329 crore in 2024. Strong returns in recent years have attracted DIIs, largely comprising mutual funds, insurance and pension funds, toward the stock markets, experts said. \u201cStocks are regarded as the best performing asset class over the long run. The strong preference for equities has led to a higher inflows from insurance, mutual funds and pension funds into the markets,\u201d said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Ltd. Market experts also attributed the surge in inflows to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority\u2019s (PFRDA) recent norms which raised the investment limit for pension funds in equity and related instruments. Effective April 1, 2025, pension funds can invest up to 25 per cent into equities and related instruments, up from 15 per cent earlier. Additionally, they are permitted to invest not only in large-cap stocks but also in mid-cap stocks. \u201cPension funds are required to deliver a certain level of returns every year. Earlier, they achieved higher returns through investments into fixed instruments but this is not possible now. The increased investment limit in equity instruments now gives pension funds leeway to invest more in equities, helping them to meet their target of higher returns,\u201d said a fund manager. The NSE data also showed that DIIs have invested Rs 4.93 lakh crore into the domestic equity markets between January-September 2025. DIIs net invested Rs 82,876 crore in August 2025, which was the highest in the current financial year. Mutual fund players pumped in Rs 4.12 lakh crore on a net basis into the stock markets between January-September 2025, with August recording this year\u2019s highest monthly investment of Rs 68,584 crore in this year, the data showed. Net equity purchases by insurance players reached Rs 54,373 crore in the first nine months of 2025, compared with Rs 23,062 crore during full year 2024, showing a growth of over 100 per cent.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":" It\u2019s no secret that things are changing in the camera and imaging space. As technology advances and the old guard passes the torch to the new, we\u2019ve seen the digital camera evolve from a work instrument only accessible to industry professionals to a creative tool that even those of modest means can access.          For as long as I\u2019ve been a part of the industry, though, the main gripe I\u2019ve had with many of the mainstream market players is that they seem hesitant to include up-and-coming creatives in their community of professionals or pitch their products directly to the younger consumer in a way they can identify with.  All it takes to see this is to visit the various manufacturer websites and scroll through the list of people endorsed by their respective brands of choice. Many of them are industry veterans with decades of experience in their field, and for any aspiring creative, that kind of recognition seems like an impossible goal. Of course, that\u2019s not to say the only reason one might pursue this art form is to achieve that level of success, but most new guitarists typically seek to emulate Bob Dylan or Slash or another guitar hero, rather than Dave that performs in the Nirvana cover band every Tuesday (nothing against Dave, he\u2019s a super nice guy and an excellent accountant).  As a Nikon user, this has been a particularly glaring criticism of mine over the last few years. Like it or not, the online creator community on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok has become a huge asset in the marketing toolbox, and one that, compared to the competition, Nikon has historically played down to its peril. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I know that I\u2019ve found it a little odd to see heavy hitters from the roster of Ambassadors alongside members of the product and technical teams speaking about how great the budget-oriented offerings like the Z50 or Zfc are. If I were a prospective customer just entering the market, I\u2019d want to hear from someone more relatable to me, whose use case is more aligned with mine. Thankfully, as a member of the younger crowd (at least for the time being\u2026), things seem to be changing on that front. Not only have many products aimed squarely at the aspiring shutter monkey hit the market, delivering professional-quality results at an affordable price, with features designed to make entry into the field as seamless as possible, but manufacturers themselves seem to have come to the realization that nurturing the up-and-coming creator community is a great way to get others like them excited about the art form and the tools we use to create that art. Recently, I spent the better part of a week attending the Los Angeles leg of the 2025 Nikon Tour, and what I saw was very promising. Aside from attracting significantly more people than I thought it might, it\u2019s very clear that Nikon is leaning heavily into this segment, both in its market outreach and the people it elevates to do that outreach. For those unfamiliar with the Nikon Tour, earlier this year, Nikon announced that it would be stopping at many of the larger cities around the US for in-person product demos and workshops hosted by a variety of Ambassadors, Creators, and other partners. Kicking off with Chicago and Aurora, Illinois, in mid-May, it has since come to Los Angeles and San Diego, with Phoenix, AZ, and Houston, TX coming up as of the time of writing. At each stop, attendees have the chance to get some hands-on time with the Nikon Z50II and Nikon Z5II during guided shoots covering a variety of subjects, and even take home their photos at the end. At the Los Angeles stop, I spent 5 days gallivanting around LA and the South Bay with a group of photographers, running the gamut from novice to experienced professional. Highlights included long-exposure night photography at Paul\u2019s Photo, a golden hour fashion portraiture session at a house in Burbank, and a street photography workshop at the famous LACMA lamppost installation. The latter was hosted by Samy\u2019s Camera and led by Nikon Creator Preston Luke. Preston\u2019s story caught my eye as particularly illustrative of the renewed push the brand is making to appeal to the burgeoning creative. Since picking up a D7200 at the age of 17 and starting out doing high school portraiture sessions around his home in Missouri, Preston has spent a decade building an audience on social media where he aims to teach and inspire others to love photography as he does. That hasn\u2019t come without difficulty, though. \u201cThe biggest challenge has been proving credibility in an industry that still leans heavily on traditional experience,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a younger creative, you often have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously. On top of that, social media changes fast, and staying relevant while keeping your artistic integrity takes constant balance. But I think that\u2019s also what makes this generation exciting, we\u2019re rewriting what a creative career can look like.\u201d Preston wasn\u2019t even the only instructor at the Los Angeles stop with a story like this. Two of the fashion portraiture sessions I attended were led by Joyce Charat, a young French photographer and Nikon Creator who moved to Los Angeles after graduating high school to study at ArtCenter College of Design. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, making working as a photographer that much more difficult. Since completing her degree, though, she\u2019s had the opportunity to work with many fashion brands and publications, like Pravana hair color, Cosmopolitan, and Harper\u2019s Bazaar, as well as a number of high-profile musicians like Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg, and G-Eazy. Joyce had much of the same to say about \u201cmaking it\u201d as a young creative, highlighting the importance of consistency, allowing your audience to see what goes on behind the scenes, even going as far as having her own dedicated BTS videographer on-site during her sessions, and believing in yourself and your abilities. It would appear that this focus on a younger audience appears to be paying off for Nikon. \u201cWe recognize that the creative landscape is evolving rapidly, and a new generation is exploring storytelling in new, exciting ways\u201d, says Steph Frank, Associate General Manager of Marketing Communications for Nikon USA. \u201cThrough programs like Nikon Creators, we\u2019re fostering community and deeper engagement, empowering diverse talent, and ensuring our products reach a wider audience\u2014from seasoned professionals to newcomers pursuing their creative passions\u2026Nikon Creators Camps and the Nikon Tour have been particularly well-received, providing opportunities for education, collaboration, and inspiration for both the community and the brand.\u201d For the wider market and the field as a whole, this can only be a good thing. Not only does art benefit from an increase in diversity, but so does the technology used to create it. New users buying into the market increases the ability and incentive for manufacturers to innovate and drive competition amongst each other, which itself often drives new users to buy into the market. Thus, our community is able to sustain itself. As Preston Luke himself says, \u201cYoung people are the future of any creative field. They\u2019re curious, eager to learn, and often the ones driving trends\u2026It\u2019s not just about selling cameras, it\u2019s about building relationships that last decades.\u201d Become a PetaPixel Member and access our content ad-free. \u00a9 2025 PetaPixel Inc.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"     Federal departments and agencies are joining forces in an effort to ban TP-Link routers due to concerns about national security risks.    TP-Link routers might not be available for much longer in the US, according to a Washington Post report last week. A potential ban is looking increasingly likely, as more than half a dozen federal departments and agencies back the proposal,  The news first broke in December of last year, when The Wall Street Journal reported that investigators at the Departments of Commerce, Defense and Justice had all opened probes into the company due to national security risks stemming from its ties to China. Since then, news on the TP-Link front has been relatively quiet.  Now, the proposal has gained interagency approval.  Read more: I Asked 4 Cybersecurity Experts If They Would Still Use a TP-Link Router \"Commerce officials concluded TP-Link Systems products pose a risk because the US-based company's products handle sensitive American data and because the officials believe it remains subject to jurisdiction or influence by the Chinese government,\" the Washington Post reported.\u00a0 TP-Link's ties to the Chinese government are only allegations. The company -- technically called TP-Link Systems -- has strenuously denied to me in the past that it's a Chinese company.\u00a0 \"As an independent US company, no foreign country or government, including China, has access to or control over the design and production of our products,\" a TP-Link spokesperson told CNET. TP-Link was founded in Shenzhen, China, in 1996 by two brothers, Jeffrey (Jianjun) Chao and Jiaxing Zhao. In October 2024, two months after members of the House Select Committee called for an investigation into TP-Link routers, the company split into two: TP-Link Technologies and TP-Link Systems.  The latter is headquartered in Irvine, California, and has approximately 500 employees in the US and 11,000 in China, according to the Washington Post report. TP-Link Systems is owned by Chao and his wife.\u00a0 \"TP-Link's unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with [Chinese] law are in and of themselves disconcerting,\" the lawmakers wrote in October 2024. \"When combined with the [Chinese] government's common use of [home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.\" The company has become a dominant force in the US router market since the pandemic. According to the Journal report, it grew from 20% of total router sales in 2019 to around 65% this year. TP-Link disputed these numbers to CNET, and a separate analysis from the IT platform Lansweeper found that 12% of home routers currently used in the US are made by TP-Link. More than 300 internet providers issue TP-Link routers to their customers, according to the Wall Street Journal report.\u00a0 Separately, the Department of Justice's antitrust division is investigating whether TP-Link engaged in predatory pricing tactics by artificially lowering its prices to muscle out competitors.\u00a0 CNET has several TP-Link models on our lists of the best Wi-Fi routers and will monitor this story closely to see if we need to reevaluate those choices.\u00a0 \"We do not sell products below cost. Our pricing is not only above cost but contributes a healthy profit to the business,\" a TP-Link spokesperson told CNET.\u00a0 The potential ban has been through an interagency review and is currently in the hands of the Department of Commerce. According to the Washington Post report, sources familiar with the details of the ban said the Trump administration's ongoing negotiations with China have made the chances of a ban less likely in the near future.\u00a0 \"Any concerns the government may have about TP-Link are fully resolvable by a common-sense mix of measures like onshoring development functions, investing in cybersecurity, and being transparent,\" the spokesperson said. \"TP-Link will continue to work with the US Department of Commerce to ensure we understand and can respond to any concerns the government has.\" Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.\u00a0Add CNET\u00a0as a preferred Google source. I wrote a few months ago that I wasn't in any rush to replace my own TP-Link router, and that's essentially how I still feel today.\u00a0 When the news first broke last December, I asked four cybersecurity experts whether they would still use a TP-Link router. One gave a strong \"no.\" Another said there is \"risk for a consumer.\" And two declined to answer the question directly.\u00a0 Itay Cohen was one of the authors of a 2023 report that identified a firmware implant in TP-Link routers linked to a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group. He told me in a previous interview that similar implants have been found on other router brands manufactured all over the world. \"I don't think there's enough public evidence to support avoiding routers from China outright,\" Cohen said. \"The vulnerabilities and risks associated with routers are largely systemic and apply to a wide range of brands, including those manufactured in the US.\" I heard a version of that from every cybersecurity expert I spoke with. TP-Link has security flaws, but so do all routers, and I couldn't point to any that showed collaboration with the Chinese government specifically.\u00a0 \"We've analyzed an astonishing amount of TP-Link firmware. We find stuff, but we find stuff in everything,\" said Thomas Pace, CEO of cybersecurity firm NetRise and former security contractor for the Department of Energy. That said, it's entirely possible that the government is aware of vulnerabilities that the public is not.  For now, I'm still comfortable using a TP-Link router knowing I follow some basic best practices for network security, but my risk tolerance may be higher than it is for others.\u00a0 If you're one of the millions of Americans who uses a TP-Link router, the news of a potential ban might be unnerving.  A Microsoft report from last year found that TP-Link routers have been used in \"password spray attacks\" since August 2023, which typically occur when the router is using a default password.  Here's what you can do to protect yourself right now: Update your login credentials. A shocking amount of router attacks occur because the user never changed the default login credentials set by the router manufacturer. Most routers have an app that lets you update your login credentials, but you can also type your router's IP address into a URL. These credentials are different from your Wi-Fi name and password, which should also be changed every six months or so. As always with passwords, avoid common words and character combinations, longer passwords are better and don't reuse passwords from other accounts.\u00a0 Use a VPN. If you're worried about prying eyes from the Chinese government or anyone else, the single best thing you can do to ensure your connection remains private is to use a quality VPN. Privacy-minded folks should look for advanced features like obfuscation, Tor over VPN and a double VPN, which uses a second VPN server for an added layer of encryption. You can even install a VPN on your router directly so that all your traffic is encrypted automatically.  Turn on the firewall and Wi-Fi encryption. These are typically on by default, but now is a good time to make sure they're activated. This will make it harder for hackers to access the data sent between your router and the devices that connect to it. You can also find these settings by logging into your router from its app or website. Consider buying a new router. I always recommend buying your own router instead of renting one from your internet service provider. This is mostly a cost-saving measure, but if your ISP uses TP-Link equipment, now might be a good time to switch to another brand. The main thing to look for is WPA3 certification -- the most up-to-date security protocol for routers. Update your firmware. TP-Link's spokesperson told me last year that customers should regularly check for firmware updates to keep their router secure. \"To do this, customers with TP-Link Cloud accounts may simply click the 'Check for Updates' button in their product's firmware menu,\" the spokesperson said. \"All other customers can find the latest firmware on their product's Downloads page on TP-Link.com.\"","label":0}

When I met my mother-in-love, as I like to call her, we immediately started talking about \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" \u2014 and the rest was history. Still, not everyone is so fortunate as to get along with their MIL. Don't worry, though: Before you head to your partner's house for Thanksgiving, knowing what type of in-law you have can help improve communication and ultimately your relationship. Dr. Tracy Dalgleish, a clinical psychologist and author of \"You, Your Husband, and His Mother,\" identified six different types of mother-in-law, although she noted that some mothers can fall into more than one category. \"The idea is not so much that we put people in boxes,\" she told Business Insider's Julia Pugachevsky. \"It's so we can understand what behavior is showing up.\" Ready to spot your MIL? Here goes: Turns out that the key to surviving Thanksgiving dinner is knowing which mother-in-law is sitting across from you. Good luck! Mark Cuban is a longtime critic of Donald Trump, but he praised the president for a TrumpRx deal that slashes the costs of Ozempic and other weight-loss drugs. Cuban told Business Insider that he and Trump are working from the same playbook to cut costs for consumers. The \"Shark Tank\" businessman owns Cost Plus Drugs, which on Thursday announced a deal to cut the cost of an expensive Crohn's disease medication. Game recognizes game. Dr. Samuel Impey, who focuses on endurance training and was formerly the lead nutritionist for the British cycling team, has a passion for bread \u2014 specifically fresh sourdough. He eats carbs like potatoes or rice to fuel up before a run or to recover after one. Impey isn't packing on the protein, though. He prefers to sprinkle it in throughout every meal. He also tries to hit his daily fruit and vegetable goal for fiber. It's all about balance. Since Lilian Schmidt turned to ChatGPT for parenting advice \u2014 and it worked \u2014 she said she's felt a lot calmer. Schmidt now makes TikToks about it and even sells a \"vault\" of pre-made prompts for other parents to use. For many parents, balancing childcare with a full-time job can feel like a lot. Whether it's meal prep, planning activities, or homework help, using AI for parenting can be a helpful tool when used correctly, she said. What parents should \u2014 and shouldn't \u2014 use AI for.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"This move underscores a rapidly tightening memory market, affecting both flash and DRAM.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  SanDisk has reportedly raised its NAND flash contract prices by a staggering 50% for November, according to DigiTimes Asia. This move underscores a rapidly tightening memory market, driven by both unrelenting demand from AI data centers as well as tightly constrained wafer supply. The report cites market sources who say SanDisk's pricing update sent a shockwave through the storage supply chain, prompting module makers such as Transcend, Innodisk, and Apacer Technology to pause shipments and re-evaluate quotes. Transcend, in particular, suspended quoting and deliveries starting November 7, anticipating \"continued favorable market conditions.\" Translation: \"prices are likely going higher before they settle down.\" If you want a snapshot of just how hot the memory business has gotten, look at the numbers:      All three credited their performance to the supply concentration at wafer fabs, which are prioritizing the production of high-margin DRAM, such as DDR5 and HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), for AI servers and high-performance computing gear. The catch: older DDR4 products \u2014 still essential for industrial and enterprise systems \u2014 are now in shorter supply, further inflating prices downstream. It's the same story we've seen across the chip industry all year: AI workloads are sucking the air out of the room. Fabs are dedicating more lines to cutting-edge memory for GPUs and accelerators, leaving commodity segments like consumer SSDs, embedded modules, and mainstream DDR4 short. The result? A structural shortage that's boosting profits for memory vendors while leaving OEMs and end-users scrambling. DigiTimes notes that Transcend expects \"upward momentum\" in the market to persist as companies balance price hikes with limited production capacity. If you were thinking about upgrading your rig or expanding your data center capacity, it might be time to pull the trigger sooner rather than later. Between SanDisk's NAND flash hikes and ongoing DRAM shortages, prices across SSDs and memory modules are trending only one way, and it's not down. History suggests that when memory makers smell profit, they don't rush to expand supply overnight. With AI still chewing through every spare chip the industry can make, this shortage could stretch well into 2026 \u2014 unless the AI bubble abruptly pops, but then our economy will have bigger things to worry about.

Reviews ethics statement      This is the ideal temperature to set your thermostat at during the cooler months to save money and stay cozy.    Your heating bill doesn't have to be terrifying this winter. Here's how to tame the beast. Staying warm through the frigid temperatures of winter isn't always easy, and cranking up the heat can lead to energy bills that destroy your budget. Thankfully you don't need to resort to hiding under a blanket bundled up in a sweater all season just to keep your heating bills manageable. There are some easy tweaks you can make that can make a big difference.    Stop stressing about the cost and start being smarter with your furnace. Finding that sweet spot on your thermostat for maximum efficiency is key, but a few other simple adjustments can help stop your heating bills from climbing into the stratosphere. It's time to stay warm without breaking the bank. Here's what you need to know.   Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. In the winter, experts recommend that you set your thermostat to 68 degrees Fahrenheit when you're home, and 60 to 65 degrees when you're asleep or away.   You  can set it higher, but that will reduce efficiency and lead to higher  energy bills. It also depends on the weather outside, said Julian Picard, owner of HVAC company\u00a0Centerline Mechanical. If  it's 20 degrees Fahrenheit   outside, maybe don't set your thermostat to 80 degrees,  he advised. Then there's the question of changing the temperature at night or when you're not home. The Department of Energy suggests you turn your thermostat back 7 to 10 degrees from its normal setting for 8 hours a day, saying that can save as much as 10% a year on heating and cooling.\u00a0   Picard  suggested a smaller change: Lower the temperature by just four degrees  when you're away or asleep. This means your system won't have to work  quite as hard to get back to temperature.   \"You don't want to have drastic changes in temperature,\" said Mahlie Dukes, franchise owner of WIN Home Inspection in Indiana.   You  should also get to know your specific heating system. If you notice,  for example, that your home never gets up to the temperature you set,  that could be a sign that your system is improperly sized for your home, Picard says. And it's a cue to lower your thermostat setting so your HVAC won't constantly be working on overdrive.   Read more:\u00a0You Can Actually Save Money by Using Electricity at These Specific Times In the summer, the ideal temperature for your thermostat is 75  degrees Fahrenheit to 78 degrees Fahrenheit   when you're home, and 80  degrees Fahrenheit when you're away or asleep, Dukes said. The  Department of Energy suggests 78 degrees Fahrenheit   during the day, 82  degrees Fahrenheit when you're sleeping and 85 degrees Fahrenheit    when you're not home.   Most importantly, you want to make sure your  system can handle the settings.  If you notice that the house never gets as cool  as your thermostat  setting, that probably means your system is not sized  well for your  home, and you might want to ease up on the cooling. You  may also want  to check on\u00a0how well sealed your doors and windows are\u00a0and how well insulated your home is.\u00a0   Air   conditioners can only really cool your home to 15 to 20 degrees below   the outdoor temperature, so setting the thermostat too low can result  in  your system running without being effective.\u00a0   Read more:\u00a0Thinking of Buying a Portable AC? 5 Things You Need to Know Before You Do Yes and no. The same general temperature recommendations apply regardless of the type of HVAC you have in your home, Picard says.   However, your results may vary depending on the type and size of your system. Systems that are over- or undersized for your home will run inefficiently, leading to higher heating and cooling costs.   This is why Picard recommends that you have an HVAC professional inspect and clean your system annually. These pros can tell you how best to use your specific system for the best comfort and efficiency, he said.   Say your home is quite a bit colder than you'd prefer, and you want it to be perfect now. It may be 65 degrees Fahrenheit   inside, and you may want it to be 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Don't set it to 75 in the hopes that it will warm it up faster. Most HVAC units have two settings -- on or off -- and there's no getting to 70 degrees Fahrenheit   any faster.   Set your thermostat to the temperature you want it to be. Setting to a warmer or cooler temperature than you actually desire in the hopes that will speed things along will just result in overcooling or overheating -- and overspending on your energy bills.   Your thermostat knows how to set the temperature because it has a thermometer in it. So if your thermostat is in the wrong spot, it won't give you an accurate reading of the temp in your home.\u00a0   You want to avoid having your thermostat in a location that sees frequent changes in temperature or humidity, like in the kitchen or the bathroom. If it's on an exterior wall, it might be more sensitive to outdoor temperature changes.\u00a0   Instead, try to position your thermostat on an interior wall in a location like your living room.   If your thermostat supports external room sensors, having sensors in other locations, like a bedroom, can help you better regulate the temperature in the rooms where you spend most of your time.   Reducing your energy bills this year doesn't have to be hard.   \"There's a huge misconception that in order to be energy efficient, you must be uncomfortable,\" Picard said.   Homeowners can also look at areas beyond their thermostat. Investing in good insulation, for example, can greatly reduce how much strain you put on your HVAC system.   \"You'd be surprised how much energy we blow right through our attics,\" Picard said.   That annual inspection and maintenance appointment can also help save you money. Picard said buildup within your HVAC system can lead to efficiency losses of up to 10% annually, which you'll see on your energy bill. That's why having it cleaned every year is a good move.   And if you're in the market for a new HVAC system, it's a great time to take stock and make sure what you have fits your specific home.  ","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Markets are always hunting for the next big trade. In 2026, I believe the trade will be a new wrinkle on the traditional basis trades where investors go long Digital Asset Treasury companies (DATs), and short futures. While sophisticated market participants have driven positive returns with the long ETF, short futures strategy for bitcoin and ether, this time, a new variation of the basis trade will include DATs and extend across the broad array of crypto projects that are commonly known as \u201calts\u201d. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) had their breakout year in 2025. Typically public companies, DATs issue and sell public shares, and use proceeds to buy a dedicated crypto asset. In doing so, they attempt to increase their crypto tokens per share. So, for the typical investor, DATs can be traded, custodied and hedged just like any other stock. This eliminates the operational complexity or regulatory uncertainty for traditional investors who are uncomfortable managing native crypto assets. For this reason, DATs are emerging as a bridge between crypto markets and traditional finance. What makes DATs especially powerful is their flexibility. These companies can deploy a wide array of treasury and yield strategies with an aim to increase their multiple to net asset value, or \u201cmNAV\u201d. By maximizing token ownership on a per share basis, DATs seek to outperform their underlying token. One successful example is Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy, which saw its stock price surge 22x since it began buying bitcoin in TKYEAR through September of 2025, while the digital asset it accumulates, bitcoin, appreciated nearly 10x over the same period. But, volatility works in both directions. Recent market moves have seen some DATs retrench and mNAVs have fallen. Even with the operational ease and regulatory clarity offered by the structure, many DATs remain out of reach for many investors because of their volatility. To date, hedging options have been limited due to restrictions on Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)--regulated futures for the preponderance of tokens. In traditional markets, futures are contracts that let investors lock in the future price of an asset. For centuries, futures have played an important role in risk management, giving institutions a way to hedge exposure, speculate on price movements, and scale efficiently. In crypto, however, regulated futures exist only for only a small subset of tokens, like bitcoin and ether. The absence of comprehensive crypto futures can be largely blamed on former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. During his tenure, Chair Gensler asserted that most crypto assets were securities. Futures are derivatives on commodities which would have placed them outside of his jurisdiction and control. So, Gensler suppressed their launch, depriving investors of important risk management tools. The world has changed. As the U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration aggressively pursues its agenda to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet,\u201d new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has made it abundantly clear through numerous public statements that \u201cmost crypto tokens are not securities.\u201d With this regulatory hurdle cleared, futures are now in the spotlight. These futures aren't just standalone products \u2014 they're a gateway to broader market access. Through its generic listing standards guidance, the SEC recently clarified that tokens with six months of futures trading can more easily be listed as ETFs, opening the door to institutional capital and mainstream adoption. And as crypto futures become liquid, the long DAT, short futures strategy becomes possible. The DAT Basis Trade A basis trade is when an investor buys an asset in the spot market and simultaneously sells a futures contract on the same asset, aiming to profit from the price difference \u2014 or \u201cbasis\u201d \u2014 between the two. \u201cContango\u201d is when future prices are higher than spot. Under this market condition, basis trade strategies tend to be profitable. DATs hold, stake and even restake digital assets, earning real onchain yield. By buying their stock, investors gain exposure to that cryptocurrency and its yield. By shorting the corresponding futures of the DATs\u2019 crypto holdings, investors hedge away price swings in those assets. What\u2019s left is the spread between the future price of the token, versus the spot holdings of the DAT. When a DAT trades below its net asset value or when the future price of the token (or \u201ctotal return\u201d token, which is a future that includes staking yield) is higher than the DATs\u2019 spot crypto holdings, investors pocket a steady, relatively market-neutral return. While it\u2019s hard to project the size of basis, for alts, the differences may be more pronounced than other assets\u2013driving a higher yield to the investor. The upside is clear. When mNAVs are rising and futures are in contango the DAT basis trade could drive compelling returns. But, like all strategies, there are many risks and downside scenarios. Perhaps the most evident is a scenario where the mNAV precipitously decreases, and losses on the stock leg are not fully offset by the futures hedge. Also, DATs that trade at a discount to NAV may become obvious takeover targets. While this could erase losses by restoring mNAV, the acquirers could pivot to another asset class necessitating an unwind of the trade. For those sensitive to these risks, ETFs, where the mNAVs are designed to hold steady at par, may be preferred over DATs when it comes to executing a regulated basis trade. But comprehensive alt ETFs, along with futures in the underlying asset, are just starting to come online. So, in the interim, the bridge offered by DATs, plays an important role in educating traditional investors on the possibilities as crypto investing normalizes. As regulated futures proliferate across alts, the long DAT, short futures trade could become an ideal way for Wall Street to capture crypto yield without touching a wallet or suffering from the intense volatility that defines crypto as an asset class. In 2026, I think it will be the trade of the year.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Back at CES 2025 in January, I saw a sneak peak at something rather interesting: the HyperSpace Trackpad Pro. It\u2019s the first of its kind, being a premium external multi-touch trackpad for Windows users. For creatives on the Mac, the Magic Trackpad has been extremely popular, and now there\u2019s finally an alternative on the Windows end. The HyperSpace Trackpad Pro is built quite well. For all intents and purposes, you can think of it as a Magic Trackpad for Windows. Glass and aluminum build, fair bit of heft, and cold to the touch. It offers palm rejection, uniform clicking (no traditional diving board mechanism to be found here), and an incredible piezo electric haptic engine. It also offers a 240Hz polling rate, which makes it highly responsive. I do have to say, I\u2019m by no means a regular Windows user. However, using this trackpad to navigate around Windows made me feel a lot more at home, and the Hyperspace Trackpad Pro certainly offers a much nicer feel and experience than the trackpad built into the laptop I\u2019m testing. It\u2019s nice having two finger smooth scrolling, as well as gestures like pinch to zoom \u2013 without facing any stutter. In my time using it, it\u2019s hard to feel like this doesn\u2019t match the Magic Trackpad on a hardware basis. Granted, it really should. The HyperSpace Trackpad Pro comes in at $149.99, which is slightly more expensive than Apple\u2019s Magic Trackpad at $129. The price tag might make it a bit harder to swallow, especially if you\u2019re a Windows user that\u2019s never previously felt interest in having a dedicated trackpad with multitouch gestures. However, Hyper has one thing up its sleeve to bridge that gap: great software. With the HyperSpace Trackpad Pro, there\u2019ll be an app called Hydra that allows you to customize your trackpad heavily. For one, you can map out certain gestures or deep presses to perform certain actions, but you can also have special corner shortcuts. Think of it as having a bunch of invisible mappable buttons beneath the suface. If you\u2019re a creative professional who values having custom shortcuts on your mouse or keyboard, the HyperSpace Trackpad Pro aims to serve as another means of getting work done faster. HyperSpace Trackpad Pro isn\u2019t quite on the market yet, though it\u2019s close. You can currently order it on Kickstarter at an early bird price of $109, which is substantially lower than its retail price of $149.99. Hyper states that orders will deliver by March for those who contribute now, though the earliest orders will begin arriving in December.  General availability is in Q1 2026, so those who don\u2019t want to contribute to a Kickstarter will have to wait until then. You can join an email list to get notified for general availability. As for any Mac users reading this, it does work in a very limited capacity on macOS right now \u2013 though there\u2019s no special software to tune or customize it. You too will have to wait a little while. My favorite Apple accessory recommendations: Follow Michael:\u00a0X\/Twitter,\u00a0Bluesky,\u00a0Instagram FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

For the build quality and features of this design, that\u2019s cheap, especially if you have two unused hard drives handy. Those buying drives for this unit could use up to 30TB mechanisms for either 60TB of RAID 0 storage or 30TB of RAID 1 with redundancy against either drive failing. It\u2019s also possible to attach external storage via USB if you want another backup or extra capacity. Overall, for a minimal outlay, this is an excellent solution that delivers decent performance for those who want centralised backups and Cloud connectivity for a small group. And, purely on value, it's sure to be added to our best NAS device selection.

Available directly from Ugreen or from many online retailers, the NASync DH2300 has an MSRP of $209.99 in the US, \u00a3169.99 in the UK, and \u20ac 209.99 in Europe. But as part of a launch promotion, it can be sourced from Ugreen for $188.99, \u00a3152.99, or \u20ac 188.99, depending on your region. Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk typically matches these costs. That\u2019s a remarkably competitive price for a 2-bay NAS with 4GB of RAM, since other similarly specified NAS like the QNAP TS-216G-US are more like $239. And, those who like Synology will pay $285 for the DS223, a design without HDMI and only a four-core SoC. Asustor does compete on price with the Drivestor 2 Lite AS1102TL, a 2-bay with only 1TB of RAM (not expandable) and a four-core SoC for $175. The only alternative that might be worth the extra cost is the TerraMaster F2-425, which has an Intel X86-compliant processor that supports Virtual Machines. What the DH2300 delivers is a punchy, small system that\u2019s cheap to deploy and relatively easy to manage for a modest cost.      Item Spec CPU: Rockchip RK3576 (8 cores, 8 Threads) GPU: Mali-G52 MC3 GPU RAM: 4GB LPDDR4X (not expandable) Internal Storage: 32GB for UGOS Pro SATA Storage: 2-bays (3.5 or 2.5 inch mechanisms) M.2 Storage: N\/A Ports: 2x USB3.2 Gen1 USB-A (5Gbps) 1x USB3.2 Gen1 USB-C (5Gbps) 1x HDMI 2.0b Networking: 1x RJ45 1GbE LAN OS: UGOS Pro Maximum Capacity: 2x 30TB SATA (120TB) RAID Modes: JBOD\/Basic\/RAID 0\/RAID 1\/RAID 5\/RAID 6\/RAID 10 PSU: 12V 4.2A 50.4W Dimensions: 151 x 98 x 213.7 mm (LxWxH) Weight: 350g In many respects, the DH2300 is like a DH4300 Plus (read my review here), but approximately half as wide. The vertical mounting of drives reworks a concept I first saw in the WD MyBook Duo, making the storage relatively easy to install and remove. It would be nice if Ugreen had some trays that didn\u2019t require screws for 3.5-inch drives, like TerraMaster, but mounting drives isn\u2019t something most people will do often. Once screwed to the plastic trays, these can be lowered into the DH2300, and they engage with a satisfying click. The lid is held in place with magnets, should you want to swap a drive. The front of the NAS has four LEDs that represent power, LAN and the two drives, and these flash on the last three indicators to show activity. Also on the front is a single USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port, and on the rear are two more USB-A ports of the same spec. One Gen 2 port might have been nice, but Gen 1 is sufficient for many applications, including connecting external storage. The one controversial port on this machine is the LAN port, because for whatever reason, instead of the 2.5GbE port that went on the DH4300 Plus, it's only a 1GbE LAN port. With this NAS costing only about 60% as much as its four-bay big brother, the 2.5GbE LAN ports and two extra bays add a significant price increase. However, as I\u2019ll discuss later, it is possible to avoid this choice without spending another $200 on the other model. One feature often missing from entry-level NAS is an HDMI port, and this NAS has one that supports 4K video at 60Hz. This means the DH2300 could easily be configured as a single-screen display system for a marketing promotion, since the media-playing app can output to the HDMI port. There is a fine irony that TerraMaster, which also includes HDMI ports but lacks any apps to use them, is further embarrassed by Ugreen, which has had the functionality to use the video output from relatively early in UGOS development. Along with the NAS, in the box is a 50.4W PSU, screws for the drives, a screwdriver, and a CAT6 Ethernet cable. If you already have some drives, getting this machine operational should only take a few minutes. It\u2019s possible to complete the install with only a single drive, and add the second drive later, assuming you don\u2019t want to use RAID 0 or 1. I\u2019d best describe the DH2300 as a minimalist NAS approach, but, as I\u2019ll discuss later, it\u2019s surprisingly agile and can handle a wide range of applications. The build quality is good, as I expected from Ugreen, and even though it\u2019s mostly plastic, it has the air of a machine with many years of use ahead of it, and it comes with a 2-year warranty.      In comparing it to some of the alternative two-bay ARM-powered NAS, the product that it is most likely to be considered against is the Synology DS223J, a machine that costs a few dollars less. The best aspect of the Synology DS223J is the Synology DSM operating system and that brand's application ecosystem.\u00a0 However, it has a less powerful SoC, only 1GB of RAM, and only two USB ports. And, installing the drive involves disassembling the machine. It\u2019s also approaching three years old, and there is no indication from Synology that they'll replace it, since they\u2019ve given up on the cheaper end of the NAS market. The DH2300 is undeniably a more modern design that can run more apps simultaneously and has several features missing from the DS223J, including a GPU for hardware video transcoding. With fewer hard drives to cool, the vertical-tube cooling system on the DH2300 works well, and the system remains generally quiet even under duress. Air is pulled in from the underside and sides, travels over the mainboard and then up past the drives before being vented through a grill on the back of the lid. In my testing, the system barely reached about 35 \u00b0C, and that was after it had been on for 10 hours or more. At this price and spec, it's hard to criticise the DH2300, with the possible exception of the 1GbE LAN port. I can\u2019t see that leaving that out and using a 1GbE port would save much money, so it looks like Ugreen wanted to encourage people to get the DH4300 Plus instead. I\u2019d have liked tool-less drive trays, but Ugreen doesn\u2019t offer those on even the expensive DXP series. The first major surprise I encountered with the DH2300 is that it doesn\u2019t use the same SoC as the DH4300 Plus, which I\u2019d assumed it would. That NAS uses the \u00a0Rockchip RK3588, an ARM 8-core SoC that runs at 2.4GHz. But the DH2300 uses a similar, but not identical, Rockchip RK3576. The RK3576 has slower Cortex-A72 and Cortex-A53 cores, while the RK3588 has Cortex-A76 and Cortex-A55 cores. There is no L3 cache on the RK3576, and it also has a narrower 32-bit memory bus and a less powerful Mali-G52 MC3 GPU. That said, as I\u2019ll discuss more in the performance section, this is more than enough computing power for file serving, and Synology sold plenty of dual-bay NAS with single- or dual-core ARM processors. Both SoCs have an NPU rated at 6 TOPS, but the RK3588's external bandwidth makes it superior for general processing. The lower-specification chip in the DH2300 has the advantage of higher power efficiency, which might affect the annual running costs if you keep this NAS active 24\/7. Being derivative ARM chips, neither of these can use X86 features, such as running Virtual Machines, though they support Docker containers. The specific snag with doing this with the DH2300 is that it only has 4GB of RAM, which is not enough to run many containers, and it has limited processing power to execute them. That probably makes this NAS unsuitable for Docker container development, even if it isn\u2019t impossible.      The PCIe lane allocation is identical to the RK3588: five PCIe lanes, four PCIe 3.0 and one PCIe 2.1, which is typically used for a Wireless M.2 card. There is no wireless on this device, so the available bandwidth is split among the three USB ports and the 1GbE Ethernet port. For those outputs, it has sufficient, as with the same amount, the DH4300 Plus managed to support a 2.5GbE LAN. Perhaps Ugreen wants to hold that feature back for a DH2300 Pro model, or give the DXP2800 a reason to exist. Where this hardware, and the DH series generally, is mildly disappointing is that there are no memory upgrades available, as the memory is board-mounted. This was also true on the DH4300 Plus, but that did have 8GB pre-installed. For those curious, this SoC can address up to 32GB of RAM, should Ugreen be inclined to make other models that are better suited to Docker development. Given that Ugreen offers a wide selection of DXP-series NAS that support up to 96GB of RAM and NVMe drives, that seems unlikely. The DH2300 was made to deliver a basic solution for backup, media serving, and other tasks, and it does that well with the hardware it has on hand. It\u2019s not meant to be a system you can evolve, with the possible exception of larger hard drives. For the price, this has more memory and power than most entry-level NAS provide. Compared to QNAP and TerraMaster platforms, the Ugreen UGOS offering isn\u2019t as mature, feature-rich, and the number of first-party applications is low. That said, it has the ones that most buyers of this machine will want, and that might just be enough. Imagine you have a regional office with a couple of staff and you want a centralised backup for their computers that you can sync with bigger servers overnight. The DH2300 is fine for that, and getting it up and running will only take a short while. It\u2019s also perfect for media playback; you can install Jellifin or the Ugreen Theatre app to provide an interface for movies and TV, and the Photo and Music apps are great as well. It\u2019s also easily connectable to Cloud services, enabling a local copy of anything online, which might be critical in an outage. But this OS now offers features I\u2019ve been waiting for TerraMaster to deliver for at least 5 years, specifically the ability to use the HDMI port for something more interesting than just seeing Linux boot. Using the Ugreen NAS mobile app, you can select a video file and tell the system to output it from the HDMI port, with a maximum resolution of 4K at 60Hz. This feature is still in Beta, but I found it worked exceptionally well. The only snags I ran into were HDR content displayed on a screen that didn\u2019t support that mode, resulting in washed-out colours. Hopefully, Ugreen can fix that issue, because it's something many other NAS brands don\u2019t offer and users will love. If you have a specific need, it might be worth checking which apps the DH2300 supports before spending. But it caters well for media distribution, backups, and personal Cloud services. And, compared to the DXP NASync hardware, it's less suitable for developers.      Those buying a dual-drive NAS are confronted with one constraint that's very difficult to circumvent: the performance of physical hard drives. With two drives, and using RAID 0 for the best performance, the maximum speed you can realistically achieve with physical hard drives is about 300MB\/s, with each drive contributing roughly 150MB\/s. If you use JBOD or RAID 1 (mirror), then that performance wall is 150MB\/s. A few drives with hybrid caching might be able to push that towards 200MB\/s, but these aren\u2019t generally meant for NAS use. With those limitations in mind, the best fit for distributing this file system is a 2.5GbE LAN port, which is why it's so disappointing that, unlike the DH4300 Plus, the DH2300 only has a 1GbE LAN port. However, at my request, Ugreen sent me a CM648, also known as a Ugreen USB-A to RJ45 2.5GbE Ethernet adapter. I tried this on the DH4300 Plus, to find out if it supported channel bonding or link aggregation, which it didn\u2019t, even if the adapter worked fine. And, on the DH2300, it worked perfectly, even if the network panels on this NAS don\u2019t support configuring a fail-over or linking it with the existing LAN port. As the CM648 uses a USB-A port, you could add two of these, and it might be possible to add a third using an adapter with a USB-C port. For those interested in using one of these, the adapter costs less than $25 on Amazon, which seems like a bargain.      To put this in perspective, I installed two 4TB Seagate Iron Wolf drives in a RAID 0 configuration for maximum performance and over the built-in 1GbE that translated into 118MB\/s for both reading and writing. Switching to the CM648, I was able to achieve 296MB\/s reads and 286MB\/s writes, with no other modifications. That was connecting to a PC with a 2.5GbE LAN adapter, and by my calculations, that\u2019s 250% faster reads and 242% faster writes, with the same drives on the same NAS. My concern was that, with this hardware configuration, there would be a noticeable increase in CPU load and memory usage. But it turns out that the maximum CPU use in a file transfer was only 15%, and the memory was 16%.\u00a0 And that\u2019s no more memory than the NAS used at idle. Therefore, like the DH4300 Plus, the DH2300 is more than up to the job of saturating a 2.5GbE LAN link, and probably more than one. My obvious next thought was, would a 5GbE LAN adapter work, because Ugreen also make those? Sadly, I don\u2019t have one to test that theory, but there are issues down that path. Firstly, the USB bandwidth is only 5Gbps, so you might not get the full experience, but also, the drives are still capped at a maximum throughput of around 300MB\/s. However, it would be possible to use a SATA SSD in this NAS, and that would have the performance to saturate a 5GbE LAN port. Those adapters cost around $35, but that also assumes you have network infrastructure that supports 5GbE networking. Out of curiosity, I deleted the RAID 0 volume, formatted drive one as a \u2018Basic\u2019 drive, then pulled the second drive out and replaced it with a Kingston 1.92TB SATA SSD. I should say that nowhere in the notes does it imply that the DH4300 supports hot swapping, but this all worked like it might. Once the drive was formatted, a cache could be added using the SATA SSD. That\u2019s an excellent feature, because if you have one large, say 20TB drive, you can get 2.5GbE (or even 5GbE) performance out of it using a relatively inexpensive SATA SSD to cache reading and writing. Most two-bay NAS don\u2019t support any of this technology, so it's exciting to find Ugreen delivering it to those on a budget. A 256GB SATA SSD is typically $25, and that\u2019s sufficient to provide caching for a conventional drive. Testing a single 4TB IronWolf drive with caching provided by a Kingston M600 SATA SSD achieved 296MB\/s reads and 191MB\/s writes. The reason that we didn\u2019t get the full impact on the writes is that with a single SSD, the system only configures it for read-only mode. That\u2019s the limitation of this solution, but it's better than having raw single-drive performance. The real takeaway from all my playing is that even with only two bays, no M.2 slots and a single 1GbE LAN port by default, the DH2300 is packed full of possibilities. If you want a faster LAN, another $25 can get you there by merely plugging in the adapter.      With the possible exception of the LAN port, which can be fixed, the hardware in this NAS is ideal for home or small-office users. For those dipping their toes into the world of NAS for the first time, it offers an easy-to-follow learning curve, and most users should be up and running within a remarkably short time. Without an X86-compliant processor, it will never host virtual machines, and with 4GB of RAM, it can only handle a couple of major Docker containers. But that\u2019s missing the point, as this NAS secures and dispenses files, displays video files, and archives media effortlessly. And, once UGOS Pro gets WORM volumes, and it undoubtedly will, it could be the cheapest local backup vault available. If you want 10GbE, VT, and M.2 SSDs, they are available, but not at this price. This is a terrific NAS that does most of what these things are bought for, without breaking the bank. Value 2-Bays but plenty of NAS for a low price 4.5 \/ 5 Design Simple but effective design that is quiet and attractive 4 \/ 5 Features No x86-based, but good enough for the key tasks 4 \/ 5 Software Not as many apps as others, but all the common tools 4 \/5 Performance Limited with a 1GbE, but excellent with a 2.5GbE adapter 4 \/ 5 Overall For the money this is a great starter NAS 4.5 \/ 5 You need a live local backupWith a 1GbE LAN port and up to 120 TB of local storage, this could be the perfect device for live synchronising files from a desktop or workstation PC. The only caveat is that without some extra hardware, you have only one 1GbE LAN port. You need a small dedicated file serverThe Rockchip RK3576 is a repurposed phone SoC, but it's got more than enough performance for file serving with two hard drives or SSDs. It\u2019s quiet, power-efficient, and has a highly responsive interface. You need failover or link aggregationWith only one LAN port, Ugreen disabled LAN fail-over and link aggregation, understandably. If you want these now, then you will need a NAS with dual LAN ports, like those on most of the DXP series. You need virtualisationVT mode is a feature of Intel and AMD processors, but it isn\u2019t supported on this NAS using its ARM SoC. If you want VT, get a NAS that uses an Intel or AMD processor.

Many Millennials and Gen Zers are abandoning hope of ever owning a home, meanwhile the ultra-wealthy seem to keep snatching up properties as if they\u2019re collectables. And even if you manage to find plenty of home listings in your area, you might quickly realize that none of them are places you would ever be interested in inhabiting.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Over the last few months, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on a tear of dealmaking, announcing multibillion dollar agreements with the biggest tech companies in the world. There\u2019s Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Broadcom, and most recently, Amazon. He\u2019s committed to spending a grand sum total of $1.4 trillion on datacenters in the coming years \u2014 an eyebrow-raising figure for a company which claims its annual revenue is projected to reach $20 billion this year, begging an all-important question for the entire tech industry, whose fate is now tied to OpenAI: What happens if he can\u2019t pay? At an event this week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar seemed to suggest that the government could act as a \u201cbackstop\u201d for the company\u2019s commitments \u2014 comments she later walked back. And in a long-winded post on X, Altman addressed the question of what happens to OpenAI if its web of deals falls apart: \u201cIf we screw up and can\u2019t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,\u201d Altman said. \u201c...We of course could be wrong, and the market\u2014not the government\u2014will deal with it if we are.\u201d The odds don\u2019t look great right now. In order to come through on its compute commitments, OpenAI\u2019s revenue would have to grow to an estimated $577 billion by 2029, roughly the size of Google\u2019s revenue that same year, Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at Theory Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. That\u2019s a roughly 2900% jump from its current projections for 2025. \u201cThese are crazy numbers,\u201d he told Forbes. But OpenAI has options. One likely scenario is that the AI company pays for and utilizes only a portion of the compute it has booked, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. In that case, companies like Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, CoreWeave and others will most likely renegotiate the contracts and ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all. \u201cThey don't want OpenAI to go bankrupt, so their incentive is to renegotiate,\u201d he told Forbes. \u201cHe\u2019s taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.\u201d  Renegotiating contracts isn\u2019t uncommon in the data center world. These contracts are extremely complex and often spread out over a span of years; some parties can even further extend timelines in case companies aren\u2019t able to meet commitments. Clients like OpenAI are typically billed on the basis of usage. The \u201cbig numbers\u201d being announced are often larger than what\u2019s actually committed under contract, largely due to variables like share price, data center construction cost and GPU price, data center expert Daniel Golding said. For instance, OpenAI has committed to buy up to 6 GW of AMD\u2019s chips (estimated to be worth around $90 billion) in exchange for about 10% of AMD shares\u2014no cash on either side. But that hinges on performance milestones for OpenAI\u2019s technology and commercial business as well as AMD\u2019s share price. The contracts often have some capital I ifs. Thanks to constraints on power supply and chip availability, there\u2019s a possibility that some of these infrastructure providers aren\u2019t able to deliver in time, another opportunity for OpenAI to weasel out of paying some of the top line number. OpenAI\u2019s $22.4 billion in total contracts with CoreWeave, for instance, can be terminated by either party at any time \u201cfor cause\u201d (legal speak for things like delays). But even with about a trillion dollars on the line, the bigger risk in Altman\u2019s mind is not having access to enough cheap compute to train and run better AI models when the time comes\u2014 a move that is crucial for revenue growth. \u201cWe believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,\u201d he said, adding that the company is also exploring ways to sell compute to other companies directly, much like CoreWeave does. When reached for comment, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said the company has \u201cnothing to add.\u201d Altman\u2019s fixation on grabbing as much gargantuan compute as he can is not surprising. He has always knelt at the altar of scaling laws. Earlier this year, Altman mused on the coming of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the company\u2019s overarching goal of creating AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities. \u201cThe intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it,\u201d he wrote, noting you could get \u201ccontinuous and predictable gains\u201d from pumping money into those resources. \u201cThe scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude,\u201d he wrote. Even before ChatGPT was released, he told employees at his crypto-cum-identity company Worldcoin (now called World), that one of his personal operating principles is \u201cscale it up and see what happens,\u201d something he\u2019s found effective with everything from large neural networks to fusion reactors, Forbes reported. And the faster the better. Scaling up \u201cearlier than it makes sense to \u2026 is super, super valuable,\u201d he told Worldcoin employees. \u201cThe math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is \u2018they need me more than I need them.\u2019\u201d  Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn\u2019t have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won\u2019t have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. \u201cHe has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,\u201d said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. \u201cHe's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.\u201d That\u2019s not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University\u2019s Leavey School of Business. \u201cWe allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,\u201d she said. Luria adds: \u201cHe can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.\u201d There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he\u2019d take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he\u2019d seemingly be off the hook, they said. As OpenAI has grown in prominence, tech giants have clamored to strike deals with the AI behemoth. \u201cMore of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate,\u201d Altman said recently. And they\u2019ve reaped the upsides: Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom gained a collective $636 billion in market cap on the days their deals were announced. Most recently, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion AI infrastructure deal with Amazon on Monday, the company\u2019s stock increased 4%, adding $10 billion to Jeff Bezos\u2019 net worth. \u201cThe math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is \u2018they need me more than I need them,\u2019\u201d Luria said. Companies involved in these circular deals have already indicated they\u2019re willing to bail each other out. In September, Nvidia said it would buy CoreWeave\u2019s unsold computing capacity through 2032, initially worth $6.3 billion. Presumably, that could expand to include anything OpenAI doesn\u2019t use given that it\u2019s CoreWeave\u2019s largest customer. \u201cIf you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank,\u201d said Lloyd Walmsley, a Mizuho analyst who covers Meta, Google and Amazon. \u201c\u200aEveryone's holding hands and, and having this leap of faith that the products are so powerful.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that OpenAI uses all the compute it has booked, and needs more. In that case, the AI titan will need to raise more funding\u2014either through private or public markets\u2014and increase its revenue exponentially. Part of why Altman has spoken about a potential OpenAI IPO is that it would make raising cheaper debt much easier. Altman said on Thursday that he\u2019s confident that revenue will continue to grow, primarily from upcoming enterprise products and categories like robotics and consumer devices. Then, take the extreme case. If OpenAI were to file for bankruptcy protection, who would get paid first? Who would, in Sam Altman\u2019s words, \u201cget burnt\u201d? For one, it\u2019s entirely possible that some cash-rich company, perhaps one on the other end of one of its big contracts like Microsoft or Oracle, buys it in a fire sale. In the very unlikely event OpenAI goes bankrupt and liquidates instead, debtholders would get their money back first. Then equity investors, and finally\u2014if there\u2019s anything left over\u2014common shareholders. OpenAI has only announced one debt deal so far, a $4 billion credit facility with nine banks including JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company announced the loan in October 2024 and said it is a revolving credit facility (akin to a giant corporate credit card). It\u2019s unclear if OpenAI has additional debt, which it isn\u2019t required to disclose as a private company. \u201cIf you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.\u201d   King among OpenAI\u2019s equity holders is Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company following OpenAI\u2019s restructuring as a for-profit company last week. Microsoft has invested $11.6 billion of its $13 billion commitment to OpenAI, and OpenAI has committed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft Azure\u2019s compute services over the coming years. The companies have two-way plans to share revenue. \u201cOf the dominoes that are going to fall when OpenAI can't pay everybody [and the question arises of] who gets paid first, and I'd argue that Microsoft gets paid first,\u201d Luria added. Other large shareholders include Thrive, SoftBank, Dragoneer and investors in the $6 billion merger between Jony Ive\u2019s io and OpenAI. Common shareholders\u2014employees, cofounders and the nonprofit\u2014would get what\u2019s left, proportionally to how much they paid for their shares. Interestingly, OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit holds a special \u201cClass N\u201d common share, which gives it majority voting and veto power in elections of board directors, though that share isn\u2019t entitled to any financial return if the company were to go under. (The nonprofit\u2019s 26% stake likely also includes ordinary common shares.) Altman\u2019s wheeling and dealing is nothing short of mind-boggling, though many of the biggest payments aren\u2019t due for a few years. In the AI universe, that\u2019s plenty of time to figure out how he\u2019s going to pay for it all, whether it\u2019s additional fundraising or explosive revenue growth. Seems like nobody knows the answer just yet, not even him.","label":0}

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a step above its competitors in every respect, including price. This monster $599 headset literally does it all. Simultaneous audio between two USB-C sources, 3.5mm, and Bluetooth, support for literally every gaming platform, premium materials, ANC, 30-hour swappable batteries, a desktop digital audio controller, and superb audio. The only issues amount to minor nitpicks, but you're going to need to really, REALLY want those extra features to justify that sky-high price tag. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is the best headset I've ever reviewed.  Top shelf build quality and comfort Industry-leading device versatility Immaculate, peerless audio Retractable mic with ANC Handy DAC with great features Monster battery life Premium specs means premium price Software is a bit slow and could be improved Materials make it a fingerprint magnet  Why you can trust Windows Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  $599.99. That's how much the latest effort from SteelSeries will set you back. And it's a price tag that's impossible to overlook. This is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite. It joins other products that share the \"Elite\" branding, such as the Xbox Elite Controller, targeting users on the high end. Gamers span all sorts of purchasing power capabilities these days, and companies know it. For those with cash to burn, building products that can seemingly do everything while also sporting the most premium materials is a segment manufacturers are increasingly targeting. The Arctis Nova Elite unashamedly joins that market as the best Xbox headset for pure, decadent luxury. As a humble games blogger, I'm not sure there's a universe where I would (or even could) ever pay $599.99 for a headset, practically under any circumstances \u2014 but if I could afford it, it would absolutely be for this headset. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is undeniably the most luxurious gaming headset I have ever used, whose features and quality inarguably justify that sky-high price tag. But you're going to be a very specific type of gamer to want to buy in here. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by SteelSeries. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. For over a decade, I've been reviewing headsets of all shapes and sizes. I've tried earbuds, budget gaming headsets, and premium cans for enthusiasts. I keep all of the headsets I review for active comparisons, and could probably open my own headset store if this tech blogging lark ever folds. One thing that won't fold is my enthusiasm for recommending YOU the best Xbox and PC headsets for your use cases. As for this headset, I've also been using the previous Arctis Nova as my daily driver. How does this one compare? Read on.       You know the price already. It's a beefy boy, but what about the specs to match it? Let's take a look. This is premium from every angle you look. This is a hi-res certified headset, which means it's verified by independent organizations as being able to deliver sound beyond a typical CD. This is 24-bit\/96 kHz signals specifically, and to do that, requires a higher grade of engineering and materials. As far as I could tell, this is the first wireless gaming headset to achieve this standard \u2014 a level typically reserved for audiophile products and studio-grade gear. Category Arctis Nova Pro Elite Drivers 40mm carbon fiber drivers with brass surrounds Frequency response 10 Hz \u2013 40 kHz (Hi-Res certified) Connectivity Dual USB-C, 2.4 GHz wireless, 3.5mm line-in, Bluetooth  Microphone Retractable and beamforming internal retracted modes Battery system Dual hot-swappable batteries (30~ hours x2) Build materials Steel headband, aluminum hinges, premium leatherette cushions Weight ~350 g Compatibility PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox (via DAC), mobile (via Bluetooth) Special features Hi-Res Wireless certification, AI mic noise reduction, EQ software, ANC options, full DAC with multi-platform connectivity, simultaneous audio source mixing Price (RRP) $559.99 USD It's not all about hi-res certification here, though. While premium materials definitely had a role to play here, this headset also boasts some of the most impressive versatility we've ever seen in a gaming headset. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Arctis Nova Elite's powerful digital audio controller looks unassuming on your desk, but it boasts monstrous capabilities. It's your platform for hot-swapping and keeping batteries charged up (with each of the 2 included cells offering up to 30 hours of playback). It also lets you mix audio signals from four different sources: two USB-C, one 3.5mm line-in, and one Bluetooth 5.3. This is the first headset that has offered the ability to mix Xbox, PS5, and PC audio simultaneously since SPDIF fell out of fashion as a result \u2014 something game streamers using consoles and capture cards might appreciate. Even the packaging is premium here, as SteelSeries guns for the audiophile and enthusiast gamer segment. It's as expensive as some Xbox Series X and PS5 models at $599.99, and it seems to have good stock levels across the board as of writing. Does the Arctis Nova Elite stick the landing? Absolutely yes, in (almost) every regard. And luckily, the parts that could be improved are software in nature and can be updated. Here are more details on the experience.      When I opened up the package to this headset, I immediately knew I was about to experience something special. This is by far and away the most expensive headset I have ever reviewed, and its premium presentation will immediately command your attention. The packaging is accented in gold and comes in a sort of monolithic box as if it had descended from another planet. The Arctis Nova Elite sports a familiar design if you've seen the predecessor Arctis Nova Pro (my previous primary driver here), complete with a retractable mic, detachable magnetic side-plates housing USB-C connectivity and the battery bay, as well as a floating headband. What sets it apart is that every aspect of it is dialled up to 11. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The dials, buttons, and materials all sport a very luxurious feel. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The leatherette earcups feel incredibly comfortable, and dare I say, dreamy on the skin, easily defeating fabric-clad rivals. The floating headband is also an easy win for long, long periods of use, and retains SteelSeries' tradition for cranial comfort. One weird downside of the floating headband is that it's easy to rock the headset off your head if you get a little too immersed in the music (and immersed you will, the sound delivery on this headset is immense). It's designed for long gaming sessions at the end of the day, but it's worth being aware of.      Returning is the retractable boom microphone, which now cleverly has per-configuration settings. When you retract it, you can still use it for calls, and it'll beamform your voice similar to earbuds. When you extend it, it functions as a high-quality mic for comms and potentially even light content creation. I'm not sure I'd record a full YouTube video on this mic over my Elgato XLR, but it's up there with the best gaming headset mics I've used. Indeed, the ability to retract the mic and fall back to Bluetooth 5.3 gives you lifestyle usability here that many other \"gaming\" headsets don't really offer. The subtle design on the black model means it won't look out of place when used during commutes or on a plane, and there's even an alternative colorway that fits a more Apple-style grey fashion aesthetic, too. The only criticism I'd offer here from a \"lifestyle\" perspective is that, perhaps, the logos are a bit \"loud\" for this type of use case. There are after-market sideplates you can buy that look a little more subtle, though, or even louder ones if you prefer. The World of Warcraft Horde ones are out of stock, though (dang.) Also, the soft-touch plastics SteelSeries opted for here tend to be fingerprint magnets too, which isn't a big deal, but on the black model, it can be pretty noticeable. When you're knee deep in corpses in a Battlefield 6 map or rocking to Nirvana while writing a gaming headset review on the internet (meta), you're likely not thinking about the side plates or fingerprints, though. How's the audio? It's fan-expletive-tastic.      Let's not beat around the bush here. The Arctis Nova Elite is the most immaculate audio experience I've had in over a decade of gaming headset reviews. I put them directly head-to-head with a family member's studio-grade Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO and was quite stunned to find the experience pleasantly comparable. This is a gaming headset, but I've found myself using it primarily for music over the past few weeks. Rediscovering new details in soundscapes I know very well has been incredibly fun with this product, as someone who generally uses earbuds or other random gaming headsets for music typically. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. There's no distortion, no glitching, no artifacting, no muddiness, no range is overbearing or under-represented \u2014 it's simply hard to go back to anything else after using these. ANC helps eliminate background noise on planes, trains, and buses, and easy on-ear controls and a solid mobile app make them a winner for commuters. Indeed, you have multiple ways to connect to this headset, too. As noted, the digital audio controller will sit at your desk and politely allow you to connect up not one, but actually three sound sources, on top of a fourth Bluetooth signal directly into the headset. And yes, you can mix them all simultaneously. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. The vast majority of users won't need this, but as a game streamer that uses a laptop and an Xbox with a capture card, I've found it incredibly welcome to not need to Bluetooth to my TV to get game audio (but you can still do that if you want?!).      The headset is heavily configurable, too. The Steelseries GG software on PC and mobile devices allows you to load up from a huge array of presets for various games, more so than any other headset I've tried. Even obscure games are represented here, which is impressive. The only downside is that you can't really delete any of the presets, nor favorite the ones you prefer. It can be a pain going back and forward between a gaming preset and a music preset, for example \u2014 but it's easily fixable. The software on PC in general could use a variety of improvements, as it sometimes hangs and features app downloads and things most people are doubtlessly unlikely to use (why would I need to download Discord from SteelSeries?). But, this is quite honestly my only gripe with the feature set, and thankfully, software is a comparably easy fix over a hardware flaw. This headset has no hardware flaws. The first iteration of the Arctis Nova Pro had a protrusion in the left ear that could get uncomfortable across long sessions, for example, but there's no such issue here. Maximum comfort, with maximum longevity, and superb, immaculate audio. For gaming, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite continues to excel. Games like Battlefield 6 and Overwatch absolutely sing on this device, giving away enemy positions with powerful tactical awareness, all without detracting from the more immersive sound design of the various virtual warzones we inhabit. The amount of tweaking you can do is impressive, too. Pushed to its extremes, the bass can get obnoxiously punchy if you want it to, or leave it thick and creamy, all while retaining maximum clarity and separation. Instruments sound like real instruments on this headset, which might sound like an odd thing to say \u2014 but you really feel the physicality of a kick drum or the slide of a bass string in this soundscape. Imagine how that translates to games with high-quality audio design, with explosions and gunfire zipping all around you. It's difficult to compare this to other gaming headsets as a result. The Arctis Nova Elite is just sublime. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The microphone experience is good, too. As you can hear in the clip above, you're looking at crystal clear comms with the microphone extended, and very good call quality when it's retracted. You can set per-config sidetone too. The sidetone quality isn't the best, but it's more than adequate for game comms. All up, it's hard to find things to gripe about here. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The number of settings you can alter and control is intuitive to set up and access, even if the software itself can be a bit slow at times. And hey, it can (and will) be updated. This headset is an absolute winner, but ... it's hard to look past that price point.      There's pretty much no other headset that competes with the Arctis Nova Elite. On pure audio alone, the Arctis Nova Elite stands out in its own class and is more closely comparable to other hi-res headsets that typically don't fall into the gaming category. The only other headset with this kind of wireless versatility is the Astro A50 (2025), and the Arctis Nova Elite has it utterly beaten on raw audio, comfort, and lifestyle versatility. The Astro A50 is a pure gaming headset, though, and shaves $300 off the asking price to boot. I think, unless you were planning to use this headset everywhere and anywhere as a lifestyle option, you might get more bang for your buck with the similarly versatile Astro A50 ... but you wouldn't get the sound quality, multi-USB source mixing, or hot-swappable batteries. There's simply no real comparison here. The Arctis Nova Elite is well and truly in a category of its own.      The Arctis Nova Elite is the ultimate gaming headset. It's the ultimate everything headset, frankly, able to easily accommodate high-end gaming, multi-device mixing for content creation, and day-to-day lifestyle use with ANC and Bluetooth. Its hi-res certification isn't just a sticker; it's immediately recognizable the second you commit a current to this headset. The sound reproduction puts the Arctis Nova Elite thoroughly in a category of its own, with few, if any, comparable peers. But boy howdy, it ain't cheap. You're going to either need to be a true all-day audio enthusiast, particularly fiscally affluent, or (like me) a poor financial planner to justify buying this. In my headset reviews, I tend to put a big emphasis on value for \"most\" people. Most of us are unlikely to look at a $599.99 headset and ever consider it an option \u2014 myself included. But with this, hearing is believing. It's one of the best headsets around. I've used my Arctis Nova Pro as my \"daily\" headset for several years at this point, and aside from some cushion wear, it's as good as it was the day I got it (and the cushions are easily replaced, too). If you were planning to use this headset for years and years, I think even the more budget-conscious could consider this headset, particularly if you wanted something you could use everywhere and anywhere. At the same time, would you feel comfy taking a $599.99 headset on the subway in that situation? I'm not sure I would. This headset is targeting a very specific type of customer unashamedly, and given what it offers, it's hard to penalize it for its price tag alone. The price makes sense given what's on offer. Whether or not it makes sense for your budget entirely depends on you and your needs. One thing I do know is you absolutely will not be disappointed.       The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a best-in-class headset boasting supreme versatility, comfort, audio, and specs. It also boasts a supreme price tag, shrugging off affordability for maximum features and luxury. You're either going to really want all of its features or have cash to burn to justify this headset, but either way, you won't be disappointed.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Sam Parkin has his say on the big issues in the EFL With the final international break of the year here, former Swindon, Ipswich and Luton striker and Final Score EFL pundit Sam Parkin gives his five takeaways from what we learned across the Championship and League One this weekend. Rob Edwards is quitting Middlesbrough for Wolves Middlesbrough boss Rob Edwards has been given permission to speak to Wolves. Parkin: \"I'm surprised, because I think given where he was at Luton in terms of his stock, I think that was probably, with respect, as good as he could have hoped for, the Middlesbrough job. It's a really big job. \"He's turned the support around from being a little bit in the doldrums to feeling really positive. \"So I am surprised from that respect, because I think the opportunity to take Middlesbrough back into the Premier League would be amazing for him. \"But I just think on this occasion, it's just the heart, isn't it? It's the fact that he was a player at Wolves, the fact he's worked there, the location, the Premier League. It's all those factors. \"So from the outside, we can all have an opinion, but what's important is what works for someone and his family, ultimately. \"I think the Middlesbrough job, as great as it is, has just been topped for ingredients by this Wolves offer. \"It's a gamble for him because the reality is the two teams could swap divisions, but it's the Premier League and I think you just have to understand that.\" Gary O'Neil has been linked with Wolves and Middlesbrough  Southampton fans have reacted angrily to the news the club are considering hiring Gary O'Neil as Will Still's replacement as manager. O'Neil was a popular player for the Saints' rivals Portsmouth.  Parkin: \"I think that would be a very brave appointment. That's not that I don't feel Gary O'Neil deserves another opportunity at a good club, he absolutely does. \"It's ironic that the two jobs he's being linked with are Southampton, where he's got such an affinity with Portsmouth, and Middlesbrough, where I think he left under a little bit of a cloud when he was a player. \"So those two might be tricky for him for one reason or another, but he'll get another job. \"I think Southampton, it's dangerous to go back, Russell Martin, Ralph Hasenhuttl, guys like that have been spoken about. \"They've won two out of two under caretaker boss Tonda Eckert. He was a club appointment - he wasn't someone Will Still brought in. \"The players are clearly playing for him, so it seems like they might have turned the corner. But I would still anticipate it being an external appointment.\" John Eustace won at his former club Blackburn and has guided Derby to five successive victories and the top half of the Championship. Parkin: \"He left Blackburn to go to Derby and probably about a month ago, for the first time in his Derby career, he was getting criticised. \"So it's incredible really; five wins, very difficult at any level of football. His teams are always hard to score against, hard to beat, that's the strength of his side. \"So to see them get two at Blackburn and to be scoring three at Sheffield United is great. \"Carlton Morris has hit the ground running and has 10 goals recently as well. He scored in his first four games, had a little bit of a lean spell, but now can't stop scoring and has six in his last four, including a hat-trick at Sheffield United. \"They've got better front players than they've had in some time - Lars-Jorgen Salvesen, Ben Brereton Diaz, Patrick Agyemang from the MLS. \"I had no doubt coming into this season, Derby would improve. I think they're up to the top half now and I think they will continue in the same vein. I'm not saying they will definitely make the play-offs, but they will be mid-table certainties.\" Tom Cleverley is under mounting pressure at Plymouth The pressure is continuing to grow on Tom Cleverley at Plymouth after defeat at Huddersfield left them bottom of League One. Parkin: \"Plymouth are obviously a big, well-supported club, so the expectation in the third tier would be to go straight back up, but, probably similar to Norwich, it's a new team that he's working with. \"He got the dreaded vote of confidence a few weeks ago and I think he deserved that because when you're trying to bring in a huge number of new players, it takes a little bit of time. \"They've done sterling business, getting Lorent Tolaj, the centre-forward, in from Port Vale, who's been a revelation. But not enough of them have knitted together as of yet. \"When you lose the derby to Exeter as they did a few weeks ago, that was a poor performance by them. They were very weak in that game and out-fought by Exeter. \"That was a massive game for them at Huddersfield, equally so for Lee Grant at Huddersfield. They got the win, Plymouth didn't. The supporters are going to be unhappy and the pressure is just going to continue to build.\" League One leaders Stockport suffered a shock home defeat against Luton, but still look a good bet to reach the second tier for the first time since 2002. Parkin: \"Perennially, it seems that whatever division they're in, they're strong favourites to go up and rightly so. \"You know they're a really good squad and have a strong side. Dave Challinor has got copious amounts of promotions and they'd won their last four games, only conceding one goal to Tranmere in the FA Cup, so I was surprised by the outcome of that when they lost 3-0 at home to Luton. That probably underlines the good work Jack Wilshere has done in a short space of time at Luton. \"Even then, Stockport had chances and it could have been a different outcome. \"It was a shock result, but there were shocks all over League One. I don't think it's a reflection on a lack of quality, I think it's a reflection on how many good sides there are in League One and there are only 11 points between Stockport and Leyton Orient in 20th.\" Sam Parkin was talking to BBC Sport England's David Anderson.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Is AI enthusiasm outrunning realistic long-term revenue expectations?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Growing debate over the stability of artificial intelligence valuations has intensified in recent weeks as the market becomes increasingly dominated by AI companies. The sharpest warning yet comes from a figure whose name remains inseparable from the events of 2008, when the subprime mortgage collapse triggered a global financial crisis. Michael Burry, whose actions during the subprime crisis became central to the blockbuster movie The Big Short, has taken new positions that show his deep skepticism toward the current AI boom. Recent financial disclosures show Burry\u2019s firm, Scion Asset Management, has opened large option positions tied to Nvidia and Palantir, with a notional value exceeding $1 billion. These positions suggest that he sees downside risk in stocks widely viewed as pillars of the AI surge. Although Scion also opened shorts in companies outside the AI arena, the scale of these AI-linked positions has drawn the most attention. This is because they reflect his readiness to challenge market consensus during earlier speculative cycles. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! These filings only cover activity through late September 2025, so it remains unclear whether he has already repositioned, although the timing alone has amplified public debate. The renewed focus on Burry comes at a moment when concerns over circular financial relationships are rising. Nvidia has been at the center of several arrangements viewed as unusually structured, including deals involving xAI, and AMD and OpenAI have also formed partnerships that combine hardware supply with equity exposure. Such patterns reinforce the view that valuations may be driven more by momentum than by clear, long-term revenue expectations. They also appear at a time when companies are committing large budgets to data center expansion, advanced CPU integration, and hardware needed to support demanding AI tools. Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has also said that the AI sector is in bubble territory, although he believes the correction could happen gradually rather than suddenly. His comments show a belief that the sector\u2019s revenue models lag far behind its investment pace, raising questions about whether current spending levels will ever be justified by returns. Meanwhile, market reactions have shown renewed volatility, with Nvidia and Palantir both experiencing sharp declines as investors reassess exposure. Despite Burry\u2019s reputation, not everyone agrees with his assessment. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Palantir CEO Alex Karp publicly dismissed bubble warnings in direct terms, insisting that AI-driven economic expansion will ultimately justify current valuations. Whether Burry is again signaling structural risk ahead of the market or simply responding to short-term sentiment will become clearer as the sector moves from rapid expansion to measurable results. For now, the tension between optimism and caution continues, leaving investors to interpret signals from a figure whose past predictions reshaped financial history.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband made at least $130 million in stock profits over the course of the California Democrat\u2019s 37 years in Congress \u2014 a staggering return of 16,930%. Pelosi, 85, announced this week she will retire when her term ends in January 2027. The San Francisco pol became famous as the first woman to wield the speaker\u2019s gavel, and infamous for her exceptional stock market returns. Before first taking Congressional office in 1987, the then-47-year-old freshman and her hubby, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi, reported between $610,000 and $785,000 in stocks in their portfolio, according to a copy of her \u201chand delivered\u201d 1987 financial disclosure form. They held a dozen stocks, including CitiBank, and in many companies no longer publicly traded. That portfolio has soared to $133.7 million today, according to the latest estimates from Quiver Quantitative. That represents an eye-watering profit of 16,930% \u2014 compared to 2,300% for the Dow Jones over those years. Even with the power of compound interest, the windfall represents a staggering 14.5% average annual return \u2014 beating out the S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow Jones performances over those years, around 7% to 9%. Last year, their investment portfolio\u00a0pulled in an estimated 54% return, more than double the S&P 500\u2019s 25% gain \u2014 and beating every large hedge fund, according to numbers in\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s end-of-year tally. Pelosi\u2019s 2024 financial disclosure form shows holdings in some two dozen individual stocks, including millions in each of NVIDIA, Palo Alto Network, Salesforce, Netflix \u2013 and between $25 and $50 million of Apple stocks \u2013 their largest holding. The Pelosis are worth an estimated $280 million today \u2013 compared to around $3 million when the Golden State lawmaker joined Congress. They also have stakes in various other ventures, including a Napa Valley winery worth between $5 and 25 million, a Bay area Italian restaurant, commercial real estate and a political data and consulting firm. They have a home in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco valued at $8.7 million and a crash pad in the Georgetown neighborhood of DC bought in 1999 for $650,000. The She-Wolf of Wall Street is leaving public life as momentum grows to ban lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks, arguing they have access to market-moving information ahead of the public.  In September, the latest iteration of a trading-ban bill was introduced in the House.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPlease provide a valid email.\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\tBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\tNever miss a story.\t\t\t\t Pelosi is so notorious for trading that past versions of the bill were named after her \u2014 and ETFs have attempted to copy her trades.  \u201cI think what I\u2019ll miss most is how she trades,\u201d said Dan Weiskopf, portfolio manager of an ETF that follows members of Congress\u2019 trades called NANC \u2013 after the Queen of Stocks.  \u201cIt\u2019s so high conviction and aggressive. . . . The only reason why you make such trades is if you\u2019ve got a process that gives you confidence, and as far as I know, they\u2019re not buying off technicals. So, they must be doing it because of information around the companies themselves.\u201d Weiskopf said Pelosi\u2019s trading style is marked by her prolific use of options trading. \u201cYou only do that because you want leverage and you only really want leverage on that kind of trading if you have a lot of convictions,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s buying deep in the money and putting up a lot of money in doing it. . . . and we\u2019re not seeing her panic. We don\u2019t see a lot of flip flopping on her trading activity.\u201d One of Pelosi\u2019s greatest hits, he said, has been exercising a call option in December bought in late 2023 at an estimated premium of $1.8 million, allowing the Pelosis to nab 50,000 shares of\u00a0hot AI chip stock NVIDIA\u00a0for $12 a pop \u2014 less than one-tenth its market price. In total the couple paid an estimated $2.4 million for the investment, which on paper is now worth more than $7.2 million. \u201cWhen you\u2019re supposed to be called an honorable member of Congress, maybe you should look yourself in the mirror and say, I want to do the right thing,\u201d Weiskopf said. \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s true legacy is becoming the most successful insider trader in American history,\u201d said Kiersten Pels, spokesperson for the Republican National Committee. \u201cIf anyone else had turned $785,000 into $133.7 million with better returns than Warren Buffett, they\u2019d be retiring behind bars.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s office did not return The Post\u2019s request for comment.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The ongoing government shutdown has helped push confidence to near-record lows, but one segment of the population is actually feeling more optimistic.  The initial reading for the University of Michigan\u2019s sentiment index fell to 50.3 in November from 53.6 last month, almost matching the all-time low of 50 from June 2022, when the annual rate of inflation hit its post-pandemic high.     \u201cWith the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a statement Friday.\u00a0     The decline was widespread and was seen across different age groups, income brackets, and political affiliations, she added.     But not everyone followed that trend.    \u201cOne key exception: consumers with the largest tercile of stock holdings posted a notable 11% increase in sentiment, supported by continued strength in stock markets,\u201d Hsu said.     The survey closed before Tuesday\u2019s elections, which revealed continued voter discontent about affordability as food and energy prices creep higher.     The timing is also notable given that it didn\u2019t capture the most recent stock market selloff that sent the Nasdaq to its worst weekly loss since April\u2019s trade war chaos.     That came as investors grew more concerned about the AI boom looking like a bubble that could pop soon. Until this past week, the stock market was on a hot streak, notching fresh record high after record high, with the S&P 500 even closing in on the 7,000 milestone.     The market\u2019s impact on consumer sentiment comes as stock ownership has broadened over past five years into more income and age groups.   A separate University of Michigan report from last month said the increase in market participation has been especially large among lower-income consumers, while participation rates of younger and older consumers have caught up with middle-aged consumers.     In fact, a\u00a0survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth\u00a0showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are now retail investors in the capital markets.\u00a0And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years.     Stock ownership has highlighted a divergence in consumer sentiment in recent months: investors are turning more upbeat while non-investors have turned more pessimistic, according to University of Michigan data from October. And participants with the top 20% of stock holdings are especially optimistic.    The spilt even mirrors the K-shaped economy that has emerged as higher-income Americans continue to spend and prop up overall consumption, while others have pulled back.     Meanwhile, the so-called wealth effect of higher asset prices on consumer spending has become more potent in the last 15 years, making it harder to separate the stock market from the economy.   Today, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010, according to Oxford Economics.     The University of Michigan pointed out in October that sentiment among stock market participants had been on the rise since May\u2014after tumbling in April when President Donald Trump shocked global markets with his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.     By contrast, sentiment for non-stockholders continued to decline and had already hit post-pandemic lows.     \u201cThese patterns are consistent with the fact that strong asset values support consumer sentimentonly for those who own those assets,\u201d the report said. \u201cMeanwhile, given that wealthier, higher-income consumers generate a disproportionate share of aggregate spending, the recent uptick in sentiment among these households may may help buoy consumption spending even amid views of the economy that are relatively subdued from a historical perspective.\u201d   \u00a9 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":" Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest added $2 million in BitMine shares across its ETFs as the Ether-holding firm\u2019s stock surged 415% in 2025.  Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest has increased its exposure to Tom Lee\u2019s Ether treasury firm BitMine while reducing its position in Tesla. According to the firm\u2019s daily trading disclosures dated Friday, ARK purchased a combined 48,454 shares of BitMine (worth around $2 million) across three of its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).  Wood\u2019s investment funds have been increasing their exposure to BitMine since it started accumulating Ether (ETH) as a treasury asset in April.  BitMine shares were up 7.65% on the day to reach $40.23 in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. The stock has gained a whopping 415% since the beginning of the year.  Related: Cathie Wood drops BTC forecast by $300K, says stablecoins eroding market share Meanwhile, ARK sold approximately 71,638 Tesla shares across its funds, a position valued at roughly $30 million based on Tesla\u2019s closing price of $429.52. The ARKK ETF and ARKW ETF each trimmed holdings in Tesla, which has been one of ARK\u2019s flagship positions since 2018. Tesla\u2019s stock fell 3.68% on the day. The move comes as Tesla shareholders have approved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s nearly $1 trillion pay package, with 75% of voting shares backing the proposal despite opposition from major proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS.  The decision, announced at Tesla\u2019s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, will increase Musk\u2019s control over the company, boosting his ownership from about 13% to 25% if Tesla meets the outlined milestones. The package grants Musk 12 tranches of stock tied to performance goals, starting at a $2 trillion market cap and scaling up to $8.5 trillion.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"You'll want to weigh the pros and cons of putting SteamOS on a Windows handheld before doing it.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  While there is some disagreement on the subject, gamers by and large prefer the Steam Deck's simple, console-like SteamOS interface to Windows 11 or the Xbox Ally X's Xbox full-screen experience. The thing is, the Steam Deck is relatively old at this point and is one of the weaker PC gaming handhelds on the market today. In other words, it cannot play some games that can be played on other handhelds. However, if you get a stronger Windows handheld and then put SteamOS on it, you can get the best of both worlds. Still, you should weigh the pros and cons before actually doing this. Here are reasons for and against putting SteamOS on ROG Xbox Ally, ROG Ally, Legion Go 2, and other handhelds.      If you're already sold on this idea, then check out my guide on how to install SteamOS on Windows gaming handhelds. This process should work for all mainstream devices, including Xbox Ally, ROG Ally, Legion Go 2, Legion Go, and more. However, I do recommend understanding the pros and cons of doing this before going through with it. I'll list those in the next section.      For some of you, putting SteamOS on your handheld could solve most of the inconveniences you have with modern handheld gaming PCs. However, you should consider the perks and drawbacks to doing this before actually doing it.      There's no denying that SteamOS offers the smoothest and most intuitive interface of any handheld to date. The simplified design makes you feel like you're interacting with a gaming machine rather than a PC, but you can also go into the desktop mode and use it like a personal computer. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Meanwhile, most other handheld gaming PCs on the market (including Xbox Ally X, ROG Ally X, ROG Ally, Legion Go, Legion Go 2, and more) all offer more powerful APUs (accelerated processing units) with better graphics abilities. Most offer higher memory and SSD storage capacities as well, which are both important for gaming. As such, putting SteamOS on one of these Windows devices won't just provide a convenient interface; it will allow you to play some games that the Steam Deck isn't strong enough to handle.      Windows has a ton of extra programs running in the background that cause the system to work less efficiently and drain the battery faster. This being the case, when you swap to SteamOS, you might notice increased performance and longer playing sessions on your formerly Windows handheld.      Linux is a very customization-friendly software, and many Steam Deck users have been able to modify it to get it working just the way they want it to. Of course, some Windows handhelds are also designed around upgradeability, so, in some cases, you can also upgrade battery life and the SSD without much hassle. Being able to get the operating system, programs, and internals just the way you want can help you make your perfect gaming machine.      I previously reviewed the Legion Go S (SteamOS) and absolutely loved this device. It's more powerful than the Steam Deck and comes with SteamOS already in place. The thing is, the version of the Legion Go S (SteamOS) that I recommend sells for a pricey $899.99 at Best Buy. Meanwhile, you could get the ROG Ally for a less expensive $649.99 at Best Buy and then put SteamOS on it to save some money.      If you remove Windows 11 from your handheld gaming PC, you cannot put it back unless you purchase a new license, and that ain't cheap. Windows 11 Home licenses have an MSRP of $139.00 at Microsoft. Some people have made it so their handheld can dual-boot Windows and SteamOS. This can be a good option for some. However, doing this takes up a lot of storage space, and having both operating systems on the system can take more power, causing a handheld's battery to drain faster.      The vast majority of PC games are designed for Windows, and this is why the Steam Deck uses Proton to translate Windows instructions for Linux. The problem is, some games still don't work well on Linux or have an aspect that doesn't work well. As an example, Call of Duty, Battlefield 6, and many other multiplayer games don't work on the Steam Deck since they require the use of a kernel-based anti-cheat software, which doesn't work with Linux. If you really want to play those games on a handheld, you're better off using Windows.      Linux-based SteamOS works very differently from Windows, and some people can find it a little daunting working with the operating system. Out of the box, the SteamOS won't let you access other game services like Battle.net, Epic Games, and others, while you certainly can do these things on a Windows handheld out of the box. Still, there are workarounds that are easy enough to get a handle on. As an example, a plugin called Decky Loader makes it possible to quickly access different services. If you want help, you can check out my guide on how to install Decky Loader on SteamOS. On the plus side, the Steam Deck is incredibly popular, and there are plenty of tutorials out there to help you get it working just the way you want it to. When the Steam Deck launched a few years ago, it was the only mainstream handheld gaming PC. But since then, far more powerful handhelds have released with internals that can handle games that the Steam Deck cannot. For this reason, it might be a good idea to put SteamOS on your Windows handheld gaming PC. But, only if you've truly weighed the pros and cons of doing so. Hopefully, this page helped you think through your decision. If you ended up putting SteamOS on your Windows handheld, tell us about your experience in the comments.      This is really a matter of preference, but SteamOS does offer a simpler interface that's easier to navigate, and it doesn't have nearly as much bloatware either.  You sure can. You just have to go through the necessarily steps to get it installed.  Yep! You can put SteamOS on Windows handheld PCs. I actually put SteamOS on my ROG Ally, and my editor-in-chief put it on his Legion Go. It works beautifully in both cases.  Yes. Putting SteamOS on your Windows handheld PC isn't permanent, but long-winded to undo. You can reinstall Windows and replace SteamOS anytime. Yes, people have been able to dual boot both Windows and SteamOS on various handheld gaming PCs.  Just remember that doing this can take up a lot of storage space, can slow down your device, and can shorten battery life.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"I\u2019ve reviewed countless Acer Chromebooks, and I always appreciate their build quality and performance. I was skeptical when Chromebook prices started increasing, as I wondered if the value was still there. I have never used them for more than light web browsing and Google Docs, which don\u2019t require the power Chromebooks like the Spin 514 ship with. However, just because I don\u2019t take full advantage, it doesn\u2019t mean that others won\u2019t. And that\u2019s the selling point. The Chromebook Plus Spin 514 is like a build-your-own adventure. It packs plenty of power in a premium build, enabling you to use it for a wide range of tasks. Its form factor makes it versatile, and while I never love using my Chromebook as a tablet, there are legitimate uses for some users. It\u2019s not a question of whether the Spin 514 is worth it; it\u2019s a matter of whether you can find $800 of value for how you\u2019ll use it \u2014 let\u2019s find out. The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 (2025) features a MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chipset and 16GB of RAM, providing ample performance. It also sports a 14-inch IPS display with a resolution of 2880 x 1800. As the name suggests, the hinge spins, allowing the Chromebook to be used as a tablet or in tent mode for presentations. Its 70 Wh battery can go an entire day without needing to recharge.\u00a0 The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 (CP514-5HN-K4ZE) is available through Acer\u2019s website for $800. It features 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and is available in one color: Platinum Silver. Acer\u2019s Chromebook product numbers are like trying to learn a foreign language without a teacher. Please ensure you copy and paste the exact model number above to obtain the unit I\u2019m reviewing. Another model is available through Best Buy for $700, which features 12GB of RAM and a slightly different display.   Acer\u2019s     more expensive Chromebooks always feature a premium and durable design, but I appreciate what the company\u2019s done with the new Spin 514. My review unit sports sleeker lines in a thinner chassis. It also maintains excellent portability, weighing only 3 pounds. Thankfully, Acer didn\u2019t sacrifice durability for a prettier design. The Spin 514 still maintains a MIL-STD 810H drop test rating. I wouldn\u2019t recommend banging around your $800 Chromebook, but it\u2019s comforting to know that accidentally slamming my messenger back against a door isn\u2019t the end of my laptop.     Although Acer didn\u2019t have to compromise on durability, one item is missing that I used to enjoy on other Chromebooks from the company: an HDMI port. I loved being able to easily hook up my Acer Chromebooks to an external monitor or television, making them even better presentation tools. Thankfully, the Spin 514 still features two USB-A 3.2 ports and two USB Type-C ports. It also includes a 3.5mm headphone jack. One of the highlights of the Spin 514 is its 14-inch IPS WQXGA+ display with a 2880x1800 resolution. It\u2019s plenty sharp and color accurate, and movies look fantastic on the panel. It also has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which I prefer for productivity. It reaches a reasonably bright 340 nits, which is more than good enough for both indoor and outdoor use. Because of the Corning Gorilla Glass panel, you\u2019ll notice some glare outdoors, but nothing that would keep me from enjoying the Spin 514. Of course, as the name suggests, the display hinge does fold over 360 degrees. It allows the Spin 514 to be used in several orientations. I think it excels best as a traditional laptop, but you can also flip the screen all the way over to use it as a tablet. Multitouch gestures are supported, and it\u2019s enjoyable to have such a high-resolution display used as a tablet. However, it\u2019s unwieldy to hold at 3 pounds, and on a desk, you\u2019re laying it down on the keyboard. Palm rejection still isn\u2019t the best, so you have to be careful where your hands are at all times. Although I don\u2019t love tablet mode, I absolutely see the benefits of a hinge that goes beyond 180 degrees for tent mode. It\u2019s fantastic for presentations, allowing you to face the screen towards the audience while you control the slides or video. I can see the value for both the education market and business professionals.  I didn\u2019t know what to expect from the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chipset when I started using the Spin 514. Thankfully, performance is solid, and I\u2019m sure the 16GB of RAM in the Spin 514 also contributes to this. I don\u2019t game on my     Chromebooks, but the MediaTek chipset should provide decent performance.     I\u2019ll always opt for more RAM on Chromebooks, allowing me to have as many tabs open as I want without compromising performance. It\u2019s up to you whether you require the extra power Acer\u2019s latest provides, but you should know it's there if you need it. As of the time of writing this review, the Chromebook Plus Spin 514 runs ChromeOS version 141.0.7390.134, and Acer offers a free year of Google AI Pro with purchase. It gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2TB of cloud storage. The Spin 514 features a standard complement of AI features, including organizing documents into categories and photo editing. Google Gemini can answer questions about what you\u2019re doing on the fly, and also has access to Google\u2019s Magic Eraser. All of it runs smoothly enough, but I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a highlight of the device.  As for the rest of the software, I love what Google\u2019s done with     ChromeOS. It runs smoothly with excellent integration with your Android smartphone. I love using the keyboard shortcuts, and I can navigate around ChromeOS without taking my fingers off the keyboard. It\u2019s not quite Linux-like with window swapping, but I like the changes Google has made over the last several years.     I consistently get outstanding battery life from the Spin 514\u2019s 70 Wh cell. It got me through an entire day of football without missing a snap, and I enjoyed the sound from the upward-firing speakers on either side of the keyboard. The webcam is of high quality and ideal for your next video conference; recipients also noted that the microphone audio was clear and crisp.  As you\u2019d expect, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 isn\u2019t a perfect machine. I still don\u2019t enjoy the trackpad experience. It\u2019s better than it used to be, but I find the sensitivity to be jumpy, even after adjusting the settings. If you pick up a Spin 514, I highly recommend investing in a good external mouse to minimize your frustration. I don\u2019t understand Acer\u2019s choice of color for the Spin 514. The Platinum Silver looks appealing, but it\u2019s not the best practical choice. When the keyboard backlight is on, it\u2019s nearly impossible to see the ledgers, so unless you\u2019re good at typing by feel, you\u2019ll struggle. Making the keyboard deck or device color a little darker, or giving the ledgers a bit more contrast, would significantly improve the typing experience. As for the keyboard itself, I love the key travel and typing feel. It\u2019s easy to pound out a few hundred words in no time, and the majority of this review was written on the Spin 514. The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 is worth the price of admission, but it\u2019s up to you to decide whether you can recoup $800 worth of value. The tools are there for those who need them, and I love the changes made to ChromeOS. I appreciate the extra power under the hood that the Spin 514 provides. Still, it\u2019s not an inexpensive investment, so make sure you need what the Spin 514 offers before taking the plunge. The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 (2025) features a MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chipset and 16GB of RAM, providing ample performance. It also sports a 14-inch IPS display with a resolution of 2880 x 1800. As the name suggests, the hinge spins, allowing the Chromebook to be used as a tablet or in tent mode for presentations.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":" Remember when the future promised us flying cars and automated everything? Well, Japan just delivered on part of that promise with something wonderfully bizarre: a human washing machine. And honestly, after hearing about it, I kind of want one. At Expo 2025 Osaka, Science Corporation unveiled the Future Human Washing Machine, and it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. You climb into a sleek capsule, sit down, and let the machine do its thing. Water splashes around you, micro- and ultrafine bubbles get to work cleaning your body, and then air blasts you dry. The whole experience takes about 15 minutes, which might actually be faster than your current shower routine if you\u2019re anything like me. Designer: Science Corporation       But this isn\u2019t just some random quirky invention that popped out of nowhere. The concept actually has roots dating back to 1970, when Sanyo exhibited an Ultrasonic Bath at the original Osaka Expo. That version used pulsing jets, ultrasonic mist, and rubber massage balls to create what was essentially a human car wash. It was spectacular, photogenic, and totally impractical. The costs were so prohibitive that it never moved beyond being a futuristic showpiece. Fast forward 55 years, and Science Corporation\u2019s chairman Yasuaki Aoyama decided to resurrect the concept, but with a 2025 upgrade. The new version ditches the gimmicky bruteness of its predecessor for something more refined and genuinely useful. We\u2019re talking about biometric sensors that monitor your vital signs and stress levels, AI that adjusts water temperature and pressure based on what your body needs, and even a display that shows calming or positive images if the sensors detect you\u2019re tired or stressed. The technology behind it is genuinely impressive. Those ultrafine bubbles aren\u2019t just for show. They\u2019re designed to cleanse more effectively than regular water alone, blending traditional Japanese bathing culture with cutting-edge innovation. And unlike the 1970 version that was pure spectacle, this one has a clear practical application in mind.  Science Corporation isn\u2019t just building this for tech enthusiasts to marvel at during expo season. They\u2019re actually targeting nursing care facilities, where something like this could be genuinely transformative. Think about it: for elderly individuals or people with mobility issues, the simple act of bathing can be challenging, uncomfortable, or even unsafe. An automated system that can clean and dry someone comfortably while monitoring their health status? That\u2019s not just clever engineering. That\u2019s solving a real problem. During the expo, which ran from April through October, visitors got to experience the machine firsthand. The process is surprisingly straightforward. You step in, sit down in the transparent capsule, and the system takes over. Water fills the chamber with those special bubbles doing their cleaning magic. Meanwhile, sensors are constantly checking in on you, and if you\u2019re looking tense, the screen adjusts to show you something more soothing. Once the wash cycle finishes, the water drains automatically and the drying process begins with air circulating around your body. What strikes me most about this project is how it represents a shift in how we think about automation. We\u2019ve gotten used to robots handling manufacturing and algorithms managing data, but automating something as personal and intimate as bathing feels different. It requires a level of trust and sophistication that goes beyond just mechanical efficiency. The machine needs to understand human comfort, adapt to individual needs, and create an experience that feels safe and relaxing rather than clinical and weird.       There\u2019s no word yet on commercial availability for regular consumers, and honestly, I\u2019m not sure how many people would rush out to buy one even if it hit the market tomorrow. The concept might still feel too futuristic, too impersonal, or just plain too strange for mainstream adoption. But for specific use cases, particularly in healthcare settings, the potential is undeniable. Whether the Future Human Washing Machine becomes a common sight in homes or remains a specialized tool for care facilities, it\u2019s a fascinating glimpse into how technology continues to reimagine even our most basic daily routines. And who knows? Maybe in another 55 years, we\u2019ll look back at our manual showers the same way we now view hand-washing clothes in a river. Sometimes the future arrives in the strangest packages.

Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s asset and wealth management business, said at the Fortune Global Forum just weeks ago that some AI stocks have \u201ca little too much concentration.\u201d     And Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told Fortune weeks earlier that she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the market\u2019s reliance on AI, citing her own calculations that 75% of the gains, 80% of the profits and 90% of the capital expenditure in the S&P 500 was tied to data-center growth in the last several years.     The week of the offseason elections coincided with a tough week on Wall Street prompted by AI concerns. Famous short-seller Michael Burry\u2019s disclosure that he was taking a big position against Palantir resulted in a 10% stock slide over several days, to furious reaction from CEO Alex Karp. OpenAI, meanwhile, rattled markets by appearing to suggest that it would need some kind of federal \u201cbackstop,\u201d prompting fears that the still-private, still-unprofitable AI juggernaut is near \u201ctoo big to fail status.\u201d The Nasdaq 100 finished the week with the worst results since April.   Voters appear to have realized they\u2019re already picking up the tab in surging electricity prices.     Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited\u00a0economic concerns\u00a0as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over\u00a0affordability\u00a0in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.     Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that\u00a0he\u2019ll focus on affordability next year\u00a0as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.     Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average \u2014 although not everywhere.     \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on politicians to talk about affordability, and electricity prices are right now the most clear example of problems of affordability,\u201d said Dan Cassino, a professor of politics and government and pollster at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.   Rising electric costs aren\u2019t expected to ease and many Americans could see an increase on their monthly bills in the middle of next year\u2019s campaigns.     Gas and electric utilities are seeking or already secured rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period last year.     With some 80 million Americans struggling to pay their utility bills, \u201cit\u2019s a life or death and \u2018eat or heat\u2019 type decision that people have to make,\u201d said Charles Hua, PowerLines\u2019 founder.     In Georgia, proposals to build data centers have roiled communities, while a victorious Democrat, Peter Hubbard, accused Republicans on the commission of \u201crubber-stamping\u201d rate increases by Georgia Power, a subsidiary of power giant Southern Co.     Monthly Georgia Power bills have risen six times over the past two years, now averaging $175 a month for a typical residential customer.   Hubbard\u2019s message seemed to resonate with voters. Rebecca Mekonnen, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, said she voted for the Democratic challengers, and wants to see \u201cmore affordable pricing. That\u2019s the main thing. It\u2019s running my pocket right now.\u201d     Now, Georgia Power is proposing to spend $15 billion to expand its power generating capacity, primarily to meet demand from data centers, and Hubbard is questioning whether data centers will pay their fair share \u2014 or share it with regular ratepayers.     Midterm elections will see congressional battlegrounds in states where fast-rising electric bills or data center hotspots \u2014 or both \u2014 are fomenting community uprisings.     That includes\u00a0California,\u00a0Georgia,\u00a0Michigan,\u00a0Ohio,\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0and\u00a0Texas.     Analysts attribute rising electric bills to a combination of forces.   That includes expensive projects to modernize the grid and harden poles, wires and substations against extreme weather and wildfires.     Also playing a role is\u00a0explosive demand\u00a0from data centers, bitcoin miners and a drive to revive domestic manufacturing, as well as rising\u00a0natural gas prices, analysts say.     \u201cThe cost of utility service is the new \u2018cost of eggs\u2019 concern for a lot of consumers,\u201d said Jennifer Bosco of the National Consumer Law Center.     In some places, data centers are driving a big increase in demand, since a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes, according to the International Energy Agency. Some could require more electricity than cities the size of\u00a0Pittsburgh, Cleveland or\u00a0New Orleans.     While many states have\u00a0sought to attract data centers\u00a0as an economic boon, legislatures and utility commissions were also flooded with proposals to try\u00a0to protect regular ratepayers\u00a0from paying to connect data centers to the grid.   Meanwhile, communities that don\u2019t want to live next to one are pushing back.     An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research\u00a0poll\u00a0from October found that electricity bills are a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults.     Now, as falls turns to winter,\u00a0some states are warning\u00a0that funding for low-income heating aid is being delayed because of the\u00a0federal government shutdown.     Still, the impact is still more uneven than other financial stressors like grocery costs, which just over half of U.S. adults said are a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress.     And electric rates vary widely by state or utility.   For instance, federal data shows that for-profit utilities have been raising rates far faster than municipally owned utilities or cooperatives.     In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers \u2014 including data centers not even built yet.     Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.     That\u2019s spurred governors from the region \u2014 including Pennsylvania\u2019s\u00a0Josh Shapiro, Illinois\u2019\u00a0JB Pritzker\u00a0and Maryland\u2019s\u00a0Wes Moore, all Democrats who are running for reelection \u2014 to pressure the grid operator PJM Interconnection to contain increases.     Drew Maloney, the CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, suggested that only some states are the drivers of higher average electric bills.   \u201cIf you set aside a few sates with higher rates, the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates,\u201d Maloney said.     Examples of states with faster-rising rates are\u00a0California, where\u00a0wildfires\u00a0are driving grid upgrades, and those in New England, where natural gas is expensive because of strained pipeline capacity.     Still, other states are feeling a pinch.     In Indiana, a growing data center hotspot, the consumer advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition, reported this year that residential customers of the state\u2019s for-profit electric utilities were absorbing the most severe rate increases in at least two decades.     Republican Gov. Mike Braun decried the hikes, saying \u201cwe can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d   ___     Associated Press reporter Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed to this report.   \u00a9 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune\u2019s flagship AI newsletter. Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. A vast data center in Plano, Texas, is a symbol of the enormous AI infrastructure boom that has boosted stock markets and driven U.S. economic growth over the past year. The data center occupies more than 450,000 square feet and cost $1.6 billion to construct and equip. It supplies 30 megawatts of computing power to train and run AI models. Yet the company that runs it is a leading candidate to be ground-zero for a future AI financial meltdown.\u00a0The data center is one of dozens around the world operated by CoreWeave, a company that develops and manages data centers and sells their computing capacity to technology companies. Its business is at the center of the AI economy\u2014providing computing power to meet the voracious demand of the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. But CoreWeave doesn\u2019t own the Plano facility, nor does it own most of the data hubs it\u2019s operating. And that is a part of the problem. The company is built, by its own admission, on a mountain of debt\u2014obligations it has piled up as it races to build out a network of server farms for its customers. And that mountain looms far larger than the piles of cash that CoreWeave has brought in the door so far. When the company announces earnings on Monday, bulls and bears alike will be watching to see how its revenue is growing, and whether it has been able to pare its losses. CoreWeave\u2019s earnings are likely to be a bellwether for the state of the entire AI boom, and for the industry\u2019s massive and expensive infrastructure buildout in particular.     CoreWeave has $7.6 billion in current liabilities\u2014bills that fall due within 12 months\u2014on its balance sheet, and $11 billion in debt overall, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report, filed in August. Coming from a tech giant like Google or Microsoft with tens of billions in free cash flow, such numbers wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow. But CoreWeave\u2019s revenues were only $1.9 billion in 2024. On its Q2 earnings call, CEO Michael Intrator told analysts that full year 2025 revenue would land between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. \u00a0On the same call, the CEO said he expected CoreWeave\u2019s capex for the year would total between $20 billion and $23 billion.     Those short-term figures pale beside a bigger and potentially more onerous obligation that isn\u2019t on its balance sheet: the $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. Many of those payments are stretched over relatively long terms, of 10 years or more. Still, some of this is for data centers and office buildings that have not yet begun to operate or bring in revenue\u2014representing a vulnerability if any of the as-yet-unprofitable startups CoreWeave sells computing services to are unable to meet their contractual obligations, or if construction delays mean CoreWeave is not able to provide capacity on time, allowing customers to cancel contracts.     In a sense, Coreweave is a metaphor for the broader AI industry at the present moment, as top companies commit to enormous capex spending today in the confidence that it\u2019ll be justified by future revenue from AI platforms and services. Investors appear to be broadly convinced by the company\u2019s narrative: CoreWeave\u2019s stock price is up 160% since the company\u2019s IPO in March.\u00a0   But Fortune\u2019s analysis of CoreWeave\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are laced with warnings and caveats, show how risky the company\u2019s business model could be. In interviews with several analysts, bulls and bears agreed that CoreWeave\u2019s fundamentals, as reflected in its filings, don\u2019t currently add up. \u201cA lot has to go right,\u201d says Thomas Blakely, a managing director of software equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, who rates CoreWeave \u201coverweight.\u201d (Of 26 equity analysts who currently cover the stock, 14 had the equivalent of buy or outperform ratings on the shares, while nine had \u201chold\u201d ratings, and three had \u201cunderperform\u201d or \u201csell\u201d recommendations, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence.)     The bears see CoreWeave as a strong candidate to find itself underwater with its mounting liabilities, making it potentially the first domino to fall in the AI ecosystem. \u201cTo say they\u2019ll scale out of this is questionable,\u201d says Gil Luria, the head of technology research at the investment firm D.A. Davidson. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it becomes more profitable.\u201d He believes that the likeliest outcome for CoreWeave on a five-year time horizon is bankruptcy\u2014either because its current customers will be able to rely on their own infrastructure by then, or because an increasingly stretched CoreWeave will no longer be able to borrow.     In a statement to Fortune, a company spokesperson said that \u201cCoreWeave\u2019s capital structure and financial performance are strong and underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts signed with the world\u2019s leading enterprises and AI labs who partner with CoreWeave because we deliver the best AI cloud.\u201d The statement went on to say that the company structured its contracts to \u201csupport and repay any related debt obligations while generating additional free cash flow. CoreWeave operates in a supply-constrained market where demand far exceeds capacity, and our hyper-growth is evidence of the trust leading companies place in us to power their most critical AI workloads.\u201d     With the company continuing to make huge new spending commitments even as it books new future revenue, AI investors\u2019 attention will be glued to its upcoming quarterly earnings report. One number that everyone will be watching is CoreWeave\u2019s \u201cremaining performance obligations,\u201d or RPOs\u2014essentially revenues that CoreWeave has booked but that have not yet been paid. (Like its scheduled lease payments, CoreWeave\u2019s RPOs are excluded from its balance sheet.)     If CoreWeave is booking the kinds of contracts that will pull it out of debt sooner rather than later, the RPOs level\u2014and the forecast for how quickly those future bookings are likely to turn into actual cash\u2014are where they would show up. The company has announced several major new deals since its last quarterly earnings announcement, including a $14.2 billion agreement to supply Meta with computing capacity, and an pact with AI startup Poolside for a data center stuffed with 40,000 Nvidia GPUs. So it is likely its RPO total will climb significantly. Wall Street analysts\u2019 forecasts for the company\u2019s 2026 revenue range from $10.9 billion to $14.9 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Bulls argue that this is exactly how the boom will play out in CoreWeave\u2019s favor: The revenue will come through, in great quantity, and its scale will solve the company\u2019s problems by catching up with and then outpacing its capital expenditures. In that scenario, the company becomes the next Levi Strauss or Amazon Web Services, providing the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d of the AI boom, and getting filthy rich. \u201cThe potential is beyond the scope of our imagination at this point,\u201d says Kevin Dede, a senior technology analyst at the financial services firm H.C. Wainwright, which rates CoreWeave a \u201cbuy.\u201d\u00a0   But for now CoreWeave is miles away from being profitable and is bleeding cash, absent its ability to issue debt. The RPOs it reported in its most recent earnings that are likely to be realized in the next 12 months are not, on their own, sufficient to cover its current obligations and announced growth plans (more on that shortly). The company has razor-thin operating margins\u20141.6% in the past quarter. After accounting for its large interest expenses, those margins turn sharply negative. The company lost more than $600 million on $2.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025. \u201cThat\u2019s not great,\u201d Luria says. \u201cIs there any way that gap closes?\u201dBarring an enormous surge in revenue over the next 12 months or so, the company will likely need to borrow more money, or renegotiate with creditors, in order to cover the obligations already on its books. To be sure, the AI boom could deliver that revenue surge\u2014but even slight weakening in spending growth across the industry could hit CoreWeave disproportionately. Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm that is shorting the stock, is pithy in its conclusions: CoreWeave, it wrote in a September report, is\u00a0 \u201cthe poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.\u201d     CoreWeave began as a crypto-mining company, a side project of a few friends who were hedge-fund traders. Crypto mining, like AI, relies heavily on graphic processing units, or GPUs, with the chips racing to solve complicated algorithms that spit out currency rewards for correctly verifying blockchain transactions, and CoreWeave was a steady buyer.\u00a0     Over time, Brian Venturo, one of the company\u2019s founders, realized that the rise in AI would be a major factor fueling the surge in demand for the computing power of the GPUs that CoreWeave was already accumulating. Beginning in October 2021, CoreWeave entered into two deals with asset management firm Magnetar Capital, raising first $50 million in convertible notes, and then a year later, an additional $125 million, also in convertible notes. The company used nearly all of it to buy GPUs from Nvidia. Over the next few years, CoreWeave would secure billions of dollars in a combination of debt and equity, building out a sprawling array of data centers across the U.S., and eventually expanding to the U.K.     This March, CoreWeave\u2019s IPO made it one of the closest things to a pure-play AI company to debut on public markets. Initially, fears about the company\u2019s debt load restrained its stock\u2019s performance. But its shares took off in May after it reported its first quarterly earnings, including soaring revenue growth of 420% quarter-on-quarter. While the price has declined since a peak in June, CoreWeave shares closed on Friday at $104, up from a debut of $40.\u00a0\u00a0     But as Luria puts it, the bear case for CoreWeave is simple math. The company\u2019s business model is to borrow capital and then use that capital to build data centers filled with GPUs and then sell time on those GPUs to AI companies. \u201cThe question is, are they getting a sufficient return \u2026 on their investment to justify the interest they\u2019re paying on their debt?\u201d Luria says.\u00a0   Its most recent filings show how hefty that debt has become. The problem isn\u2019t just the amount of CoreWeave\u2019s debt. It\u2019s the structure\u2014most of it is more expensive than average for corporate debt, and much of it comes due in the next nine months. Of CoreWeave\u2019s current liabilities, $3.6 billion is debt payable by June 30, 2026, just part of $11 billion in overall debt the company carries on its balance sheet. Much of that debt carries hefty interest rates of between 9% and 15%, according to the financial statements, with 11% being the weighted average rate overall. (This fall, rates on newly issued investment-grade corporate debt have hovered between 5.5% and 6%, according to Moody\u2019s. The rate at which CoreWeave is able to borrow has come down over time, with most of its newer debt issued at closer to 9%. )     The majority of CoreWeave\u2019s outstanding debt, its statements show, is in the form of two loans, called Delayed Draw Term Loan (DDTL)1.0 and DDTL 2.0. There is $1.8 billion outstanding on the DDTL 1.0, at a 15% interest rate, and $5 billion in DDTL 2.0, at an 11% interest rate. The company has begun payment on DDTL 1.0; quarterly principal payments on DDTL 2.0 are due beginning in January 2026. (The interest rates on both these loans are floating.)     This is where the company\u2019s RPOs come in. CoreWeave says that as of June 30 it had a little over $30 billion, the majority of which should turn into actual sales over the next four years. The company says 50% of that amount, or $15 billion, will be recognized in the next two years. Assuming half of that will in turn be recognized in the next year, that means the company should have $7.5 billion coming in. But if its operating margins remain at just 1.6%, the company will only generate $120 million in income from this $7.5 billion\u2014not enough to cover its interest expenses or make the principal repayments on its debt.\u00a0 That implies that CoreWeave\u2019s returns remain far below the cost of its capital.      Higher RPOs, of course, would mean more revenue for CoreWeave next year. That said, there are also far more capital expenses to come. CoreWeave continues to spend heavily to purchase Nvidia GPUs\u2014which make up the great majority of its capital expenditures\u2014and other equipment to outfit its data centers. In the first half of 2025, for example, it invested $4.7 billion in property, plant and equipment while bringing in only $2.2 billion in revenue. The report from Kerrisdale cites similar concerns as Luria in justifying its short position. CoreWeave is \u201ca debt-fueled GPU rental business with no moat, dressed up as innovation,\u201d the firm writes, arguing that the stock faces a 90% downside.\u00a0     Luria and Kerrisdale both cite CoreWeave\u2019s highly concentrated customer base as another potential peril\u2014a reality that CoreWeave itself acknowledged in its last earnings report. \u201cA substantial portion of our revenue is driven by a limited number of our customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would adversely affect our business,\u201d the company wrote. Most notably: In the second quarter of 2025, an eye-popping 71% of CoreWeave\u2019s revenue came from Microsoft alone.\u00a0   To be sure, Microsoft has a better credit rating than many countries, including the United States, and is unlikely to renege on its contract with CoreWeave. And CoreWeave\u2019s contracts with its lessees generally require them to pay to the ends of their leases even if they don\u2019t wind up utilizing them, except in case of \u201cnonperformance.\u201d\u00a0     Much of CoreWeave\u2019s utility has come from offering readily available compute as those companies raced to scale up their own operations. But with Microsoft set to spend tens of billions of dollars on developing its own data centers, it may not need CoreWeave\u2019s services in the future. \u201cThey will pay their obligations, but the likelihood of them renewing at the end of the contract is much less guaranteed,\u201d Luria says.\u00a0     CoreWeave\u2019s other major customer, OpenAI, is another matter. In March, CoreWeave entered an agreement with Sam Altman\u2019s AI giant, with OpenAI committed to paying $11.9 billion through October 2030, with a $4 billion expansion announced in May. But OpenAI itself has made commitments far beyond its current cash flow\u2014including commitments in the many hundreds of billions to Oracle, Nvidia and other data center providers.\u00a0     If OpenAI runs into any financial troubles, Luria says, CoreWeave likely wouldn\u2019t be first to receive payments, compared to much larger OpenAI partners like Microsoft, Amazon, or even Oracle. (That\u2019s also the case for some of the other, smaller venture-backed and loss-making AI startups CoreWeave serves, such as poolside, Cohere, and Mistral.) To rely on CoreWeave\u2019s ties to OpenAI, he says, \u201cYou have to believe that OpenAI is going to be unbelievably successful, so much so that it can pay everybody that\u2019s ahead in line.\u201d     All of this means there\u2019ll be plenty at stake when CoreWeave reports earnings on Monday. The company will also be digesting a recent setback: In late October, the shareholders of Core Scientific, a crypto miner with a hoard of computing resources that CoreWeave coveted, rejected CoreWeave\u2019s $9 billion all-stock acquisition offer. (CoreWeave will console itself with a $270 million breakup fee\u2014an amount that will help it cover the $360 million it is expected to pay Core Scientific to lease data center capacity from it next year. Overall, CoreWeave is on the hook to pay Core Scientific some $10 billion in future lease payments over the next 12 years, which may have been one reason CoreWeave was eager to try to use its highly-valued shares to purchase Core Scientific in an all-equity deal valued at $9 billion when the offer was initially made.)\u00a0   The argument for CoreWeave\u2019s success is just as simple as the math against it: AI is going to represent a transformational shift in the global economy, and CoreWeave is powering the technology\u2019s growth. As the development of AI accelerates, so will the demand for computing power from companies aside from the hyperscalers, all hungry for the services of providers like CoreWeave. What\u2019s more, today\u2019s creditors may be willing to wait a little longer for that demand to materialize: The lenders behind DDTL 2.0 recently renegotiated the terms of the loan to delay the start of principal payments.     Blakely, at Cantor Fitzgerald, says that CoreWeave is already diversifying its customer base, noting the recent deal with Meta.  \u201cIt\u2019s a growth business,\u201d he says, in reference to CoreWeave\u2019s capital expenditures. \u201cIf business is growing, you have to invest against it.\u201d He and other bulls see a future where the company is no longer laden with debt.\u00a0Once CoreWeave sheds its liabilities over the next five years, Blakely says, a growing percent of its revenue can begin coming from infrastructure that\u2019s already paid off, boosting CoreWeave\u2019s margins. Moreover, Blakely says that new models of chips might run more efficiently or be able to fetch a higher premium from customers, allowing CoreWeave to hold more pricing power.     Blakely says that those $30.1 billion in RPOs\u2014the revenue that has been booked but not yet delivered\u2014are likely to increase meaningfully in CoreWeave\u2019s next earnings, based on recently announced agreements. But the number to watch might be the additional obligations in borrowing that the company will take on to service them: If those obligations scale up alongside the booked revenue, bears say, CoreWeave still risks running out of cash unless it takes on yet more debt, raises more equity, or gets existing creditors to extend terms.\u00a0     Blakely acknowledges that a sustainable path forward for CoreWeave is perilous. \u201cA lot has to go right,\u201d he says. Still, he compares the current moment in AI to the beginning of the smartphone era, where analysts doubted Apple\u2019s claims that it would transform global communication. \u201cCoreWeave is a leader there in terms of this market,\u201d Blakely says. \u201cIf they can maintain that lead \u2026 they will be able to participate in the spoils.\u201d\u00a0     CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Coreweave\u2019s quarterly principal payments for DDTL 1.0 would begin in January 2026; those payments have already begun.   This article was updated to add a range of analysts\u2019 projections for CoreWeave\u2019s 2026 revenue.  \u00a9 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"The Nubia Z80 Ultra, developed by ZTE, has officially reached the global market after its earlier debut in China. The smartphone maintains nearly all the specifications of the Chinese version, bringing high-end performance, a focus on photography, and a distinctive design to users worldwide. It is launching across several European markets in three colors\u2014black, white, and \u201cStarry Night\u201d blue, inspired by Van Gogh\u2019s artwork. At its core, the Nubia Z80 Ultra features the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, one of Qualcomm\u2019s most advanced chips, paired with up to 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of internal storage. These specifications aim to deliver strong performance for demanding applications, multitasking, and gaming. Powering the device is a 7,200 mAh silicon-carbon battery that supports 80W fast charging, both wired and wireless. The Chinese variant offered 90W wired charging, meaning the global version has slightly reduced power delivery, but still offers exceptional charging speeds for its large battery capacity. The phone\u2019s display continues to be one of its main highlights. It sports a 6.85-inch AMOLED panel with 2K resolution, a 144 Hz refresh rate, and up to 2,000 nits of peak brightness. Notably, the screen has no visible camera cutouts\u2014the 16 MP front camera is placed under the display, preserving a full-screen experience.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"ByAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week\u2019s edition of The Prototype, we look at Jared Issacman\u2019s re-nomination as NASA Administrator, a biotech company revolutionizing the collagen market, patching up a broken heart and more. To get The Prototype in your inbox, sign up here. A lot\u2019s happened this week, so you may have missed that President Trump nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman as NASA administrator. And if that sentence is giving you d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no glitch in the Matrix. The president tapped Isaacman for the job back in December. One of the administration\u2019s least controversial picks, Isaacman cleared a key Senate committee on a bipartisan vote in May and was supported by astronauts and industry leaders alike. But Trump withdrew the nomination that same month, just before an expected confirmation vote. It\u2019s not clear why the administration changed its mind, but if Isaacman is confirmed by the Senate this time around, big changes may be afoot for NASA. This week, several outlets reported that a 62-page memo titled \u201cProject Athena\u201d was floating around D.C., outlining plans to reform NASA. Isaacman confirmed the document was his in a long social media post, in which he also summarized his thoughts on reforming the space agency. Those reforms include reorganizing NASA to a more decentralized, nimble organization with more empowerment on decision making. Isaacman also emphasized launching more crewed missions and committed to the Artemis program, which aims to establish a permanent presence on the Moon. He also wants the agency to collaborate more with commercial space companies and to expand planetary science with more missions that are individually less expensive compared to multi-billion dollar projects. This plan, Isaacman continued, \u201cwas written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success. The more I see the imperfections of politics and the lengths people will go, the more I want to serve and be part of the solution.\u201d Collagen\u2014a protein used for medical applications, cosmetics and protein powder\u2014is a fast-growing market of over $10 billion, and is expected to double by the end of the decade. The U.S. market accounted for around $2.5 billion last year, according to Grand View Research\u2014about 80% of which is imported. Which is ironic, because it\u2019s sourced from cattle hides that often come from the United States in the first place. Kansas City-based Nortian Biotech is looking to change that. It recently secured a $41 million investment round to build its manufacturing operations in the Midwest, valuing the company at $100 million. But the company isn\u2019t just re-inventing the wheel. Conventionally, collagen is extracted from animal hides by treating them with an acid or base solution to remove excess hair and other tissues, then simmering them in hot water for hours. This produces gelatin, a degraded form of collagen that requires additional steps to filter and purify before it can be used. Nortian, by contrast, has its own proprietary process that uses enzymes to extract collagen directly from the hides, without turning it into gelatin first. The result, CEO Andre Albuquerque told me when I visited their headquarters a few weeks ago, is a purer product that\u2019s cheaper to produce. Albuquerque cofounded Nortian with Gabriel Prats and Diego Rolim in 2024. All three are originally from Brazil, where Albuquerque founded a company that first developed the enzymatic process. They decided to build the business directly in the United States because of the size of the market and its demand for higher-quality collagen. The three have bigger plans beyond collagen production, however. Once that part of the business is up and running, they plan to produce other valuable ingredients from animal waste. \u201cThe goal is to have a full recycling company using biotechnology to develop the best ingredients for food supplements and the pharmaceutical sector,\u201d Albuquerque told me. A stem cell-powered \u201cpatch\u201d might one day be able to repair damaged hearts\u2014without open-heart surgery\u2014researchers at the Mayo Clinic reported in a new study. The team used heart tissue that had been grown from reprogrammed stem cells, which can be delivered with a small incision. The technique worked in the lab and is now moving on to larger-scale tests before it\u2019s attempted with humans. If successful, this technique might make it possible to treat patients who would otherwise require implants or even transplants, the researchers said. In my other newsletter, InnovationRx, Amy Feldman and I looked at Pfizer and Novo Nordisk\u2019s multi-billion dollar battle over Metsera, the departure of FDA\u2019s top drug regulator, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s $40 billion Kenvue deal and more. Blue Origin will launch its New Glenn rocket for the second time in a few days, sending NASA\u2019s Escapade spacecraft to Mars along a never-before used route in order to study the Red Planet\u2019s magnetic field. MIT researchers have developed microscopic, wireless implants that can be injected into the bloodstream and then find their way to the right part of the brain to provide electrical stimulation to treat diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. Spanish company Qilimanjaro Quantum Tech opened up a new data center that will host up to 10 quantum computers with different architectures, enabling the company to support thousands of users. The last few years have seen unprecedented numbers of book bans in American schools, according to PEN America. That could impact student performance, according to a new paper from Danielle Dennis, dean of the University of Rhode Island Feinstein College of Education. That\u2019s because one of the best predictors of educational performance is how much kids read. But book bans set off a chain reaction that reduces reading volume\u2014not only is there reduced access to certain materials, but a climate of censorship also leads to librarians being less likely to recommend books and teachers being less likely to promote discussions of books. All of these factors impact how much kids read\u2014and therefore, how well they do at school. I\u2019ve been enjoying the show High Potential, currently on ABC and streaming on Hulu. The series follows Morgan Gillory, whose high intelligence makes her gifted in a lot of ways, but causes her to struggle to hold down a job. She\u2019s a single mom working as a cleaning woman when she inadvertently finds herself a consultant for the local police, as her intuition and obsession with solving puzzles makes her a natural crime solver. It\u2019s a fun, breezy procedural in the vein of the old USA shows like Psych and Monk. Kaitlin Olson is terrific in the lead role, supported by great character actors like Daniel Sunjata and Judy Reyes.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Two exciting drives to spearhead Samsung's SSD army into CES 2026  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  As the year draws to a close, anticipation for CES 2026 grows. Samsung has provided a preliminary preview of its forthcoming Detachable AutoSSD (AM9C1 E1.A) and PM9E1 M.2 22x42, a 2242 variant of the OEM drive designed to rival the best SSDs in the market. The radical new modular SSD design has a swappable NAND and SSD controller that can be detached independently. The company also showed off its new tiny 4TB PCIe 5.0 SSD. Samsung introduced the original AM9C1 automotive SSD last year, a BGA drive that incorporates the company's proprietary 5nm PCIe 4.0 controller and 8th-generation V-NAND flash. The latest E1.A version of the AM9C1 maintains these components but now features a modular design. Consequently, Samsung markets the AM9C1 E1.A under the new Detachable AutoSSD series. The modular configuration separates the SSD controller from the NAND into two distinct modules, thereby facilitating upgrades and replacements. Samsung asserts that the new E1.A form factor also extends the product's operational lifespan by enhancing heat dissipation. The original AM9C1 was available with capacities ranging from 128GB to 2TB, with sequential read speeds up to 4,700 MB\/s and sequential write speeds up to 1,400 MB\/s. It's modular AM9C1 E1.A form factor provides extensive versatility, allowing automotive manufacturers or owners to replace the PCIe 4.0 controller with a faster PCIe 5.0 alternative in the future or to increase storage capacity with higher-capacity NAND components. The AM9C1 E1.A caters to autonomous vehicles. However, it is reasonable to envisage a similar implementation within the consumer SSD market. Samsung can easily port this design to the mainstream market; however, the associated costs are likely to be substantial, as is typical for cutting-edge technology. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is essentially an iteration of the original PM9E1, rendered in a more compact form factor. The initial model is a M.2 2280, whereas this new variant, as indicated by its designation, is presented in an M.2 2242 package. Although not a prevalent form factor, it is commonly utilized in ultra-thin laptops, tablets, or mini-PCs. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is marginally too long for the Steam Deck, as the device employs M.2 2230 drives. Nonetheless, modifications exist to accommodate larger drives within Valve's gaming handheld; however, such alterations are not generally advisable. The PM9E1 is a PCIe 5.0 drive featuring Samsung's 5nm Presto SSD controller and V8 TLC V-NAND. It essentially serves as the OEM variant of the Samsung 9100 Pro, tailored for the consumer market. The M.2 2242 segment is not very crowded; however, the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 will compete against Corsair's recently announced MP700 Micro. Similar to its competitor, the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 supports capacities of up to 4TB. This makes these M.2 2242 drives particularly appealing to Steam Deck users, as the increased surface area permits higher capacities, whereas M.2 2230 SSDs are limited to a maximum of 2TB. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 provides sequential read and write speeds of up to 14.8 GB\/s and 13.4 GB\/s, respectively. Consequently, it offers significantly higher performance compared to the MP700 Micro. The PM9E1 M.2 22x42 demonstrates a 48% increase in sequential read speeds and a 58% increase in sequential write speeds. Although the PM9E1 M.2 22x42 is classified as an OEM drive, Samsung's OEM products occasionally enter the grey market and are available at more competitive prices; however, this often entails the absence of the standard warranty typically associated with consumer products.

Samsung will likely disclose additional details regarding the AM9C1 E1.A and PM9E1 M.2 22x42 at the CES 2026, which is scheduled to take place from January 6 to 9 at the usual venue in Las Vegas.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":" \t\t\tBy Jake Kanter, Max Goldbart   \tUncertainty over ITV\u2018s future has been one of the dominant themes of 2025. Famed for launching Downton Abbey, the network has been courting sale interest for well over a year, but for all the industry chatter and press speculation, ITV\u2019s silence has been stony. That all changed on Friday, when the UK broadcaster dropped a bombshell worthy of Love Island: a buyer has entered the villa.  \tIn a 70-word statement, ITV told shareholders that Comcast-owned Sky has made a \u00a31.6B ($2.1B) bid for its media and entertainment division, which houses its TV networks and streaming service. If a deal is completed \u2014 and it remains an if \u2014 then ITV will be split in two, with shareholders retaining control of ITV Studios, the production and distribution unit behind shows including Fool Me Once and The Voice.  \t           \tDeadline hears that Sky has been laying the groundwork for this moment for some time. Sky, which is very much leading on the deal with its parent Comcast in the background, has been quietly talking to ITV leaders about the shape of the takeover and why it makes sense for both parties. Work has also been undertaken to examine whether regulatory hurdles can be cleared. A formal deal remains weeks, if not months away, but a source familiar with the talks said there is \u201cgoodwill and momentum.\u201d      \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tITV\u2019s much-discussed and notoriously sticky share price (chair Andrew Coslett was heckled over it at ITV\u2019s latest AGM) jumped more than 10% after the bid was announced, but Sky\u2019s move has left some in the industry scratching their heads.   \tThe pay-TV operator is one of the British media\u2019s great success stories, forged when Rupert Murdoch was at his swashbuckling best. But in recent years, the company has been managing decline and has at times felt like an unloved child in the Comcast empire. On a recent earnings call, Comcast chiefs, including Brian L. Roberts, did not mention Sky once \u2014 usually because it raises awkward questions about the hefty $39B Comcast paid for Sky in 2018. On the Sky side, there is a view among some at its West London HQ that Comcast has mismanaged its asset. Sky, which has made mass layoffs over the past year but did return to profit, has had its value written down by \u00a31.2B, (nearly a quarter) since it was acquired.  \t           \tSo why is Comcast backing Sky\u2019s pursuit of another contracting business? Or, as one observer dryly put it: \u201cWhy would you want to take the bad part of ITV away from the really good part?\u201d  A Scale Play  \tThose close to the deal will tell you that Sky sees ITV as complementary, bringing together the UK\u2019s biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster with the top pay-TV platform. There is a belief that this will present a compelling offer for advertisers and help unlock new subscribers for Sky. For both parties, bigger is seen as better in a world in which they are competing for viewers, and therefore revenue, with global giants like YouTube and TikTok. This, of course, mirrors what is happening in the U.S., with buyers circling Warner Bros. Discovery as the ink dries on the Paramount-Skydance merger. \u201cThe way the market is looking, a deal like this does make sense,\u201d said a Sky insider.  \tIndustry execs noted that Sky has been mulling a free-to-air acquisition in the UK for some time, given that the pay-TV network took a serious look at Channel 4. Ultimately, the British government abandoned plans to sell Channel 4 in January 2023.  \tA former Sky executive said the company is constantly exploring ways to bolster its declining and aging customer base, meaning it could view ITV, and its streaming service ITVX, as another shop window for its content, not least sport. Sky remains the biggest home for Premier League football in the UK. \u201cNot everyone who watches ITV watches Sky, but everyone who watches Sky watches ITV,\u201d said an industry observer.  \tThe former Sky executive pointed to its heavily marketed Essential TV deal \u2014 which bundles Sky Atlantic (home to House of the Dragon) with an ad-tier Netflix plan for \u00a315 \u2014 as evidence of the company\u2019s efforts to reach new subscribers. They said this sort of offer would have been unthinkable, even five years ago.\u00a0\u201cSky is like a massive cruise liner with a small hole. It will sink eventually, but maybe ITV plugs this gap a little longer,\u201d the source said.   \tWhile there is crossover between the ITV audience and Sky subscribers, Tom Harrington, Head of Television at Enders Analysis, said the broader audience will be a much better sell to advertisers. \u201cYou\u2019d be enormous in a shrinking market,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you have a declining business in many ways and combine it with another [declining] business then suddenly you look a lot bigger. That is better, even if putting them together won\u2019t really arrest what they are facing.\u201d  \tAnother well-placed former Sky insider agreed the deal makes sense if Comcast wants to run Sky and ITV for cash, essentially juicing what remains of declining but still lucrative ad businesses. This person, along with numerous other sources, said there would be significant cost-cutting that could be achieved in slamming the businesses together (broadcasting union Bectu quickly voiced alarm that the deal would have \u201chuge implications\u201d for ITV staff). But ultimately, the former Sky insider came back to an analogy often whispered among bankers who are merging weakening businesses: \u201cTwo drunks propping each other up at the bar.\u201d  An Ad Monopoly?  \tOther questions linger. There is no guarantee a Sky takeover of ITV would be cleared by regulators. The deal would need to be approved by Ofcom and the Competition Markets Authority. There is confidence this can be achieved, and the UK government has signaled in recent months that it wants to make it easier for broadcasters to come together.   \t           \tNevertheless, Sky and ITV are estimated to cover around 70% of the advertising market, meaning that any deal would certainly raise eyebrows from commercial competitors, not least Paramount-owned 5. \u201cThat would be the biggest hurdle,\u201d noted a Sky insider, who said the deal would be the first big test of whether the government will greenlight consolidation.  \tEx-ITV chair Peter Bazalgette, an industry doyen, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today show that regulators should be flexible, given that ITV is now taking on the likes of Google and Meta in the video advertising space, not just its more immediate rivals like Channel 4. Bazalgette\u2019s argument mirrors the one that ITV has begun making to UK lawmakers and regulators.  \tThere is also the question of the duo\u2019s overlapping news businesses. Both are widely respected, but Sky News has been loss-making for years and its current funding guarantee from Comcast \u2014 one of the stipulations of the 2018 deal \u2014 expires in 2028. A person close to Sky News suggested that the service could end up producing ITV News, which would get Comcast out of a \u201creally difficult decision in 2028,\u201d but would be bad news for current supplier ITN.  \tBreaking ITV apart would also lead to questions over the deep ties between its network business and studios arm. \u201cThey are so inextricably linked,\u201d said the market observer. \u201cBut the terms with which they relate to each other would, of course, become less advantageous and beneficial. So you\u2019re buying something that wouldn\u2019t be as good as it is now.\u201d  \tThe assumption from some of our sources is that ITV CEO Carolyn McCall will seek a buyer for the studios business soon after the sale of networks. Banijay and RedBird IMI have held talks, but interest has cooled in recent months. ITV insiders value it at \u00a33.5B, and there is little doubt that it is an attractive asset in a consolidating market.  \tITV, a grand old institution of British broadcasting, recently celebrated its 70th birthday. The company knows better than most that it must adapt to survive. Executives will hope that their courtship with Sky can turn into an enduring union, even if the takeover bid has left some perplexed.  \tSky, ITV, and Comcast declined to comment.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Go to: Apple: a horde of lawyers. The FSFE: ONE lawyer. We still landed a knockout! Support us today to keep standing up to Apple and defending our user rights! News The EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act is supposed to shake up the power of tech giants by giving developers and users more choice. Apple\u2019s \u201cnotarisation\u201d of mobile apps contradicts these objectives. A civil-society complaint against Apple\u2019s monopolistic control over app distribution aims to change that. The EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims for a structural reset of power in digital markets, a shift from corporate control toward device neutrality, where users decide what runs on their devices. For Free Software, this legislation can be a unique opportunity by finally opening closed ecosystems - like iOS - to Free Software alternatives. Apple has reacted aggressively against the DMA, litigating against regulators, and unfairly excluding Free Software from iOS and iPadOS by blocking the unfettered installation of software (sideloading), prohibiting alternative app stores, and hindering interoperability. The FSFE has recently contributed to a complaint initiated by civil-society organisations targeting Apple\u2019s non-compliance with the DMA, urging the European Commission to enforce the DMA\u2019s rules related to interoperability and the app store, giving users and developers effective choice over which apps and app stores they want to use on their devices. This complaint is important for software freedom, contextualising the diverse approaches towards curation of software distribution. Imagine that you are a Free Software developer willing to make your program available in the iPhone. You want to have your software curated in a non-profit Free Software-friendly app store (like F-Droid for Android). This is important for you because you prefer to not have Apple controlling what your software does and to whom it should be made available.  This all sounds good, until you realise that your plan is not possible in iOS. There is no non-profit Free Software app store available for iPhones and iPads. Apple blocks non-profit app stores with extremely high financial requirements and prohibits unfettered installation of software. Even for the Free Software commercial ones, such as the Alt Store, Apple still applies a complete review and control, through an encryption layer over distributed source code. On October 22, ARTICLE 19 and Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Freiheitsrechte (GFF) filed a complaint against Apple for non-compliance with the DMA to tackle these issues. The complaint highlights the following conduct as illegal under the DMA: The core of the complaint is twofold: Apple\u2019s complete review of apps \u2013 known as \u201cnotarisation\u201d process - a mandatory step for distributing any software on its platforms, represents the very gatekeeping behaviour the DMA was written to prevent.   Notarisation forces all apps, even those distributed outside Apple\u2019s App Store, to be submitted to Apple\u2019s servers for scanning, approval, and cryptographic re-signing before installation. The result is that Apple retains full control over what software users can install and how developers can distribute it. This transforms Apple\u2019s self-appointed \u201csecurity review\u201d into a choke-point of power, locking in developers and users into the company\u2019s proprietary ecosystem. Apple\u2019s requirements for third-party app stores. Apple has conditioned the provision of a third-party app store as a native app in its iOS and iPadOS on (1) providing a standby letter of credit in the amount of \u20ac1,000,000 from a financial institution that is at least A-rated; or (2) being a member of good standing in the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and have an app that had more than 1,000,000 first annual installs on iOS and iPadOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.  Both requirements are extremely unfair and disproportionately affects non-profit Free Software projects, SMEs, startups, and individual developers. This discriminates by size and renders the market inaccessible to smaller new entrants. For Free Software developers, the implications are even more severe. Apple\u2019s notarisation regime requires developers to hold a paid Apple Developer account, accept restrictive legal terms, and submit binaries to a closed, opaque process. Once approved, the binaries are re-signed by Apple and distributed under digital restriction management (DRM).  This breaks users\u2019 rights when it comes to Free Software freedoms. Users can no longer verify that the source code they read corresponds to the binary they run, nor can they freely redistribute software that Apple refuses to notarise. What makes this process absurd is that Apple applies this notarisation process to all apps running on iOS, no matter which channel of distribution. This means that a developer of an alternative app store for iOS has actually no control over the apps they can distribute in their store, as Apple still holds gatekeeping power through notarisation. Under the DMA, gatekeepers must enable the installation of third-party app stores and refrain from imposing unnecessary technical restrictions. Yet Apple\u2019s notarisation enforces the very dependency the DMA prohibits: it reasserts Apple\u2019s role as the mandatory intermediary for every app on its platforms. This undermines competition, discourages independent developers, and excludes non-commercial, community-run projects that cannot afford to submit to Apple\u2019s terms or refuse to submit to them. Allowing this practice to persist would water down the DMA\u2019s promise before it is even tested. Apple\u2019s requirements for enabling third-party app stores are very hard to meet. They have effectively prevented non-profit Free Software app stores from working in iOS and iPadOS. The provision of a 1 million euro standby letter of credit or 1 million downloads within a year in the EU overburdens not only non-profits, but also individual developers, startups, and SMEs. When these conditions are put into context, such requirements do not reflect industry standards and expectations. They derive from Apple\u2019s monopolistic behaviour with respect to mobile devices. Such impositions do not exist in Apple\u2019s laptops and desktop computers, where unfettered installation (sideloading) is a reality. The complaint concludes that both requirements go beyond the limits of what is necessary under the DMA. Apple ignores less restrictive alternatives (e.g. insurance and escrow frameworks), and provides no justification for doing so. The complaint surges the European Commission to impose fines and to find an alternative to Apple\u2019s control over software distribution, including non-profit stakeholders in the process. The alternative to Apple\u2019s notarisation already exists, and it works. Decentralised curation, as practised by repositories like F-Droid, shows that security and software freedom coexist inherently. Instead of concentrating trust in a single private authority, decentralised systems distribute it: through transparent verification pipelines, reproducible builds, and community audits. Users choose whom to trust, and curators are accountable to the public, not to corporate shareholders. This model embodies the DMA\u2019s vision of interoperability and openness far better than Apple\u2019s notarisation. Such a model aligns with the DMA\u2019s ambitions: interoperability, transparency, and user choice. Decentralised curation can support multiple overlapping trust networks, from individual developers to NGOs, universities, or public institutions, each maintaining their own repository policies. Instead of \u201cmillions of apps\u201d buried in opaque ranking algorithms, users could benefit from clearly defined, community-led collections where the emphasis is on transparency, privacy, and respect for user rights. Security is achieved not through corporate secrecy but through diversity, peer review, and verifiable integrity. If the DMA is to live up to its potential, regulators must treat Apple\u2019s notarisation for what it is: a mechanism of control disguised as a security feature. This civil-society complaint demonstrates that Apple\u2019s understanding of security undermines transparency, competition, and user autonomy - hampering software freedom for everyone. It is not genuine security, it is merely gatekeeping by another name. The European Commission must ensure that compliance with the DMA means genuine openness. The right to install, share, and verify software freely in any device is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of freedom.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Conservative Rodrigo Paz promised \"capitalism for all\" as he took office after nearly 20 years of one-party rule. Bolivia's worst economic crisis in four decades has sparked dollar and fuel shortages. Pro-business centrist\u00a0Rodrigo Paz was sworn in as Bolivia's president on Saturday, marking the end of nearly two decades of leftist rule. The former\u00a0senator with the centrist Christian Democratic\u00a0Party\u00a0won last month's run-off against far-right rival Jorge Quiroga,\u00a0who served as president in 2001-02. Socialist incumbent\u00a0Luis Arce, who ruled from 2020, did not seek reelection due to internal party conflicts and the Andean country's economic crisis. At the inauguration in the country's administrative capital, La Paz,\u00a0the 58-year-old said:\u00a0\"Today, a new era of independence begins, in the service of the\u00a0people. This is the new Bolivia, opening itself to the\u00a0world.\" Referring to the country's economic crisis, widely blamed on\u00a0the socialist government, Paz told Bolivians:\u00a0\"The country we inherited is devastated,\u00a0morally and materially\u00a0indebted, with endless lines for fuel and empty markets.\" \"Bolivia is rejoining the world, never\u00a0again isolated. Never again will the country be held hostage by an\u00a0ideology; ideology doesn't put food on the table,\" he said in his swearing-in speech. Paz promised a policy of \"capitalism for all,\" before detailing plans to move gradually to market-oriented economy, which will require thawed ties with the United States and other trading partners, as well as cuts to government subsidies. He also alluded to the need to build political alliances domestically as\u00a0his Christian Democratic Party controls only 39% of the 166\u00a0seats of the Legislative Assembly. \"We haven't been handed a throne, but a task,\" Paz said. \"This is the\u00a0time for true democracy and respect for the law; no one is above the\u00a0law. We will overcome that disgraceful and shameful past.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Bolivia is\u00a0one of South America's poorest nations. After two decades of rule by\u00a0the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party, founded by former President Evo Morales, the country is mired in economic crisis.\u00a0 Morales, who was head of state from 2006 to 2019, steered Bolivia sharply to the left, nationalizing energy resources. While he oversaw a thriving economy\u00a0during the early 2000s commodities boom,\u00a0plummeting natural gas exports and state-led policies, reliant on generous\u00a0subsidies and a fixed exchange rate, have led to collapse. The country faces acute US\u00a0dollar shortages\u00a0after the previous government exhausted almost all of Bolivia's hard currency reserves to prop up the\u00a0fuel assistance. Along with high inflation, chronic fuel shortages have made long queues at gas stations a way of life. Paz has said the\u00a0free-market reforms would happen\u00a0at a measured pace. He rejected rival Quiroga's calls for a\u00a0bailout from the International Monetary Fund and aggressive fiscal shock therapy. With the world's largest reserves of lithium, a key component in batteries and electric vehicles, Bolivia has struggled to exploit the resource. But Paz's government is expected to open the sector to foreign investment. Under Morales, Bolivia cut ties with Washington and moved closer to China, Russia, Cuba\u00a0and Venezuela. Paz has vowed to restore ties with the US. Edited by:\u00a0Saim Du\u0161an Inayatullah","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-08","content":" A ridiculous premise makes a great story. Swedish engineer and musician Mattias Krantz got a wild hair and decided he was going to teach an octopus how to play the piano. He went to the seafood market and selected a likely student. He named the octopus Takoyaki, which is a snack made of fried octopus, or Tako for short. Krantz set up an aquarium and became friends with Tako, then realized he had no idea what he was doing. How do you teach an octopus to play piano?It was a matter of getting to know the octopus. Then Krantz had to design a piano that harnessed Tako's abilities and interests. He had to remake the piano over and over as he learned what worked and what didn't, in a process that took six months. For a creature with eight arms, Tako is no Rachmaninoff, or even Victor Borge, but he can play his weird custom instrument and seems to enjoy it. The video is 18 minutes long, but you will fall in love with Tako, and Krantz's learning process is rather amusing (with plenty of F-bombs). -via Metafilter\u00a0   Commenting on Neatorama will earn you NeatoPoints!

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Despite its age, Excel continues to evolve with new functions being added over time. There are newer better Excel functions that you should use instead of the old ones. But, there are also some old Excel functions that you don't need to stop using \u2014 because you never used them to begin with. Excel remains a relic, despite all its updates. That\u2019s because Excel never removes functions; every new one is simply added to the existing pile. It makes sense when you consider the compability issues (what if a company still uses a spreadsheet they made twenty years ago?) but it also provides some really interesting snapshots of its history. I went looking, got lost in the maze, and came back with a handful of Excel functions that I'm sure no one uses today. Some of these functions are redundant because they\u2019re outdated, while others still serve very specific, niche purposes. BAHTTEXT converts a number into Thai Baht words. For example, =BAHTTEXT(472.50) returns \u0e2a\u0e35\u0e48\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e40\u0e08\u0e47\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e32\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c, which means four hundred seventy-two Baht and fifty Satang. This function was introduced for Thailand\u2019s accounting and invoicing standards, where monetary values are often written in both numeric and textual form to prevent fraud or misreading. It\u2019s the only language-specific number-to-text function built into Excel, although Thailand is not the only country to write both numeric and textual values in official forms. Oddly, Microsoft didn't add this support for any other country. Obviously, outside Thailand, BAHTTEXT serves little purpose, but it still exists in every version of Excel. You can't change the language output \u2014 it will always produce Thai text. It's literally in the name. ROMAN converts Arabic numerals into Roman numerals. For example, =ROMAN(2025) returns MMXXV. The optional [form] argument (0\u20134) controls the level of abbreviation. A higher value produces more compact forms (for example, 499 as ID instead of CDXCIX). This function dates back to early versions of Excel, when Roman numerals were occasionally used for page numbering, outlines, or formal documents. In modern use, it\u2019s decorative at best. It still works flawlessly but is rarely applied to any real-world data. Most people who rediscover it are either exploring Excel\u2019s function list out of curiosity, or writing their personal manifesto in Excel. ARABIC reverses the work of ROMAN. It converts a Roman numeral string back to a standard number. For instance =ARABIC(\"MMXXV\") returns 2025. It\u2019s one of Excel\u2019s few \u201ccomplementary\u201d functions which directly undoes another. ARABIC was added much later than ROMAN, primarily for data compatibility. If a user inherited legacy spreadsheets using Roman numerals, this function allowed them to bring the data back into numeric form. Today, it\u2019s a curiosity. The only practical reason to use it is to fix a cell that someone (needlessly) converted with ROMAN in the first place. PHONETIC extracts phonetic text (called furigana) from East Asian character data. In Japanese versions of Excel, users can attach pronunciation guides to kanji text using the Phonetic Guide feature. I don't speak (or read) Japanese, but I tried installing the Japanese language pack to try this out. The feature should appear under the Fonts group on the Home tab, but it didn't show up. I tried customizing the Excel ribbon to manually add it and it worked. I did get a Phonetics Guide feature, but clicking it did nothing. I suppose this feature is really locked to the region. Despite this, the PHONETIC function itself (which is useless without the underlying phonetic system) is available in all versions of Excel. INFO returns information about the current Excel environment. The type_text argument must be one of a predefined set of keywords such as: Type Result directory Returns the current working directory numfile Number of worksheets currently open osversion The operating system version string recalc The recalculation mode (automatic or manual) For example, =INFO(\"osversion\") returns Windows (64-bit) NT 10.00 for me. Originally, INFO was useful for Excel macros and automated spreadsheets that needed to adapt based on environment variables. Today, the same data can be accessed more reliably through VBA or Power Query, which makes INFO largely irrelevant for modern workflows. These two functions convert text between double-byte and single-byte character encodings. They exist for legacy East Asian systems that distinguished between half-width (single-byte) and full-width (double-byte) characters. For example, =ASC(\"\uff2d\uff35\uff2f\") returns the single-byte version MUO. Whereas, =DBCS(\"MUO\") returns the double-byte \uff2d\uff35\uff2f. Before Unicode, certain Japanese and Chinese characters required two bytes per symbol, while Western letters used one. When data moved between systems that interpreted text widths differently, these conversions prevented corruption. In the Unicode era, both functions are practically obsolete. They still appear for backward compatibility, especially when opening old CSV files from Japanese financial software or mainframe exports. Given Japan\u2019s rapid economic expansion in the 1990s, Microsoft\u2019s decision to include and preserve these features makes sense. These two are remnants of the financial world\u2019s pre-decimal era. They're also the most interesting to me, because learning their purpose turned into an impromptu history lesson: U.S. bonds and some stock prices were once quoted in fractions rather than decimals (typically in sixteenths or thirty-seconds). For example, a bond price might appear as 101 8\/32. This means $101 and 8\/32 of a dollar, or $101.25 in today's notation. DOLLARDE converts fractional dollar values to decimal form, while DOLLARFR does the reverse. For instance, =DOLLARDE(1.02,16) returns 1.125, and =DOLLARFR(1.125,16) returns 1.02. These conversions allowed analysts to run calculations on legacy data without rewriting pricing systems. Since modern markets use decimals, both functions now survive mostly for historical completeness. They remain accurate but have almost no practical application outside of reconstructing vintage financial records. I had a blast looking these up and writing about them, and I hope you enjoyed the ride too. There's little practical value here \u2014 you will (likely) never use any of these, but that's precisely what makes them fascinating. They survive as fossils in the codebase and made me appreciate Excel's history more.

{"date":"2025-11-08","content":"Yves here. A very large number of Americans are concerned about the direct effects of the now-record Federal shutdown, in the loss of pay and\/or benefits. We are now seeing additional effects, such as the 10% cut in air traffic and resulting cancellation of flights leading some to cancel Thanksgiving travel plans. This post describes another type of harm, that of missing or less than disinterested economic data leading investors to either hold back on action due to higher uncertainty or make poor decisons. Of course, the AI bubble does demonstate that the US has massive capital misallocation. But with the confidence fairy weak despite that, data gaps and doubts will only make a bad situation worse. By Lynn Parramore, Senior Research Analyst at the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Originally published at the Institute for New Ecomomic Thinking website If the 2008 financial crisis proved anything, it\u2019s that economic stability is not a given but a fragile construct \u2013 one that can collapse at warp speed when trust, transparency, and accountability erode. Reality has a way of reminding us if we forget. Which brings us to a glaring red flag waving: as the government shutdown drags on (and on), the flow of official economic data has slowed to a trickle. The Fed is missing timely labor, inflation, and spending numbers. The Treasury Department is flying blind on cash flows and debt issuance. Even the smaller agencies, like the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), are skipping their usual readouts on spending, income, and investment. This is basic stuff that keeps markets steady and policymakers tethered to reality. We are becoming untethered, and it\u2019s not just a bureaucratic problem. For everyday people, it can ripple into mortgage rates, retirement accounts, and everything in between. In the meantime, everyone from Wall Street to Main Street is being nudged toward private-sector data for guidance. And here\u2019s the rub: private players \u2014 often with little oversight \u2014 have every incentive to spin the numbers in their favor. Experts are warning that this mix of missing and delayed public data, plus murky private information, is creating blind spots that could impact the whole economy. Let\u2019s dive in. Public vs. Private: Who\u2019s Telling the Truth? So how reliable are private-sector economic indicators compared to official government statistics? How do they really compare? Ben Schiffrin, a former SEC staffer and securities policy expert at Better Markets (a financial markets watchdog), says that government-collected stats are designed to provide a baseline of trust and transparency that private-sector data don\u2019t necessarily deliver. \u201cThe official data is supposed to come from a neutral perspective,\u201d Schiffrin explains. \u201cFor example, most people have long believed that data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is reliable. If it says something good or bad, you can trust it. That\u2019s generally what government data is meant to be.\u201d On the other hand, private companies have a way of manipulating information to help their bottom line. Take 401(k)s, for example. A recent Wall Street Journal report pointed out that only about ten percent of participants were interested in private-market investment options \u2013 private equity, private real estate, and the like. But you wouldn\u2019t know that, Schiffrin notes, from the way firms like Apollo and Blackstone have been marketing these options relentlessly, claiming data that purports to show that everyone wants in. The result is a striking gap between what investors actually want (or need) and what the industry is trying to sell. In finance, hype often matters more than reality. Or consider crypto. Industry surveys and advocates love to tout adoption numbers, spinning headlines as if \u201cmass adoption\u201d is already here. But Schiffrin points out that while crypto companies trumpet broad use, multiple surveys, including from the Fed, show that only a tiny (and even declining) fraction of Americans actually use cryptocurrency for payments or trading \u201cThe discrepancy is huge,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can\u2019t be both fifty percent and two percent.\u201d Phillip Basil, a former Federal Reserve staffer who studies banking policy, economic growth, financial stability at Better Markets, emphasizes that knowing a dataset\u2019s limitations is just as important as the data itself. \u201cI\u2019d say about 90% of the data out there has some kind of limitation,\u201d he notes. \u201cIt\u2019s just the reality: the volume of data being collected today is so large that some compromises or shortcuts are inevitable.\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to see what those compromises might be. \u201cGovernment data tends to be strong because it\u2019s public and transparent,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see how it\u2019s collected and what assumptions go into it, but private organizations often shield their sources and methods to protect proprietary processes.\u201d He points out that when you\u2019re building models or making predictions, understanding those limitations is essential. In the worst-case scenario, the limitations of private data can push the entire economy off a cliff. Exhibit A: Credit rating agencies. These profit-driven firms, paid to rate bonds, loans, and other financial products, base their assessments on a mix of public filings, issuer-provided numbers, and proprietary models, which draw on many sources of government data. They\u2019re private, yes \u2014 but wildly influential in public markets. And things got pretty wild in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis, when these agencies, caught in a massive conflict of interest, handed out top marks to mortgage-backed securities they had every incentive to rate favorably. Investors trusted them blindly, and the fallout was catastrophic. Amanda Fischer, a former SEC chief of staff and now policy director at Better Markets, has seen firsthand how private credit ratings can wander far from independent reality. She recalls an episode from the Biden administration, a reminder that some lessons from 2008 never quite stick. She observes that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) \u2014the body that represents state insurance regulators \u2014 still allows insurers to lean on private credit ratings to decide how much capital they must hold. It\u2019s a convenient system, but not always a prudent one. In one instance, Fischer recalls, the NAIC conducted a study comparing its own assessment of private credit investments with the ratings issued by a few smaller agencies \u2014 Egan-Jones and Kroll among them. \u201cThe results showed a huge gap between the NAIC\u2019s independent analysis and the grades these agencies were handing out,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the firms was so upset it publicly protested, and the NAIC quietly pulled the study from its website. The only trace left is a recent article in the Financial Times.\u201d Fischer adds that when she served on Biden\u2019s Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), there was a lot of discussion about how to get state insurance regulators to rely less on these private credit ratings, especially since they came from smaller shops that were often \u2018friendly\u2019 to the issuers. But the problem persists, and inflated or overly generous private credit ratings can mask real risk, leaving insurers undercapitalized and the financial system more vulnerable in a downturn. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher recently warned that U.S. insurers are engaging in \u201cratings arbitrage\u201d similar to the subprime practices that led to the 2008 crisis. The Bank for International Settlements warns that credit ratings on private loans held by US insurers may have been systematically inflated. Loopholes and Legal Gray Areas The surge of private data and alternative markets exposes a glaring weakness: the rules haven\u2019t caught up. These gaps in oversight leave both markets and ordinary Americans vulnerable. Schiffrin emphasizes that the U.S. system for regulating securities rests entirely on accurate information. Bad data = inadequate rules of the road. He notes that companies aren\u2019t supposed to tell investors what to buy or sell, but they must provide truthful, complete details about themselves and their finances. Some of this information is non-financial, like a company\u2019s strategy, leadership changes, or risk disclosures, which isn\u2019t really raw data but still matters to investors. Other information is strictly financial, like revenues, profits, balance sheets, and other hard numbers that analysts crunch. \u201cWithout accurate data and information, investors can\u2019t make informed decisions, and the market breaks down,\u201d Schiffrin warns. He stresses that we trust the SEC to enforce the laws that say companies must report earnings accurately. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, the information isn\u2019t useful to anyone, and the SEC will go after them. That\u2019s the foundation of securities law.\u201d But when it comes to newer alternative markets, like prediction markets and certain crypto-based platforms, the SEC faces major challenges, since these markets often operate outside traditional disclosure rules, making oversight and enforcement far more difficult. Think of prediction markets as online betting platforms, but instead of just wagering on sports, people can place bets on future events, like who will win the next presidential election, what the unemployment rate will be, or how the economy will perform next quarter. \u201cDebates are happening because they\u2019re exploding,\u201d say Fischer. \u201cThey\u2019re opening a whole new avenue for data exploitation, and operating in a legal gray zone when it comes to securities laws.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s striking,\u201d she continues, \u201cis that the sports betting rules under state law are often more rigorous than the rules for these prediction markets under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Right now, there\u2019s really no one ensuring that these markets are transparent or that the information they rely on is being disclosed accurately.\u201d Fischer explains that many of these platforms structure their bets as \u201cswaps\u201d to sidestep state gambling restrictions, claiming they fall under CFTC oversight. That\u2019s not very comforting, according to Fischer: \u201cThe problem is, the CFTC isn\u2019t actively policing these markets, and the platforms themselves aren\u2019t monitoring for insider trading or manipulation\u2014at least not as far as we know.\u201d She points to a recent case involved a large bet placed on the Nobel Peace Prize winner just before the announcement: \u201cThe timing suggested someone may have had early information.\u201d This is the kind of scenario where people can potentially profit from nonpublic information, blurring the line between legitimate speculation and insider trading. Schiffrin adds, \u201cWe have a lot of concerns with certain types of event contracts. Betting on elections is its own recipe for disaster. And when it comes to sports contracts, well, FanDuel and DraftKings aren\u2019t exactly paragons of virtue, but at least they\u2019re regulated. They have limits, warnings, systems to deal with addiction.\u201d He points out that the biggest players in the prediction market space, like Kalshi and Polymarket, are pushing to operate free from even the most modest oversight: \u201cA recent article in Rolling Stone noted that at least FanDuel tracks key metrics, like what percentage of users struggle with gambling addiction, and actually tries to address it. I think their statistics roughly line up with those from the National Council on Problem Gambling.\u201d By comparison, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi face almost no accountability. \u201cThey can say whatever they want \u2014they can pretend gambling addiction isn\u2019t a problem in this country,\u201d he adds, underscoring just how unregulated these markets remain. And of course, as in the Nobel Prize case, accurate data can be weaponized by private players, depending on who sees them first. Imagine a firm tracking real-time consumer spending. If an investor glimpses those trends before the public, they can trade ahead of the market, pocketing gains off information nobody else has. Frontrunning, as the practice it known, is something Schiffrin sees it as a real threat. \u201cIt applies to government data too,\u201d he notes. \u201cSometimes questions arise: did someone know a policy announcement was coming, and trade on it? Government data is supposed to have stricter controls to prevent that kind of misuse.\u201d Private-sector data, he adds, is no different from any other corporate information. \u201cPublic companies have insider trading policies because they know early access to market-moving information is a problem. The government isn\u2019t a public company, but if it becomes a source of market-moving data, the same risks apply. Just like earnings reports can move markets, early access to key government data could, too.\u201d Fischer stresses that the stakes are even higher in emerging arenas like prediction markets. \u201cHaving worked at the SEC, I would strongly caution against insider trading because normally, people get caught. But in prediction markets, enforcement is minimal. The usual rules about fairness and transparency don\u2019t seem to apply.\u201d When Data Problems Hit Your Wallet Inaccurate or missing economic data shapes the decisions of policymakers, and that\u2019s especially important when the Federal Reserve sets interest rates \u2014 those rates influence everything from mortgages and credit cards to your savings. When the Fed is working with incomplete or misleading information, it can ripple through the entire economy, affecting everyone\u2019s money. Basil lays it out plainly: \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal if monetary policy is not getting things right \u2014 to everybody, especially everyday workers.\u201d He emphasizes the extent to which rate setting really affects people\u2019s day to day lives. \u201cIf you have a credit card or you\u2019re taking out any kind of loan or you have some money packed away into a pension or whatever, everything moves with the rate cycle. Your retirement moves with the rate cycle. The amount of debt you owe moves with the rate cycle. How much credit a bank is willing to extend you moves with the rate cycle. So all of that, it is critically important to, to small businesses, consumers.\u201d Basil stresses how difficult the situation becomes for Fed officials: \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the actual data for one of your Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, there\u2019s some workarounds. You project certain numbers and then put those numbers into your model. But the problem is when you\u2019re projecting key inputs, well, those projections have uncertainty, and then you put those key inputs into your model, well, your model also has uncertainty.\u201d He warns that the errors tend to snowball as policymakers move forward. He point to concerning comments made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell during a recent press conference following a two-day policy meeting. As Powell explained, data lapses are making it difficult for the Fed to properly steer the economy: \u201cWe\u2019re going to collect every scrap of data we can find, evaluate it, and think carefully about it. And that\u2019s our job.\u201d He highlighted the use of private data, in-house surveys of business executives, and informal interviews with contacts across the country to make up the difference. At the same time, he acknowledged that the uncertain data environment was complicating the Fed\u2019s work: \u201cIf you asked me could it affect \u2026 the December meeting, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to, but yeah, you could imagine that. You know, what do you do if you\u2019re driving in the fog? You slow down.\u201d \u201cPowell is correct, but it\u2019s still a problem,\u201d Basil explains. \u201cImagine the Fed slows down to be cautious. That might seem prudent, but what if caution isn\u2019t the right move? Real data could show they need to raise or lower rates \u2014 take actions that would actually benefit consumers \u2014 but instead they hold back. That\u2019s the real danger: the Fed freezes when it should be acting. Meanwhile, markets and the economy keep moving on signals the Fed can\u2019t fully see. Employment could start collapsing, or other problems could emerge. That\u2019s the real concern.\u201d Basil is especially worried about gaps in data outside the banking sector. \u201cThe Fed collects plenty of information on banks, but most of it comes weekly or quarterly,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven then, it\u2019s not frequent enough. But in some key non-bank markets, there\u2019s almost no reliable data at all.\u201d Two of these markets have a direct impact on everyday life. The first is the repo market, where banks lend money to each other overnight. If this market falters, borrowing costs can quickly rise for everyone, from mortgages to credit cards. The second is the Treasury market, where the U.S. government borrows money by selling bonds. Treasury rates set the cost of mortgages, car loans, credit cards, basically, almost all borrowing. Data on these markets is surprisingly thin, observes Basil. \u201cA few years ago, the Office of Financial Research discovered that the repo market was almost twice as large as everyone thought, thanks to untracked over-the-counter activity. And those short-term rates matter because they dictate how financial institutions lend to each other. When the market falters, banks falter, and the Fed has to step in.\u201d Basil points to September 2019 and March 2020 as cautionary tales. In both cases, the Fed had limited visibility into these markets and responded by throwing trillions of dollars at the problem until things calmed down. \u201cThey overcorrect because they don\u2019t know the scale of the issue,\u201d he says. The consequences hit everyone. Turmoil in Treasury markets can spike borrowing rates, shake businesses, and pinch consumers. \u201cWhen things went haywire last April, the Fed blamed hedge funds, the Treasury blamed foreign investors \u2014 and no one really knew because there simply wasn\u2019t enough data.\u201d \u201cThese gaps are invisible most of the time,\u201d Basil says, \u201cbut when the markets blow up, they become huge problems.\u201d Here\u2019s the bottom line: The shutdown isn\u2019t just slowing the flow of information \u2014 it\u2019s putting the economy in the hands of data we can\u2019t fully trust. When policymakers have to rely on incomplete, delayed, or privately generated numbers, every decision gets riskier. This isn\u2019t just theory, because gaps in official data, murky private numbers, and unregulated alternative markets create blind spots that could trigger real problems. The fix is straightforward: get timely public data flowing again, strengthen oversight of private information that drives markets, and close the legal gray areas around emerging financial platforms. Until that happens, the whole economy is basically \u201cdriving into the fog\u201d \u2014 and we\u2019re all along for the ride. Exhibit B: Financial auditors.  BDO USA was the financial auditor for First Brands.  BDO signed-off on First Brands\u2019 2024 public financial report just prior to First Brands bankruptcy entirely missing billions in off-balance sheet debt\u2026or maybe not.  There are what appear to be reliable reports that BDO had a loan arrangement with Apollo Global Management which held long-term short positions on First Brands debt.  Where have we seen this before? Information provided by the government is always accurate and impartial, right? That\u2019s how we know that JFK, RFK and MLK were killed by lone assassins, that Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism, that the president of Venezuela runs the (non-existent) Cartel de Los Soles, and that no explosives were involved when WTC7 collapsed into its own footprint. Category error. The post is about data. and about the accuracy of official government data versus private data. What about data from non-profits and universities?  Probably universities now fear losing funding if they challenge Trump, show bad economy, etc.  NBER ?  Independent experts.  Forget the corporatocracy. Your email address will not be published.
