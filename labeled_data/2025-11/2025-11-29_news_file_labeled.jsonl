{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Black Friday 2025 Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Absolute Best Deals Kindle Deals Headphone Deals Apple Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals Sleep Deals Tech Deals Toy Deals The wellness industry is a wild marketplace. You can't trust the marketing alone, and FDA regulation on protein powder deals is quite limited. It pays to be cautious. So for this year's Black Friday, we sifted through the markdowns, cross-checked claims, verified third-party tests, and sampled the supplements so you don't have to. If you're looking to stock up or invest in a healthier routine, these are wellness supplements and protein powder deals we'd trust with both our own bodies and wallet. I'll be refreshing this list with the latest sales, so check back often. For more intel, check out our Best Black Friday Deals roundup. Ritual Ritual Amazon Ritual\u2019s Essential Protein Daily Shake is our top recommendation for women\u2019s protein powder. It\u2019s generally pricier than its competitors, but a $15 discount makes the cost more digestible. Its pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, and each serving also contains four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Ritual is a great supplement for sensitive stomachs as it\u2019s free from GMOs, stevia, sugar alcohols, and artificial sweeteners. It\u2019s also soy-free, gluten-free, and vegan. Bonus: It\u2019s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Each scoop delivers 30 grams of protein, as well as 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids. It\u2019s obviously made for protein shakes, but I personally prefer using this supplement in baked goods. Liquid I.V. Amazon (Regular, 16 Servings) Amazon (Sugar-Free, 14 Servings) Amazon (Immune Support, 14 Servings) If reviewer Louryn Strampe had a music festival starter pack, Liquid I.V. would be an essential. After downing one of these, her sore throat, dry nostrils, and head instantly feel better. Liquid I.V. comes in 20-plus flavors that will make your water taste sweeter, like passion fruit, mango, and strawberry lemonade. Each packet comes with electrolytes and eight vitamins and nutrients, including vitamin C and B vitamins. Plink Amazon (48-pack) Plink (48-pack) If you prefer fizzy tablets that you can just throw into a glass or water bottle, Plink is refreshing and offers a carbonation that recalls seltzer water. (Though, if you do toss it into a water bottle, leave it momentarily open so the gases can escape.) Plink comes in three flavors\u2014Pineapple Grapefruit, Watermelon, and Pomegranate Berry\u2014but I'd recommend the Variety Pack if you're new to the brand. IQBAR Amazon (20-Pack) Walmart (20-Pack) IQBAR (20-Pack) Reviewer Louryn Strampe loves the Peach Mango flavor, but she'd also recommend the Blueberry Pomegranate and Pi\u00f1a Colada. In addition to electrolytes, each packet also contains lion's mane mushroom and magnesium L-threonate to boost cognitive health. Fortunately, according to Strampe, the mix doesn't taste like shrooms, but it does have an earthy tang to it. Electrolit Amazon (8 Servings) Reviewer Louryn Strampe's favorite electrolyte mix for hangovers, Electrolit has been around since 1950 (!) and its packets are both generously sized and contain a balanced mix of sodium, carbohydrates, and sugars. All flavors are 33 percent off on Amazon right now, including the Variety Pack. Bloom Nutrition Amazon Bloom Nutrition Bloom\u2019s powder includes pre- and probiotics, fruits and vegetables, antioxidants, adaptogens, and digestive enzymes. Reviewer Louryn Strampe says drinking Bloom helps her regulate her digestive system and feel less bloated. Plus, the fruity flavor doesn\u2019t taste like greens. Factor Amazon Factor This greens powder has a light citrus flavor and offers one full serving of vegetables and vitamins within the recommended daily amount (no megadoses). It comes in convenient single-serve packets, making it easy to take along on your travels for a health kick. Organifi Amazon (30-Serving Jar) Organifi This is a reliable greens powder (organic spirulina, Ashwagandha, and chlorella) with minimal grit. Reviewer Louryn Strampe says it tastes like spearmint gum, but the Pomegranate Berry variation is also on sale if you prefer a fruitier palette. WelleCo Amazon WelleCo Pineapple & Lime is our favorite, but other flavors are also on sale, like Blood Orange and an Unflavored variation. It\u2019s a superfood blend of grasses, algae, and greens, complete with vitamin A, calcium, biotin, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and copper. Gr\u00fcns Amazon (Plain, 28 packs) Gr\u00fcns (Grunny Smith Apple, 28 packs) Amazon (Cubs for kids, 28 packs) Gr\u00fcns Gummies are ideal for those who can\u2019t down green powders, have kids, or prefer an on-the-go supplement. The Superfood Gummies contain 60 ingredients, from vitamins and minerals to greens (kale, cabbage, wheatgrass) and antioxidants (like goji berry and pomegranate). Zena Nutrition Amazon (30 packets) A superfood blend of organic greens, fruits, vegetables, herbs, mushrooms, prebiotics, and probiotics. We\u2019ve only tried Mixed Berry, but other flavors are discounted as well, including Green Apple and Mango. Jocko Go Amazon Jocko Willink\u2019s energy drink is a monkfruit-sweetened beverage that tastes like Sunny D and Stevia. It\u2019s only 95 milligrams of caffeine, but it also contains 100 milligrams of B vitamins, which is more than 4,000 percent of the daily recommendation. Gorilla Mind Amazon This is a 200-milligram energy drink boosted with nootropics like N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine and Alpha-GPC. Reviewer Pete Cottell says the Orange flavor is elite with its creamy finish, but other flavors are on sale, too, including the Variety Pack. Lucky Energy Drink Amazon An understated beverage for people who might not like the traditional taste of energy drinks. According to reviewer Pete Cottell, it provides enhanced focus and a steady boost of energy thanks to its 200 milligrams of caffeine. Phx Amazon This energy drink is a great option for those who want to avoid sugary beverages but still want a little flavor to mask the 700 milligrams of electrolytes. Our favorite is Orange, but other options are also on sale, including Blueberry Lemonade and Wild Berry. Gorgie Amazon This is a mild energy drink with 150 milligrams of caffeine that offers a productive buzz. Reviewer Pete Cottell describes the taste as a Diet Peach Snapple diluted with club soda. Accelerator Amazon This is a mild energy drink with 150 milligrams of caffeine that doesn\u2019t cause headaches or jitters. The peach flavor is not overly sweet, but other flavors are discounted as well, including Tropical Punch and Rocket Pop. G Fuel Amazon Allegedly the official energy drink of Esports, and it contains 300 milligrams of caffeine. A Reddit commenter said it \u201ctastes like what a clown would taste like.\u201d Ghost Amazon Most flavors are discounted, including Swedish Fish, Warheads Sour Black Cherry, and Tropical Mango. Reviewer Pete Cottell says this beverage will give you a burst of energy for about an hour, bubble guts, and a mild headache. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Wooden huts are glittering with golden fairylights as groups of friends gather in woolly hats, warming their hands on mugs of mulled wine. Signs written in German are dotted about - Gl\u00fchwein (mulled wine), Bratwurst (grilled sausage), Kinderpunsch (non-alcoholic punch). This isn't Germany - it's Birmingham's Frankfurt Christmas Market. Organisers say it's \"the largest authentic German Christmas market\" outside the country and Austria. Christmas markets are thought to have originated in Germany in the 14th Century, and its markets have long been admired since. But how close are the ones in the UK to that supposed traditional, real thing? BBC News visited some to find out - and perhaps provide some inspiration for your next festive visit. On a cold Thursday afternoon in Birmingham, we have just met Nina Adler and Till Rampe, 27-year-old German students studying for PhDs in the UK's \"second city\". As we walk around the Christmas market, which snakes through streets close to Birmingham New Street railway station, they're reminded of home. They point to the wooden huts, food and drink, and the handicrafts as positive signs this is close to the traditional ideal. The chocolate-coated marshmallows at one stall impress Till, who is from a town near Frankfurt. \"I could swear they are from my hometown,\" he says. But other aspects of Birmingham's market are further removed from the German way - like the beer. \"People are just connecting Germany with beer,\" Nina, from Berlin, says. \"In Germany usually you drink mulled wine. This is very typical.\" And as for the pop tunes blaring out of the speakers in Birmingham - like The Power of Love - you probably wouldn't hear that at markets in Germany - rather it would be Christmas music and carols, she says. Also visiting the market with us is Katharina Karcher, an academic at the University of Birmingham. Her verdict? It's \"super authentic\". Having been set up in 1997 and running annually since 2001, the Birmingham market is organised by Kurt Stroscher, who is also director of Frankfurt's Christmas market.  He uses \"only wooden stalls and atmospheric white lights that don't blink\", with the stalls built in Germany and food and drink imported from there. It's mostly a thumbs-up for Birmingham's Christmas market when it comes to authenticity, then - but how does it compare to one in Germany? While many Christmas markets in the UK have been running for a couple of weeks now, in Germany they have only just opened, as is tradition, on 24 November. Most German towns and cities have a Christmas market, with Dresden, Nuremberg and Cologne among the most famous. These markets hold \"huge symbolic meaning\" to Germans, says Dr Karcher, who's from near Frankfurt. Along with a religious undertone, \"they are what get people through the dark time\", she explains. Some 800 miles away from Birmingham, the city of Berlin is home to more than 70 different, small Christmas markets. In Charlottenburg Palace in the west of the German capital, the market is bustling and filled with people of all ages when we visit on a Tuesday night. The smell of roasted almonds, caramelised apples, chocolate-coated fruit, mulled wine and grilled sausages fills the air, as Christmas carols are performed live on a stage and children enjoy a small, sparkling Ferris wheel. The 17th Century Baroque Charlottenburg Palace is illuminated in different colours, with falling snowflakes projected onto its facade and wooden stalls in front. So what exactly makes a traditional German Christmas market? Typically, they may have (as this one in Berlin does): To Magrita, 66, who is enjoying a mulled wine with her husband Dietmar, 69, German Christmas markets are characterised by their unique atmosphere: \"The colourful lights and Christmas decorations make it so special.\" Dietmar explains how \"Christmas markets are not the same as other markets labelled as 'Winter Market' or 'Winter Wonderland,' because of the fairytale-like feeling you only get at an authentic Christmas market\". \"I visited a Christmas market in Milan a few years ago, and it wasn't the same, it was just a collection of different stores,\" he adds. At another table, Anna and Karolina, both 19, are catching up over some chocolate-covered strawberries. \"Apart from the mulled wine and the food, the colourful lighting and the festive and cosy vibe are what make Christmas markets unique,\" says Anna. But in Karolina's view, \"the star... is definitely the food and drink. [It's] what really makes a Christmas market authentic\". Back in the UK, while Birmingham can boast about its markets authenticity, what of other locations in the UK? Christmas markets have become a staple of many UK cities - Manchester, Leeds, Bath, Edinburgh and Newcastle among them. Smaller markets, typically in historic settings, are also proving popular on TikTok, sometimes incredibly so. Since 2023, Lincoln Christmas market has been closed because of overcrowding concerns. When the BBC visited the market in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, earlier this week, we saw an open mic night, including a rendition of Neil Young's Heart of Gold, and stalls selling the likes of pasta, Greek gyros and Yorkshire pudding wraps. There were also German foods and signs, though far fewer than Birmingham. Visitors didn't seem to mind though.  \"I quite like that,\" says Jamie Aycliffe, who was visiting the market with his wife and baby. \"We're doing our British version of the Bratwurst.\" But having been to Christmas markets across Europe himself, he felt the ones in the UK were \"not as good\" and \"a bit more commercial\". Others were visiting the Kingston Christmas market for the aesthetic.   \"It's fun,\" drama student Amelia Shannon, 22, says. \"I don't have to go to Germany for it.\" Overall, though, this was not as true to the traditional thing as in Birmingham, and also much smaller in size. Some people told us they'd prefer it if UK-based Christmas markets like in Kingston's sold more small gifts from independent businesses, like German markets do. Anne-Teresa Markovic, an academic originally from Nuremberg, says she was struck  by the range of food and drink offerings being \"more prominent\" there than in Germany while visiting Christmas markets in Manchester and Leeds. She recalls seeing \"festive patatas bravas\" on the menu, which needless to say, aren't particularly German. Christmas markets in Germany are changing, though. There's often now more international food - and Dr Karcher says depictions of the patron Saint Nikolaus are increasingly becoming more about Santa Claus. The warm glow exuded by Germany's Christmas markets was dimmed during deadly car attacks on a market in Berlin in 2016 and in the city of Magdeburg last year. Security has been stepped up at markets since. Some markets have been cancelled because the costs of security are too high for organisers. The Berlin Christmas market we visit is surrounded by a fence with large, concrete blocks placed along it, while a police car patrols one of the entrances. Despite the heightened security measures, the atmosphere seems relaxed. Anna and Karolina say they have never been to a Christmas market in the UK before, but would both welcome more Christmas markets outside of Germany.  \"Christmas markets are not defined by their location,\" explains Anna, \"but by the festive atmosphere and the time of the year when they take place.\"  Eight other 2025 Christmas markets in the UK you might like: Demonstrations were co-ordinated in cities including Bristol, Manchester and Birmingham. Jacob from Merseyside has met Santa one last time after an \"amazing\" response to his mum's plea. Hull city centre hosted events as part of a Christmas weekend, which continues on Sunday. ScotRail has announced its Christmas and New Year timetable which includes the last Christmas Eve and Hogmanay trains departing earlier than usual. The display includes reindeer on the roof, huge glittering snowflakes and a Santa figure. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"John Morgan says he tried to raise his kids with the same grit that shaped him when he was young. He is the eldest of five and started working various jobs at a young age to help his financially strapped family. Today, his legal firm, Morgan & Morgan, is one of the largest personal-injury law operations in the country, and he has an estimated net worth of $1.5 billion, according to Forbes. He attributes his extreme wealth partly to luck. \"I think when people start making money, they think they're a lot smarter than they actually are, and that arrogance is how they lose,\" he recently told Business Insider's Kevin Reilly. \"And so I believe luck has had an incredible amount to do with what happened to me.\"  See Morgan's full interview below: That same mindset is why he tried to raise his kids to be more self-aware than spoiled. \"These rich people buy their kids great cars, I never did,\" he said. \"I gave them like an 8-year-old Navigator, and they had to work, and they had to pay for their insurance.\" Morgan has three sons and one daughter. His sons now work at his law firm, but when they were younger, some of them worked at WonderWorks, Morgan's chain of science-focused entertainment centers. That didn't go over so well for one of them. \"I had to fire Dan once,\" said Morgan, who had heard that his son, Daniel Morgan, was slacking off at work. \"I said, 'Hey man, you're fired. And you're not going out until you get a new job,'\" Morgan recalled. Daniel Morgan told BI in a follow-up email that getting fired for showing up late to work at WonderWorks was embarrassing. \"But it turned out to be one of the most important lessons of my life,\" he wrote. \"The golden rule in our house was that you always had to have a job,\" wrote Daniel, who said he started working for his dad at age 14. After he was fired, Daniel Morgan ventured outside the family business. He landed a new job at Boston Market, but it didn't last long. About a week later, Daniel quit because they had him washing dishes, and it made him vomit, Morgan said.  \"I said, think about that, Dan. They got you doing the worst job in the place. That's what they think of you,\" Morgan said. For Morgan, firing his son was about teaching him perspective and that his last name couldn't buy him respect. It had to be earned. After leaving Boston Market, Dan found a job at Firehouse Subs, where he \"excelled,\" Morgan said. Daniel Morgan wrote that working in the fast-food industry taught him \"the value of humility and hard work (and showing up on time).\" He went on to become a lawyer, along with his two brothers. \"When I eventually joined Morgan & Morgan, I started in the call center and had to work my way up, earning every opportunity,\" wrote Daniel, who is now a managing partner at Morgan & Morgan. For all the wealth and size of his empire, Morgan's family is what he holds most dear. He built homes for his kids at the beach so they could raise their own families side by side. \"I would not understand life without them,\" Morgan said. \"Now I've got all these grandchildren, which is just another huge gift. And three of them live across the street from me.\" While he has ensured his kids are well-off, Morgan says he hopes they appreciate how lucky they are and the value of money. Morgan's mentor once told him, which he's passed down to his children: \"The money belongs to God,\" he said. Whatever luck granted them this wealth and fortune, it's simply that \u2014 luck. The money doesn't belong to him or his family \u2014 it's simply theirs to do the most good with while they can, he added. Morgan plans to put all his wealth into a trust that his daughter will manage once he's gone, he said. The trust will be used to fund causes he cares about, which are providing food, water, medicine, shelter, and clothing to those in need. He hopes his children will also contribute to those causes after he passes. \"What we're now doing is we're taking all of our fortune, and we're going to build a permanent foundation to do just those things, and that hopefully will go on way after my death. So that's the game plan.\" Daniel Morgan said he's proud of the mission he and his family are building. \"My siblings and I are living proof that my dad's hard lessons paid off,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":" This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.       We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.      LEGO makes a lot more than just toys for kids: This PAC-MAN arcade cabinet is an example of one of their adult-focused sets that are meant to be displayed rather than played with. This collectible, which is based on nostalgia, recreates the classic arcade experience from the 1980s with 2,651 pieces of real detail that both gamers and LEGO collectors will love. During Black Friday, this set is only $188 on Amazon, down from $269 and it is a record-low 30% discount that beats all previous prices. Since it came out, the set has stubbornly kept its $269 launch price with only short sales bringing it down to around $230. This price of $188 is a huge change that will create a lot of value and cause buying frenzies as word spreads through LEGO and gaming communities. See at Amazon The functional 4-way joystick moves in a way that feels like real arcade controls with satisfying clicks as you change directions. The coin slot lights up when you press it, and the score display can be changed to show high scores that are special to you like personal gaming achievements or inside jokes. When you open the back panel, you can see the engineering magic that makes static bricks look like they\u2019re moving. The rotating display base has figures of PAC-MAN, Blinky, and Clyde that change direction and behavior when you press buttons which makes for dynamic presentations instead of static poses. As you move through the positions, watch characters switch from chase mode to fleeing mode, just like in the power pellet moment when the hunted becomes the hunter. The 1980s arcade scene with a gaming mini-figure gives the cabinet a sense of place in its cultural moment instead of showing it in isolation. The vignette captures the arcade atmosphere where kids fed quarters into machines for hours, bringing back memories for anyone who lived through that time. LEGO\u2019s dedication to authenticity is shown in the way they style their mini-figures, choose their accessories, and add environmental elements. The 12.5-inch height makes a big impression on a desk or shelf without taking over like huge sets with more than 5,000 pieces that are more than two feet tall. The size is perfect for office desks, where the cabinet shows that you like retro games without looking like a toy collection; bedroom shelves, where it goes well with other gaming memorabilia; or entertainment center displays, where it fits in with modern consoles. The 2,651 pieces make for a satisfying level of building difficulty that takes experienced builders about 8 to 12 hours to complete, which makes it a good weekend project or evening building session that lasts for several days. This number of pieces strikes a balance between being fun and easy to get to. The LEGO PAC-MAN Arcade is now 30% cheaper than the stubborn $269 price that has been in place since it came out, thanks to the record-low Black Friday price of $188. If you\u2019ve wanted this set but didn\u2019t want to pay the usual price, this Black Friday deal makes nostalgic LEGO engineering available before it sells out.

A single screen can often feel limited, especially if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re someone who needs to work with multiple applications at the same time. Those who use a laptop as their main work or play device can benefit from adding a second, portable display to their setup, and today is a great time to bring one home. Amazon is currently offering quite a few impressive Cyber Monday deals, which also drops the price of the 15.6-inch KYY portable monitor to just $66. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s after a 34% discount on its $100 price tag, and the offer is open to all shoppers. Both Prime and non-Prime members can take advantage of it. Though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to get your orders in fast, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting the discount to wrap up soon. See at Amazon In a sleek, lightweight build, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a nice 15.6-inch screen. The size is similar to what most standard laptops offer, so you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel a drastic difference when switching between both. The same goes for the visuals. The portable monitor offers a 1920\u00d71080 resolution, which translates into brighter colors and sharper details. The advanced IPS matte screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle, meaning you can enjoy consistent visuals from all directions. Basically, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to sit directly in front of the screen to view the content. This is great for when you have multiple people around; those at the back or on the side will be able to see just as clearly. You can choose between multiple display modes (including mirror, extend, second screen only, and portrait mode), depending on what you need. Need to run two programs side by side? The extended mode gives you access to both. Reading through long documents? Portrait mode should work best! The monitor includes two fully functional USB-C ports, which means you can connect it with just a single cable for both power and display, as long as your device supports Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode. The setup is plug-and-play, so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to worry about installing any complicated drivers to get started. Even better, it comes with a smart cover that not just protects it from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand you can use to prop the monitor up. In short, if you have been wanting to expand your work or play setup with something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to carry around, this portable monitor can be a valuable addition.

Insta360 came to the action camera party later than GoPro and DJI, but the Chinese brand has been steadily taking their lunch money with cameras that have more features and cost less. The X5 came out in April of this year and is already a serious threat to the big players. It has 8K 360-degree capture and AI tools that really help with post-production work. This weekend, the model\u2019s price dropped to its lowest point ever, from $549 to $464 during the Black Friday sales event on Amazon. That discount is important because you\u2019re getting cutting-edge technology that would have cost twice as much just two years ago. It\u2019s now in a body that can handle a lot of abuse and record video that looks professional right out of the camera. See at Amazon The Insat360 X5 has two 1\/1.28-inch sensors that work together to record 360-degree video at 8K resolution and 30 frames per second. The bigger sensors let in more light and detail than the small chips that come with cheaper cameras which means that your footage stays clear and colors stay true, even when you\u2019re filming complicated scenes with different lighting. The dual-sensor setup stitches together perfectly in the camera and get rid of the obvious seam lines that used to ruin great shots in other 360 cameras. If you want regular flat video instead of the full spherical capture, you can also switch to InstaFrame mode: The camera will automatically track you so that you stay in the center of the frame while recording. This mode saves a lot of time because you can get shareable content right away without having to open editing software. Three AI chips work together inside the body to reduce noise and process images, and this is why the camera works better in low light than you would expect from an action camera: Night scenes and dimly lit rooms look surprisingly clear with detail visible in the shadows instead of the blurry mess that cheap cameras make. The triple-chip architecture also makes the \u201cinvisible selfie stick\u201d effect possible. This effect automatically takes the stick out of your footage to make those impossible floating third-person angles that make it look like you hired a professional camera operator. With FlowState stabilization, you don\u2019t need to carry a gimbal as it uses electronic correction to smooth out bumps and jolts while keeping the horizon level no matter how you twist or turn the camera. The 360-degree horizon lock lets you put the X5 on a bike helmet, surfboard or drone and the footage will stay in the right direction even when you do crazy flips and spins. Four microphones surround the body and a new wind guard system cuts through rushing air to pick up clear voice audio. The replaceable lens design solves one of the biggest problems with action cameras: if the lens got scratched or cracked, you had to buy a new camera or deal with bad footage. The X5\u2019s lenses were designed by Insta360 to pop off and on in a matter of seconds and the new glass is less likely to get scratched than older versions while still providing good optical quality. The camera can also go down to 49 feet without needing a separate case\u00c2\u00a0and its battery lasts 185 minutes, which is much longer than the 60 to 90 minutes that most other cameras last. And the good news is that with fast charging, the battery can go from empty to 80% in just 20 minutes. This new and capable camera is a great deal in the action cam space, especially since other 8K models from well-known brands still cost more than $500. You\u2019re getting next-gen sensor technology, professional-level stabilization, and AI-powered editing tools for less than the price of a mid-range GoPro.

Black Friday weekend is here, and with that comes tons of deals across every product category under the sun ranging from vacuums to coffee makers to, yes, even video games. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Slim on sale for $100 off. This disc edition of the console has recently been priced as high as $550, but during this weekend, you can grab the system of just $450. See at Amazon Okay we all love our memes about the PS5 saving it has no games. And while maybe at this point in the console\u2019s lifecycle we were hoping for a little more, the library of choices you have for what to play is far more than the barren wasteland Twitter makes it out to be. The new Ghost of Y\u00c5\u008dtei is one of the best looking and best playing action games of the generation. Returnal is a fast-paced third-person shooter roguelike with eary vibes reminiscent of Metroid. Astro Bot is our much-needed plunge back into the 3D mascot platforming genre. It\u2019s a brilliantly fun love letter to all things PlayStation and earned its title as 2024\u2019s Game of the Year at The Game Awards last year. Then if you missed out on the PS4 generation, you have countless titles waiting for you to dip into\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of which even enhanced for their move onto the PlayStation 5.\u00c2\u00a0The Last of Us: Part 1 and The Last of Us: Part 2 regularly get cited as the best story in video games. Well, at least the first one does (though I am a stark defender of the second one). Form your own opinion on the choices made by the iconic characters in these post-apocalypse stories that went on to inspire and HBO adaptation. Access a bunch of these instant classics with a subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium. You\u2019ll be able to access hundreds of games across PlayStation generations like\u00c2\u00a0Control, Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy VII Remake,\u00c2\u00a0and more. While this model PlayStation 5 is marketed as having a 1TB SSD, your actual usable storage isn\u2019t quite that. Much of the internal drive\u2019s space is dedicated toward system software that enables the PS5 be, well, a PS5. Out of the box, its more accurate to say you\u2019ll be working with a little over 850GB. If you\u2019d prefer more space, you can always expand it. The PS5 Slim\u2019s storage is expandable via an internal SSD slot. Brands like Crucial, Samsung, and Wester Digital all make SSDs which come with heatsinks and are compatible for installation in a PlayStation 5. Much of those you\u2019ll be able find on sale this weekend and next between Black Friday and Cyber Week. Installation is pretty easy too. There are any number of tutorial videos to choose from on YouTube. All it takes is a screw driver and five minutes of your time.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Anker makes some of the best power banks, and these are some of the best deals.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you're in the market for a portable power bank during Black Friday, Anker is likely at or near the top of your list. The company makes a ton of great products, including some of the best portable chargers we've tested. Black Friday is the perfect time to stock up on chargers, and two of my favorite power banks are currently on sale with up to 33% off. The Anker Nano Portable Charger and Anker MagGo Power Bank (5K) are both available for less than $40 each, discounted from $60 and $55, respectively. Depending on your needs, this is a great time to get two very useful and very convenient power banks for less than $80. This versatile power bank offers tons of value with its fast charging speeds and built-in USB-C cable. For $20 off, this Anker charger is well worth what you pay for it since it saves you from needing to buy a separate cable. \u2705Recommended if: You want a portable charger with fast charging, a built-in USB-C charger, and multiple ports for charging more than one device at a time. \u274cSkip this deal if: You want a more compact charger or one that supports faster speeds for devices with larger batteries (that support 45W or higher). Thin phones aren't cheap, but you can save on this slim power bank while still getting the battery life you need to keep your iPhone Air or Galaxy S25 Edge going. That's a ton of value for less than $40 with this Black Friday deal. \u2705Recommended if: You have a Qi2-enabled device like a Pixel 10, Galaxy S25, or recent iPhone models. Also, if you have a thin phone like the iPhone Air or Galaxy S25 Edge with a smaller battery. \u274cSkip this deal if: Your phone doesn't support Qi2 or have built-in magnets, and you don't want to rely on a case for magnetic charging.      These two chargers have become staples in my everyday life. The Anker Nano Power Bank is incredibly useful for many reasons, but the main ones are the charging speed and built-in USB-C cable. It supports 45W charging, which is faster than most Galaxy phones can charge, while still being quick enough for Android phones that support faster speeds. As for the USB-C cable, it's retractable, meaning it's hidden when you don't need it, and you just have to pull it out to extend it up to 2.3 feet. And if you want to charge multiple devices, the power bank also comes with a USB-C port and a USB-A port. With a 10,000mAh capacity, it'll be able to provide a full charge to your smartphone and then some, or provide a decent charge to multiple devices. There's a small display so you can monitor temperature as well as real-time charging speed, and it'll even give you an estimate of how much charge time you have remaining. And to help with portability, the power bank comes with a loop.      The MagGo Power Bank is a bit more niche, since it's a Qi2 wireless charger, but as more Android phones gain support for the standard, it's definitely a charger you'll want in your arsenal. It's surprisingly thin for a 5,000mAh power bank and supports 15W speeds (or 20W with the USB-C port). The magnets are great because you can stick them to the back of your phone and not have to worry about carrying it awkwardly. And as a plus, it's also good for charging smaller devices like wireless earbuds.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Black Friday 2025 Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Absolute Best Deals Kindle Deals Headphone Deals Apple Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals Sleep Deals Tech Deals Toy Deals Hyperice's Black Friday deals are live, and they're not ones to miss. Hyperice is one of the top wellness recovery brands in the industry, trusted by athletes, college sports programs, and professional facilities. From percussive massage guns to heated wraps, we've rounded up the best Hyperice Black Friday deals. All of these gadgets have been tested and vetted by WIRED staffers, but we've also included some gear that we have yet to test if the discount may be too good to pass up. Products are selling out fast, and the prices change frequently, so check back for the latest updates. For more intel on sales, check out our Best Black Friday Deals roundup or our Black Friday liveblog. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice REI The Hypervolt 2 is the best percussive massage gun on the market (for most people). At 1.8 pounds, it's light enough to pick up after an intense workout, and the 60-watt brushless motor delivers relatively quiet percussions. It has three speed settings and five interchangeable heads (fork, ball, cushion, flat, and bullet), and it's built with a pressure sensor that lets you know when you're pushing too hard, kind of like an electric toothbrush. You can usually get around three hours of continuous use per charge, and since it's TSA-friendly, you can throw it in your carry-on for long travels. Nike \u00d7 Hyperice Hyperice Dick's Sporting Goods Nike The Hyperboot is on sale for the first time. These recovery boots pair the brand's heat tech with its Normatec-like compression for a warm, pressurized therapy that feels incredible both before and after a workout. You can toggle between three compression levels (50, 130, and 210 mmHg) and heat (111, 118, and 125 degrees Fahrenheit) using the built-in control panel. Slip on both, and they sync automatically. You typically get around 90 minutes of continuous use per charge, depending on how hot and tight you run them. They're IP54 rated, meaning they're dust- and splash-resistant. They're also TSA-approved. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice Best Buy Whether I'm running, traveling, or sitting too long at my desk, my calves are the first place I feel pain. Hyperice's portable air-compression sleeves have become my go-to remedy when I'm sore or stiff. They're also a useful recovery to have if you struggle with bad circulation or chronic pain. There are seven intensity levels, 360-degree compression, and three overlapping zones that deliver a rhythmic relief I can't get from a massage gun. I'd happily pay full price for the Normatec go, so seeing them on sale is just a cherry on top. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice The Hyperice X Shoulder is a contrast therapy wrap that's smarter than your typical ice pack or heating pad. With five levels of heat, cold, and compression, you can dial in exactly what you need. It's helpful for warm-ups and recoveries, but especially for rehabbing a minor strain. The battery lasts around 90 minutes on the highest heat setting and about an hour on the highest cold setting. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice Hyperice's Venom 2 Back is a neoprene wrap that delivers vibration therapy and even heat across your lower back. I use it after strenuous strength training and anytime my back aches from hunching over my laptop all day. It's also a game-changer if you suffer from menstrual cramps that extend to your lower back. You can toggle between three heat levels (113, 122, and 131 degrees Fahrenheit) and three vibration frequencies. It boosts circulation, loosens tight muscles, and is overall a great tool to have for mobility warm-ups. I especially appreciate the 15-minute auto shut-off, so I don't have to worry about overdoing it.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Beyond just sounding great in general, the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds also have a range of premium-level audio features.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Black Friday earbud deals are already starting to show up at multiple retailers, just weeks away from one of the year's biggest sales events. For example, Best Buy is offering $80 off the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds for its early Black Friday sale, bringing the price of our favorite earbuds down to just $248. These wireless earbuds offer high-quality audio, along with several useful features such as active noise cancellation, ambient sound mode, 360 reality audio, and support for multiple high-resolution formats. We also like them for their superb battery life and their ease of use through the Sony Headphones Connect app, which has EQ and other controls. The earbuds also include an IPX4 water resistance rating, as well as fast charging through the USB-C cable and Qi wireless charging. They're definitely on the pricey side of the earbuds spectrum, making deals like this particularly worth taking advantage of. Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds: $328.00 $228 at Best Buy Sony's powerful WF-1000XM5 earbuds are currently selling for $80 off at Best Buy, as the retailer soft launches some early Black Friday discounts. These are not only our favorite earbuds, but Sony also launched them with an improved ear fit from the previous-gen version. \u2705Recommended if: you want a good deal on some of the best noise-cancelling earbuds available on the market; battery life and audio quality are highly important to you, even if it means spending a little more money; you're looking for earbuds with ANC, spatial audio, and ambient sound modes. \u274cSkip this deal if: you'd prefer to save additional money and would rather go with a budget pair of earbuds without all the bells and whistles; you need a pair of earbuds that are extremely durable and include a dust resistance rating, in addition to water resistance; you prefer over-ear headphones to earbuds. The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds are top-notch, largely due to their excellent audio quality, wide range of audio features, and long-lasting battery. While it's certainly a competitive market out there by today's standards, these stand out as a clear favorite of ours, even if you're just in it for the overall sound quality. The WF-1000XM5s include powerful AI-based ANC, ambient sound modes, 360 reality audio, and equalization and other settings using the Sony Headphones Connect app. Sony also says these will get users up to 8 hours of battery life per charge, or a total of 24 hours with intermittent charges using the case. Using the USB-C charging cable, the company also says that users can replenish an hour of battery life with just a 3-minute charge. Meanwhile, they also support Qi wireless charging. The buds are constructed with six onboard microphones for high-quality call audio and easy voice commands, while they also include features such as Speak-to-Chat and Precise Voice Pickup Technology.

Are we in the middle of an AI bubble? Ask a lawmaker, and they probably won't have a definitive take for you. \"If I knew that, I'd be in a different line of work,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents much of Silicon Valley, told Business Insider. The AI bubble debate has been raging in the tech world since August, when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that investors had grown \"overexcited\" about the technology. There are also concerns about circular spending patterns among tech companies investing in AI technology, and fears that companies won't be able to recoup the billions of dollars they're spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. Bill Gates has explicitly compared it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. However, many in the tech world remain confident that there's no bubble, citing continued high demand for AI products. \"Are we in an AI bubble? I have no idea,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told Business Insider. \"Even the AI people don't know.\" Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that while she was unsure whether there's a bubble, she's concerned by \"how much of the economic activity in the stock market and across the country is driven by this one sector.\" \"If it is overvalued, when that bubble pops, it's going to be felt everywhere,\" Warren said. \"The concentration makes the economy far more vulnerable than it otherwise would be.\" One of the few lawmakers who's been outspoken about the potential for a bubble is Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said at a hearing last week that we may be in a \"massive economic bubble\" that could pose \"2008-style threats to economic stability.\" \"Should this bubble pop, we should not be entertaining a bailout,\" Ocasio-Cortez added. The debate is slowly making its way to Capitol Hill as the Trump administration and some Republicans in Congress are pursuing ways to make it easier for the AI industry to do business. President Donald Trump, when asked, has largely shrugged off questions about whether he's worried about a bubble. \"I guess. I worry about everything,\" Trump said in an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month. \"I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected.\" Trump has begun to talk up the need to restrict states' ability to regulate AI, reviving a fight that played out over the summer as Congress considered the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The bill originally included a provision that would have blocked states from enacting some regulations on AI for 10 years. It was strongly supported by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee who's positioned himself as an ally of the AI industry on Capitol Hill. It was later stripped out of the megabill in a 99-1 vote. When asked last week whether he sees a bubble in the AI industry, Cruz was circumspect. \"Will there be uncertainty? Will there be economic challenges? Of course,\" Cruz told Business Insider. \"But for technology of this magnitude, it's in our interest that America win the race, and not China.\" Ocasio-Cortez argued that there's a connection between the potential bubble and financial incentives to make AI technology more exploitative. \"People's deepest fears, secrets, emotional content, relationships can all be mined for this empty promise that we're getting from these companies to turn a profit,\" Ocasio-Cortez said at the hearing. But for some of those who want to see stronger regulation of AI, the question of a bubble is largely beside the point. \"Bubble, no bubble, whatever,\" Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said. \"We need to focus on the effect on working people.\" Jump to","label":0}

Keeping your devices charged at all times doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be complicated. Those who use multiple gadgets to get through their days can greatly benefit from dual-port chargers that make it easy to top up to two essentials at the same time. And today is a great time to pick a couple for literal pennies. A 2-pack of Anker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 20W charger, which typically sits at $19, just dropped to $11 at Amazon, after a whopping 41% discount. Each of these comes with two ports, and with this deal, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re basically paying just a little over $5 for each. The offer applies to the black color option. Others are discounted too, but the prices vary. For instance, the white option is sitting at $13, while green and purple are going for $14 each. Plus, for every color except black, discounts are only available to Prime members. These are Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals (even though the event is behind us), but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling out fast. Get yours before the stock runs out or Amazon decides to push the price back up. See at Amazon The charger is designed to be compact and portable. It fits in the palm of your hand, slides into your pocket, and can be tossed into any backpack without bulking things up. Getting two of these means you can keep one for home use, while the other in your laptop bag or car for hassle-free on-the-go usage. Two ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) let you power two devices at the same time. The 20W output isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t massive, but still decent to juice your essentials up without taking too long. It can fast charge an iPhone 16 from 0 to 50% in around 30 minutes. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll enjoy maximum power when using a single port. When both are in use, expect each to deliver 7.5W max output. A 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable is included with each charger, which is long enough for you to be able to use the connected devices comfortably as they charge. As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices. These include iPhone Series 15 through 17, iPhone Pro Series (2024, 2023, 2022, 2021), the latest Google Pixel devices, recent Samsung phones, and even Galaxy tablets. You will also be able to power your earbuds, select iPad configurations, plus smartwatches with each. Basically, it covers all the devices you rely on on a regular basis. But despite all the power, the charger stays calm and cool as it works. Anker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enhanced safety system includes overvoltage protection, temperature control, and other helpful safety features to protect your devices from long-term wear, while also maintaining their battery health. Included in the box are two Anker chargers, a 2-pack 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty, in case something goes wrong. You can now grab this bundle for just $11. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open to all shoppers, but Prime members will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, too. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not one, you can still get free delivery, but only on orders above $35. Just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait too long to grab the deal, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to end soon. Holiday rush is in full swing, and as a general rule, if you spot something you like, jump in on it while there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still time. Additionally, there\u2019s plenty more going at a discount right now, so it\u2019s a good time to stock up on both the essentials and pricey options without blowing your budget.

Sometimes a layoff isn't a farewell forever. Rehires of people who were laid off could become more popular in a shaky job market. Visier, a people analytics firm, looked at how many people were rehired at their previous employers within 15 months of being terminated. Visier found about 5.3% of laid-off employees were rehired, based on global data from 2018 to 2024 covering 142 large organizations with over 2 million employee records. Andrea Derler, principal researcher at Visier, expects boomerang hires of people who were previously laid off to increase as companies figure out how to handle \"AI-induced pressures\" and economic uncertainty. \"In times of extreme turmoil, where workforce planning is made even more difficult due to rapid, unexpected, and unpredictable changes, layoff boomerangs seem to be more prevalent,\" Derler said. Separately, ADP Research found that the share of new hires who were boomerang employees increased from 26% in March 2022 to 35% this past March. \"In an era where the outlook on the jobs market is fuzzy or uncertain, it makes sense for both employers and employees to stick with what they know,\" Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, previously told Business Insider. The US is in a mostly frozen job market marked by low layoffs, but also low hiring. Job growth slowed from a monthly average of 111,000 between January and March to about 62,000 between July and September. Layoffs in the US are low, but announcements are adding up. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that there have been over 1 million job cuts announced from US-based employers this year as of October. Verizon, Amazon, government agencies, and others have made headlines for their decisions. Derler said Visier's data doesn't show a surge in manager layoffs, but they are also more likely to be rehired. \"Organizations realize that it's really hard to find a good manager because the manager is responsible for a lot of things: performance, productivity, but also engagement of other employees,\" she said. Among the handful of industries Visier looked at, finance and retail had the highest rates of laid-off employees that were rehired at 7.5% each. Derler said retail has a lot of turnover, so it makes sense that workers may go back and forth. She suspects the rate for the finance industry is because the work duties involve certain skills and expertise. Instead of tapping into a new talent pool, businesses may turn to people previously on their payroll and who have already demonstrated their capabilities. Meanwhile, Derler said tech's rate of 4.3%, below the average rate and the lowest among the five industries looked at, could be because desired skills and knowledge quickly evolve. So, unlike finance, firms may want to look at a new talent pool. \"Prompt engineers a year ago was the big job \u2014 nobody talks about prompt engineering anymore,\" Derler said. \"Skills are changing so fast, so that's why I can assume that they'll be looking for new people with new skills rather than those who they know.\" Derler said all parties need to have good \"layoff hygiene,\" where both sides are respectful. She said workers should also try not to internalize their layoff or think it's something they did wrong. She also emphasized the importance of always keeping up your skills, so that if you are laid off, you can confidently add your knowledge to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or talk about it in an interview. Derler also suggested staying connected with people you worked well with in case you do rejoin \u2014 not just so it's pleasant to return, but because they might know about an opening. Derler said she interviewed some boomerangs and found some were still in touch with their old boss. \"When their manager then realized they actually needed somebody again, they would be the first that they would call,\" she said. \"Makes sense, right? Because you know the person, you get on well with them.\" Have you gone back to your previous job? Are you a hiring manager who has made boomerang hires?

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"If you're looking to stock up on Game Pass to avoid any price increases, this is by far the best Black Friday deal we've seen so far.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When Microsoft recently announced a massive 50% price increase for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, I wasn't as stressed about whether I should stay subscribed to the service as a lot of people rightfully were. That's because I've already stacked my Game Pass subscription to the end of 2028, and big Black Friday discounts helped me pull it off. Discounts like this deal that nets you two 3-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate codes for only $95.98 at Newegg. That's six months enjoying everything Xbox Game Pass has to offer for 20% less than the service cost before its massive price increase. If you've been paying month-to-month, this sale will cut your Game Pass bill almost in half.  If you're looking for the best way to stack up on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you found it. This is the cheapest way to secure stackable 3-month codes, saving you nearly 50% compared to paying per-month after Xbox's recent price increases. You're still saving 20% even going by pre-price increase costs. I love Xbox Game Pass; I've been able to experience so many unique video games I otherwise never would've played because of the service, and I also take advantage of many of the included perks and benefits. That being said, Xbox Game Pass is no longer the cut-and-dry ultimate value it was at its inception, thanks to a series of unfortunate price increases. Not too long ago, the flagship Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier got hit with a massive 50% price increase. Sure, subscribers also got access to a bunch of new content and the promise of 75 or more day one launches every year, but paying $30 a month for a gaming subscription is a tough pill to swallow for many. Those price increases are steadily rolling out, making it increasingly difficult to get the best of Game Pass without breaking the bank. Fortunately, I'll be avoiding this price range \u2014 and potential future price increases \u2014 for at least three years, and that's because I've picked up Xbox Game Pass Ultimate codes during major sales and stacked them on my account. If you find value in Xbox Game Pass (millions do), but don't want to be saddled with ballooning costs, look out for these deals. This Black Friday, the best I've seen is easily dual 3-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate codes for $95.98 at Newegg.com. It's definitely better than the alternative Xbox Game Pass Ultimate deal on Amazon. Just to break those savings down quickly, you'd have to pay $120 for six months of XGPU before the price increase \u2014 after, you'd have to pay $180. Savings of nearly 50% is nothing to scoff at, and you can stack these codes and lock your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at that lower price. Just be warned, this deal is for the United States region (and you're limited to 20, technically, but you'd only need six to max out your account). Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Windows Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. After the recent price increase, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs a whopping $29.99\/month, 50% more than its previous price. You can still find plenty of codes for the previous price of $19.99\/month (or $59.99 for three months), but it's a lot harder to find a deal that will get you Game Pass Ultimate for even less than that. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft's flagship gaming subscription service, so it includes a lot of benefits, including access to hundreds of games across console and PC, Xbox Cloud Gaming to stream Game Pass titles and your owned games, online multiplayer on Xbox consoles, day one access to 75+ new games every year, exclusive deals and discounts on games and DLC, various in-game perks and benefits, increased Microsoft Reward points, and other major perks like EA Play, Ubisoft+ Classics, Fortnite Crew, and more. Yes, you can stack up to 36 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on your account, letting you avoid monthly subscription fees and making it easier to save money. The easiest way to stack Xbox Game Pass is to buy digital codes, but be sure you're buying codes that work in your region, and aren't \"Trial\" codes meant for brand-new subscribers. Black Friday landed on Friday, Nov. 28 in 2025, though its related discounts weren't restricted to the official day itself. Black Friday as an event started earlier in the week across multiple retailers, and continues to apply across the weekend. Cyber Monday starts on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025, but, as with Black Friday, it has already begun appearing as the theme for deals at certain retailers. While its discounts are generally restricted to the day itself, some deals may extend into Tuesday and beyond. Cyber Monday has already started on Amazon US, with its promotional messaging shifting away from Black Friday in the early hours of Saturday morning, on Nov. 29, 2025, and is expected to last until the end of Monday, Dec. 1, 2025.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally have been more popular than expected; unfortunately, this means they're out of stock at many retailers.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PC has sold more than ASUS ROG and Xbox expected, which has led to it being out of stock or on backorder at a few different retailers. For instance, you can still put an order in for one for $999.99 at Best Buy (sorry, there are no Black Friday discounts), but new orders aren't expected to arrive until January 2, 2026. Still, this is one of the safest places to buy from. If you want to get an Xbox Ally X before Christmas, there are some places you can look for one. Just be careful and follow our safety tips so you don't get scammed. The Xbox Ally X can be ordered at Best Buy, but currently, orders placed aren't expected to arrive until Jan 2, 2026. This devices has an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chip with 24GB RAM, and 1TB SSD. It can be used to play everything from casual games to compatible AAA games.Windows Central review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 1\/2 The less powerful Xbox Ally will arrive before Christmas, but it cannot run the latest AAA games since it utilizes a modest AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip with 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD. It's especially good for cloud gaming and playing less-intensive games like 2D pixel art titles and indie games. As of right now, it should arrive before Christmas if you buy it during Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Windows Central review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50      Unfortunately for everyone who wants to get an Xbox Ally X this holiday season, the handheld gaming PC is in short supply. As I mentioned earlier, you can still put an order in at Best Buy, but the retailer currently estimates that you won't get it until Jan 2, 2026, which is obviously after the holidays. If you really don't want to wait until next year to get your hands on one, then there are a few places you can try, like eBay, AliExpress, and Facebook Marketplace. Just be careful since some people might want to scam you with deals that are too good to be true. Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Windows Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Yes, but it depends on the handheld and its configuration or internal hardware for what kind of games it can run. If you want to play AAA games, you'll need to make sure you buy a more powerful handheld gaming PC.  Yes, but the experience could be different depending on the handheld you get. Some PC gaming handhelds run Windows while others run SteamOS. The devices that run Windows (Xbox Ally X, Legion Go 2, etc.) can easily access a wide range of gaming services out of the box. However, you'll need to do some work on the Steam Deck and Legion Go S (SteamOS) first before you can access more than just Steam. For help with that, check out my guide on how to Decky Loader on Steam Deck. Unfortunately, no. The Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally do not have any Black Friday deals so far this year. No. GameStop does not sell Xbox Ally or Xbox Ally X handhelds. However, some locations will take these devices as trade-ins. Black Friday 2025 is technically on Friday, November 28, 2025. However, various retailers have been introducing deals as early as a couple of weeks before then. As has been the case for several years, Black Friday deals will merge and give way to Cyber Monday deals.  Cyber Monday 2025 is Monday, December 1, 2025. Some Black Friday deals will continue through this event and will change in name only. However, several new Cyber Monday deals are likely to sprout up on that Monday and some will continue throughout the week.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"     What you get with the stripped-down Model Y and Model 3.    The Tesla Model Y Standard model in white. Notice that the front has standard headlights instead of the light bar found on the original version. Tesla has launched a range of more affordable electric cars\u00a0-- stripped-back versions of the\u00a0refreshed Model Y\u00a0and\u00a0Model 3. These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to own a Tesla.  This change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\u00a0  The idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.  It comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from\u00a0Kelley Blue Book, the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.  This is what the rear of the Tesla Model Y Standard looks like. It has the same light bar as the regular version. The Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.  Inside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\u00a0  Tesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.  Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. The rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.  The Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\u00a0  The front of a Tesla Model 3 Standard driving along a road. It looks identical to the regular Model 3. Meanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\u00a0  Tesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.  It retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\u00a0  Charging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.  Both cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\u00a0  Full Self-Driving is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.  I think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\u00a0  In my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.  Pricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\u00a0  For now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"JBL's Tune headphones offer a decent audio experience that won't break the bank.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you're in need of some cheap wireless headphones, the Black Friday deals have got you covered. Amazon has slashed the price of the already affordable JBL Tune 520BT wireless headphones in half, bringing them down to just $30. While these may not have all the bells and whistles of premium or mid-range headphones, they're a good pick for anyone looking to get an affordable name-brand option. JBL says they'll get up to 57 hours of battery life, while they also have a comfortable design that's easy to fold up and stow when not in use. Like most modern headphones, they also include built-in microphones for hands-free calling and voice commands, as well as physical buttons for controlling playback and volume. They also feature JBL's signature \"Pure Bass\" sound, but for those who prefer a different audio profile, they also include access to simple EQ settings using the JBL Headphones mobile app. The Tune wireless headphones plug in to charge using a USB-C cable, and the maker says that 5 minutes of charging will yield 3 hours of playback time. JBL Tune 520BT: $59.95 $29.95 at Amazon for early Black Friday For a limited time ahead of Black Friday, Amazon is offering the JBL Tune 520BT wireless headphones for just $30, marking a 50% discount.

It's safe to say that 2025 has been a good year for phone launches. I had over 75 phones delivered this year, and whether it's the tri-folding Huawei Mate XT, the incredibly-thin OPPO Find N5 or Honor Magic V5, the vibrant iPhone 17 Pro (I got the orange one), or the Find X8 Ultra with its outstanding cameras, there have been plenty of standouts this year. Most flagships started using silicon batteries, leading to devices like the Find X9 Pro and its 7,500mAh battery, and Vivo outdid itself with the cameras on the X300 Pro. While these phones are limited to select global regions, there's a decent selection of phones to consider if you're in North America. Google got its act together this year with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, delivering a flagship that excels in all areas. The Pixel 9a, meanwhile, is the best budget phone around. And if you need an all-rounder that gets everything right, the OnePlus 13 is still my go-to recommendation. With Black Friday in full swing, now is the best time to buy a phone if you're looking to do so. The Pixel 9a is all the phone you need if you just want a budget device with great cameras. It is great to hold and use, the software is the best you'll see in this segment, and it will get more updates than any other budget phone. At $349, there just isn't any other phone that's as good.  I like the OnePlus 13 more than the OnePlus 15, and that's why I'm recommending it. The phone is still plenty fast, and if anything, it's showing no signs of slowing down. It has amazing battery life, terrific cameras with Hasselblad tuning (the OnePlus 15 doesn't have this), and at $699, it costs a lot less than its Samsung rivals.  The Pixel 10 Pro XL is one of my favorite phones of 2025. While Samsung also did a good job this year, Google rectified long-standing issues with the Pixel 10 Pro XL, making it a better choice. The cameras are outstanding, the software is a delight to use, and the phone is faster than its predecessors \u2014 a big deal in its own right. If you're using an older Pixel or Galaxy phone and want a true flagship, I'd suggest getting the Pixel 10 Pro XL right now.  I don't say this every year, the sale is particularly relevant if you're in the market for a phone but haven't one yet. With phone prices going up next year, this is the best time to get a new phone while they're still relatively affordable, and there are decent deals to be had. The Pixel 9a is now selling at just $349, and honestly, it's a terrific choice if you just need a reliable phone. It nails the basics, has a great in-hand feel, and the rear design is pretty great thanks to a camera module that sits flush with the body. The cameras are the best in this category, you get a clean software with fast updates, and there isn't much missing on this phone. If you've used a Samsung phone and are considering switching over to another manufacturer, I highly recommend the OnePlus 13, which is now down to $699. It's significantly more affordable than the Galaxy S25 models, but you still get amazing cameras, better battery life than any Samsung phone, and a level of fluidity that One UI can't come close to. And if you're ready to embrace AI features and want a phone that does the best job in this area, you should get the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The phone usually costs $1,199, but Google has a $300 discount right now, bringing it down to $899. That's still quite a lot of cash, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best Google phone yet, and having used every single Pixel in the last decade, I'm confident in recommending the device.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Only two of the three colors remain.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When looking at the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+, it's usually kind of a difficult one to recommend due to its $650 retail price. But, you can throw all of that out of the window, as Walmart has an insane Black Friday\/Cyber Monday deal for the Tab S10 FE+, as it's on sale for $409, a savings of $240! I didn't even know this deal was going on, but apparently, I was simply in the dark as the Silver color option is already gone. Even then, the Gray version is the only one that's available for $409, as the Blue color comes in at $428, which is still cheaper than any other deals we've seen. Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ (128GB): $649.99 $409.99 at Walmart There are a lot of great Android tablets in Samsung's lineup, but at this price, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ is hands-down the best. Seriously, this might just be the best Black Friday\/Cyber Monday Android tablet deal that I've seen in quite a while.  Price comparison: $499 at Samsung | $469.99 at Amazon \u2705Recommended if: you want a flagship-looking Samsung tablet while getting about 80% of the same features, without paying the exorbitant price tag, \u274cSkip this deal if: you're in the market for a tablet that is either more powerful or has a different screen size. When I initially started looking for deals, I came across the Tab S10 FE Plus for $469 over at Amazon, and thought that was pretty good. But by a stroke of luck, I happened to see this deal from Walmart, which was the last place I expected to have the best tablet deal. When there aren't a bunch of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals going on, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ is actually a difficult recommendation. It's not because of the features or functionality, but it all comes down to the $649 retail price. For just $150 more, you can get the Galaxy Tab S11, which is equipped with a better screen and newer processor. Now the question becomes whether you should get the $409 Tab S10 FE+ or splurge on the Galaxy Tab S11, which is down to $649. Honestly, if the Tab S11 were a bit cheaper, it would make for a more difficult decision. But I'd probably still go with the Tab S10 FE+, as it lets you keep some money to splurge on dinner with, or to pick up some of the other Black Friday\/Cyber Monday deals you come across.

Have little ones who can\u2019t get enough of dinosaurs? Surprising them with a buildable T. rex skull is going to light them up instantly, and today is a great time to pick one up. LEGO\u2019s Jurassic World Dinosaur Fossils: T Rex Skull building set, which gets you a posable T. rex skull, plus a fossilized footprint with a plaque, is currently sitting at just $25 on Amazon. That\u2019s after a 38% discount on its retail price of $40, and the price is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. It\u2019s a Cyber Monday deal, and the holiday rush is going to set in quickly. We recommend grabbing it fast, as the offer (or the stock) is likely going to end soon. See at Amazon This fun set is made for ages 9 and up, and gets you a total of 577 pieces. It\u2019s not going to be one of those massive projects that require week-long dedication, and won\u2019t be a super quick job either. Think of it as a fun little weekend activity that your kids can begin on a Saturday and be done with by Sunday. Attention to detail is truly impressive. You\u2019ll be building a fairly realistic dino toy; a T. rex skull with dinosaur bones that sits on a display stand. You can choose to keep the jaws open for a scary look or close them when letting the beast rest. The skull is paired with the fossilized footprint, plus a plaque that displays some cool facts about the Tyrannosaurus. Kids can learn about the height of the giant, its weight, dietary preferences, and more as they build. There\u2019s a hidden amber piece added somewhere in there to add a little mystery for the curious minds, too. Finish off by adding some LEGO plants around for a foresty feel. Once made, the set measures over 8 in. (21 cm) high. Place it on a shelf in the living room, or in the kids\u2019 play area; it\u2019s going to look stunning everywhere. You can display the skull, amber, and footprint in different ways. It\u2019s going to look great on its own, and even pair it with other Jurassic World kits for a fuller setup. Like all LEGO sets, this too comes with a detailed instruction manual. The guidebook takes you through each step, and is pretty easy to follow. But for additional assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, as well. The platform offers 3D instructions, plus lets you zoom in on the blocks from each angle to get a better understanding. Kids can save all their sets, track progress, and even build with friends! This deal lets you grab it for just $25, which is basically nothing for the experience the set offers. Now is a great time to bring one, or even two of these home for the little dino lovers in your life without blowing your budget. That said, there\u2019s plenty more going at a discount right now. Black Friday is over, but you can still pick everything from kitchen essentials to high-ticket items like TVs, smart home devices, tech gadgets, and more without paying the full price. Just note that most discounts are short-lived. If you see something you like, don\u2019t wait too long to grab it. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":" This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.       We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.      Tablets have become real productivity tools that make it hard to tell the difference between a casual browsing device and a serious work tool. However, the best models often cost more than $800 and have features that most people don\u2019t use. The Galaxy Tab S10 Lite from Samsung gets around this price barrier by giving you the core S10 experience in a more affordable package \u2013 as it cuts out unnecessary premium features while keeping everything you need for everyday use. On Amazon this Cyber Monday weekend, you can get one for $249 (128GB\/WiFi model) which is a great deal compared to the regular price of $349. This is the lowest price ever, so you can get premium tablet features without the flagship tax. See at Amazon Samsung put an Exynos 1380 processor in the Tab S10 Lite which can handle tough tasks without overheating or lagging like cheap tablets do after a few months of use. This octa-core chipset and 6GB of RAM work together to keep multiple apps running smoothly. You can switch between your email, streaming video, and note-taking apps without having to wait for loading screens or interfaces to respond. The 128GB of internal storage is enough for important apps and a moderate media library. However, the real flexibility comes from the microSD card slot\u00c2\u00a0which can hold up to 2TB of extra storage. Because it can be expanded, you can load up whole seasons of shows for flights, store years\u2019 worth of photos, or install big games without having to delete things all the time to make room. The 10.9-inch LCD screen is a good size for both portability and usability: It has enough space for comfortable reading and productive work without being too big like bigger tablets that are hard to hold. Vision Booster technology automatically changes the brightness of the display depending on how bright or dark it is around you. This means that you can read content whether you\u2019re outside in direct sunlight or in a dark bedroom. The battery lasts for up to 16 hours of continuous use\u00c2\u00a0which is enough for several days of normal use, like browsing the web, streaming, and playing games from time to time. This long battery life means you don\u2019t have to worry about constantly checking the battery percentage or bringing chargers with you wherever you go with your tablet. Super Fast Charging technology fills the battery completely in about two hours\u00c2\u00a0so you can charge it during lunch breaks or between meetings instead of leaving it plugged in overnight. The S Pen that comes with the tablet changes the way you use it by letting you write naturally and navigate easily which feels more immediate than just touch controls. Samsung added smart features that turn your messy handwritten notes into clean digital text, solve math problems as you write them, and even help you automatically organize your study materials. With Circle to Search, you can draw around anything on the screen to quickly search for it on the web. This gets rid of the boring copy-paste process that makes you lose your focus The Tab S10 Lite runs Android with Samsung\u2019s One UI on top of it and gives you access to millions of apps while keeping the interface cleaner than stock Android.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Investing The Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU) provides defensive exposure with one-third to one-half of returns coming from dividends. The iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) offers 4.3% yield and hedges against stock market corrections. The Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) provides non-U.S. developed market exposure at a 0.03% expense ratio.  \t\t\t\t\tSending You to Google News in 3  \u00a9 Thinkstock The current dynamics playing out in the stock market are really hard to describe right now. On the one hand, there are pockets of the economy that are red-hot, with hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into high-powered growth trends like AI that are clearly propping up valuations across the board.\u00a0 On the other hand, the vast majority of stocks in the overall market may already be in bear market territory. That\u2019s representative of a weakening consumer, and the view that valuations may have gotten a bit too distorted in the post-pandemic era.\u00a0 Forget stocks, other asset classes like real estate could be more overvalued right now relative to where interest rates are today. And while I do expect interest rates to come down, there are risks with bonds and other top securities as well, leaving few seemingly good options to park some capital right now.\u00a0 For those thinking about how to navigate this market, here are three top options to consider right now. I\u2019m going to focus on three exchange traded funds (ETFs) as ways to play the market in this piece, as these holdings should provide solid upside for passive and active investors alike.\u00a0 There\u2019s perhaps no more defensive sector in the market right now than utilities, and the\u00a0Vanguard Utilities ETF\u00a0(VPU) remains my top ETF pick for long-term investors looking to ride these trends over time.\u00a0 Sure, there\u2019s plenty of growth upside within the utilities sector that could be explored in its own dedicated article. But I think the relative value that comes from having between one-third and one-half of the returns from this sector coming from dividends is important to consider. Utilities companies are typically mature entities that benefit from very sustainable underlying cash flow growth profiles. Regulators have to approve price increases over long periods of time, providing assurances to investors that they\u2019ll get paid back. The capital-intensive nature of this industry has provided for such fundamentals, and that\u2019s one of the most attractive aspects of this particular sector worth considering. Instead of buying any one or grouping of utilities stocks alone, I prefer to play this trend via VPU. It\u2019s one of my largest ETF holdings in my portfolio for this reason, generating around 2.6% in yield right now at an expense ratio of 0.09%. Those are fundamentals I like.\u00a0 I continue to think that bonds represent a unique opportunity for investors today, and the\u00a0iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF\u00a0(TLT) is one of the best options for investors looking for portfolio protection, in my view. I continue to have the perspective that interest rates will have to trend lower over time, if not only for the fact that governments around the world who hold U.S. debt will not want to see the value of their holdings decline (and the U.S. government also won\u2019t want higher interest rates, which increases its debt servicing costs).\u00a0 With the long-term trends of lower interest rates being challenged due to inflation picking up in recent years, this may be a choppy bet. But if stocks start falling meaningfully in a correction or bear market situation, TLT is one ETF that could outperform the rest.\u00a0 The ability for investors to hedge out their interest rate sensitive exposure, and play lower rates over the long-term, in one ETF is impressive. With a current dividend yield of 4.3% and an expense ratio of 0.15%, TLT is a top option for long-term investors right now.\u00a0 Last, but certainly not least on this list of defensive ETF options for investors to consider is the\u00a0Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF\u00a0(VEA).\u00a0 I\u2019ve thought for a few years now that U.S. equities are broadly overvalued, compared to their own historical metrics. However, compared to the rest of the world, this valuation divergence is even more notable.\u00a0 What VEA does is allows investors looking to broaden out their geographic concentration in the U.S. market to other high-quality developed markets to do so. Via investing in key markets in Europe and Asia (such as Japan), VEA doesn\u2019t provide the higher-risk emerging markets exposure that may turn some investors off. Rather, this fund looks to buy non-U.S. proxies in the highest quality and most stable markets around the world.\u00a0 With a dividend yield of 2.8% (much higher than nearly any index fund tracking U.S. stocks) and a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.03%, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s not to like about holding some VEA and diversifying out some of the geographic risk associated with being all-in on one stock market. Those thinking long-term can supplement U.S. exposure with such an ETF and sleep much better at night. At the end of the day, I think that\u2019s the most valuable thing VEA and the other two picks on this list provide.\u00a0 Latest Podcast Episode Amazon Strikes Back, And A Surprise $10,000 Portfolio Buy 38 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Nov 9, 2025 Live Nov 4, 2025 I\u2019m of the view that passive and active investors alike can find value in owning exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Jonathan Ponciano is a financial journalist with nearly a decade of experience covering markets, technology, and entrepreneurship. Klaus Vedfelt \/ Getty Images  You\u2019ve spent decades building your nest egg, but how do you turn that lump sum into a paycheck that lasts? According to a 2025 Nuveen and TIAA Institute study, nearly all 401(k) participants (93%) say they want retirement plans to offer guaranteed lifetime income options, yet most 401(k)s don\u2019t.   Navigating the math of decumulation\u2014how to draw down savings without running out\u2014is one of the biggest blind spots in retirement planning. And while lifetime income tools are gaining traction, the foundation of a secure retirement still lies in a smart withdrawal strategy\u2014one that balances your need to live well today with the reality of funding a future that could last decades.   Retirement essentially flips the script on workers. \u201cAfter decades of saving, people are suddenly expected to figure out how to spend it down in a way that lasts,\u201d says Mark Stancato, founder of VIP Wealth Advisors. \u201cThere is no built-in structure, no paycheck, and considerable uncertainty.\u201d   Between market volatility, taxes, and rising healthcare costs, many retirees feel unprepared to make that shift. The lack of structure can lead to over-withdrawing in the early years or being overly conservative and losing purchasing power over time.   A strong first step to a great decumulation strategy is building a foundation of guaranteed income. \u201cWe begin by identifying fixed expenses and establishing a core income floor using reliable sources, such as Social Security or pensions,\u201d says Stancato.   From there, you can structure your income sources and assets using what\u2019s known as a bucket strategy. Short-term spending needs are covered with cash or bonds, while medium- and long-term needs can rely on equities and other growth-oriented investments, effectively giving your portfolio room to grow while still supporting your near-term liquidity needs.   For retirees looking to guarantee income, fixed annuities, which turn a lump sum into a predictable monthly paycheck for life, are often the first option considered. In fact, the Nuveen study shows that 90% of 401(k) participants would consider using fixed annuities to create a steady retirement income, and increasingly, plan sponsors are exploring ways to include fixed annuities in their 401(k) plans. However, they\u2019re not your only choice.   \u201cThere are more tools now than ever,\u201d says Stancato. Some retirement plans, for example, offer managed payout options or guardrail-based withdrawal strategies, while technology can help automate distributions and make spending more dynamic, adjusting to market downturns or personal circumstances.   You can also explore newer tools like target-date funds with income features or variable annuities with income riders, though these often come with added complexity and cost. The key is matching your plan to your lifestyle\u2014something a one-size-fits-all product can\u2019t always do.   Even with the best foundation, one of the most overlooked aspects of retirement income planning is the order in which you draw from accounts. To move your money efficiently, Stancato recommends following a tax-aware sequence: Start with taxable accounts, then move to tax-deferred accounts, and preserve tax-free assets like Roth individual retirement accounts for last. \u201cOften that tax-free bucket becomes a legacy or long-term healthcare reserve,\u201d he adds.   This sequencing helps minimize tax burdens over time and provides more flexibility to adjust as life or tax policy changes.   Turning a nest egg into retirement income requires more than just taking withdrawals\u2014it requires intention, strategy, and adaptability. \u201cThe biggest mistake people make is treating every dollar the same,\u201d says Stancato. \u201cYou need to know what each account is for and when you will need it.\u201d   A thoughtful plan that matches income sources to spending needs, tax profiles, and lifestyle goals will help you get the most from your retirement years.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":" This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.       We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.      In the premium headphone market, big names like Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats compete with each other by offering different features and prices to different types of listeners. The Beats Solo 4 is the perfect choice if you want great sound quality, spatial head tracking, and modern connectivity features without having to pay extra for active noise cancellation. This Cyber Monday weekend, Amazon has the lowest price ever on this model which competes directly with models that cost a lot more: The regular price is $199, but it\u2019s now only $129. Instead of cramming in every possible tech feature, they focused on battery life, comfort, and sound quality. See at Amazon Beats designed the Solo 4 to last up to 50 hours on a single charge which changes the way you use wireless headphones all week long. You can fly across the country several times, go to work every day for two weeks or binge-watch entire TV shows without having to look for a charging cable. The USB-C charging port has fast fuel technology that lets you play for 5 hours on a 10-minute charge when you\u2019re running late. The Solo 4 connects to both iOS and Android devices via Bluetooth so you don\u2019t have to worry about being stuck in one ecosystem if you switch between platforms for work and play. The 40mm drivers in each ear cup make Beats\u2019 \u201ccustom acoustic platform,\u201d which adjusts the frequency response to give you strong bass without drowning out vocals and instruments in the mid and high ranges. You will be able to hear the thump of kick drums and bass lines clearly while still being able to understand every word in podcasts or other content with a lot of dialogue. Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio make listening more immersive by tying sound to your device instead of your head movements. When you turn your head while watching a movie, the sound stays in the same place on the screen, just like it does in a real theater. This feature turns on automatically when you play content that works with it on Apple devices and some Android phones. To fix the comfort issues that plagued earlier Solo models during long wear sessions, Beats changed the headband and ear cushions: The very light construction spreads pressure more evenly over your head, and the soft foam cushions make a tight seal without the vice-grip feeling that gives you headaches after an hour. The on-ear design folds flat into a small shape that fits easily into backpacks or carry-on bags. The matte black finish doesn\u2019t show fingerprints and scratches as easily as glossy finishes, which show every smudge within hours of opening the box. Beats comes with a 3.5mm audio cable so you can connect to older devices that don\u2019t have Bluetooth or keep listening when the battery dies after a long time of use. This Cyber Monday deal brings the price of the Solo 4 down from $199 to $129 and puts it in direct competition with budget models that give up battery life, build quality, or platform compatibility. You\u2019re getting a high-end Beats product for less than what many mid-range brands charge, plus the brand recognition and customer service that come with owning an Apple product.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"WARNING: ALL PHOTOS FEATURING ANIMALS HAVE BEEN CREATED USING AI When scrolling through social media recently, you might have noticed posts which seem a bit\u2026 off. Grainy CCTV footage of a dog saving a child from a bear attack, a video of wild bunnies on a trampoline or a picture of a Christmas market outside Buckingham Palace. It's all AI generated and due to its low quality and its inauthenticity, it's being branded AI \"slop\". Both social media users and content creators say they're worried that AI slop flooding feeds is leading to a less authentic online experience - and is drowning out real posts. But a new trend, which sees people adding AI-generated animals to original photographs, has encouraged some content creators to embrace AI. \"I was like, that's really niche because it looks so real,\" influencer Zoe Ilana Hill says. The 26-year-old jumped on the trend after being impressed by the imaginative way another content creator had used AI, by editing some of her original photos and adding AI dogs. \"I don't want to see it [AI] as a threat to my career, I want to see it as something I can work alongside with,\" the full-time influencer says. Zoe, who has 82,000 followers, says she feels like platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are trying to \"push\" and \"force AI\" on users, and has seen her fair share of slop her own feed. But she saw potential in the AI animal trend, adding that she suspected the post would perform well as she thought social media users would \"be like, oh my God, she's holding a deer\". \"The deer is so seasonal and that is so rare to be actually able to go and physically see a deer in person,\" she says. Zoe says her post was a success - with more than 20,000 likes and comments including: \"No stop this is the cutest thing ever\" and \"this trend is adorable!!!!\" Whenever Zoe posts a photo made with AI, she likes to make it clear it's a generated image, \"there is actually a tag [on Instagram] where you can say this photo was created by AI\". \"I don't think it's fair for people to think that something's real when it's not.\" When influencers don't disclose the use of AI - it can cause confusion. That was the case with one German influencer, with 900,000 followers, posted a picture with dozens of AI dalmatians captioned:  \"just me, living my dream\". One user commented asking: \"Is it AI? I saw a post like this three times today.\"  Another replied concerned for the generated animals' welfare, adding \"there are plenty of dogs sitting in animal shelters who would like to have a nice home\". \"Hot girls have started using AI,\" wrote one X user discussing the trend by sharing animal photos from various influencers in a post viewed almost 27 million times. But not everyone sees using AI this way as harmless fun.  Another X user responded: \"They are not hot because they use AI for mindless slop that could easily be done by hand with Photoshop.\" Clara Sandell, a marketing professional and digital creator from Finland took part in the trend after she saw it \"everywhere\" and found the posts \"so cute\". \"I kind of put my own twist [on the trend], I used my spirit animals and my favourite animals,\" the 38-year-old adds. Clara posted a carousel photo on Instagram with tigers, an elk, a horse, and cats and dogs. Reaction from the photos were positive, with many labelling the post as \"chic\" and \"beautiful\". When asked if she would participate in future AI trends she replied \"depending on how cute the trend is,\" and if it was transparent so that you can \"see it's AI\" being used. For content creators looking to create high-quality images, social media consultant Matt Navarra thinks that AI makes it easier to produce \"fantastical high gloss\" and \"aesthetic\" content for influencers, \"whether it's wild animals generated, through to something that's much more believable\". Whilst some of the AI content we see online is unrealistic and evidentially not real, Mr Navarra says \"most people who are serious about being a creator or an influencer want to maintain a reputation\". He believes many creators are \"doubling down on the realness\" to give themselves a place on the feed amongst \"a sea of AI-generated content which is flooding or AI slop as it's been termed\". The consultant says he predicts 2026 will be the year of AI dominated content on social media, adding:  \"If you thought that AI animal content was quirky, I think buckle up\". But not everyone will be pleased to hear this.  Maddi Mathers, a tattoo artist from Melbourne commented \"love you but not the AI\" under the same German influencers post who created the AI dalmatians. Commenting isn't something that Maddi, who describes herself as a \"very silent social media user\" would normally do. But when the tattoo artist first saw the photo, she believed it was real before but scrolling through the posts revealed the cute dalmatians were \"obviously very fake\". \"Honestly, it's such a simple thing but it makes you feel dumb when you get fooled by AI,\" the 25- year-old explains. Maddi says such AI posts create an element of mistrust because \"there's such an importance of being true to yourself and showing your true personality\" when being an influencer.  She believes that when creators put out content that isn't real it can be \"damaging for their career\" as their audience \"won't know what to believe anymore\". AI slop isn't necessarily a bad thing - \"but the speed and volume of what we're creating\" is what concerns creative health scientist Katina Bajaj. \"When we're creating and consuming AI-generated content at such a rapid pace, we aren't giving our brains enough time to digest,\" Mrs Bajaj says. She explains that from her perspective, the solution to AI slop isn't to ban it or \"look down upon AI tools,\" but to \"prioritise and value our creative health more than generating endless content\". There is currently no requirement \"to label images that have been created or altered with AI\" on Instagram, according to Meta's policy. However, \"images will still receive a label if Meta's systems detect that they were AI-generated\". TikTok has recently launched a new tool which allows users to shape their feed - this includes being able to see more or less AI generated content. The 'Manage Topics' feature is intended to help people tailor their 'for you page' to ensure users have a range of content in their feed, rather than removing or replacing content entirely. There is a lot of AI software that can be used to make this trend, but not all can create the flawless content social media is portraying. Emily Manns, a fashion content creator from the US, didn't quite get what she bargained for when she bought multiple AI apps to join in with the trend and received \"one single rodent\" in what was meant to be an aesthetic photo. \"I don't even know what [the animal] was,\" said the 34-year-old. \"It [the photo] took like 2 minutes to load, and when it loaded, I was peeing my pants of laughter.\" The app also added an extra finger onto the influencers hand, and distorted her face. Emily says she posted the photo to her Instagram but \"deleted it instantly\" because the content wasn't engaging very well. An expert says parents need their children \"to be exposed to challenges\" in their lives. Dozens say they fell victim to companies using images of people who do not exist and false back stories. The tactics and spoils of smishing - scam texts that trick people into disclosing data - are revealed. A judge imposes a hospital order on a stalker who threatened an influencer and followed her to Bali. Sussex Police say Connor Pace drove around a Bexhill car park with his victim on the bonnet.

Long favored by royals, aristocrats, and exhausted Londoners \u2014 including myself on many occasions over the years \u2014 it embodies country life in Britain and its old-world charm. In recent years, it has become a magnet for American tourists and affluent expats. Here's what I saw when I spent a few days in the \"Hamptons of England,\" learning how American newcomers and old money are learning to live alongside one another. Curious about the Cotswolds? Read more from Joshua-Nelken Zitser's reporting trip: The townhouses and inns in Stow-on-the-Wold \u2014 built using honey-colored local stone \u2014 look like they're from a fairytale. They're a far cry from the chaos and crowds of my hometown, London. Many of the buildings in the market square, including pubs and galleries, are centuries old. The Porch House, a pub and inn, has timbers that have been carbon-dated as more than 1,000 years old. St. Edward's Church, located in the town center, was built in the early medieval period on the site of a former Saxon church, with additions made in the Victorian era. Inside, a 17th-century painting depicting the crucifixion has hung in the church for almost 200 years. The building itself is one of 98 Grade I listed buildings in the Cotswolds, meaning that it's considered to be of exceptional historic interest. It is believed to have been J.R.R. Tolkien's inspiration for the \"Doors of Durin.\" Whether or not it was, the yew trees flanking the door are a sight to behold. Tourists love posing in front of it: The Stow and District Civic Society, a local historical preservation group, calls it the \"most photographed door in the Cotswolds.\" I briefly met a Texan family, all of whom were dressed impeccably, head-to-toe in tweed, and were excited to get a photograph taken by the door. Around the market square, and down narrow stone lanes, you'll find fancy boutiques selling everything from antique furniture to the essentials for the classic Cotswolds look: gilets, tweed, and Barbour jackets. I didn't buy any of the more expensive items, but I did try some vegan vanilla fudge from a small fudge store. It was so good that I went back for more the next day. High on a hill with views of the River Windrush, the Oxfordshire town of Burford is having a renaissance. While lunch used to be mostly stodgy pub food, now, places like the Bull offer fine dining with a modern feel in the historic town. As well as remarkable views of the countryside, I learned the hard way that its position on a hilltop means getting from one end of the high street to the other requires a steady climb. Walking into the Sweet Shop in Burford is like stepping into a British time capsule. Jars of boiled sweets, packets of fudge, and other quintessentially British offerings, like lemon sherbet, line its walls. It's run by the O'Brian family. When I visited, Lauren O'Brian was behind the counter with her daughter, who was helping out after school. The Madhatter Bookshop in Burford is dimly lit, with intriguing displays of hats sold alongside the books. I never say no to a bookshop browse, and I loved the \"dark academia\" feel of this one. It felt cozy and the perfect place to spend a fall afternoon. A few doors down on Burford's main street, I peeked into The Oxford Brush Company, a store entirely dedicated to bristle brushes and brooms. This eclectic mix of independent stores is offset by a chain supermarket. The Hugo Lovage Patisserie, also located in Burford, sells luxury pastries to visitors, locals, and, according to its owner Cindy Kosmala, celebrities, too. The macarons, eclairs, and cakes looked like miniature pieces of art, and tourists wandered in and out to photograph the items on display. If Erewhon is the most upscale and luxurious place to buy your groceries in Los Angeles, then Daylesford Organic Farmshop is the Cotswolds' equivalent. It sells organic food and rustic home goods, such as sheepskin throws, caviar, tweed dog blankets. I didn't fancy spending \u00a3650 ($861) on a quilt, or \u00a345 on a beef and stilton pie. Its restaurant was one of the first in the UK to be recognized with a Michelin Guide Green Michelin Star, back in 2021. The deli counters serve fresh fish, colorful salads, and caviar. The shelves are lined with beautiful packaged condiments, such as a \u00a316.50 organic hot sauce. The drinks section sells magnums of ros\u00e9 wine \u2014 one bottle I saw cost \u00a3227. In my few visits over the years, I've rarely bought anything. I just watch well-dressed people browsing and take in the extravagance of the place. The Club by Bamford and the connected Bamford Wellness Spa are where rural life meets LA wellness trends. There are reformer Pilates classes, $300 massages, and everything from sound healing treatments to cryotherapy. The bonfire outdoors and the converted barn gave the place a rustic but fashionable feel. Diddly Squat Farm, with its long lines for the farmshop, and the Farmer's Dog, are tourist hot spots. I visited both, and left disappointed. Some companies offer tours of the sites, which provide a window into the show, as well as the history of farming in the Cotswolds. While the comparisons between the Cotswolds and the Hamptons are easy to make, with their luxury shops, high-end spas, celebrity residents, and proximity to a big city, the Cotswolds are very much their own place. There are centuries of history on nearly every corner, and the kind of charming British traditions you won't find on the eastern end of Long Island, be that having scones with clotted cream made at a local farm or cozying up in a pub with a cider brewed in the Cotswolds. This wasn't my first time visiting, and it certainly won't be my last. Jump to","label":0}

Black Friday may be officially over, but gaming deals haven't completely vanished yet. This year's discounts have been especially strong across the board, with big price cuts on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch hardware, games and accessories \u2014 and PC gamers haven't been left out either. We're still seeing some standout post-Black-Friday gaming laptop deals, with savings as high as 28% on popular lines from Asus ROG, Acer Nitro and Alienware. A quick dose of realism, though: If your upgrade plans involve adding more RAM, recent memory price jumps could complicate things. That\u2019s exactly why the remaining deals feel even more urgent, you\u2019re locking in solid specs now, before component prices drift higher. Bottom line: grab what\u2019s still in stock while you can. Once we move past Cyber Monday, the best gaming discounts are usually the first to disappear. Amazon Just because you're into gaming doesn't mean you need to drop thousands on a laptop. Acer's Nitro V lineup includes several models with varying screen sizes and computing power starting at under $600, so you can find one that fits both your needs and your budget. This one has an upgraded i7 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, 1TB SSD, 16GB of RAM and is currently sitting at its lowest price ever. Amazon This laptop is absolute overkill if all you're doing is checking email \u2014 but if you want a machine that can crush modern games, this is the one. It's not the lightest out there at nearly 6 pounds and the design isn't exactly what I'd call understated, but under the hood, it's all power: an i7 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The 1920x1200 165Hz display is icing on the cake \u2014 sharp, smooth and a standout at this price. Amazon Yes, this older Nitro V model revs down the specs a bit \u2014 but pairs that with a dip in the pricetag, too. It\u2019s still a formidable gaming competitor, with a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card, half a terabyte of SSD storage and a nearly 16-inch screen. Amazon Now we\u2019re talking: With an Intel Core i7, newish RTX 5060 GPU and 16GB of RAM paired with a full terabyte of SSD storage, this Alienware Aurora has room to grow with your future gaming needs \u2014 and at just under $1,100, it\u2019s priced right, too.

There's no question or concern over political crap like rsilvergun thinks there is. The question is more: Do you get what you pay for? And to me, this isn't a simple yes or no answer. The answer I'd give is: What degree did you get, and what did you pay for it? No matter what degree you have, I'd say that if you spent more than $150k, under any circumstance, then you got ripped off.

Pretty hard to raise a family on that pay. But you have chosen low-paying white collar jobs as your examples. I would encourage people to look at higher paying professions and get educated to do one of them. I agree that an HVAC technician married to someone who also works will have an okay combined income, but you kind of want to be able to live well on your own if possible. According to Indeed; \"The average White Collar Group monthly salary ranges from approximately $3,790 per month for Sales Representative to $7,585 per month for Account Manager.  >> $120k\/year plus bennies as an elementary school teacher Very atypical, the median salary of an elementary school teacher in Texas is about $60k. I think what we are discussing here is the prospects of a young person looking to get an education that will result in some kind of viable career path. I submit that if you train to be a plumber you are generally looking at just scraping by for the rest of your life. The national average wage of an HVAC technician in the USA is about $29\/hr. Pretty hard to raise a family on that pay.That 29 bucks an hour works out to 58k a year, assuming no overtime, which is very close to the U.S. national median of 60k across all jobs - and that's without needing a 100k in college loans. For perspective, it's slightly less than the median teacher salary (62k). The national average wage of an HVAC technician in the USA is about $29\/hr. Pretty hard to raise a family on that pay.

That extra $20k makes a big diff, and you could eventually pay off the loan. Also note that for a fair comparison, HVAC school plus room and board costs money that many people will have to borrow.  https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/loans...

[plumbingtipstoday.com] I was responding to \"The plumber in question lives in the same $multimillion gated housing development\" statement.

You seem to be getting a little angry for some reason. >> a plumber who didn't need to go to college to become a successful resident in an expensive gated community flew right over your head It is clearly way out of line with the norm. I see people here claiming that getting a blue collar education for plumbing, electrician, HVAC, etc is a good way to go, and I disagree. Those professions pay poorly and have a low ceiling. Conflating education with academic rank. Both are not the same. A detail politics likes to ignore because that enables noise-making. Indeed. People with a good education have _options_. And that means they do not have to take crap. Obviously, quite a few assholes do not like to have that type of person around. People with a good education have _options_.

They send them to very expensive schools with a lot of humanities courses so that they can be taught critical thinkingYou misunderstand what powerful people sending kids into top schools are doing.

It is almost entirely about other people that go to the same school that allows one to form critical connections that important in business and politics.

For a regular person going to a regular school this is almost entirely not applicable. It's a borderline scam, where so many jobs, even minimum wage ones, need a degree just to get past the application submission stage, that a degree is almost mandatory in many fields. A lot of it is employers transferring the cost of training to the employee. It also blows the meritocracy arguments out of the water, because a person's ability to get high level qualifications is highly dependent on their ability to pay. Not just pay for college, but to not work so much they don't have time to do extra studying  Both views are overly simplistic. The costs associated with getting a 4 year degree, on average, continue to rise faster than the cumulative benefits of having the degree, and the degrees are getting less valuable as they no longer guarantee high-paying jobs. Degrees have been further cheapened by the obvious abuse of the rich to get the degree no matter how obviously unworthy they are of having it. Conversely, just because more people are seeing degrees as not worth the cost, does not mean they have an equal  Nope. This has been the truth ever since the internet became a thing people could use. The reasons are wrong however. In 1991-1999 if you wasted your time and money on a college degree, that degree was completely worthless by the time the dotcom bubble burst in 2001. So if you learned Java, Flash, or 30 other \"new\" products at the time that have since been flushed down the toilet by Adobe, you wasted your money. The same is happening with \"AI\" now. If you jumped into the many \"AI\" stuff colleges are pushing o  Or maybe parents are tired of paying massive tuitions + room\/board for their kids to go to a worthless propaganda factory.  It doesn't cost that much to learn to be an activist. The degree isn't about \"getting a high-paid job\", it's about knowing what the hell you're doing once you get a job. Although, fair enough, it's quite plausible that not many degrees would meet that standard either. Very few degrees are actually useful and the people who take those would often be better off getting a job first and then deciding that, say, they need a degree in engineering to progress further in that job than paying to get the degree up front and then discovering there are no jobs (as a friend of ours recently has). The whole degree system has been turning into a huge scam where kids borrow vast sums of money to keep pampered academics in nice jobs. I'm an academic. I've got a good thing going here, and if you don't keep the lid on it, I might have to get a real job! I make at least half of my living emailing office hours to students, since I have a bad habit of putting them at the top of the syllabus that no one reads. Granted, it was hard work deciding which $100 textbook to make my students buy so I could read my free publisher copy to them verbatim, but that was a one-time adoption activity. And then there's that committee that meets in the printer room when me and the other member happen to be printing at the same time. In all seriousness though, \"very few degrees are useful\" is inaccurate. All high technology in society requires extensive, structured study. It is exceedingly rare to see any serious advancement at the fundamental level come from someone without extensive education. The Manhattan project, Internet, air-travel, modern medicine, robotics, industrial systems, etc., are all courtesy of someone with extensive formal study. There are non-degreed \"skilled workers\" who might take a wrench to an airplane without a degree, but you'll be hard pressed to find someone designing an airplane without a degree. Now I do agree that a lot of degrees are useless, and it can be hard to tell which ones are a good investment. Ulterior motives have crept into a lot of higher education, just like they've crept into health care. t is exceedingly rare to see any serious advancement at the fundamental level come from someone without extensive education. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Dylan Field, Evan Williams, Gabe Newell, Jay Koum, Larry Fucking Ellison, Zuck, Michael Dell, and Travis Kalanick are all dropouts to name just a few.

Igor Sikorsky, the father of the helicopter, was a dropout. Jack Northrop never went to college, though he later fo Investment is a tricky one. I'd say that learning how to learn is probably the single-most valuable part of any degree, and anything that has any business calling itself a degree will make this a key aspect. And that, alone, makes a degree a good investment, as most people simply don't know how. They don't know where to look, how to look, how to tell what's useful, how to connect disparate research into something that could be used in a specific application, etc. The actual specifics tend to be less important  No reason for the degree to move up. The job could simply provide the necessary training. The whole system is predicated on jobs relying on 3rd parties to train (be it another company or a college). Either way it's a shit system that companies like to scam. My dad used to work as a repair technician. On more than one occasion, he had enough work to take on an apprentice. Invariably, they'd quit as soon as they got useful to start their own business. Under the current system, an employer is relieved of the cost of educating the employee (and the risks that go with it) with the trade-off that they pay for the tuition via the employee salary schedule itself. Thus, a college educated worker commands a \"higher salary\" that covers the upfront education cost. If we sw  It really depends. As degrees in the US are a big business, there are many worthless degrees and many that you can get easily, making them worthless if you did it the easy way. Funny thing. The largest private (i.e. for profit) University in Germany currently has problems because many students find the degrees are not valuable and they do not learn a lot. No such problems with the regular ones. I think commercial education is just broken because of perverted incentives. This is what happens when people see a generation of kids borrowing lots of money to get a 'good degree' and then ending up struggling to find a job in And elite overproduction is a common sign of a society that's approaching collapse. Those kids believe--quite rightly given what they were told--that they deserve a much better life than they will have and won't be very happy with the existing elite telling them to retrain in making burgers. really need to have the banks and schools take loan risk then you will costs come down. Yes. Every loan should have to be co-signed by the school because they're the ones saying it will benefit the kids. If Trump had any sense he would forgive all student loans and pay them off with a windfall tax on the schools who've been raking in the money from the loans. They know they're selling a defective product and shouldn't be treated any differently to any other business that's doing so. Agreed on schools taking risks, though it should be private universities to do it first as a trial run to see what the default rate would be.  If state universities start doing it, they can just use taxpayers to bail them out. Other countries realize that free\/inexpensive higher education is actually an investment in their citizens and in their country's futures. Try looking into STEM jobs vs those with degrees. The difference is massive. We simply do not have enough STEM jobs and that was before the push for STEM... which was a gamble on technology shaking up the future economy. There are not enough jobs to go around; just as before when there was nowhere near enough farm jobs for the number of people. Industrialization made farming too productive but it also created demand for new labor. This is not the case today. Even if there was, you'd need enough consumer dem  Getting a degree does not absolve you from really learning and being good at things. I think a significant pert of the people with degrees that have trouble finding jobs did select \"easy\" ones or took it wayyyy to easy getting them.

Exactly this - whatever improvements in income they might get from their college degree will be offset by the long-term debt they get in for that degree. You do realize that public universities in the US have loads of scholarships? Plenty of people get an education \"for free\" so long as they can sustain their GPA. Those \"public\" universities have to fight like hell to keep funding just so they can be \"public\" which in some states is lucky to be 40% funded! Now is that really public when 60% is not publicly funded? It used to be more which is just one reason why costs have gone up. They also do not spend 30+% of the budget in marketing like private schools do which lowers costs.  Sadly, if the state football team does well, then funding can go up but then a lot of it still is wasted on sports! Furthermore, I don't thi  Remarkably, less[sic] than half of voters with college degrees see those degrees as worth the cost: 46% now, down from 63% in 2013. Remarkably, less[sic] than half of voters with college degrees see those degrees as worth the cost: 46% now, down from 63% in 2013. Because people without degrees are often just envious. I routinely ask my part-time students why they chose to get that degree after all. It is \"need more skills for my job\", \"no career options without that degree\" and sometimes \"I really want to know more about things\". This mostly students that are interested in IT security though, no idea how representative that is. According to the summary, lots of those who have degrees are saying these things. Be interested to see the perception in other countries with different payment systems.  If the cost was 1\/3 the current rate all else equal does this polling move? I imagine it does. It's much like healthcare in that despite all the evidence out in the world Americans treat these systems as intractable laws of nature, the costs are sky high because that's how they are and always have to be.  Meanwhile it's just basic economics that tells you why the costs keep going up and yet we take the route of \"we tried  Maybe if we weren't world fucking police we could afford free healthcare for our citizens. Of course, then the rest of the world would be wailing at us for taking care of ourselves instead. We can't win! The USA used to have vocational schools. Many of them were high schools. They taught draftsmanship, printing, auto mechanics, and other trades. There were also one and two year schools that would teach people how to be plumbers and electricians and diesel mechanics. Over the last couple decades we lost that. Instead everyone was going to work in The Service Economy. Lots of those service economy jobs were either outshored or never even existed. Thousands of people who would have been fine with a vocational  Lies. It's stupid and a waste of time. I know from experience. It's interesting that when pushed the degree-mongers always come back to 'well, a degree isn't training you to do a job, it's teaching you to think and, uh, you have fun and shit.' And you're going to pay $100,000+ for that? For $100,000 you could travel the world for years and meet a whole lot of interesting people and do a whole lot of interesting things. \"College is where you meet the friends you'll keep for life,\" That certainly didn't work. We went poof in multiple different directions. Never saw any of them again. As summarized, this is a poor question. There's a world of difference between a PhD in medieval poetry, paying full freight at an Ivy versus BS in machine learning from State. There's also a ton of difference from person to person. My master's definitely paid for itself. My nephew dropped out of a state college because he had no interest or aptitude for education. A college degree would be wasted on him as long as his career goal is professional gamer. professional gamer.But he keeps falling for that gift horse statue left on the front lawn. professional gamer. But he keeps falling for that gift horse statue left on the front lawn. Not to mention the classic chemical engineering vs gender studies argument. That said, was I really better off as an engineer than I would been as an electrician? I put in a lot of unpaid overtime that would have been time and a half. For that matter the senior board operators at the chemical plant made more than I did, but they worked rotating shifts too. 1) How many credit hours will be taught by tenured faculty vs $1000-per-credit-hour adjuncts?2) Faculty don't want to administer their departments (or other departments), so they outsource to non-educators. Work-study?  Graduate students? Nope.  Bureaucrats can't build private empires with students.3) Most textbooks are over-priced rip-offs.  Most undergraduate classes don't teach cutting edge, so older text books are fine.4) Graduate school is a special form of hell (eg https:\/\/acoup.blog\/2021\/10\/01\/...

Surely you jest!6) The university president isn't an educator, but chosen on fund-raising ability.7) The faculty and staff dream of a multi-billion dollar endowment, like Harvard (see 6).  The idea is that they can do whatever they want, college market be damned.8) Very few athletic departments make money.  Now I'm prepared to call the net expense \"advertising\".  But how many (additional) applications is the college receiving for this \"advertising\". College used to be elite. Just flunking out was prestigious; because not many could even be accepted. Now anybody can go and it's turned almost into high school; if you are connected, you can be a moron and graduate. History major?  No matter, you survived it and therefore are probably worth hiring plus you have a broad general understanding of the world, can think, innovate, and teach yourself.

An ORR spokesperson said the decision was made on \"robust evidence\" from Network Rail to guard against possible service disruption on the West Coast Main Line. Network Rail declined to comment. The fast service, which gets to London in under two hours, will still set off from Manchester Piccadilly at 07:00 on four weekdays, but will not be available to commuters. It will, instead, ferry Avanti staff from Manchester to London when the new timetable launches on 15 December. The decision means the service could run for more than 100 journeys without paying passengers on board. An Avanti West Coast spokesperson said they were disappointed with the ORR's decision not to grant access rights from December for four weekday services that they currently operated, including the 07:00 fast service from Manchester to London. The ORR also required a Sunday service which currently runs from Holyhead to London to terminate at Crewe, they added.  \"This will clearly impact those customers who already use these services,\" they said. \"However, we will still be delivering even more services across our network from the start of the December timetable, including further additional trains on our Liverpool route.\"  The spokesperson confirmed that the services being removed were: An ORR spokesperson said: \"Our decision on the Manchester-London service was based on robust evidence provided by Network Rail that adding services within 'firebreak' paths on the West Coast Main Line would have a detrimental impact on performance.  \"We identified that this service would run in one of those paths. If Avanti operates the service as empty coaching stock (ECS), ECS can be run more flexibly (delayed or re-routed) than a booked passenger service.  \"This can assist with performance management and service recovery during disruption.\" The ORR said Avanti was previously given the right to run this service from May 2025 for the duration of one timetable period only.  This was on the basis that First Lumo's Stirling services were not operating at the time but the First Lumo services are expected to begin operating during the December 2025 timetable period.  The ORR added that under the new timetable, new open access train services, run by First Lumo to Stirling in Scotland, were due to start.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"The PSVR 2 just got its steepest discount ever, and it still comes with the award-winning Horizon Call of the Mountain for free!  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The PlayStation VR2's launch price of $550 shocked the gaming world, and the Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle brought that up to $599. Just two and a half years later, that same brilliant bundle is now down to $299, making it an irresistible addition to any PS5 gamer's setup. This bundle includes the PSVR 2 headset, two controllers, and a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. It's easily my favorite game in the Horizon Zero Dawn series, and it's one of the most beautiful VR games ever created. That's particularly excellent since it's included free in the box. PSVR 2 requires a PS5 to play, but since nearly 100 million people already own one, you're likely set to enjoy one of the finest VR headsets to date without much fuss. So long as you've got that PS5, everything else you'll need is in this box. The PSVR 2 has hundreds of games to play, including big names like Resident Evil 7 and 8, Gran Turismo, Hitman World of Assassination, and many more titles you're going to love. PlayStation VR2 Horizon COTM bundle: $399 $299 at Amazon Unlock the power of your PS5 with the PSVR 2 and jump INTO your games. Horizon Call of the Mountain is included in this bundle, which ensures you get a top-notch AAA gaming experience the moment you unbox the headset, now at its lowest price ever! Price comparison: Best Buy - $599 | Walmart - $299 \u2705Recommended if: You're a PlayStation 5 gamer who is all about immersive graphics, wants a VR headset with a great OLED display, and is ready to play some of the biggest-name VR games on the market. \u274cSkip this deal if: You don't have a PS5, don't like using headsets that require a wire, or are more interested in some of the Meta-exclusive games like Batman or Deadpool. If you're choosing between the PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 3 this holiday season, there are some pretty substantial differences between the two experiences. Sony's edge is in its top-tier components, which include an OLED display, eye tracking, and advanced haptic feedback in both the controllers and headset. Plus, there are a handful of exclusive games you can only get on the PSVR 2. Aside from the Sony-related IPs you might expect (like Horizon and Gran Turismo), the PSVR 2 features games with better graphics than the Meta Quest 3 can offer since it's powered by the PS5. Some exclusive titles, like Synapse, even use the PSVR 2's eye tracking to great effect, giving you kinetic powers that you can aim with just your eyes. It's unreal! But there's no denying how good the Meta Quest 3S is, all at an even cheaper $199. To make that deal even sweeter, you don't need another console or PC to power a Meta Quest: it's a completely standalone VR console that doesn't use wires or limit your play space, and it has even more exclusive games than the PSVR 2. Meta Quest 3S 128GB: $299 $249, plus $50 gift card, free game, and more at Best Buy The Meta Quest 3S is currently on sale via multiple retailers for Black Friday, but Best Buy is one-upping the competition by throwing a $50 gift card into the mix. This free credit goes on top of a straight $50 discount, three months of Meta Horizon Plus, and a free copy of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. $140 of savings with an already-affordable VR headset? Sign me up.  Need more storage? Upgrade to the 256GB version of the Quest 3S at Best Buy to score a $70 discount along with all the goodies mentioned above (note that the included free game with this configuration is Batman: Arkham Shadow, not The Walking Dead).  Price comparison: Amazon - $249 (Gorilla Tag bundle + $50 Amazon credit) | Walmart - $249 (Batman Arkham Shadow bundle) Meta has made a name for itself in the VR space with a massive library of exclusive games. The recently released Deadpool VR can only be played on the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, and the same goes for last year's Batman Arkham Shadow. And because of the Meta Quest's popularity, you'll find tons of people to play with online. Games like Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons are perfect in VR, and with color mixed reality vision, you can even put the board on a real table and play with your headset on. The PSVR 2 only has black & white passthrough vision, which means no mixed reality content to be had. Either route you choose, though, VR gamers are eating good this year, and with steep $100 off discounts for each of these headsets, it's the perfect year to finally jump into next-generation immersive gaming!

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"                 Reading time 2 minutes        Last week, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) published a study claiming that AI is already capable of replacing 11.7% of existing U.S. labor. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly the kind of eye-popping study guaranteed to get a lot of eyes on researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work at a time of shaky faith in AI, as stockholders might want some reassurance that their AI investments are going to pan out. The report on this research is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Iceberg Index: Measuring Skills-centered Exposure in the AI Economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but it also has its own dedicated page called \u00e2\u0080\u009cProject Iceberg\u00e2\u0080\u009d that lives on the MIT website. Compared to the research paper, the project page has a lot more emoji. Where the paper on the study comes across sort of like a warning about AI tech, the project page, which is headlined \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan AI Work with You?\u00e2\u0080\u009d feels more like an ad for AI, in part thanks to text like this:\u00c2\u00a0 \u201cAI is transforming work. We have spent years making AIs smart\u00e2\u0080\u0094they can read, write, compose songs, shop for us. But what happens when they interact? When millions of smart AIs work together, intelligence emerges not from individual agents but from the protocols that coordinate them. Project Iceberg explores this new frontier: how AI agents coordinate with each other and humans at scale.\u201d The titular \u00e2\u0080\u009cIceberg Index\u00e2\u0080\u009d comes from an AI simulation that uses what the paper called \u00e2\u0080\u009cLarge Population Models\u00e2\u0080\u009d that apparently ran on processors housed at the federally funded Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is affiliated with the Department of Energy. Legislators and CEOS seem to be the target audience, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re meant to use Project Iceberg to \u00e2\u0080\u009cidentify exposure hotspots, prioritize training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Large Population Model\u00e2\u0080\u0094should we start shortening this to LPM?\u00e2\u0080\u0094claims to be able to digitally track the behavior of 151 million human workers \u00e2\u0080\u009cas autonomous agents\u00e2\u0080\u009d with 32,000 trackable \u00e2\u0080\u009cskills,\u00e2\u0080\u009d along with other factors like geography. The director of AI Programs at Oak Ridge explained the project to CNBC this way: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBasically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The overall finding, the researchers claim, is that current AI adoption accounts for 2.2% of \u00e2\u0080\u009clabor market wage value,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but that 11.7% of labor is exposed\u00e2\u0080\u0094ostensibly replaceable based on the model\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of what a human can currently do that an AI software widget can also do. It should be noted that humans in actual jobs constantly work outside their job descriptions, handle exceptional and non-routine situations, and are\u00e2\u0080\u0094for now\u00e2\u0080\u0094uniquely capable of handling many of the social aspects of a given job. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear how the model accounts for this, although it does note that its findings are correlational not causal, and says \u00e2\u0080\u009cexternal factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094state investment, infrastructure, regulation\u00e2\u0080\u0094mediate how capability translates to impact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, the paper says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolicymakers cannot wait for causal evidence of disruption before preparing responses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other words, AI is too urgent to get hung up on the limitations of the study, according to the study.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Any big red box moment is risky. And for a government disliked by millions there's peril at every turn. Now the chancellor's big choices are out there, what's the best-case scenario for Reeves and Starmer, and what's the worst that could happen next? On the positive side of the ledger, Labour MPs have gone off to their constituencies in a better mood this week. That is in large part down to the chancellor's decision to scrap the limit on bigger families getting some extra benefits. The prime minister will revel in the argument for scrapping the cap in a big speech on Monday, suggesting it's not just the right thing to do for those in need, but the right move for the economy now and into the future. He'll also make the case the Budget will help families by easing energy bills and freezing rail fares. And the long-awaited strategy on child poverty will likely see the light of day towards the end of the week. It's about as clear an example of a Labour-friendly policy as there could be - redistributing taxpayers' cash to the least well-off. One government source described it as a \"restatement of values, something that MPs wanted to see, government being more bold about what it believes in and what a Labour government is\". In other words, giving Labour MPs something many of them - not just the left-wing fringe, but government ministers like Bridget Phillipson - had argued for, has cheered them right up after months of unhappiness and anxiety-fuelled conversations about what Keir Starmer stands for and whether he is up to the job. While it's not a policy that is universally popular with the public, the decision makes it easier for the leadership to get their backbenchers on board and manage the party. But with a majority as big as they won in July 2024, it's solving a problem they ought never to have had. A reliable party is a basic for any government that wants to be effective. And it shouldn't be an issue for an administration with a huge majority. But you don't need me to remind you Labour's time in office has been eventful at best, chaotic at worst, with the leadership unable to keep its MPs in line. In the best-case scenario, the changes to benefits in the Budget gives Labour a clearer identity, an argument in the party's comfort zone that it's happy to make. From a political point of view, another government source says \"there'll be a body language change and we are going to enjoy the fight.\" If - and it is still an if - this calm can last, politics can settle down and businesses might feel more confident. The hope is that would unlock cash for the economy, despite big tax rises, big increases on welfare spending and the country's still whopping debts. After all the preparation (more on the dark side of it later), there was no big meltdown in the markets on the day. Remember, market reaction matters because the government borrows lots and lots of money from investors who want it back one day. Business leaders hope seeming stability hangs around and endless politicking ends. As one says: \"Best-case scenario is this gives stability - the government can crack on, and we see an uptick [in the economy]. It's not like other governments globally are smashing it.\" Another boss of a company worth billions told me: \"Twenty-six billion of extra tax is not normal, but I think the Budget will settle things down. We all love to criticise but maybe it is time to cut them some slack.\" The polls do not suggest for a second that the public at large is in the mood to do that. Early surveys of opinion after the Budget give Reeves's plans short shrift. More than a million people will be paying more income tax or paying it for the first time - not a traditional reason for cheer. Inflation is expected to be higher for this year than expected. And the growth in people's spending power is predicted to be \"dismal\". But for one member of the government, the best-case scenario \"has to be an uptick in the polls and a stronger message for May\", referring to a mega set of elections in Scotland, Wales and across different parts of England where Labour is roundly expected to get hammered, and Keir Starmer's job is expected to hang in the balance. The Budget has not brought that moment of jeopardy any closer, which given how rocky things have been, is a win of sorts. But one party insider grimly joked, after this week: \"The best-case scenario for the PM is that he gets to May, and then there is a failed challenge.\" What about the worst-case scenario? The ink on the Budget headlines was barely dry when along came another political fuss about a partial u-turn on expanding workers' rights. For some in the party, the timing was incomprehensible - one senior figure told me, exasperated: \"in terms of managing your party, why do it this week? You'd calmed everybody down, bond yields happy, Labour backbenchers happy, then you throw it all up in the air again!\" Separate to the Budget process, unions and business and ministers had been trying to find a compromise over how long workers would have to be in a job before getting the right to claim they'd been unfairly sacked. For some in the unions and the party, dropping day-one protection from unfair dismissal was a necessary compromise to make sure the bigger changes to workers' rights could pass through Parliament. But it has angered some on the left. A source close to the talks with the unions and business told me \"you can't grid the negotiations\" - in other words, the announcement couldn't be fitted into a neat government timetable. The partial climbdown is not likely to result in an enormous bust-up \u2013 one of Angela Rayner's steadfast allies who pioneered the wider plans said they were a \"little concerned\" rather than frothing with rage. But the spat punctures any suggestion that the Budget will end grumps and strops inside the party. And listen to this warning from another source in the Labour movement: \"It's a ludicrous thing to have done \u2013 it was a clear manifesto pledge. It's not complicated and it's made the Labour-trade union relationship more difficult and created unnecessary tension for Starmer and Reeves in the event of things tanking after local elections.\" In other words, leadership watch out. For all the political focus, the Budget is of course also a huge economic moment and it simply isn't pretty. Debt is still sky-high. Growth is predicted to be still sludgy for years, slower than expected all the way up until 2030. State spending, particularly on welfare, is going up and up. It's hard to reconcile that with Reeves and Starmer's language before and after the general election: that helping business make money and hire more people - growth - was at the top of their list. One city figure told me: \"The left side of Labour might hate business but that's what pays for the things they want - it cannot fund the triple lock, welfare, and the NHS unless the economy grows.\" Another senior business figure told me: \"I think we are bit screwed aren't we - by end of the decade we are going to spend nearly 400 billion on pensions and welfare - growth is clearly not at the top of the list.\" The minimum wage is going up. Business rates are going up for many companies. Even one union figure told me \"growth's gone as a priority\". For one city insider, there is a sense that Reeves's effort to play nice with the business community before the election had been for nothing. \"They've sacrificed any opportunity they had to really drive growth, support aspiration and build an economy around thriving businesses and entrepreneurship in favour of saving their jobs. Taxpayers and business have been betrayed and both have long memories. \"All of the pre-election talk about being the party of business and growth was bullshit. Everyone recognises that now and they won't forget.\" Government figures dispute this. Pointing to decisions on Heathrow and new nuclear, they hit back: \"If those businesses want to employ decent people in the years to come, it's quite a good idea those children don't go hungry when they are growing up.\" Starmer himself will insist the government is just as committed to growth as it's always been in his speech next week, and is likely to emphasise his desire to get rid of red tape and speed up the planning system. Downing Street insiders suggest it's bogus to suggest the new focus on child poverty means they're not interested in helping business grow any more. Multiple sources suggest Labour switching to a more traditional focus to please its party removes what sometimes felt like a contradiction - a focus on helping business make money at the same time as pursuing its own values. One former minister suggested that since the high-tax, high-spend Budget, the difference between the two parties was now as clear as it was in 1992. But in the worst-case scenario, the economy remains on a measly path. As one business leader suggested, the increase to the minimum wage and increased taxes could mean \"everyone will just not hire - there's nothing to create confidence for us when we desperately need it.\" The Treasury might hope something else turns up and the long-term picture improves, perhaps because of advances in AI, perhaps because of planning reforms, perhaps because of, who knows. But the official predictions at the moment do not make for reassuring reading. Lastly, decisions in the Budget might bash the public's trust in the government even further. That's not just because having repeatedly promised not to increase income taxes, the chancellor is doing precisely that by freezing the level where you start paying tax, breaking certainly the spirit if not the precise letter of the party's election manifesto. And Reeves also stands accused of lying about how short of cash the government really was in the run up to the Budget. Repeatedly, and unusually publicly, the chancellor talked about how changes to the financial picture would leave her with no choice but to take those pesky, difficult decisions, i.e. put your taxes up. This impression was created over many weeks, so tax rises didn't come as a massive shock to you or the markets. Some leaks were accidental. Many briefings were deliberate, including suggestions just last week that the numbers from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had come in more or less at the last moment, looking more rosy than had been expected. Here's the rub. What we now know is that the OBR, which released this information late on Friday, had weeks before told Rachel Reeves that because more tax had come in, there wasn't actually a hole in her finances after all. The Conservatives have blasted her for \"lying\" about the numbers. Downing Street has flat-out denied that. But even one Labour insider questions whether the government crossed the line: \"Everyone knows the game, but there's a line between rolling the pitch and simply misleading the public and the lobby.\" In the worst-case scenario, the very messy Budget process has damaged trust in the government even more, and given their opponents more reason to hurl accusations of bad faith and bad behaviour right in heir face. Budgets can unravel spectacularly, fall apart before your eyes. That has not happened this week. Given how bad things have been for this government in the last few months, that fact alone will be a relief. And Labour has emerged with a sharper political identity that's relieved many in its rank and file. But that's not the same as pleasing the public. The financial picture doesn't give much cheer. In the end, there may not be much economic comfort in the political comfort zone.

In a dimly lit Stanford University basement classroom packed with anxious computer science students, lecturer Mihail Eric tells the class he's going to teach them how to code without writing a single line of code. Eric's class, The Modern Software Developer, has quickly become one of the hottest Stanford CS courses this semester, which bills itself as the first attempt at a major university to embrace coding tools like Cursor and Claude. It is an unsettling time to be a computer science major, even at a school as prestigious as Stanford, knowing you will be graduating into a world where AI is getting better at programming by the day. \"It can be scary because you think your job security is being compromised, and you might get replaced,\" said Brent Ju, one of the class's dozens of students. Ju is graduating this spring and so far has no job offers. \"The market is a little tough. I am still interviewing.\" \"If you can go through this entire class without writing a single line of code, more power to you,\" said Eric, a Stanford alum who purposefully designed the course to be an antidote to the majority of classes that still ban the use of AI. A who's who of AI coding luminaries has stopped by the bucolic Palo Alto campus to guest lecture, including Boris Cherney, creator of Claude Code, and Gaspar Garcia, head of AI research at Vercel. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, will address the final class next week. On a recent morning inside the classroom, Silas Alberti, head of research at Cognition, delivered a lecture called \"The Opinionated Guide to AI Coding in 2025.\" \"I think what you learn in school has always been a little bit behind, so I'm glad that this course exists to teach the newest stuff,\" Alberti said after his lecture, surrounded by students lined up to greet him like a celebrity. \"If you learn with yesterday's methods, you are not going to be super competitive, but if you really lean into the tools, you can be a super engineer.\" The mood of the students in the class reflects the current zeitgeist of Silicon Valley, with excitement about what many consider one of the most significant technological advancements of our lifetime. But there is plenty of fear about AI rendering an expensive Stanford degree obsolete. When Eric graduated in 2016, getting a Stanford CS degree was the golden ticket. \"People thought 'I'm going to go to an elite university, and then I'm just going to be set for life and have a cushy six-figure job for as long as I want at a FAANG company,'\" he said. The number of CS students surged as tech companies embarked on a massive hiring spree. \"Meanwhile, a lot of companies that hired a lot during COVID saw that they overhired,\" Eric said. \"Now you have a surplus of young talent and also a surplus of newly laid-off, quite experienced talent.\" Making matters worse, AI is already proficient in coding and continues to improve rapidly. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said up to 30 percent of the company's code is being written by AI, while Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei predicted in March that AI had the potential to write \"essentially all\" of the company's code within a year. Ju, who says his dream job would be to work at Anthropic, says he is trying to stay positive. \"It's exciting because if the tools aren't going to replace you, but act as an assistant, it can really supercharge your productivity and make you a more effective developer,\" Ju said. \"I'm more of an optimist who leans toward that direction.\" Zach Lloyd, founder and CEO of Warp, a developer tool for agentic workflows, delivered a guest lecture last month and maintains he is still very interested in hiring CS students. \"The idea that people from a place like Stanford with a CS education won't be able to get jobs as engineers is a little overblown,\" he said, adding that knowing the fundamentals of programming is still vital to effectively using Warp or Claude. \"These tools are accelerators but not replacements yet, and the actual people who will be best at wielding them are those who have a solid foundation.\" Eric plans to teach the course again next year, though he says AI is advancing so fast that the class will likely look very different. \"People were asking me if I was concerned that by week seven, things are going to be obsolete that I talked about in week one?\" he said. \"Yes, it is a concern. So far it hasn't happened yet.\" Jump to","label":0}

Are you looking for a new luxury car? One factor you might be considering is maintenance costs. While certain brands, especially foreign ones, have high maintenance costs, many luxury brands can be affordable. Read More: Auto Experts Say Stop Buying These 4 Hybrid Cars Immediately Find Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster In this article, we\u2019ll cover the five cheapest luxury cars to maintain over ten years.\u00a0 The Lexus IS 300 has low maintenance costs. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that maintenance over ten years costs just $5,848. Similarly, there\u2019s a 15.63% chance that your IS 300 will need a major repair in the first ten years. Although maintenance costs increase over time, you can expect to spend only $265 on maintenance in the first year. With its low maintenance costs, the Lexus IS 300 could be your next luxury car purchase. Discover Next: I\u2019m a Car Expert: 3 Luxury Cars That Cost More To Fix Than They\u2019re Worth The Lexus brand is known for its reliability, which is why it\u2019s no surprise that the Lexus ES 350 also makes the list for cheap luxury cars to maintain. Over the next 10 years, expect to spend $5,926 on maintenance for your ES 350. Like the IS 300, there is a 15.63% chance that your ES 350 will need a significant repair in the first ten years, which is low compared to many other luxury brands. \u201cMany luxury cars are extremely expensive to maintain, and they tend to need a lot of maintenance, especially after the first five years,\u201d said Melanie Musson, auto industry expert with Auto Insurance. \u201cThe 350 ES does not follow that trend. It has an engine, transmission, and other working parts that are built to last. So, the 350 ES does not require a lot of maintenance, which in itself makes it cheap to maintain.\u201d The Genesis brand also has a strong reputation for durability. In fact, the average G70 owner will spend just $7,221 on maintenance over the first ten years. During those 10 years, there is a 19.65% chance that your G70 will need a major repair. G70 drivers will spend under $1,000 each year through the ninth year, making maintenance affordable. \u201cThe G70 is designed to provide many years of comfort and reliability,\u201d said Musson. \u201cThe vehicle will tend to last for well over a decade with regular maintenance, including oil changes, brake service, and fluid flushes.\u201d Musson continued, \u201cEuropean luxury cars tend to have expensive parts that make the cost of maintenance and repair quite high. Japanese and Korean-made vehicles, like the Genesis G70, are made with parts that are a lot less expensive, so repairs come with a more reasonable price.\u201d Just above the Genesis G70 in terms of maintenance costs is the Alfa Romeo Giulia. This car has an average maintenance cost of $7,241 over the first ten years. Similarly, there is a 19.65% chance of a major repair during the first ten years. Like any vehicle, maintenance costs increase over time. During the first year, owners spend an average of $322 on maintenance, which is affordable compared to many other luxury cars. Next up is the Acura TLX. Over the course of ten years, expect to spend $7,897 on maintenance and repairs, with a 21.88% chance of a major repair during that timeframe. Acura TLX owners report spending under $1,000 on maintenance during the first six years of ownership. In years seven and beyond, expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,200 on maintenance and upkeep. If you\u2019re in the market for a sleek sport sedan with affordable maintenance, check out the Acura TLX.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Choosing the right vehicle takes research, and for most shoppers, reliability is a major factor at play when it comes to selecting the right set of wheels. Consumer Reports (CR) is one of the most well-respected product reviewers online, and regularly reports on the most reliable and best-selling vehicles on the market. Of course, not all its reviews are positive. Recently,\u00a0CR noted that a well-known luxury vehicle is lacking in reliability despite the fact that it still sells pretty well. Based largely on data from past year models, CR predicts the Lincoln Nautilus will prove to be an unreliable purchase for affluent drivers,\u00a0despite being one of the brand's most popular vehicles. Between 2024 and 2025, Nautilus SUVs had a total of 10 recalls, which should be enough to alert most buyers of the vehicle's poor reliability. For\u00a02024\u00a0models, the main issues were electrical system failures that both increased the risk of engine bay fires and caused the instrument display to go black. The latter of these failures could result in drivers losing the ability to see their speedometer or any potential warning lights. A similar electrical problem also increased fire risk in the 2025 year model, which faced another recall due to an\u00a0exterior lighting malfunction that reduced visibility for the driver and made it harder for folks in other vehicles to see the Nautilus on the road. Both models also have problems detecting obstructions, and feature windows that close so forcefully they could potentially injure drivers. Regardless of a vehicle's brand, make, or model, there are always pros and cons to owning a car. Of course, the Nautilus' high number of recalls is concerning, but other reasons to rethink buying the model include its rough braking and the challenge of entering and exiting the vehicle. Edmunds reports several Nautilus owner complaints, such as a \"bad rattle coming from the back of the vehicle\"\u00a0and mechanical problems that cause the SUV to shut down in the middle of the road. The SUV's technology seems to be an issue, too, as many owners say they've had trouble with everything from the Bluetooth system not working to memory functions failing to store settings. Though, in fairness, some people love their Nautilus SUVs. Ford reported it was one of Lincoln's best sellers in 2024, selling 46%\u00a0more frequently than the previous year. Meanwhile,\u00a0S&P Global reports that the Nautilus leads the way in customer loyalty, with nearly 50% of owners willing to buy the model again. And despite users' complaints, owners stated on Edmunds that the vehicle had great gas mileage and exceptionally comfortable seats. While the Lincoln Nautilus wasn't one of Consumer Reports' least reliable SUVs, you'll still want to do your\u00a0research before making a move on this one. After all,\u00a02025 isn't the best time to buy any car, let alone a luxury SUV.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Get your hands on four of 2025's biggest games for their lowest-ever prices ahead of Cyber Monday.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When looking for discounts on the latest and greatest video games during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, many players tend to shop in major digital storefronts like Loaded (formerly CDKeys), Fanatical, Steam, or the official store of their platform of choice. However, what many don't realize is that on occasion, you can find the best deals by going with physical copies of games sold at traditional retailers. And that is precisely the case with GameStop right now, which is offering both the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions of four of 2025's biggest games for a full 50% off each, with both delivery and in-store pickup available. That list includes the hugely popular Battlefield 6 selling for just $35 at GameStop \u2014 half of its $69.99 MSRP \u2014 along with Borderlands 4, Assassin's Creed Shadows, and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (though Metal Gear is actually going for $30 at Amazon, an even lower price). These deals will only last through Sunday OR until GameStop's stock runs out, though, so take advantage before they're gone. Battlefield 6 stands tall as 2025's best-selling game, and for good reason: it's a terrific return to form for Electronic Arts' legendary multiplayer FPS series, complete with Battlefield's classic class-based structure, plenty of maps and modes, cutting-edge destruction physics, amazing audiovisual presentation, and more. Battlefield is back.\u2705 Price check:\u00a0$60.69 at Loaded\ud83c\udfae PS5 version: $35 at GameStop Borderlands 4 is the latest and biggest entry in Gearbox Software's acclaimed co-op looter shooter franchise, and an excellent game to play with your friends. Featuring a new world, a new story, four fresh Vault Hunters to play as, and a veritable ocean of loot to collect, it's a wonderful FPS, and a must-play at this price.\u2705 Price check:\u00a0$60.69 at Loaded\ud83c\udfae PS5 version: $35 at GameStop Fans have been asking for an Assassin's Creed game set in Japan for years, and earlier this year, it finally came in the form of Assassin's Creed Shadows. Journey through this open-world, action-packed adventure as both the stealthy shinobi Naoe and the legendary samurai Yasuke.\u2705 Price check:\u00a0$39.99 at Amazon\ud83c\udfae PS5 version: $35 at GameStop Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a prequel to the rest of the colossal Metal Gear franchise, and a fan-favorite classic. This new remake of the title brings it forward 20 years with a complete overhaul that modernizes gameplay, visuals, and audio, and I can't recommend it enough if you're after a tactical stealthy action-adventure experience.\u2705 Price check:\u00a0$35 at GameStop\ud83c\udfae PS5 version: $35 at GameStop      From ARC Raiders to Elden Ring, there are plenty of amazing Cyber Monday game deals out there right now. These ones from GameStop \u2014 and Amazon's even better discount on the Xbox version of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater \u2014 are arguably the best of them all, as none of these games have ever sold for lower prices than this. The markdowns on Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4 are particularly wild, as the former is the best-selling game of 2025 and an incredibly hot multiplayer title, while the latter is the year's largest co-op game and was one of the last highlights of the summer. Assassin's Creed Shadows had a big launch in spring as well, and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remakes one of the most beloved early-2000s games there is. I'd be shocked if you find any of these games selling for lower prices than this in the foreseeable future, so if one or more of these games interest you and you play on either Xbox Series X|S or PS5, you should 100% pull the trigger on one or more of these deals. Just be sure to do so ASAP, as they're going away once the weekend ends. Enjoy our content?

Though it's now best thought of as a Cyber Monday sale since Black Friday is over, GameStop's sale is scheduled to end once Sunday is over according to a social media post from the retailer. However, these deals will also disappear once GameStop runs out of stock, which could happen even sooner. Therefore, it's best to pull the trigger sooner rather than later. Cyber Monday\u00a0starts on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025, but, as with Black Friday, it has already begun appearing as the theme for deals at certain retailers. While its discounts are generally restricted to the day itself, some deals may extend into Tuesday and beyond. Cyber Monday has already started on Amazon US, with its promotional messaging shifting away from Black Friday in the early hours of Saturday morning, on November 29, 2025, and is expected to last until the end of Monday, December 1, 2025.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"The KTC 27 5K monitor gives Apple's $1,400 Studio Display a run for its money, with the same pixels and screen size but at a much more affordable price.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Black Friday weekend is well and truly upon us, and for a long while I've loved 5K monitors. I love high-resolution displays, as I think Windows and text looks best when rendered at 5K. Unfortunately, most 5K monitors are very expensive, at least, that was the case until now. You can now grab yourself a brand-new 27-inch 5K monitor for just $569. That's for the KTC 27-inch 5K monitor, which offers the same size and resolution display as the Apple Studio Display, but at an almost $1000 discount. You can buy two for the price of one Apple Studio Display, and still have some left over! This 5K monitor features a 27-inch IPS display with 400 nits of brightness, a dual 2K 120Hz mode, and 65W power delivery. For just $535 you're getting a whole lot of monitor for your money with this deal.  5K monitors have become something of a unique but popular market in the last few years. While most people opt for a 4K monitor, 5K monitors have been reserved for creative professionals or people who just want text and images to look as crisp as possible on their display. 4K monitors are great, but they often result in Windows and macOS having to display icons and text at a not ideal rendering scale. With a 27-inch 5K monitor at 217ppi (pixels per inch,) Windows will scale at 200% natively, and macOS will also scale at its native resolution too. That means text and images look even crisper than usual, and the OS's run better as a result. Just as comparison, Windows will usually render at 150% scaling on a 4K monitor. This is mostly fine, but Windows and visuals just look better at 200%. The KTC 5K monitor itself is also packed full of features. It has a 5K (5120x2880) 60Hz mode, but also a 2K (2560x1440) 120Hz mode. So if you wanted to use the monitor for gaming or wanted a higher refresh rate for whatever reason, you could swich the monitor into 2K mode and experience Windows and gaming at a much smoother frame rate. It has built-in 65W Power Delivery, which means you can plug in a laptop with USB-C and send charge to it to keep it alive when using it with the external monitor. It also has HDR 400, though it is only an IPS display so don't expect the screen to be as bright as an OLED monitor is. Unfortunately, there aren't any 5K OLEDs on the market right now, so IPS is the best we're going to get, and for $535 I think this is one hell of a monitor. You get a lot for your money, including a 217ppi display that most people haven't experienced before. A 5K monitor has more pixels per inch (PPI) compared to a 4K monitor at the same display size. The more pixels, the more information and definition can be shown to the user. A 5K monitor will make icons, text, images, and app windows and corners look sharper. Technically yes, a 5K monitor will drive the graphics driver harder than a 4K monitor. However, most modern PCs won't flinch at this added workload. The only time it may become noticeable is in gaming, as 5K gaming is still very demanding. Luckily, this monitor has a 2K mode so you can drop the resolution for gaming scenarios.

But according to Lamia, when we use denial to defend ourselves or cope with what we feel, we contradict the reality of a situation or attempt to adjust to a circumstance by neglecting its impact. However, the extent of someone\u2019s denial may not really be the issue at hand.  \"What\u2019s important is not that people recognize their denial, but that they are able to accept what they are feeling that leads to the denial in the first place,\" Lamia explained. \"If someone excessively and habitually uses\u00a0alcohol\u00a0to medicate their\u00a0anxiety, for example, we might emphasize their attempts to dismiss the harm\u00a0that their use of alcohol will cause, rather than focus on the emotions they feel that motivate their denial. If that person stops drinking, one would hope the emotions that were formerly hidden by denial, which often have to do with\u00a0shame, would be exposed and accepted by the individual.\"            theschoolofsocialvalue    Report   We not only use denial to hide from any negative emotion, including shame, fear, guilt, or distress but to mute positive emotions as well. \"Sometimes feeling positively may be just as threatening as negative feelings. We may want to deny the reality of our emotions, because accepting a reality that is uncomfortable, painful, or incongruous to what we expect means we must also alter our perception of ourselves. Thus, if you are in denial, perhaps you are simply trying to ignore the truth about what you actually feel, rather than about what you are doing or thinking.\" But if you want to move forward, you have to swallow the truth.            hard.pills.to.swall0w    Report              awkwardpotatoo    Report              mgrayv11    Report              rexxar-tc    Report              xrancorx    Report              Nickard    Report              petey_public    Report              heratiio_sherwood    Report              -eDgAR-    Report              dairyfreediva    Report              Stanzeil    Report              supportivefathers    Report              SiepieJR    Report              istherenofuckingusernameleft    Report              joemamma474    Report              TheLloydGross    Report              AlrightyAphrodite99    Report              wholesomememesplz    Report              Charming_Preference    Report              Vovvy    Report              TheSanityInspector    Report           You Might Also Like: \"\u201cMakes Me Physically Cringe\u201d: 22 People List Beauty Standards That Need To Retire\"    digitaldegenarate    Report   Anyone can write on Bored Panda.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"AI infrastructure demand strains global supply chains already operating near limits  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Meta is reported to be in advanced discussions to secure large quantities of Google\u2019s custom AI hardware for future development work. The negotiations revolve around renting Google Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) during 2026 and transitioning to direct purchases in 2027. This is a shift for both companies, as Google has historically limited its TPUs to internal workloads while Meta has relied on a wide mix of CPUs and GPUs sourced from multiple vendors. Meta is also exploring broader hardware options, including interest in RISC-V-based processors from Rivos, suggesting a wider move to diversify its compute base. The possibility of a multibillion-dollar agreement caused immediate market changes, with Alphabet\u2019s valuation climbing sharply, putting it close to the $4 trillion mark, while Meta also saw its stock rise following the reports. Nvidia\u2019s stock declined by several percentage points as investors speculated about the long-term effect of major cloud providers shifting their spending to alternative architectures. Estimates from Google Cloud executives suggest a successful deal could allow Google to capture a meaningful share of Nvidia\u2019s data-center revenue, which exceeds $50 billion in a single quarter this year. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The scale of demand for AI tools has created intense competition for supply, raising questions about how new hardware partnerships could influence sector stability. Even if the deal proceeds as planned, it will enter a market that remains constrained by limited fabrication capacity and aggressive deployment timelines. Data center operators continue to report shortages in GPUs and memory modules, with prices projected to rise through next year. The rapid expansion of AI infrastructure has strained logistics chains for every major component, and current trends suggest that procurement pressures may intensify as companies race to secure long-term hardware commitments. These factors create uncertainty around the actual impact of the deal, since the broader supply environment may limit production volume regardless of financial investment. Analysts caution that the future performance of any of these architectures remains unclear. Google maintains an annual release schedule for its TPUs, while Nvidia continues to iterate on its own designs with equal speed. The competitive landscape may shift again before Meta receives its first large shipment of hardware. There is also the question of whether alternative designs can offer longer operational value than existing GPUs. The rapid evolution of AI workloads means device relevance can change dramatically, and these dynamics show why companies continue to diversify their compute strategies and explore multiple architectures.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"A Steam Deck with more storage for games is automatically a better Steam Deck, so take advantage when there are deals to be had.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  You don't need me to tell you that video games are taking up more storage space than ever before. So when Black Friday rolls around, it's a good time to upgrade. In the case of the Steam Deck, it's the number one upgrade I recommend. I bought a 256GB Steam Deck and received it in the earliest batches, and it didn't take long to need more. My SSD of choice \u2014 the Crucial P310 \u2014 is reduced right now, with 1TB down to $84.99 at Amazon, or you can get 2TB for $129.99 also at Amazon. Crucial is a respected name in storage, and the P310 is about the best value SSD upgrade you could make to a Steam Deck, ROG Ally, or any other handheld gaming PC that uses the m.2 2230 form factor. With read speeds of up to 7,100 MB\/s it's leagues better than trying to make do with a microSD card to hold your games on your handheld.  There's not much that needs saying. If you don't have 1TB or more already in your handheld gaming PC, then this is the upgrade to make. It's good for the Steam Deck, it's good for the ROG Ally, it's good for the Xbox Ally, and any other handheld that uses the m.2 2230 form factor SSD. The Crucial P310 is a strong performer, with read speeds up to 7,100 MB\/s. Chances are it could even be a little faster than the stock SSD in your handheld, even if not by much. There's also the fact that at this price, this is also about the cheapest upgraded SSD you could put in a Steam Deck, so it gets extra points for that. We have guides on upgrading the SSD in the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally, and the Legion Go to help you on your way. But all you need is a little patience, and a screwdriver. The Steam Deck is probably the most involved process from the software side, but the results are well worth it. The alternative is to use a microSD card. Sure, these are cheap, but they're also slow. For lighter games, this option isn't so bad. But you don't want to be loading Cyberpunk 2077 from a microSD card! Cyber Monday starts on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025, but, as with Black Friday, it has already begun appearing as the theme for deals at certain retailers. While its discounts are generally restricted to the day itself, some deals may extend into Tuesday and beyond. Cyber Monday has already started on Amazon US, with its promotional messaging shifting away from Black Friday in the early hours of Saturday morning, on Nov. 29, 2025, and is expected to last until the end of Monday, Dec. 1, 2025.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"If you\u2019ve gone looking for a memory upgrade lately, you\u2019ve probably noticed that RAM prices have shot up, seemingly overnight. What was once the most affordable part of any PC build has become a weird luxury item, allegedly thanks to AI data centers hoovering up an unprecedented share of global DRAM supply. With high-bandwidth memory consuming wafer starts and manufacturers redirecting stock toward enterprise contracts, DDR5 prices have risen high enough that many people are questioning whether they actually need those extra gigabytes. Fortunately, RAM upgrades aren't the only additions to your PC that can deliver meaningful improvement, especially if you're already at or above the 16 GB mark. DDR4 RAM might not be your first choice, but it still has a few advantages that make it relevant in 2024 Storage is one of the easiest upgrade \"Ws\" you can grab, especially right now. It's speculated that the rising cost of DRAM could eventually spill over to flash storage, but for now, that doesn't seem to be the case. Fast, high capacity storage can be a game changer for a system that doesn't have much of it. It can completely transform how quickly your system boots, loads apps, and compiles shaders. Even adding a second drive specifically for games or scratch files can make your system feel more responsive while offloading work from your primary disk. If your system is dropping into swap space a lot because of your lack of RAM, getting a really fast disk to handle swap might not be a permanent fix, but it's one that can hide that deficiency a bit better than other upgrades might. PC upgrades don't come cheap, but some of them are simply not worth the premium  Unless you're already at the end of your upgrade path, upgrading your CPU to something within platform doesn't only dodge the potential requirement for new RAM (if you were to go from DDR4 to DDR5), but it's probably more influential than additional memory as well. If you're a gamer on AM4 and you don't already have a Ryzen 7 5800X3D, now might be a good time to make the jump, for example. The gaming gains you'd see from that will almost always be more significant than more RAM, unless you're severely limited. It might be the end of the line for your trusty ol' CPU If you\u2019re coming from a last-generation or older card, a GPU upgrade often produces more real-world impact than a memory upgrade ever would. GPU pricing has been relatively stable even as DRAM has spiked, but that might not be the case for long. A graphics card could not only be cheaper than a new kit of memory, but will also be way more influential for your performance. Many games are GPU-limited long before they\u2019re RAM-limited, so it\u2019s often a more sensible way to spend your money. You can always revisit a RAM upgrade when prices come back to Earth, and if you're on a budget, looking at the pre-owned market might be the best way to get the most out of your money. Don't push them into retirement just yet  While RAM prices have climbed, monitor prices (especially for OLED and high-refresh rate options) have been trending downward. A display upgrade changes literally everything you do on your PC, from gaming to all kinds of productivity. If you really want to feel a new upgrade, a monitor is probably the one that will make the biggest difference in your day-to-day usage. The jump from an old 144Hz TN panel to a 240Hz IPS (or OLED if you can really splash the cash) is one of the biggest jumps one can make for a PC setup. OLED deserves the hype, and the asterisks are starting to get removed  If you want an upgrade that costs nothing, undervolting is one of the easiest ways to get it. A well-tuned undervolt on your CPU or GPU can dramatically reduce temperatures, fan noise, and power draw while keeping the same (or even higher) level of sustained performance by avoiding thermal or power throttling. Modern GPUs can sometimes run dozens of watts lower with no performance loss, turning a hot, loud machine into something far smoother and quieter. CPUs benefit too, especially on laptops or small-form-factor desktops where sustained boost is limited by thermals. The best part is: it costs absolutely nothing to perform an undervolt besides a little bit of time, and there isn't the same sort of risk to the longevity of your hardware like there may be with overclocking. Less voltage is more when it comes to modern components DRAM prices won\u2019t stay high forever. As AI data centers stabilize and manufacturers scale up HBM and DDR5 production, consumer markets should eventually see relief. Until then, these upgrades offer a far better value than paying inflated rates for memory. When RAM pricing resets, you\u2019ll be in a much better position to upgrade on your own terms. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved  Xda land of undervolting, you missed out turning on resizable bar, every other article bangs on about it. Upgrading a CPU can mean upgrading the motherboard as well, which might mean upgrading RAM as well.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"A new great budget competitor to rival Moza? Direct drive wheels, which transmit the forces experienced by your car in sim racing games to your hands without the use of intermediaries like cogs or belts, are experiencing something of a golden age. Pretty much every major manufacturer has now made the jump to producing these high-end wheel bases, offering a significant step up in dynamism and realism at increasingly mainstream prices. That includes well-known names like Logitech, Corsair (Fanatec), Thrustmaster and Turtle Beach, but also includes specialist firms like Moza which have disrupted the market with their huge ranges, well-developed software ecosystems and great value offerings.  Now, Shenzhen-based PXN is attempting to pull the same trick, launching a salvo of PC-only wheel bases, wheels, pedals and bundles at aggressive price points. I've been testing their top-end VD10 10nm wheel base and their W CS R2 and W DS R2 wheels to work out whether this relative newcomer has carved out an advantage over the giants of the space, and whether they have the potential to join or even challenge Moza as disruptors. The PXN VD10 is a relatively low-profile wheelbase versus others with a similar 10Nm rating, which counts as comfortably mid-range in the direct drive market. (Entry-level models tend to be around 4-6Nm, while high-end models top out around 25Nm from what I've experienced thus far.) The modest 258x125x125mm dimensions make the VD10 easy to hard-mount into your sim rig with two or four bolts, or clamp to a desk, with both mounting options available in the box.  In terms of design, there's relatively little of note - the VD10 features a familiar aluminium alloy shell, with grooves cut in to aid heat dissipation. Wheel rims mate easily via the quick release mechanism on the front, while the back contains a laptop-style external power input, three USB-C ports for connections to accessories like pedals or shifters, if used, and a USB-C output that connects to your PC. (No consoles are supported, though using an external adapter ought to make this possible.) An on\/off button sits on the back, but there's no easily accessible emergency stop button, which is a disappointment. The whole unit weighs around 7.4kg, a touch above the similarly powerful Moza R9.  The 330mm W CS R2 and 300mm W DS R2 wheels are a bit more interesting to look at, with nice and clunky magnetic paddle shifters on the back, a pair of analogue paddles below them, and a good selection of face buttons, sticks, dials and other inputs up front. The CS is the more authentic-looking of the two, with wider and squatter backlit buttons, while the DS wheel's smaller buttons are rendered in white plastic sans backlighting. The CS is also noticeably wider on the whole and uses a full circle design better for rally and drifting, versus the DS with its more middle-of-the-road D shape.  These differences aside, the overall build quality and construction is similar, with structural metal, stitched faux leather rims and plastic used most other places. There's a definite step up in quality between these rims and something like the Fanatec GT DD Pro's more plasticky construction, and for the money I don't have any substantive complaints.  The PXN software package is relatively well-developed, with an overall layout and vibe that reminds me of Moza's Pit House. Like that software, a main page displays all connected peripherals, with settings for the wheel base, rim, pedals and other accessories showing up in dedicated sections. There are tooltips to explain what each setting does, but I'd still like to see more detailed explanations to get a better idea of what I should change on a per-game basis.  There are also areas to update the firmware of connected devices and see which games are supported. Firmware updates to the base and wheels added support for SimHub, a third-party program that can take over from the PXN software to unlock some extra functionality and better compatibility with games. I used this to get the wheel's LED shift metre to work in Assetto Corsa Evo, for example, and this worked well with minimum fuss.   You also get the rare ability to get a digital driver's display on your phone, with the software producing a QR code for you to scan, which leads to a webpage with your live data. If you can mount your phone somewhere within eyeshot, this is a nice alternative to having to spend for a dedicated sim racing display.  The only real complaint I have here is the game support. F1 23 is listed on the games page as a supported game, but I still had to set all of my buttons manually when first loading into the game, which for a button-heavy game like F1 is a bit of a process to go through. I'm not sure if having a preset requires game developer involvement, but just be aware that this is a downside to going with PXN over longer-established players like Logitech, Thrustmaster or Fanatec.  Following a straightforward hard-mount onto my usual Next Level Racing GTTrack cockpit, I had plenty of fun testing out the wheel base and the two rims, with the bulk of my time spent in Assetto Corsa Evo and F1 23. As the wheel and rims are PC-only, I didn't spend any time on consoles.  The level of force feedback is immediately evident in Evo, where the ridges of a kerb, a bump in the road or the loss of traction under high-speed cornering or heavy braking is immediately obvious. I'm still a novice to manual shifting, but the paddles here felt well-tuned and provided plenty of tactile feedback. I found the buttons on the DS a little tricky to reach, especially when wearing gloves, but the CS was a bit better with its wider buttons and more sensible arrangement for the four face buttons in the top right. The inclusion of a four-way stick made navigating menus easy, and the brake bias and traction control dials were nice and accessible for per-corner changes if desired.   F1 23 is a little less developed in terms of the force feedback it provides, but with a few menu tweaks I was hitting within several tenths of my best lap times with the (significantly more expensive) Moza R9 or Logitech G Pro Racing setups that I've spent the most time with. Again, I found the DS a little more awkward when accessing controls like the Multi Function Display, which allows you to set your next tyre compound or change brake bias. However, you can also accomplish these using one of your two dials (eg brake bias) or by holding a button to give a voice command to your AI engineer (eg change next tyre), so this wasn't a deal-breaker - and the smaller diameter of the DS made it feel a little easier to turn.  Shifting is something that you'll be doing a whole lot in an F1 game, and this felt pretty good on both rims - maybe not quite as nice as on the Moza GS V2P GT wheel, but totally fine for my purposes. Having analogue paddles below is also key for F1 games, where you'll want to use at least one for shifting on standing starts.  Overall, the level of force feedback fidelity and the quality of the wheels was on par with Moza wheels at a similar price, and a tad better than the likes of Turtle Beach. I found the best results at middling levels of torque - say 6Nm. Moza still holds an advantage in terms of tweakables, with better-explained and more granular software controls, but PXN came closer overall than I expected.  The PXN VD10 and the CS and DS wheels are genuinely decent options at their (currently reduced for Black Friday) price points, offering a good experience right out of the box, easy-to-use (if slightly limited) software and good build quality. The direct drive motors deliver detailed force feedback and provide a clear advantage over cheaper cog and gear-driven alternatives like the popular G29\/G920, though you don't get quite the same level of granular tuning or wide game support as on Moza, Fanatec or Logitech products. The ecosystem is also relatively small at present, with only a handful of rims and wheel bases, but with a shifter, handbrake and button box available, there are at least the most essential accessories.  Overall, I'm impressed with this opening outing from PXN, and it'll be fascinating to see how their offering develops over time. Moza has proved that it is possible to improve force feedback fidelity, game support and software tuning over time, and if PXN follows a similar trajectory they could become a good value alternative.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"A question of memory. The price of RAM, the quick access source of memory in a computer, is currently soaring. Prices have more than doubled in two months and show no sign of slowing down. They've risen so sharply, in fact, that some shops have stopped printing price labels so they can alter the prices daily, as though they were market traders selling freshly caught fish. This problem is likely to affect us all in gaming - it isn't only a PC gaming issue. Yes, obviously it will be more expensive to build and upgrade a PC, but the rise in prices also causes problems for Valve's upcoming Steam Machine as it enters full production. Consoles aren't safe either; there's already talk of Microsoft raising Xbox prices in response, and even companies with large RAM stockpiles won't be safe forever. What's more, the component crunch isn't an isolated issue. RAM is the acute problem right now but SSD storage prices are on the rise, and graphics card prices, though more stable than they have been in previous years, remain high. These are all connected things. And if the prices continue to rise, they may push gaming beyond the reach of many people's expendable incomes. There are a few reasons, but the biggest current driver of change is everyone's favourite technological development, AI. Tech companies need RAM to power their AI platforms, so as these platforms continue to grow, so does the demand for RAM. The price of RAM has been increasing since the spring, but it was turbocharged at the start of October when colossal AI company OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, announced a deal with two of the world's largest producers of memory chips - Samsung and SK hynix. This deal will see Samsung and SK hynix provide memory to OpenAI for its huge Stargate data center initiative, which will effectively result in OpenAI commandeering 40 percent of the world's RAM output. The response? Panic buying, as companies rushed to fill their RAM reserves, which only drove prices higher. It didn't help that RAM manufacturers generally had smaller reserves to begin with because they'd produced a surplus during Covid when demand was higher, as people transitioned to working at home. Recent tariff ridiculousness - mostly between the US and China - also made matters worse, disrupting supply lines and undermining confidence as companies waited to see what would happen next. As respected tech reporter Moore's Law is Dead said in a video: \"It's a perfect storm of unpreparedness, panic, and greed.\" On a surface level it means buying RAM for a PC will be more expensive. The newer generation DDR5 RAM is particularly expensive. Our tech reporter Will Judd tells me the 32GB DDR5 RAM he uses to test most of his builds increased from \u00a388 to \u00a3222. At the higher end of speedy 64GB DDR5 RAM, you can find prices as high as \u00a3735 (up from \u00a3228!) making it more expensive than a PS5 Pro, especially at its current discounted rate. The knock-on effect is companies that make gaming devices that use RAM, which is pretty much all of them, have to put their prices up to compensate. Case in point: PC-builder CyberPowerPC did exactly this yesterday, warning of a price increase in December because of \"market conditions\". How much a company will be affected depends on how large their RAM reserves are - their stockpile, which presumably they bought at a cheaper price. As Moore's Law is Dead said, Sony seems to be well stocked, hence the company's ability to drop the price of PlayStation 5 for Black Friday and to introduce a cheaper PlayStation 5 model exclusively for Japan, which has apparently quadrupled sales in the region. Nintendo is also suspected to be well stocked, having presumably bulked RAM reserves ahead of the Switch 2 launch this year. But Microsoft is rumoured to have low levels of stockpiled RAM, so may feel the sting of rising prices soonest as it goes out to buy more. Will that then be absorbed by Microsoft as it tries to keep Xbox prices down, or will it be born out in the end-user price? There's a question mark over Valve and its approaching Steam Machine. Valve will not subsidise the cost of the machine as console manufacturers typically do in an effort to establish an installed base to sell games to, meaning the Steam Machine will much more closely reflect the price of the individual components. Valve presumably has a big enough stockpile for an initial production run, but how soon will it need more RAM that it will pay exorbitant prices for? Is this enough of a problem that it may delay the release of the Steam Machine? Given that AI demand is the driving force behind these inflated RAM prices, those prices will presumably remain high as long as tech companies invest heavily in AI, which they are currently doing. That's where the big money is so that's why everyone wants a piece of it. But there is talk of AI being a bubble that might burst, although whether or not that will bear-out, or when, is of course unknown. It's also worth noting that exacerbating factors such as tariffs and the general cost of living continue to burden the market. They are the reasons we've seen unprecedented price rises across this generation of consoles, after all - this is the first generation in memory where the price of consoles has actually gone up since launch. We're much more used to seeing prices and sizes of consoles shrink alongside the components in them, though this is harder to achieve now than it used to be. Just as it took many things to drive the prices up, it will take many things to bring them back down again. That's also assuming, of course, memory manufacturers will want to aid that. As it stands, they're making a lot of money from this, because large tech companies have a lot of money to throw around. AI and crypto mining have driven huge profits for companies which make components you need for them. Take Nvidia as an example: its share price has erupted like a volcano in the past five years, making it the most valuable company in the world today. Why would a company that's benefiting enormously from scarcity, coupled with high demand, seek to change that? That's the bigger question, because why try and launch a new console and establish an installed base for it if you're looking at prices most people will struggle to be able to afford? The only way to achieve lower prices would be to subsidise the machines heavily and take a financial hit, but why do that if you are Sony or Nintendo, whose consoles are both selling at record rates? Microsoft arguably has the biggest incentive because it has ground to gain, but we've already seen the company step back from the either-or approach to consoles and start publishing Xbox games on PlayStation instead; hardware dominance doesn't seem as important to Xbox any more. It would make more sense for a company like Sony, which is in a dominant position with PlayStation 5, to simply wait. To extend this generation of gaming even further, and continue selling and developing for PlayStation 5, all while waiting for the component market to settle down, assuming it ever does. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. Late-generation development has historically resulted in some wonderful games, because dev tools and engines and processes are well established at that point, and because there is a larger installed base to sell to. Less dev upheaval plus greater potential rewards is a convincing argument. The rising price of RAM is about much more than the rising price of RAM, then. It's about strangleholds and monopolies and individuals being overlooked as hungry tech companies stampede towards AI dominance. It's also yet another disruption in a generation of gaming that is undergoing seismic, fundamental changes. \"The role of the console is shifting,\" I heard from experts recently, and this is perhaps one more shove on its way.

Leavenworth is a traditional European Christmas market that plopped itself right on the west coast of the United States.\u00c2\u00a0 Half a million lights glow across the village from November to February, and the whole town takes part in caroling. Plus, they make one heck of a gl\u00c3\u00bchwein, which is a type of hot German wine that pairs perfectly with holiday shopping. Bethlehem does NOT come to play! The town was literally named on Christmas Eve in 1741, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been acting accordingly ever since. Expect a massive Christkindlmarkt full of artisans and pretzels, a live Advent calendar (yes, that exists), and Moravian stars hanging from every other building. McAdenville prides itself on becoming a gorgeous, glowing wonderland every holiday season. And no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not some ordinary lightshow: over 500,000 lights cover the town, leading people to drive from all over the Southeast just to roll slowly through town. This place is practically a postcard come to life. In fact, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen a gorgeous, snowy New England photograph, none would be surprised if it really was a picture of Stowe. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the mood for snowy mountains and sleigh rides, this is your next stop. If you want Christmas with a side of wine tasting, welcome to Fredericksburg.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Simply the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy right now  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you\u2019re looking for a new Bluetooth speaker, the pure volume of choice can be overwhelming. Whether you\u2019re searching for a small, portable option or a big booming party speaker, I\u2019ve collected my definitive list of the best Bluetooth speakers money can buy. I\u2019ve personally tested every single Bluetooth speaker model on this list, as well as a huge portion of their competitors \u2013 more than 30 models have gone through my rigorous testing process. And it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of budget you\u2019re working with \u2013 I've got everything from impulse budget buys up to a speaker that can power an actual concert. I've analytically listened to hours of music, exhausted each of their features, assessed all aspects of their design, and directly compared all the options to their key competitors. I undertook this effort at the music testing space at TechRadar's reviewing lab \u2013 a controlled environment for assessing audio quality, and the ultimate location to craft my guide to the best Bluetooth speakers around. Below, you'll find my number one overall pick for most people, as well as my other picks for the best models to buy right now with different price brackets in mind. Within each entry, I've included the official prices of the speakers, but also a target price. This indicates how much I think you should aim to pay for these speakers in the real world, where prices are regularly lower. Our expert review:  Why you can trust TechRadar     We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.  \u2705 Unbelievable sound quality in a highly compact model: I was blown away by the Clip 7\u2019s impactful yet regimented bass response, but also its clear midrange performance and expressive treble. For its size, the Flip 7 offers a beautifully balanced, cohesive, and dynamic listen that made me want to bump my tunes for hours on end. \u2705 Top-tier durability and waterproofing: With an IP68 rating, the JBL Flip 7 isn\u2019t just fully dustproof, but it\u2019s also able to survive being dunked in 1.5 meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. It has a drop-proof design and is scratch-resistant, making it an extremely hardy speaker indeed. \u2705 Unbeatable value for money: For its mid-range price, the JBL Flip 7 is incredibly talented. I was wowed by its sonic capabilities, especially in the bass department, but it also has a great set of features, admirable battery life, and a rugged design. I also love the JBL Charge 6 for similar reasons, but the Flip 7\u2019s unbeatable value for money helps it take top spot. \u2611\ufe0f More than 1,300 reviews per year\u2611\ufe0f 17 years of product testing\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours of testing tech\u2611\ufe0f Read TechRadar's review guarantee For more than a year and a half, I've served as a resident Reviews Writer here at TechRadar, where I have a particular focus on audio tech. I\u2019ve tested some of the best noise-cancelling headphones, best soundbars, and, of course, the best Bluetooth speakers on the market right now. I built this guide from the ground up after testing a range of speakers against one another. I\u2019m talking everything from small budget options up to premium, towering party speakers. The vast majority of the models that I\u2019ve tested haven\u2019t made the cut here \u2013 after all, I re-tested more than 30 in my quest to provide you with the definitive Bluetooth speaker guide! Our expert review: I\u2019m going to kick off the full-list with my choice for the best ultra-cheap Bluetooth speaker. Yes, the JBL Go 4 is the ideal pick for anyone looking to spend less than $50 \/ \u00a350. I love the fact that it can supply punchy, clear audio, even through such a tiny form. Even when I played a few of my favorite house tracks, I was surprised with the bass weight the Go 4 could muster up. And when you combine that with a waterproof, durable build and feature-rich companion app, you\u2019re getting a ton of bang for your buck. I was pleased to see that the Go 4 provided all the necessities. Its nifty companion app opens up EQ adjustment and stereo pairing (if you\u2019ve got another Go 4), and I was even able to pair it to other JBL speakers using Auracast. PlaytimeBoost can also provide a few more hours of listening, which you may need, given the speaker\u2019s fairly limited battery life. Of course, when a speaker is this small, it isn\u2019t going to blow you away in the audio department, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Go 4. I tried listening to a range of tracks, including bass-heavy bangers, and this mini model performed well across the board. I experienced decently punchy low-end replication and clear vocals, though there is some noticeable compression at higher volumes. Something I always appreciate from JBL is its effort to create speakers in fun colorways, which makes a model like the Go 4 stand out from the crowd. It also has IP67 dust and waterproofing, making it both an eye-catching and durable pick. The small loop can fit on a hook or similar too, which is pretty convenient.  Sure, if you spend a little more, you could grab the better-sounding JBL Clip 5 \u2013 and non-US readers could even grab the Edifier ES20 for a similar cost. But if I had a strict sub-$50 budget, I\u2019d buy the Go 4. It\u2019s ultra-compact, but still sounds pretty strong. It\u2019s got plenty of features to play around with, and it's well-protected against the elements. All in all, that\u2019s very tempting. Our expert review: When I tried out the Edifier ES20, I really wasn\u2019t expecting it to be as good as it is. After all, it\u2019s a very cheap model, often available for less than \u00a350 in the UK (it\u2019s typically a bit more in the US, hence its position in the $50-$100 category). On top of that, it\u2019s ultra-compact and hardly the most powerful model on the market. But it still performs fantastically. During a test against rivals in this price category, I was wowed by the ES20\u2019s clean, balanced audio performance. The detail it showcased in the mid-range was something the spectacular JBL Clip 5 and Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 speakers couldn\u2019t quite match. It also has attractive lighting, great waterproofing, and a luxurious look that far surpassed my expectations in this price range. The Edifier ES20 is equipped with so many tools that helped it to stand out over other options I tested in this price-range. Perhaps the most memorable was its in-built mic with integrated noise-cancelling technology. This means you can enjoy clear, hands-free calls without running for your phone. I also appreciated its strong 15-hour battery life, customizable lighting, and multi-speaker pairing options. It's just a shame about the limited EQ adjustment. As I mentioned above, the mid-range performance of the ES20 is where it really shines. When comparing this to the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4, I was struck by the definition and tonal accuracy of guitars and vocals more than anything. You get natural-sounding treble too, which stays disciplined until you hit those really high volumes. Bass heads may prefer the weight of the Wonderboom 4, but the ES20 still offers a punchy and relatively clear low-end effort. Just don\u2019t expect it to hit those deep dark notes in the sub-bass realm. The star of the show, though, is the ES20\u2019s design. I found that a number of my colleagues really loved the retro-inspired look of this Edifier speaker, with an appealing speaker grille protecting the driver and a faux leather material used for the outer casing and button controls. Lights positioned on the reverse side of the speaker can illuminate a wall behind it, increasing immersion in your favorite tunes. Oh, and it's also IP67 dust and waterproof, meaning it's as durable as it is beautiful. If the ES20\u2019s cost in the US were closer to its UK pricing, the ES20 would easily score a 5\/5 in the value department. However, as it stands, it gets slightly marked down. I still think the ES20 is well-worth its sub-$90 list price, though, thanks to its surprising sound quality, striking design, and plentiful playtime. Our expert review: As you can see, I selected the JBL Flip 7 as the best Bluetooth speaker overall, so it makes the cut as the best mid-range option too! The Flip 7 bowled me over \u2013 mainly because I couldn\u2019t believe such meaty bass was coming from such a small cylindrical device. But it offers more than powerful low-end output: it's generally an excellent-sounding model, with direct and detailed audio. The Flip 7 ticked all of my boxes outside of the sound department too, with phenomenal durability and waterproofing, a broad feature-set, and a low launch price. It\u2019s already gone on sale a couple of times too, so if you can scoop it for less, you\u2019re getting the deal of a lifetime. I found the JBL Portable app to be impeccably easy to use, and used it to alter the Flip 7\u2019s EQ, toggle the battery-increasing PlayTime Boost, and try out multi-speaker pairing. OK, you can't pair to previous Flip speakers to expand the sound, but it more than makes up for that with the inclusion of Auracast connectivity (to send sound to lots of compatible speakers at once), its generous 16 hour battery life, and effective AI Sound Boost tech for optimized audio output. There's no integrated mic here, but that may not bother too many users. The Flip 7 is easily one of the best-sounding speakers I\u2019ve used in this size class. Its low-end output will shock you with just how deep and hard-hitting it sounds, but you\u2019ll also be treated to layered mids and expressive treble. I also found the Flip 7 to offer a dynamic, fairly nuanced listen, and was delighted to see USB-C audio passthrough for higher-resolution listening. When you hear the Flip 7\u2019s sound, you may struggle to reconcile it with the small cylinder that lies before you. I adore the compact, highly portable nature of this speaker, which makes it ideal for taking out and about. Pair that with an IP68 dust and waterproof rating, a drop-proof design, and well-positioned button controls, and you\u2019ve got a stellar all-round package. The main reason I selected the JBL Flip 7 as my best mid-priced \u2013 and indeed, best overall \u2013 pick, is based on its unbeatable value for money. The Charge 6 runs it close, coming in at just $149 \/ \u00a3129 \/ AU$229, and offering a bit more bass and a generally more full-bodied sound, but the power and fidelity available from a speaker as small and low-priced as the Flip 7 is impossible to ignore. Our expert review: I had so many options to choose from in the $200 and up bracket, but the Bose SoundLink Max is the true all-rounder that deserves to be top dog. It offers a nuanced listen while also packing a real punch. It looks absolutely beautiful, but still has a rugged and drop-proof build. And it has a nice set of features to keep the user experience fresh and easy. On top of that, you can find the SoundLink Max for a great deal less than its list price, especially when large sale events come around \u2013 Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, I\u2019m looking at you. I adore this model\u2019s agile, full-scale sound, eye-popping color options, and power bank capabilities \u2013 all of which make the SoundLink Max the full package for parties, home listening, or taking on the go. Look, I think Bose could\u2019ve done better with the EQ adjustment tools here, but otherwise there\u2019s plenty to like about the options at your fingertips. It can offer wired listening, multi-speaker pairing, external device charging, and multi-point connectivity. There\u2019s also 20 hours of battery life, which is nothing special, but should be enough for multiple days of listening.  The five-hour recharge time is a little slow, though. I love the sound of the SoundLink Max. It supplies hefty yet agile bass, complexly layered mids, and carefully detailed highs, which kept me listening for hours on end. I considered the Bose SoundLink Plus for this category, given its lower (but still premium) price, but its low-end performance just couldn\u2019t compare, and I found the Max offered generally more immersive, moving audio. Oh, you also get access to the aptX Adaptive codec here, opening up higher-resolution Bluetooth streaming. Drop-dead gorgeous. That\u2019s how I\u2019d describe the Bose SoundLink Max, which is an absolute joy to look at. It's got a smooth, rubbery exterior that protects it against tumbles, but looks very sleek indeed. You also get IP67 dust and water protection, and can pick the model up in a range of enticing colors, with some of my favorites including Blue Dusk and Citrus Yellow. This model is regularly discounted for large-scale sales events, and if you can grab it for my target price, it\u2019s astonishingly good value for money. Raw power, intricate details, and great functionality. That\u2019s everything you could want and more from a premium, larger-sized speaker like the SoundLink Max, and, in my view, its commitment to quality is deserving of the high asking price. Our expert review: The Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 3rd Gen was one of the speakers on this list that I tried for the first time just for this guide. And honestly, I hope I never have to give it back. I\u2019ve been playing tunes on it constantly, and enjoying every little detail in my favorite tracks, marveling at its undeniable beauty, and playing around with the fun options in the Bang & Olufsen app. Seriously, this thing doesn\u2019t suggest that it's premium\u2026 it yells it. It perhaps doesn\u2019t offer the same sound-for-pound value as the considerably larger and mightier Bose SoundLink Max, but considering its small size, the A1 3rd Gen is a phenomenal-sounding model. If you\u2019re short on space, the impressively room-filling-yet-revealing sound of this speaker will suit you to a T. You can also show it off to your guests; they\u2019ll almost certainly be wowed by its beauty just as much as its sonic talents. OK, so Auracast won\u2019t be coming to this speaker, but I still think it has an admirable set of features. There\u2019s stereo pairing, multi-point connectivity, USB-C audio passthrough for elite hi-res sound, and a range of radio stations integrated into the B&O app. I found that the A1 3rd Gen surpassed my expectations, sonically speaking. Yes, even with that price tag. This thing may be small, but it outputs seriously powerful audio. On top of that, you get an exceptionally detailed listen right across the frequency range, which is even more apparent when making use of the aptX Adaptive codec or, even better, USB-C audio passthrough. The bass extends to surprisingly dark lows, mids are expansive yet controlled, and the attack of sounds in the treble range is snappy and full of intent. Come on, just look at it! The A1 3rd Gen is a marvel in design, with discreetly placed buttons, eye-catching circular dimensions, and indulgent color variants, such as the Honey Tone I tested. Of course, it\u2019s IP67 waterproof rated too, meaning it's well protected against the elements. The highlight for me, though, is its high-caliber build. The lower half of the speaker is constructed from hard-wearing polymer, while the upper segment is made of textured pearl-blasted anodized aluminum. A leather carry strap just hammers home the true sense of luxury you access by purchasing this absolute gem. There\u2019s been no sign of a significant sale on this one just yet, and its premium market position means that it will almost always cost you an arm and a leg. But your investment in the A1 3rd Gen will come with significant returns. Unbeatable sound in this size-class, an awe-inspiring design, and a top-tier companion app make this a grand choice indeed. If you did want more power at this price-point, options like the JBL Xtreme 4 or the on-sale Bose SoundLink Max may suit you better. Our expert review: The Tribit Stormbox Blast dishes out earth-shaking bass and supplies up to 200W of power output. That means you\u2019re getting the commanding sound required for busy house parties or outdoor events. But the Stormbox Blast 2 isn\u2019t just loud \u2013 it genuinely sounds great. With a rhythmic, cohesive sound, you\u2019ll want to blast tunes for hours on end. On top of that, the Stormbox Blast 2 supports wireless pairing for microphones, and has 6.35mm ports for wired alternatives, making it a fantastic choice for karaoke fans. Couple that with a 30-hour battery life and customizable LED lighting, and it\u2019s a smash hit. You can access karaoke with wireless or wired microphone connectivity, exciting lighting options, and an extensive set of EQ options with the Stormbox Blast 2. You also get 30 hours of playtime, an XBass feature for exaggerated low-end output, and USB-C out charging for external devices. You won\u2019t get the most detailed listen in the world out of the Stormbox Blast 2, but it\u2019s still capable of surprisingly well-rounded sound with a bit of tinkering. And the main event, of course, is the bass. If you want room-swallowing low-end power, the Stormbox Blast 2 is among the best options on the market. Fidelity will take a hit if you edge towards the absolute peak of the volume scale, but you'll likely not need to quite go that loud \u2013 and if a party is steering that way, maybe you won't care anyway, as long as the bassline is bouncing. Although this model is a chunky fella, and heavy to carry around, its curved design means it's still pretty attractive, and its personalizable lights keep it interesting despite a plain black look. IP67 dust and waterproofing means that the speaker can be submerged underwater, making it a good choice for pool parties or beachside listening. For its size, the Stormbox Blast 2 has more of a mid-range price-tag, which is impressive considering its broad feature-set and commendable audio performance. You can get older and similar party speakers for less, but a range of sound upgrades make this very worthwhile. Our expert review: It\u2019s actually unbelievable how long the Marshall Kilburn III can go for without needing a charge \u2013 50 hours to be exact. For a model in its weight class, that\u2019s an outrageous amount of playtime. This model can also be used to charge external devices like mobile phones and headphones, so you can share the power around with ease. But this thing\u2019s not only a leader in the battery life department \u2013 it\u2019s also a top performer when it comes to audio. You\u2019ll uncover phenomenally balanced, detailed, and impactful audio on the Kilburn III, and the Marshall app enables EQ tuning, so you can find your perfect sound. The Kilburn III has just about everything you\u2019d want from a modern Bluetooth speaker. The Marshall companion app opens up EQ adjustment, Auracast functionality, and battery preservation options. It also has placement compensation, which optimizes audio for your listening space. Of course, you\u2019re also getting 50 hours of playtime, which is truly exemplary. Even though it skips on higher-resolution Bluetooth audio codecs, this model is one of the best performers, sonically speaking, in its size class. You get seriously weighty, yet responsive bass output, fantastically defined mids, and expressive treble. True 360 stereophonic sound keeps your music sounding unreal from all angles, while deft instrument separation ensures a layered, nuanced listen. I adore the amp-inspired look of the Kilburn III, which is impeccably crafted with metallic physical controls, hardy faux-leather, and a red velvet-infused carry strap. Its IP54 waterproofing doesn\u2019t stack up too well against some rivals, but it's still splashproof and decently protected against dust. The Marshall Kilburn III is pricier than its predecessor, but it really does feel worth its cost. With improved acoustics, a significantly upgraded look, and better waterproofing, it more than earns its higher price tag. Even against rivals, I\u2019d consider it fairly priced; it's cheaper than the Bose SoundLink Max, for instance. Our expert review: If I was to pick a portable speaker capable of playing music over Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth, I\u2019d have to go for the Sonos Roam 2. Playing tunes over Wi-Fi will generally mean that less quality is lost than would typically disappear when streaming over Bluetooth, and the Roam 2 takes advantage of that to deliver detailed, engaging listening experiences. Of course, you get the benefits of Sonos' multi-room technology too. So, if I had a Sonos Move 2 and a Sonos Era 100, say, I'd be able to link this lil\u2019 fella up to my home system. It's not perfect \u2013 battery life is a little underwhelming above all. But if you want the ease and quality of Wi-Fi streaming, then this is still my top overall pick. My favorite feature on the Roam 2 is, of course, its Wi-Fi streaming capability, which helps you enjoy your music in even better quality. It can also link to other speakers in your Sonos ecosystem \u2013 if you have any. I also appreciated Trueplay, which optimizes playback to your environment, though I was left wanting more in the battery life department. More than anything, I was struck by the Roam 2\u2019s high attention to detail in the mid-range, which makes it a fantastic speaker for vocal or guitar-led tracks. It also supplies a decent amount of low-end weight, but I never felt as if bass was overemphasized or muddied. It can\u2019t get that loud, and you\u2019ll experience compression at higher volumes, but that\u2019s very common for speakers in this size category. With a minimalist design, some unique color options, and a stand-out shape, the Sonos Roam 2 does a good amount to set itself apart from the competition. It also has an IP67 dust and waterproof rating, easy-to-use button controls, and the option to be mounted upright or on its side. Yep, it\u2019s more than just a pretty face! If you gave me $150 right now and told me to get the best speaker I could, I still think I\u2019d be tempted to grab the JBL Flip 7 over the Sonos Roam 2 for its slightly better sonic performance and power \u2013 oh, and its considerably longer battery life. Still, the Roam 2 doesn\u2019t have to rely on Bluetooth, and it still looks great while sounding pretty swell too. Our expert review: Can debuts get much better than that of the Marshall Bromley 750? I'm really not too sure! Marshall\u2019s first ever gigantic party speaker is fantastic-sounding, gorgeous-looking, and long-lasting beast, and I'd recommend it for any larger-scale event \u2013 remember, this thing is large enough that requires wheels and a handle, like a suitcase. I found that this model could dish out almighty, yet regimented bass, while still giving mid-range sounds like guitars and vocals plenty of room to play. Treble also comes through with clarity and precision, while Marshall\u2019s 360-degree true stereophonic sound tech keeps audio well-defined from all angles. The gorgeous lights and amp-inspired design also help the Bromley to feel worth its fairly hefty price tag, and though its companion app could use some work, the speaker\u2019s physical controls and connectivity options won me over. With EQ adjustment, customizable lighting, and a whopping 40 hours of battery life, the Bromley 750 is a master in the features department. There are a range of connectivity options too, like RCA ports for keyboards and turntables and XLR\/6.35mm combo ports for microphones and electro-acoustic guitars \u2013 perfect for karaoke. The Marshall app is a little underequipped, however, meaning you\u2019ll often have to rely on physical controls. If you need powerful, disciplined audio output, the Bromley 750 is my top choice, as it offers meaty, yet controlled bass response, defined mids, and expressive treble. Sound character control also means you can stick with a more dynamic listen, or sacrifice a bit of fidelity for maximum loudness \u2013 you can also live somewhere in between. This works very well, and believe me, if you want to turn it up to 11 here, you can! I love the way the Bromley 750 looks. Attractive lights shimmer behind its beautiful speaker grille, it has a sleek faux leather exterior, and luxurious physical controls. IP54 waterproofing is up-to-scratch for a speaker of this type, and the built-in handles make the speaker feel pleasingly portable considering its weighty build. When I reviewed the Marshall Bromley 750, I found myself comparing it to the recently released JBL PartyBox. See, that model's priced very similarly to Marshall\u2019s party debut, but it's got a significantly higher power output. If you want raw might, that one may well offer you better bang for your buck. Still, the ultra-premium build of the Bromley 750, paired with its great sound and repairability, give it great long-term value.

In order to build this guide, I spent multiple weeks testing a whole lot of models, comparing a load of rivals on aspects like sound quality, features, and design. On top of this, I've been consistently reviewing Bluetooth speakers and other related audio gear for more than a year and a half here at TechRadar. Anyway, what does the actual testing process look (and sound) like? Well, first of all, I make sure I'm using Tidal to listen to music, thanks to its support for quality up to 24-bit and 192kHz, so I'm started with the best possible source. In addition, I make sure to run through the TechRadar testing playlist, which features tracks from a number of genres, like Classical, Electronic, Jazz, and Rock. Of course, I want to have a bit of fun while doing this, so I always bump a few tracks from my personal music library too. I listen to a lot of house music and jazz funk fusion, but my playlists feature a range of tunes that help me to judge dynamics, tonal accuracy, and detail right across the frequency range. I always test out audio gear in the music testing space we have here on TechRadar \u2013 a quiet, acoustically treated and controlled environment for judging the quality of audio gear. However, I do try to take speakers into other environments too, including my home, the office, outdoor spaces, and sometimes even the shower (if that IP rating is high enough, of course). On top of this, I'll make sure to test performance across different connectivity methods. Sometimes a speaker won't showcase its full potential unless its making use of a wired connection. Maybe it needs to be plugged into a power source to hit its maximum power output. I'll try whatever is necessary to hear the full potential of each unit I try. This includes making use of higher resolution codecs, like aptX Adaptive, which require a compatible source device or USB-C dongle. If a Bluetooth speaker has a companion app, I'll also ensure that it's downloaded (I have so many my phone is running out of storage). Then, I'll exhaust every option, from EQ adjustment through to customizable lighting or battery preservation modes. Keen to learn more about how we review audio gear and more at TechRadar? Make sure you head on over to our 'how we test' guide.      Let's start with the most important question first. To choose the perfect Bluetooth speaker, you'll have to ask yourself a few questions. What do you want to use it for? Personal listening? Parties? Playing music in the shower? Some speakers might not have the raw power needed for parties, and some may not have the waterproofing required for mid-scrub listening, so consider the amount of power and protection you'll need, for instance. It's also important to think about size. Do you want a mini speaker for dropping tunes in your bedroom? Do you want a behemoth that can get everybody moving at an outdoor gathering? Consider how much portability and room you need. And it goes without saying, but set yourself a budget. Good quality audio really doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Of course, the sub-$10 speakers on Amazon should probably be avoided, but there are a number of options under $50 that can serve you well. There are a lot of great waterproof speakers, but I can run through a few top choices. For a smaller model, I recommend the Edifier ES20 or the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4. These are both IP67-rated and each sound great.For a mid-sized option, the JBL Flip 7 or JBL Charge 6 are exemplary choices. We scored both models five stars, and their IP68 dust and waterproofing is out of this world. Meanwhile, those seeking out a larger model will be best off with the Bose SoundLink Max or the Tribit Stormbox Blast 2. These both combine IP67 protection against the elements with seriously hefty audio output. This comes down to two main things. First, budget; second, personal preference. JBL typically offers more budget-friendly audio gear than Bose, but you can still generally expect a terrific standard of sound and build quality. There's also a trademark look to a JBL speaker. It's rugged, outdoorsy, and often cylindrical. Maybe you dig that, maybe you don't! Bose, for many, is synonymous with luxury. And that makes a lot of sense, especially given that the Bose SoundLink Max made the cut as my top premium pick. You often get impressive levels of sonic detail and a spectacular finish from Bose speakers. I'd argue that some models don't offer the spectacular value that JBL do, but if you've got the cash and want to hear some finer details, it may well be worth the additional spend. A lot of the time, wireless speakers \u2013 those capable of streaming over Wi-Fi \u2013 are better equipped for home listening, often featuring a less rugged or portable design. But that comes with the benefit of playing music over Wi-Fi, which often sounds better than Bluetooth streaming. That's because more data is typically lost during a Bluetooth stream, though some higher-quality codecs can retain a tad more detail. But the best Bluetooth speakers still sound great, and they can often offer superior portability and waterproofing among other things. Some speakers can do both \u2013 see the Sonos Roam 2. If you're going to be using a speaker almost exclusively at home, indoors, then I'd recommending taking a peek at our best wireless speakers guide. Otherwise, one of the options on this list will certainly suit your needs.      In this context, frequency response refers to the range of frequencies that a speaker can reproduce. For example, if a speaker's frequency response is 20Hz-20kHz, that suggests that it is capable of replicating all sounds within the average human's range of hearing. Audio codecs compress and encode audio signals, which are transmitted wirelessly from one device to another. These are then decoded by another device, and delivered to you, the listener.  Allow me to provide an example. Say you're playing music via Spotify on the Edifier ES20 speaker, which is connected to your Android phone. The audio file \u2013 playing from Spotify \u2013 would then be compressed and re-encoded by your phone with the SBC codec, before being decoded by the Edifier speaker and played to you. SBC is the most basic codec, and the vast majority of Bluetooth devices support it. AAC offers better sound quality than SBC, and can potentially transmit audio without compressing or re-encoding it, if the source music file is AAC, if both the speaker and your source device support AAC transmission, and if the file isn't too high-quality for Bluetooth's bandwidth.  There are some more fancy codecs to uncover that audiophiles will likely appreciate.  For instance, LDAC \u2013 Sony's proprietary coding tech \u2013 and aptX codecs, like aptX Adaptive, can open you up to higher-resolution Bluetooth audio. A lot of modern Android devices support LDAC, but not as many phones and tablets support aptX Adaptive.  Crucially, you'll need to make sure your source device and Bluetooth speaker both support the codec you want to make use of. For instance, the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max and the Bose SoundLink Plus each support aptX Adaptive. Make sure the streaming service you use also enables higher-resolution streaming. Tidal, for instance, can open up streaming in 24-bit, 192 kHz, so you'll be able to hear those additional details that aptX Adaptive can uncover. A Bluetooth speaker doesn't necessarily need to support LDAC or aptX to sound good \u2013 the JBL and Marshall speakers on this list, for example, offer impressive sound without them. But it can be a nice touch for those listeners who want a more intricate, revealing listen. OK, this one's a little less tech intensive! IP ratings refer to the dust and water protection a product has. After the letters IP, you'll find two additional characters. The first indicates its dustproof rating, while the second shows its waterproof rating. For example, if a Bluetooth speaker is IP67-rated, then that tells us two specific things. Firstly, the '6' shows that the model is dust-tight, and completely protected against dust ingress. Meanwhile, the '7' means that the speaker is waterproof, and can safely be submerged under a meter of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. When you buy a new Bluetooth speaker, you should always check its IP rating. If it's IPX7 rated, for example, that means it does not have a dust resistance guarantee, but is safe to be submerged underwater. If it is IP54 rated, say, that means that it's partially dust-proof, but only splashproof, rather than fully waterproof. If you're buying a more recently released Bluetooth speaker, like the ones in my guide, then my honest answer to this question is: not much. All modern phones can connect to the speakers in this guide, though its worth noting that only speakers with the Bluetooth 5.2 version or later support the LC3 codec, which is used for Auracast streams.  A lot of the time, yes. However, speakers can only generally be paired with specific models \u2013 often, multiple units of the same model. One brand that has a slightly more expansive approach is JBL, which lets you connect a wide variety of its speakers together, so long as they support Auracast. You may need two of the exact same model for stereo pairing, though. October 16, 2025Refreshed the introduction.

In a tribute speech, Joon Ho said Foster was an example of how great choices make great cinema.     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tCiting a scene in The Silence of the Lambs in which her character FBI trainee Clarice Starling, recalls the shrieks of young sheep, Joon Ho said it was the closeup of her face that elevated the take.  \t\u201cAll we see is her haunting performance\u2026 This is an example of a great choice,\u201d\u00a0 he said.  \t\u201cIn Robert Zemeckis\u2019 Contact, when Dr. Ellie Arroway enters the wormhole and witnesses the mindblowing celestial event we only see it for a brief moment, and Jodie Foster\u2019s face steeped in awe, fills the screen\u2026 We are not moved by the depiction of the celestial event but by her face as she was witnessing it unfold.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"If you're a Windows user, you either have Windows 11 or have been fighting against updating. Some people don't want to move away from the beloved Windows 10, but Microsoft is pushing that issue, as it cut security updates for Windows 10 last month. If you're one of the people trying to get used to Windows 11, there are several changes that have been made from the previous operating system that take some getting used to. While the changes, like the new user interface and the addition of widgets, have been written about extensively, you might still be getting comfortable with the system. If that's the case, you probably have your own list of features that you either miss or want changed. Some of these features are noticeable right away, while others become apparent after you use Windows 11 extensively. It was so perfectly aligned where it was. Why did Windows move it? The Windows Start menu button should be all the way to the left of the bottom of your screen. In Windows 11, the Taskbar is centered by default. The reason for that is Microsoft's wanting to use the space at the bottom for widgets and updates. Mine gives me the weather and stock market tips, which are fine, but I'd rather have it like it used to be. The good news is that I can move it whenever I see fit. If you go to Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, you can change the alignment to left. This will bring you back to what you were used to in Windows 10. But having it centered feels like a weird setting to be enabled, rather than just keeping it the way it was. It almost feels like Microsoft is just trying to throw people off and show a new side of its operating system.  In Windows 11, the Start menu is overly simplified and may not be right for you. It now has icons for apps at the top, which you can customize and change depending on which programs you use the most. Below that, there are now recommended options, as Windows 11 learns what you have opened recently or opened frequently and will recommend them. If you find the recommendations helpful, you can toggle on more of them. If you aren't a fan of them, you can minimize the amount that comes up. You cannot eliminate the Recommended options in the Start menu. Back in the Personalization menu, you can click on Start and choose which version of Start you like. It is automatically set to about half icons and half recommendations. Also included are the folders, which let you add folders to the Start Menu. This is a helpful feature because you don't have to rely on the recommendations of your OS to have files easily accessible. It also eliminates the need to use the Taskbar to search for ones that you use often. If you use the Pictures or Documents folder frequently, you can toggle those on and have them show up on your Start menu. It makes opening and revisiting them much simpler. The suggestions that are available in this menu are similar to what was left of the Start menu in Windows 10.  Recovery and backing up your system are important parts of keeping your files safe. While computers have come a long way in terms of adding fail-safes and safety backups to their systems, there are other steps you can take to ensure your settings are saved and stored. One of them is using System Protection. While some people think they need to back up files manually, System Protection backs up files, settings, apps, and more by creating restore points. Think about when you're using Microsoft Word, and you can go back to previous versions of your document if you want to see what edits you or someone else made in an older version. Restore points are similar to that, as they look at how your computer is set up at a specific time and take a mental log of the settings. You're able to restore your points to bring your system back to exactly what it was like when they were captured. To set them up, you need to search for Create a restore point in the taskbar or on the Start menu. The System Properties menu will show up, and you can click System in the Protection Settings part of the menu. After you click Configure, you'll be able to select Turn on System Protection. There's a sliding scale that lets you choose the maximum amount of space your system will reserve. If you click Apply and OK, you're all set based on your preferences. This enables your points to be restored.  You may not consider yourself a computer genius, but that shouldn't put you off from having the option to act like one. Yes, you probably don't want to go and screw around inside the inner workings of your computer if you aren't someone who knows what they're doing. But, if you do feel so inclined to try some of the advanced tool options on your Windows laptop, you should enable Developer Mode. By going to Start -> System -> Advanced and turning on Developer Mode, it provides you with access to the most up-to-date apps and features on your computer. However, Developer Mode isn't necessary for people to use every day unless they're testing out some new features. But, if you're just using your computer like you normally would, you probably don't need to go into Developer Mode. But having it enabled, on the off chance you do need it, is a good idea. It's not like you're going to just be stumbling into that menu, making it fine to have it enabled.  File Explorer is a feature on Windows that lets you search for different files on your computer. File Explorer isn't always the best way to look for files on your computer, but you can either click through a number of folders and menus, or you can type in and search for something by name. You can look at the names of files in each folder and menu. But it might not give you more information than that. The files will have an icon with them, so you can have an idea of what the file is. But if you save something as a JPG rather than a PNG, you won't know that unless you turn on the file extensions within File Explorer. To do that, you need to open File Explorer and click View. At the bottom is the Show menu, and within the Show menu is the option to select the File name extensions. Once you do that, the names of the files will be followed by the shorthand for what the file is. This makes it simpler to identify each file. While there's a lot to like about Windows 11, it can take some getting used to. Some great features just need some help to populate, as you can enable them with some simple settings changes. Personalizing Windows 11 makes it more conducive to being the right operating system for you. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

By      Darryn Bonthuys    on November 28, 2025 at 5:03PM PST  Anime TV Box Sets   $12 - $46   Anime Movie Blu-rays   $9 - $43    Like most imported goods, anime is much more expensive as of late, but thanks to Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can score deals on hundreds of anime series and movie Blu-rays. There are dozens of anime Blu-rays in the sale, and we've rounded up our favorites below.   Note that these are limited-time offers and will likely only last through Black Friday. Luckily, there are still several hours left in the event, so you still have time to check them out (assuming they don't sell out before the day is over). Even better, select Blu-rays are part of Amazon's B2G1 Free promotion that's running alongside Black Friday--meaning if you add three eligible items to your Amazon cart, the cost of the lowest-priced item will be subtracted from your order's total at checkout. There's also a chance some may stick around after Black Friday ends, so even if you're reading this after the sale is over, it's still worth checking the links below to see if any are still in stock and discounted.   For more holiday bargains across tech, books, and games, check out GameSpot's Black Friday deals hub.       Some of our recommendations here include evergreen classics, like the over-the-top spectacle of FLCL and high-tech brawling in Megalobox. Feel like watching something more modern? Then you'll want to grab the Blu-rays for shows like Bluelock for pure sporting action and Space Dandy for stylish sci-fi adventures. Hell's Paradise is another easy pick for its tale about death row convicts in feudal Japan searching for an elixir of immortality on a cursed island, and Call of the Night is a vampire story that's full of surprises. Need some action in your life? Then grab your favorite Dragon Ball Z storyline from the list of Blu-rays below, enjoy the charm of Black Clover for swords-and-sorcery hijinks, and sail the seas of the Grand Line with the Straw Hat Pirates in One Piece.           The selection of anime films on sale is on the shorter side, but there are still some great movies to grab in Amazon's Black Friday event. Some notable deals include the 4K steelbook edition of the groundbreaking film Akira and the first two chapters in the Rebuild of Evangelion saga, Evangelion 2.22 and Evangelion 3.33. We've listed a few more anime film deals below.      Amazon Cyber Monday Gaming Deals   Check out all of the video game and hardware discounts.

Animal Crossing fans can save big on several other Lego building sets, including Nook's Cranny and Rosie's House and Isabelle's House Visit. By      Steven Petite    on November 29, 2025 at 1:54AM PST  Lego Animal Crossing: K.K.'s Concert at the Plaza (550 Pieces)   $32 (was $80)   Lego Animal Crossing: Nook's Cranny & Rosie's House (535 Pieces)   $45 (was $75)   Lego Animal Crossing: Isabelle's House Visit (389 Pieces)   $24 (was $40)   Lego Animal Crossing: Fly with Dodo Airlines (292 Pieces)   $22.79 (was $38)    Amazon has a bunch of great Lego deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, including several incredible bargains on Animal Crossing playsets. The most notable Lego Animal Crossing deal is the 550-piece K.K.'s Concert at the Plaza for only $32 (was $80). The 60% discount doesn't have an advertised end date, but we'd be surprised if it was still in stock after this weekend. The same goes for Amazon's deal on Nook's Cranny and Rosie's House, which is discounted to only $45 (was $75). Other awesome Lego Animal Crossing deals include Isabelle's House Visit for $24 (was $40), Fly with Dodo Airlines for $22.79 (was $38), Bunnie's Outdoor Activities for $12 (was $20), and Julian's Birthday Party for $10.79 (was $15). It's worth noting that the six Animal Crossing playsets mentioned above and Kapp'n's Island Boat Tour are retiring soon; this is a great opportunity to add to your collection for low prices before these Lego Animal Crossing sets are no longer on store shelves. The  Lego Store is also offering these Animal Crossing deals , but some sets are sold out already. You can take a closer look at the four Animal Crossing Lego sets with the largest price cuts below.  K.K.'s Concert at the Plaza is arguably the best Lego Animal Crossing set due to how much variety it offers. It includes the Residential Services building, a drivable camper, a portable cafe, decorations such as a customizable flag, bulletin board, and fruit tree, and a buildable stage for K.K. Slider to play some tunes alongside Isabelle and Audie. Each Animal Crossing figure can hold an assortment of small accessories. Naturally, this includes K.K.'s acoustic guitar and a microphone. K.K.'s Concert at the Plaza has modular baseplates that allow you to customize the layout of the stage, portable cafe, and Residential Services building. This 535-piece playset includes Tom Nook's store, Rosie's home, and a bunch of accessories and decorations. Kids can act out the daily lives of the two villagers with the help of accessories pulled from the game, including a DIY recipe card, fish bait, a bulletin board, and a fruit tree. Nook's Cranny has a cash register, a cabinet with goods for sale and a Bell bag to provide loans to customers. Rosie's front yard has a garden with a picnic table where the two can enjoy afternoon drinks and cupcakes. You can customize the interior and exterior layouts of Nook's Cranny and Rosie's House by moving the baseplates around.   The 389-piece Isabelle's House Visit playset includes Isabelle and Faauna minifigures. You'll build Fauna's idyllic home as well as decorations such as trees, a workbench with a tool rack, a mailbox, and a vegetable garden. You can redecorate the yard by shifting the baseplates. There's also a buildable present that is, of course, attached to a balloon.   Fly with Dodo Airlines is a 291-piece playset featuring Wilbur and Tangy. The interior of Dodo Airlines includes a ticket gate for Tangy to pass through--but not before handing over her ticket, of course. The buildable plane's propeller can spin, and it has two seats for Wilbur and Tangy.      Note: The first seven Animal Crossing Lego sets in the list below are retiring soon.     Four Lego Animal Crossing sets that are not retiring are up for grabs for discounted prices, too. Leif's Caravan & Garden Shop is $24 (was $30), and the Able Sisters Clothing Shop is down to $32 (was $40). Both playsets come with two Lego minifigures. The 149-piece Goldie's Cozy House playset is on sale for $18.39 (was $23). Lastly, the cheapest product in the Animal Crossing collection, Stargazing with Celeste, is only $6.39 (was $10).   Goldie's Cozy House launched alongside two other Animal Crossing sets in August. The 814-piece Creative Houses playset is the largest and priciest Animal Crossing Lego product yet. You can alter the houses and the decorations to match all four seasons, which means each house has a 2-in-1 design. Creative Houses includes Lego minifigures of Stitches, Fuschia, and Fang. Lego also launched a highly customizable 543-piece playset called Blathers's Museum Collection. This one comes with Blathers and Lily minifigures and lets builders redesign the exhibits both inside and outside of the museum.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Strategy CEO Phong Le says the company now has \u201cmore flexibility than ever\u201d to continue accumulating bitcoin, citing a capital structure built on long-dated debt, opportunistic equity access, and no short-term refinancing pressure. Speaking on the most recent episode of the \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast, Le told host Danny Knowles that Strategy\u2019s ability to raise capital through both debt and equity has become a central part of the firm\u2019s long\u2011term bitcoin operating strategy. He described capital\u2011market access as the \u201cmagic\u201d behind the company\u2019s ability to consistently add bitcoin to its balance sheet through multiple market cycles. Le said the firm deliberately engineered its balance sheet to avoid liquidity stress and to maintain room for opportunistic issuance. \u201cOur capital stack is very strong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first debt maturity doesn\u2019t hit until December 2025. It gives us a lot of flexibility to be opportunistic.\u201d The company holds several convertible note tranches that are long\u2011dated and carry minimal near\u2011term dilution risk. Le added that Strategy now has \u201cmore flexibility than ever\u201d to continue accumulating bitcoin, pointing to its ability to tap both equity and debt markets depending on conditions. He added that Strategy now has more flexibility than at any point in its history, citing its ability to raise equity through at\u2011the\u2011market programs and its track record of issuing zero\u2011coupon or low\u2011coupon convertibles. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown we can do both. We can choose the timing of both,\u201d he said, noting that the firm can raise capital during strong equity markets or lean on convertibles when rates and market conditions favor long\u2011duration issuance. The Washington, D.C.\u2013area firm, which rebranded from MicroStrategy to Strategy in February 2025, holds more than 158,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Le said the company\u2019s shareholder base understands that Strategy\u2019s market identity has shifted from a traditional software company to a hybrid business combining enterprise analytics with a bitcoin\u2011forward treasury strategy. \u201cOur shareholder base understands who we are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the only access point to this strategy in public markets.\u201d Le acknowledged that some investors still question how Strategy should be valued, especially when bitcoin prices are volatile or trading well below recent highs. But he argued that the company has proven its approach through multiple cycles and that its continued access to capital at favorable terms validates the model. \u201cThis strategy works because we know how to use the capital markets well,\u201d he said. He said Strategy intends to continue deploying excess cash flow from its software business into bitcoin and will monitor capital-market conditions to determine whether equity or debt issuance is more appropriate at a given time. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re executing \u2014 on software, on bitcoin, and in capital markets \u2014 we think the story will remain compelling,\u201d he said. Class A shares of Strategy (MSTR) closed Friday at $17.18, up 0.88% on the day, but down 41% in the year to date. That compares with a 3.14% decline in bitcoin over the same period. James Van Straten, a CoinDesk market analyst, said Saturday on X that the market may still test Strategy's enterprise valuation or drive its stock below the firm\u2019s bitcoin cost basis. \u201cEven though I believe the bottom is in, the market will feel max pain in one of those two scenarios,\u201d he said, adding that once investors see the company ride out its current convertible note structure, \u201cboth bitcoin and MSTR will rally hard.\u201d More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security  What to know:  More For You Bitcoin ETFs Are Now BlackRock\u2019s Top Revenue Source, Exec Says \u2028 The firm's US-listed spot bitcoin ETF IBIT, launched in January 2024, reached $70 billion in assets in record time and has generated hundreds of millions in fees.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"Silent Hill f is a compelling horror game that isn't afraid to stray from the norm while staying true to what makes Konami's legendary horror franchise terrifying  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  It pleases my cold heart to see Silent Hill make a big comeback these past few years, with chilling titles like the wonderful Silent Hill 2 remake and the surprisingly engrossing spin-off, Silent Hill f. Silent Hill f quickly won fans and us over for its disturbing story, interesting characters, and experimental shake-up of Silent Hill's trademarked gameplay. If you haven't played Silent Hill f yet and are in the mood for a spooky Christmas, its Day One Edition is now 29% off for $49.94 at Amazon, courtesy of Cyber Monday. \"Silent Hill F is thoughtful in its themes, confident in its presentation, ambitious with its combat design, and unapologetic with its violence. It's a game that will stick with you after you reach any one of its conclusions, and the nightmare continues even further in New Game+ with additional story elements.\" ~ Jez Corden, Executive EditorWindows Central Review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd      There are plenty of reasons as to why Silent Hill f is the fastest-selling game in the series, and is well worth risking getting nightmares to play. It's a well-made game that is guaranteed to chill you to the bone, regardless of whether you're a long-time Silent Hill fan or a newcomer to horror games in general. It tells a horrific yet tragic tale of the young Shimizu Hinako, desperately trying to escape her haunted town of Ebisugaoka while searching for friends before they're hunted by monsters lurking within. Silent Hill f also features a gorgeously detailed (and disturbing) art direction, backed up with atmospheric sound-design and music to truly make you feel like you're alone and trapped in a world where your worst nightmares have come to life. On top of that, Silent Hill f is also bold enough to try innovating the series' gameplay formula with devious, mind-bending puzzles, a more in-depth combat system, and special story cutscenes that only unlock in NG+ runs.      For the most part, it's a successful departure that's fun to play while staying true to the themes and horrors of Silent Hill. However, the combat system doesn't seem to be balanced well on harder difficulty levels, where enemies are more frequent. However, that doesn't stop Silent Hill f from being a great Xbox title and one I personally recommend for lovers of survival horror games, especially now that the Day One Edition of the game is on sale for $49.94 at Amazon, instead of its normal MSRP of $69.99 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Buying the Day One Edition will net you Silent Hill f along with several DLC items for it. These include a White Sailor School Uniform costume, an Omamori: Peony accessory, and an Item Pack containing the Shriveled Abura-age, Divine Water, and First Aid Kit items. If Silent Hill f: Day One Edition runs out of stock at Amazon or if it's not your preferred retailer, other stores are selling it at similar discounted prices: Silent Hill f is available for purchase on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Windows and Steam. No, Silent Hill f is currently not available to download via Xbox Game Pass. Yes, Silent Hill f does support Xbox Play Anywhere, so buying it on Xbox will automatically its Windows PC license and vice versa. Additionally, you will be able to transfer and continue your game's save data progress between Xbox and Windows PC platforms via the Cloud. Black Friday arrived on November 28, 2025, and will last until December 1, 2025, when it will be replaced by Cyber Monday.  However, retailers like Amazon have already begun shifting away from Black Friday in favor of hosting Cyber Monday deals early. Enjoy our content?

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"ByBruce Martin, Contributor. One of the most important moments in NASCAR history will be settled in a Federal Courthouse, not on a race track.  The highly contentious anti-trust lawsuit filed by 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports against NASCAR will go to trial on Monday, December 1 in Federal Court in Charlotte, North Carolina. The trial is officially known as \u201c23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports v. NASCAR.\u201d Jury selection is expected to begin on Monday and could advance to opening statements in front of Judge Kenneth D. Bell. The two NASCAR teams filed a lawsuit against NASCAR on October 2 in federal court in Charlotte claiming NASCAR\u2019s actions violate antitrust laws. The plaintiffs include 23XI Racing, a team co-owned by one of the greatest athletes in American history, former NBA and University of North Carolina legend Michael Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by Bob Jenkins. The suit accuses NASCAR of anticompetitive practices as defined in Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. This came after two years of negotiations between NASCAR and race teams for a new charter agreement that began in 2025. Bitter acrimony between the plaintiffs and NASCAR have continued to the point where Judge Bell urged both sides to a settlement instead of going to trial. Both sides agreed to proceed with the trial in what could have a \u201cscorched Earth\u201d outcome. \u201cI\u2019ll let you come up with your own opinion, but I think one of us is on a suicide mission,\u201d Hamlin said on October 25 at Martinsville Speedway. Three days after Hamlin made that prophetic statement, Judge Bell dismissed NASCAR\u2019s counterclaim against 23XI and FRM as he granted the teams\u2019 motion for summary judgment. NASCAR had alleged that 23XI, FRM and 23XI co-owner Curtis Polk illegally colluded with other race teams to obtain better terms in the 2025-31 charter agreement. On October 31, NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps, in the annual NASCAR State of the Sport news conference, stressed that he hoped it could be settled before the trial began. \"NASCAR is fully aligned with our race-team partners who have submitted declarations hoping to end this litigation,\" Phelps said. \"We are trying our hardest. I am trying my hardest both as a fan as well as the commissioner of this sport that I\u2019ve loved since I was 5 years old. \u201cWhile two of the 15 teams may not share that view and seem set on an unfortunate court battle, I hope that we can all agree that our racing is as good as it has ever been and we care about how we serve our fans.\u201d NASCAR wants the charter system to continue, Phelps said. And even though the teams don\u2019t ask for it to be eliminated, NASCAR continues to warn that it could be the result of any remedies if NASCAR loses the lawsuit. \"The charter system is a critical part of the sport, something we created with and for the teams,\" Phelps said. \"We'll continue to defend and preserve it. Make no mistake, the lawsuit puts this at risk.\" On November 4, Judge Bell granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to define the market as \"premier stock-car racing\" and ruled that NASCAR has power over that market, rendering NASCAR\u2019s argument that the teams have options to compete in other racing series as moot. The issue at trial will be whether NASCAR has illegally used its power to keep there from being competition for premier stock-car racing. On November 11, Judge Bell ruled that powerful NASCAR team owners Rick Hendrick and Roger Penske must make themselves available for depositions without any limitations to the topics. According to FOXSports.com\u2019s Bob Pockrass, NASCAR put Hendrick and Penske on its witness list, triggering 23XI and FRM to request the depositions before trial. In response, Hendrick and Penske filed a brief to limit the deposition topics. \"Hendrick and Penske, in view of their decades-long relationship with Jim France, agreed to give limited testimony regarding non-confidential matters at the trial of this case, but in a way that did not force them to \u2018take sides\u2019 in the lawsuit \u2013 something which both men have made clear that they cannot and will not do,\" their brief states. But 23XI and FRM argued that their depositions should not be limited in scope, that because NASCAR brought the owners into the lawsuit, that they can be asked questions about the team finances. Hendrick has won 15 of the last 30 Cup titles while Penske not only has won three of the last four Cup titles but also owns IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. NASCAR\u2019s filing arguing for the limited scope of the depositions said: \u201cNASCAR\u2019s questioning will not seek information regarding the teams\u2019 income, expenses, profitability, employee salaries, or payments to drivers.\u201d But the judge sided with 23XI and FRM in his order: \"The trial of this matter will be publicly and fairly contested under the relevant rules and law, without regard to the notoriety of the companies and individuals involved. No company or individual will be accorded special treatment.\" On November 22, as part of the unsealing of several exhibits to motions in the case, text messages revealed NASCAR executives\u2019 concerns over the SRX Series and harsh comments about longtime veteran car owner Richard Childress after critical comments Childress made about NASCAR. The text messages were from 2022 and 2023, a pivotal time for NASCAR, as it was negotiating a new media rights deal, signed in November 2023 for the 2025-31 seasons. SRX was a stock-car series (the series built all the cars) that ran from 2021-23 at short tracks. It originally ran on Saturday nights but moved to Thursday nights to attract NASCAR drivers, including Denny Hamlin, Chase Elliott, Ryan Blaney and Brad Keselowski in select events. As the trial date nears, Hamlin engaged in some biting comments directed at a story published in ESPN.com believing it should have been co-authored by a high-ranking member of NASCAR\u2019s public relations department. According to Dickenson Media, a news outlet that covers Southwestern Virginia, the aggregate value of charters has grown to $1.5 billion over the past 10 years, with individual charters selling for as much as $45 million. When NASCAR signed a new media rights deal with FOX, NBC, Turner, and Prime in 2023 for nearly $8 billion, all new revenue over the previous deal was directed to race teams under the 2025 charters. An additional $50 million in funds was contributed directly from NASCAR and the tracks. In a recent filing that included declarations from team owners who signed the agreement, Rick Hendrick, owner of Hendrick Motorsports, supported the deal. He stated: \u201cThe Charter agreement is critical to the stability of the NASCAR ecosystem... Undoing what we have collectively negotiated will not only result in immeasurable damage to our sport... it will, most importantly, hurt the people and families that depend on us for their livelihoods.\u201d NASCAR issued a statement citing declarations from team owners, including Hendrick, Roger Penske, Joe Gibbs, Richard Childress, and Brad Keselowski: \u201cThis lawsuit is not about antitrust; it is merely an attempt to renegotiate an agreement that was signed and is being honored by all other race teams.\u201d Hendrick and Penske are both on NASCAR\u2019s witness list for the trial, while Jordan is expected to testify for the plaintiffs. The case comes to trial following several significant pre-trial rulings: Injunction Vacated: In December 2024, Judge Bell granted a preliminary injunction that would have allowed 23XI and Front Row to race as chartered teams during the lawsuit. However, the Fourth District Court of Appeals vacated the injunction in June 2025. Consequently, 23XI and Front Row raced as unchartered or \u2018open\u2019 teams when the 2025 season concluded on Nov. 2 at Phoenix Raceway. Counterclaim Dismissed: Two days after the season finale, Bell dismissed NASCAR\u2019s counterclaim alleging 23XI and Front Row had colluded to form an \u201cillegal cartel\u201d to manipulate charter negotiations. Market Definition Limited: Bell also granted a motion for partial summary judgment, limiting the relevant market definition for the lawsuit to \u201cpremier stock car racing.\u201d NASCAR had sought a broader definition that included other racing series. \u201cWhile we respect the Court\u2019s decision, we believe it is legally flawed and we will address it at trial and in the Fourth Circuit, if necessary,\u201d NASCAR stated following the market definition ruling. There is a tremendous amount at stake in this trial for the future of NASCAR and the team\u2019s involved, but harkening back to Hamlin\u2019s earlier statement from October 26, \u201cOne of us is on a suicide mission.\u201d","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":"I've reviewed every Kindle, here are the best e-readers and bundle offers  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Every Amazon Kindle e-reader (except the newest ones you can't even buy yet) are on sale in the Amazon Black Friday deals. So if you've been thinking about buying a Kindle as a gift or for yourself, now is the best time, because I've never seen lower prices on most of these Kindle e-readers, and some of these are dropping in price for the first time ever, like the Kindle Colorsoft Signature edition, my personal favorite Kindle for reading books and graphic novels. \u2022 Shop Amazon's full Black Friday sale A Kindle makes a great gift because it's so versatile. You can use it to read books from Amazon's Kindle store, you can subscribe to Kindle Unlimited for a ton of independent content, or you can even link your Kindle to your library account using an app like Libby, which lets you borrow books to your Kindle for free. Every Kindle lasts weeks on a full charge, and some are even durable enough to get wet. I tested the Kindle Colorsoft by reading extensively in the tub - it's a great job if you can get it! - so I can promise that these Kindle e-readers are built tough. The latest version of the standard Kindle is on sale for a record-low price for Black Friday. It's a basic ereader, but it still boasts a four-week battery life and space for thousands of books. Given it's $45 cheaper than the Paperwhite, this is clearly a better pick for the infrequent reader who's after a more budget-friendly option. This is a return of the same Prime Day deal on the Kindle Paperwhite for Black Friday. The more premium ereader scored four stars in our Kindle Paperwhite review, thanks to its excellent features, best-suited to avid readers. You get a 12-week battery life, a glare-free 7-inch screen, adjustable warm light, and storage space for thousands of books. The Kindle Colorsoft is down to its lowest price as part of Black Friday. As Amazon's first and only colored Kindle, it's a must-have for people who love reading travel guides, graphic novels, and other genres with a lot of images and photographs. Or if you just want to browse your entire library in its fully vibrant glory. It's USB-C and wireless charging compatible, lasting up to 8 weeks on a full battery. This updated version of the Kindle Scribe has only been discounted a handful of times in the past, so this Prime Day deal is a new record-low. The Scribe combines some of the best features of the Kindle Paperwhite, such as the glare-free and auto-adjusting display, along with the option to take notes, comment on documents, and doodle using the included stylus pen. Our Kindle Scribe review was down on some missing features that have been added in recent updates, so now this is better value for a multi-functional device. The latest Amazon Kindle is the best yet: the lightest and most compact version of the ereader so far. It has a brighter front light at max setting, along with a higher contrast ratio and faster page turns. It\u2019s the ideal way to carry hundreds of books with you, thanks to its 16GB storage and 6 weeks of battery life. You can also pay \u00a310 extra to get the version without lockscreen ads. Amazon has also launched a decent, if a little disappointing, deal on the latest Kindle Paperwhite for Black Friday. We found in our Kindle Paperwhite review that it's packed with features to suit all avid readers, including a 12-week battery life, glare-free 7-inch screen, adjustable warm light, and storage space for thousands of books. This is a good buy and one of the best ereaders out there; it's just a shame that the days of even bigger discounts are well in the past. Amazon offers bundles with Kindle e-readers as well. The Kids version of the Kindle is just the device with a kid-friendly cover and a short-term subscription to Amazon Kindle Kids Unlimited. The Essentials bundle usually offers a book cover, as well as a wall charger, since there is no charger in the box (a Kindle can use USB-C like your smartphone or laptop). I don't think the bundles are worth a look in most cases, since Kindle book covers are not expensive if you shop around. However, if you splurge on the Signature edition Kindles, you'll get wireless charging built-in, and then the Essentials bundle with a wireless charging stand is worth considering. The Kindle Colorsoft Signature edition includes 32GB of storage and wireless charging, but the latter is only useful with a wireless charging stand. Enter this Essentials bundle for the lowest price I've seen when you buy the stand with the Kindle Colorsoft. It's not cheap, but you get to display your full-color collection of book covers bedside with this charging stand, and the faux leather book cover offers nice protection. You're splurging on the Colorsoft anyway, why not get the whole package? This is the best way to enjoy the Amazon Kindle Scribe (2024), because you can only get the superior green model with 64GB of storage inside, and the faux leather book cover matches the green perfectly and gives you a tidy place to store your pen. In my time reviewing the Scribe, I couldn't imagine using it without this cover, which flips over vertically from the top, helping it to act as a stand as well as a cover. This bundle also includes a charger, but any USB-C charger will do. This is the lowest price on the Kindle Scribe, whether or not you buy the bundle together or just the Scribe itself.

{"date":"2025-11-29","content":" Most people think of smart home technology in terms of basics like plugs and lightbulbs, but the real innovation is often found in devices that solve unique, tangible problems. SwitchBot has built its entire brand on this idea, developing a reputation for creating gadgets you might not have known you needed. From a small robot that can push any button to a motor that automates any curtain track, the company\u2019s portfolio is filled with clever engineering designed to add convenience to the analog parts of a home. Now, for its Black Friday 2025 sale, SwitchBot is making a strong push to get this unique hardware into more homes with discounts reaching up to 58%. The promotion covers a wide range of its product ecosystem, including the highly practical Curtain 3, the impressively compact K11+ robot vacuum (which hits a sub-$200 price), and the brand\u2019s new, eye-catching AI Art Frame. It\u2019s an aggressive sale that highlights the company\u2019s confidence in a product lineup that continues to be one of the most creative in the smart home market.  SwitchBot is making its first serious play in the digital art display space, and they\u2019re doing it with a product that feels genuinely different from what\u2019s already out there. The AI Art Frame represents a departure from the company\u2019s usual smart home automation gadgets, bringing together E Ink Spectra 6 technology with Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model (internally codenamed NanoBanana) to create something that sits somewhere between a traditional digital photo frame and an AI art generator. The display itself uses the same color e-paper technology you\u2019d find in high-end electronic shelf labels and specialty e-readers, which means it produces images with a matte, paper-like finish that doesn\u2019t emit light or cause eye strain. With six primary colors (black, white, red, yellow, blue, green) rendered through microcup ink particles, the Spectra 6 panel delivers surprisingly vivid color at up to 200 PPI, though it won\u2019t match the brightness or contrast of an LCD display. The frame comes in three sizes: a compact 7.3-inch version at 800\u00d7480 resolution, a mid-sized 13.3-inch model, and a statement-making 31.5-inch option that approaches the scale of traditional wall art. What makes this more interesting than just another e-paper display is the integration with generative AI. Through the SwitchBot app, you can feed the frame text prompts or upload your own photos and have the Gemini model transform them into stylized artwork, apply different artistic treatments, or generate entirely new images from scratch. The conversational nature of Google\u2019s image model means you can refine results iteratively, asking it to adjust colors, change compositions, or blend multiple images together without needing any design software. The frame is housed in a premium aluminum body and supports both portrait and landscape orientation, with compatibility for standard IKEA frame sizes if you want to swap out the exterior. Perhaps the most practical feature is the battery life, which SwitchBot claims can reach up to two years on a single charge thanks to E Ink\u2019s ultra-low power consumption. The display only draws power when it refreshes to show a new image, and can maintain the current picture indefinitely without electricity. That eliminates the cord clutter that typically comes with wall-mounted digital displays and gives you far more flexibility in placement. At $119.99 for the 7.3-inch model during Black Friday, SwitchBot is undercutting the digital art frame market by a significant margin. Netgear\u2019s Meural Canvas, which has long been considered the benchmark for premium digital art displays, starts at around $600 for a 21.5-inch screen and doesn\u2019t include AI generation capabilities. Even the 31.5-inch SwitchBot at $799.99 (down from nearly $1,300) is positioned well below what you\u2019d typically pay for a large-format digital display in this category. The real value proposition is the combination of genuinely useful AI features, exceptional battery life that makes it practical for any room without worrying about outlets or cable management, and E Ink technology that looks more like actual printed art than a glowing screen. For anyone who has been curious about AI art generation but didn\u2019t want to deal with desktop software or subscription services, or for those who simply want a smart photo frame that doesn\u2019t need constant charging, this represents a surprisingly accessible entry point into a product category that has traditionally been either expensive or gimmicky. Click Here to Buy Now $120 $149.99 ($29.99 off). Hurry, deal ends in 48-hours!  The Curtain 3 represents SwitchBot\u2019s third iteration of its flagship curtain automation system, and the upgrades this time around address nearly every complaint users had about previous generations. The most significant improvement is the motor, which now delivers double the thrust force of the Curtain 2, handling curtains up to 15 kg on rod-type tracks and 16 kg on U-rail systems. That\u2019s a substantial leap in capability, opening the door to heavier blackout curtains and layered window treatments that would have overwhelmed earlier models. The second major upgrade is QuietDrift mode, a dual closed-loop motor control system that operates below 25 dB while moving curtains at a deliberately slow 5mm per second. This was engineered specifically to solve one of the most common frustrations with automated curtains: the jarring mechanical noise that defeats the purpose of gentle, sunrise-simulating wake-ups. The addition of Matter 1.4 support also brings native Apple HomeKit compatibility when paired with a SwitchBot Hub 2, which puts it on equal footing with more expensive systems from Lutron or Somfy in terms of ecosystem flexibility. Installation remains tool-free and works with most standard curtain rails and rods, which continues to be one of SwitchBot\u2019s strongest selling points against competitors like Aqara or IKEA\u2019s Fyrtur system. The built-in light sensor allows for intelligent automation based on ambient brightness, closing curtains as daylight fades or opening them when morning light reaches a certain threshold, all without requiring scheduled timers or manual intervention. Battery life on a single charge typically lasts several months depending on usage frequency, but the real game-changer is the optional Solar Panel 3, which SwitchBot claims has doubled the charging efficiency of the previous generation. With just three hours of direct sunlight daily, the system can theoretically run indefinitely without ever needing to be removed for charging. The bundle being offered includes two Curtain 3 units plus a dedicated Bluetooth remote, which is particularly useful for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to rely solely on voice commands or smartphone apps for basic open\/close operations. The two-pack pricing at $137.69 makes this one of the most cost-effective ways to automate a bedroom or living room with paired curtains, especially when you consider that competing solutions like Aqara average over $860 for similar coverage and require perfectly smooth curtain rods to function properly. SwitchBot\u2019s design works with telescoping rods and less-than-perfect tracks, which matters in real homes where curtain hardware isn\u2019t always pristine. The quiet operation is the feature that really sells the practicality here, because nobody wants to be jolted awake by a grinding motor at 7 AM, and the light sensor automation means you can genuinely set it once and let it handle morning routines without constant schedule adjustments as the seasons change. When you add in the solar panel option (sold separately but worth it), you get a truly hands-off curtain system that doesn\u2019t need charging, doesn\u2019t need manual operation, and doesn\u2019t announce itself every time it moves. For the Black Friday price, you\u2019re getting a mature product from a company that\u2019s been iterating on this exact use case for years, and it shows in the thoughtful details. Click Here to Buy Now: $137.69 $179.99 (24% off). Hurry, deal ends in 48-hours!  The air purifier market has become fiercely competitive in recent years, with established players like Levoit, Coway, and Winix dominating recommendations lists with their $150-300 offerings. SwitchBot is entering this space with a targeted pitch focused squarely on pet owners, and the engineering choices reflect that priority. The filtration system uses a three-stage approach with a washable pre-filter for larger hair particles, an H13 HEPA filter rated at 99.97% efficiency for particles down to 0.3 microns, and an activated carbon layer specifically designed to tackle pet odors. The company claims 93.45% removal of floating pet hair and 98.18% reduction of pet odors within 30 minutes, which puts it in the conversation with dedicated pet-focused units like the Levoit Core P350. With a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of 400 m\u00b3\/h (236 CFM), it\u2019s positioned for small to medium rooms, roughly on par with the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty in terms of throughput. The standout feature is the claimed 20 dB operation on its lowest setting, which would make it one of the quietest units in its class if that measurement holds up in real-world use. The inclusion of ambient lighting with 10 RGB color options and an optional fragrance diffuser suggests SwitchBot is thinking about this as a visible piece of living room furniture rather than a utilitarian appliance you hide in a corner. At $94.99 during Black Friday (down from over $200), the standard Air Purifier undercuts most comparable HEPA-rated units by a significant margin. The Air Purifier Table takes the same core filtration system and wraps it in a functional side table with a tempered glass top, adding 15W wireless charging for phones and other Qi-compatible devices. This is where SwitchBot\u2019s approach diverges most sharply from traditional air purifier manufacturers. Instead of making a device you need to find space for, they\u2019ve created furniture that happens to clean the air, which solves one of the most common complaints about air purifiers in smaller apartments: they take up valuable floor space without contributing anything aesthetically or functionally beyond air cleaning. The table stands at a height that works as a bedside table or end table next to a couch, and the wireless charging pad means you\u2019re effectively getting two useful functions bundled into the air purification. At $159.99 with the Black Friday discount (down from $270), it occupies a price point where it\u2019s competing less with other air purifiers and more with the question of whether you\u2019d rather buy a standalone air purifier plus a separate side table, or consolidate both needs into one device. The Matter 1.4 support means it integrates with Apple Home, Google Home, and other major platforms for scheduling and automation, which matters more in a bedroom context where you might want it to ramp up before you go to sleep and dial down to whisper-quiet levels overnight. The standard Air Purifier at $94.99 represents one of the sharpest discounts in the entire Black Friday sale at 56% off, positioning it as an impulse purchase for anyone who has been curious about air purification but balked at spending $200-300 on a Levoit or Coway. At that price, it\u2019s cheaper than many budget units that lack smart home integration or true HEPA filtration, making it an easy recommendation for pet owners dealing with shedding season or anyone living in areas with seasonal air quality issues. The Air Purifier Table at $159.99 is the more compelling value proposition from a feature-per-dollar perspective, bundling furniture, wireless charging, and air purification into a single footprint at a price that\u2019s still well below what you\u2019d pay for Dyson\u2019s premium units or even mid-range options from Blueair. The pet-specific focus also addresses a genuine pain point in the market, where most air purifiers treat pet hair and dander as just another particle type rather than optimizing the entire filter stack around that specific use case. For anyone with cats or dogs who are tired of constantly vacuuming or dealing with lingering pet odors, either of these represents a practical entry point into automated air quality management without requiring a major financial commitment or sacrificing valuable living space.

Hurry, deal ends in 48-hours!  The robot vacuum and mop category has become increasingly crowded at the premium end, with flagships from Roborock, Dreame, and Ecovacs routinely pushing past $1,500 with their most advanced docking stations and AI-powered navigation systems. The S20 enters this market with a feature set that closely mirrors what you\u2019d find on those top-tier models, but at a price point that traditionally belonged to basic vacuum-only robots without mopping capabilities. The signature feature is RinseSync, SwitchBot\u2019s implementation of continuous mop roller cleaning during operation rather than only at the dock. This means the roller mop is being scrubbed and rinsed with fresh water as it moves across your floors, addressing one of the fundamental problems with single-pass mopping systems where the mop pad gets progressively dirtier. The 10,000Pa suction puts it on par with last year\u2019s Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra and current mid-range flagships from Dreame, which is substantial power for dealing with embedded dirt in carpet or debris along baseboards. The dual anti-tangle rubber brushes are designed specifically to handle hair without the constant maintenance that plagued earlier robot vacuum generations, and the AI-powered obstacle avoidance uses visual recognition to navigate around cables, pet waste, and other common floor hazards without getting stuck or requiring rescue missions. The MultiClean Base Station is where SwitchBot has clearly studied the competition and incorporated the features that matter most. Automatic dust collection with 90-day capacity means you\u2019re only dealing with bag changes roughly four times a year, and the heated mop drying system prevents the musty odor problem that\u2019s common with damp mop pads sitting in enclosed docks. The station comes in two versions: a standard tank model with separate 2.7L clean water and 2.5L wastewater tanks, and an auto-fill and drain edition that connects directly to household plumbing for genuinely hands-off water management. That plumbing-connected option puts it in rare company, as most manufacturers still rely on manual water tank filling even on their most expensive models. The Matter 1.4 integration is particularly well-implemented here, with direct section cleaning control in Apple Home, which means you can tell Siri to clean specific rooms without needing to open the SwitchBot app or rely on less-reliable voice assistant workarounds. The system can also automatically refill SwitchBot\u2019s Evaporative Humidifier, showing how the company is thinking about cross-device automation within their ecosystem rather than treating each product as an island. The 58% discount brings the S20 down to $339.99, which fundamentally changes the calculation for anyone who has been watching the robot vacuum market and waiting for premium features to become affordable. To put that in context, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra with comparable 10,000Pa suction and self-cleaning dock currently sells for around $1,000 on sale (down from $1,800 at launch), the Dreame L50 Ultra hovers around $900-1,100, and the Eufy Omni S1 Pro sits at $1,000 during promotional periods. All of those are excellent machines that score well in independent testing, but the S20 is offering the same core feature set, continuous mop cleaning during operation (which most don\u2019t have), and optional plumbing connectivity at literally one-third the price of the competition. This isn\u2019t a budget robot pretending to be premium; this is a legitimately capable machine with flagship specifications being sold at a price that makes it accessible to people who would normally be shopping for basic Roomba alternatives or entry-level Roborock models without mopping capabilities. For anyone with hard floors who wants genuinely effective mopping rather than just a damp pad being dragged around, or for pet owners dealing with constant hair and dander, the combination of strong suction, anti-tangle brushes, and continuous mop maintenance addresses the specific pain points that cause people to abandon their robot vacuums after a few months of use.

Where the S20 is built for comprehensive floor care with its mopping system and hefty base station, the K11+ takes the opposite approach by prioritizing compactness and affordability while maintaining the features that matter most for vacuum-only cleaning. At 24.8 cm in diameter, SwitchBot is billing this as the world\u2019s smallest self-emptying robot vacuum, and that measurement puts it noticeably below the industry standard of around 35 cm for most competitors. The 9.2 cm height is equally significant, allowing it to slip under furniture and into spaces where standard-sized robots simply can\u2019t reach. This isn\u2019t just marketing spin; apartments with low-clearance sofas, bed frames with minimal ground clearance, or densely furnished rooms with narrow pathways between furniture legs represent genuine use cases where a smaller robot can clean areas that would otherwise require manual vacuuming. The 6,000Pa suction is roughly 60% of what the S20 offers, but it\u2019s still competitive with popular models like the Eufy RoboVac series and significantly more powerful than older Roomba models that many people are still using. The dual anti-tangle brushes carry over from the S20, addressing the hair-wrapping problem that plagues cheaper vacuum-only models, and the 360-degree LiDAR navigation ensures it\u2019s mapping rooms and planning efficient paths rather than bouncing randomly like budget robots. The self-emptying base with a 4L dust bag capacity maintains the 90-day hands-free operation that makes robot vacuums genuinely practical rather than just novelties that need constant attention. Quiet Mode at 45dB is particularly relevant for this size category, as smaller robots in studio apartments or compact homes are operating in closer proximity to living and sleeping areas where noise becomes more intrusive. The Matter 1.4 support matches the S20\u2019s smart home integration capabilities, which is notable given how many budget-tier robot vacuums still rely on proprietary apps or clunky voice assistant workarounds. The K11+ can be controlled natively through Apple Home, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa without requiring SwitchBot\u2019s Hub as an intermediary, putting it on equal footing with premium models in terms of ecosystem flexibility. For anyone living in a space where a full-sized robot vacuum feels like overkill or physically won\u2019t fit, or for those who already have a mopping solution and just need competent vacuuming, this represents the core robot vacuum experience stripped down to essentials without sacrificing the automation features that make these devices worthwhile in the first place. The $199.99 Black Friday price for a self-emptying robot vacuum with LiDAR navigation and Matter support would have seemed impossible even two years ago, when that combination of features was firmly in the $400-600 range. Most robot vacuums under $250 are either basic bump-and-run models without smart navigation, or vacuum-only designs without self-emptying capability that require manual dustbin emptying after every cleaning session. The K11+ delivers both advanced navigation and automatic dust collection at half the price of comparable options from established brands like Shark or even Roborock\u2019s budget line. The compact size also solves a specific problem that doesn\u2019t get enough attention in robot vacuum reviews: many people who live in smaller spaces or have furniture arrangements that create tight corridors simply can\u2019t use standard-sized robots effectively, leading to frequent manual interventions or large sections of floor that never get cleaned. For $140 less than the S20, you\u2019re giving up mopping capability and 40% of the suction power, but if you\u2019re primarily dealing with hardwood or low-pile carpet and don\u2019t need wet cleaning, those trade-offs buy you a smaller footprint that can actually reach everywhere in a compact living space. This is the robot vacuum for studio apartments, small condos, or anyone who wants automated floor cleaning without dedicating significant floor space to a large docking station or dealing with a robot that\u2019s constantly getting wedged under furniture.
