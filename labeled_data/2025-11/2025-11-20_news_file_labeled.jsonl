Sonos guards its pricing religiously throughout the year and refuses to discount even when competitors slash their prices for random sales events. Black Friday on Amazon is the only time Sonos loosens its grip on retail prices, and the Beam (second gen) soundbar just dropped to a new record low of $349, down from its usual $499. Only 16 units remain in stock for the black color at the time of writing, which tells you how quickly people are grabbing this deal. See at Amazon The Beam soundbar packs Dolby Atmos processing into a soundbar that measures just 25.6 inches wide, which means it fits under most TVs without dominating your entertainment center. Atmos creates a three-dimensional sound effect that places audio above, around, and beside you instead of just firing sound from the front. The soundbar uses psychoacoustic processing to bounce sound off your ceiling and walls and creates the impression of height channels without installing speakers overhead. Explosions in action movies feel like they\u2019re happening above you, rain sounds fall from the ceiling, and helicopters pass convincingly overhead. Sonos engineered the Beam soundbar with dedicated drivers for different frequency ranges including a center tweeter that\u2019s specifically responsible for crystal-clear dialogue reproduction. The clarity of the dialogue is enormously important in modern content, where mumbling actors and aggressive sound mixing often bury conversations under music and effects. The bass response is full of lively low-end that doesn\u2019t require a separate subwoofer, although Sonos does let you add their Sub if you want room-shaking bass when watching movies or listening to music. Setup, from unboxing to content with better audio, takes about five minutes. You connect one HDMI cable from the soundbar to your TV\u2019s eARC or ARC port, plug in the power cable, and the Sonos app will walk you through the rest. Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone\u2019s microphone to analyze your room\u2019s acoustics and then auto-adjusts the soundbar\u2019s output to compensate for room size, furniture placement, and wall materials. The Beam soundbar streams music, podcasts, radio, and audiobooks from just about every major service when your TV is off. You can use it as a dedicated music speaker throughout the day, then seamlessly switch to TV audio in the evening. AirPlay 2 support allows for direct streaming from an Apple device, while the Sonos app provides access to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens of other services. For voice control, you can use Alexa or Google Assistant built directly into the soundbar, adjusting volume, changing inputs, or controlling playback with ease and without the touch of a remote. Because of HDMI-CEC, your TV remote controls the Beam soundbars\u2019s volume automatically and saves you from having to juggle multiple remotes or programming universal controllers. The soundbar responds immediately to the volume buttons on your existing remote after you set it up, which makes the whole system feel integrated rather than cobbled together. At $349, the latest Beam soundbar is $150 off its usual price and undercuts a number of competing soundbars that offer similar features but notably worse sound quality. Sonos rarely discounts its products because they\u2019re worth their full value based on performance alone, but this Black Friday deal is a real doozy.

The Tiger Cubs are on the hunt \u2014 and they're ready to pounce on private market opportunities. Big-name asset managers such as Tiger Global, Coatue, and D1 \u2014 a group collectively known as Tiger Cubs, given their connections to the late Julian Robertson's Tiger Management \u2014 are back to investing in private markets, talking about start-ups, and fundraising for non-public strategies. These managers, once burned by the 2022 tech market rout, when soaring interest rates and plunging valuations forced them to retreat, are now riding the artificial intelligence boom in big-name tech stocks and late-stage private companies alike. In private markets specifically, there's been a slight uptick in the number of deals these crossover investors have done in 2025 compared to the last two years, and a significant jump in the size of checks they've been writing. PitchBook data shows that the median valuation of private companies in which Tiger Global has invested so far in 2025 is more than $2 billion, compared to roughly $300 million in 2022. The venture rounds and private deals these funds have done this year are, on average, significantly larger than what they were doing three years ago, according to PitchBook. Even with public equity markets as strong as ever, hitting record highs in late October before a dip at the start of the month, private markets are where hedge-fund stockpickers hoping to distinguish themselves from cheap index investors and run-of-the-mill mutual funds are flocking. D1 founder Dan Sundheim, who originally made his name in the industry compiling deep dives on potential short bets of public companies in an online investing forum, said \"public markets bring distraction and pressure\" to top startups. \"Many private companies would do better staying private,\" Sundheim said on a podcast with Stripe cofounder John Collison last month. The public markets are desperate for new entrants, but the \"IPO market is broken beyond repair,\" according to Coatue's founder, Philippe Laffont, who invests across both public and private tech companies. Investing in private companies has become an easier way to bet on long-term potential, he said, thanks in part to the efficiency and number of players in the public markets. Speaking at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference earlier this month, Laffont said an investor in a public stock has to ask, \"Not only do you believe in the future, but is it already priced in or not?\" In 2020 and 2021, these firms, especially Tiger Global, helped fuel sky-high valuations for startups with a plethora of bets across the board. The pain in 2022 forced these managers to do some soul-searching, and Tiger Global reworked its risk management processes. Now, even smaller Tiger Cubs have returned to private markets in recent times after a pause. Mala Gaonkar's SurgoCap was a part of iCapital's $820 million raise this summer. Gaonkar's former firm, longtime Tiger Cub Lone Pine Capital, resumed private-marketing investing last year when it backed Canva and travel platform Spotnana \u2014 the manager's first venture bets since late 2021. This year, the firm invested in Singapore payments startup Airwallex. Meanwhile, Maverick Capital's stand-alone private markets fund focused on AI, Maverick Silicon, has done eight deals since launching in mid-2024. Funds mentioned declined to comment. This isn't to say that these managers are selling all of their publicly traded stocks or that these funds just started investing in private AI companies. Tiger Global backed OpenAI in 2021, for example, at a valuation of $15.7 billion; the company is now worth more than 30 times that. Publicly traded chipmakers and tech giants investing in AI are among the top holdings for most of the Tiger Cubs, regulatory filings show, and Maverick Silicon's head, Andrew Homan, said at October's Robin Hood conference that public chipmakers like Nvidia and SK Hynix would be smart bets in the coming decade. Valuations for private companies like OpenAI and Anthropic continue to surge, though, and pure-play venture funds and crossover managers, such as the Tiger Cubs, are ready to put their billions of capital to work. \"As we like to say in this industry, it's on,\" said Tiger Global's founder, Chase Coleman, at the Robin Hood conference.

Professional monitors make everything look better but the price tags usually sting. Amazon just torched its profit margins on the LG Ultrafine 27-inch 4K monitor, dropping it to $177 from the usual $249 price. This move screams inventory clearance which means you\u2019re getting a legitimate 4K display for less than many 1080p monitors cost. The LG Ultrafine monitor delivers true 4K resolution with HDR10 support and 90% DCI-P3 color coverage that creative pros actually need. This record-low Black Friday price makes upgrading from your aging 1080p screen a no-brainer decision. See at Amazon With a native resolution of 3840\u00d72160, it packs four times the pixels of standard 1080p into the same-sized 27-inch display. You can easily set multiple windows side by side without straining to read tiny text or giving up readability. Spreadsheets show more rows and columns at once, code editors display more lines simultaneously, and photo editing reveals details that 1080p screens completely miss. IPS panel technology offers accurate colors and wide viewing angles that TN panels simply can\u2019t touch. Colors remain consistent even when you\u2019re viewing the screen from extreme angles, which matters a great deal when you work with clients or show content to others. The 1000:1 contrast ratio creates deeper blacks than typical budget monitors, which makes dark movie and game scenes richer. IPS response times have dramatically improved over the last few years, so you won\u2019t see ghosting or motion blur from this display like you did on older IPS displays HDR10 support brings compatible content to life with enhanced brightness and contrast. The likes of Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video stream HDR content that looks significantly better on this monitor compared to standard dynamic range displays. This monitor automatically jumps into HDR mode when it detects compatible content, then seamlessly flips back to SDR at all other times. Peak brightness reaches levels that will make the highlights pop without washing out the rest of the image. Minimized bezels around display edges means maximum utilization of screen real estate. Thin bezels create a cleaner aesthetic, adding to the modern, professional look of any desk. Borderless designs are great for multi-monitor setups since the gap between screens will be almost invisible. The white finish will match perfectly with Apple aesthetics if you\u2019re building a cohesive workspace; it works well with any setup, though. The matte screen coating helps reduce screen glare from windows and overhead lights, maintaining clarity of image in bright rooms. Reader Mode reduces blue light emission for extended reading sessions that don\u2019t strain your eyes. The mode shifts colors toward warmer tones that feel easier on your eyes during long workdays or late-night work sessions. Flicker Safe technology eliminates the invisible screen flickering that causes eye fatigue and headaches after hours of use. Put together, these create a display you can stare at for eight-plus hours without the burning, tired eyes that cheap monitors cause. Within the first week of using it, the reduction in eye strain is indeed noticeable. Both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs are available for maximum compatibility. Modern laptops, gaming consoles, desktop computers, and media devices can be connected directly with no need for an adapter. DisplayPort is capable of higher refresh rates and bandwidth than HDMI, though both inputs provide full 4K resolution at 60Hz. A pair of inputs allows the connection of two devices at once and switching with the onscreen menu. USB-C displays are significantly more expensive, so the use of traditional connectivity here keeps the price accessible while still providing full functionality. At $177 down from $249, this LG Ultrafine 27\u2033 4K monitor delivers professional specs at a price that undercuts basic 1080p displays. You\u2019re getting true 4K resolution, HDR10 support, 90% DCI-P3 color coverage, and IPS panel quality for 29% off the regular price.

Amazon\u2019s stock counter shows fewer than 12 units remaining at the time of writing this article which tells you everything about how fast the Sonos Ace headphones are moving at this Black Friday price. Premium wireless headphones solve the problem of airplane noise, open office chaos and commute soundtrack quality but most flagship models cost a fortune. The Sonos Ace just dropped to its lowest price ever at $279 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from the usual $399, which puts them at roughly half the cost of AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones. See at Amazon The Sonos Ace delivers spatial audio via Dolby Atmos which places instruments and vocals in a three-dimensional soundstage around your head. Dynamic head tracking shifts the audio positioning as you move, so the sound stays anchored to your device rather than rotating with your head. This tech creates an immersive listen that\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re sitting in a recording studio or a concert hall. It works great in those Atmos-mixed tracks on Apple Music or Tidal, where producers have placed elements on purpose in the spatial field. It\u2019s unusual that Sonos allows for lossless audio streaming over Bluetooth; most wireless headphones tend to compress audio to fit within Bluetooth\u2019s bandwidth limitations. The company also uses USB-C connectivity for true lossless playback when you want absolute audio fidelity. This dual approach means you get convenience when you need it and maximum quality when you\u2019re sitting down for critical listening. The ANC uses multiple microphones to analyze and neutralize external sounds across a wide frequency range. Sonos engineered the ANC to handle everything from low-frequency airplane engine drone to mid-range conversation noise. It also adjusts in real time to your surroundings, kicking cancellation harder or softer depending on the ambient noise. Transparency mode lets you hear your surroundings when needed, be it airport announcements or quick conversations. Battery life reaches 30 hours with ANC enabled which means you can fly cross-country multiple times before needing a charge. That endurance puts the Ace ahead of most competitors that struggle to hit 20 hours with noise cancellation running. The rapid charging feature gives you three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, saving you when you forgot to charge overnight. A full charge takes about three hours via USB-C\u00c2\u00a0and the headphones support charging while listening through the cable. The physical design focuses on all-day comfort: plush memory foam ear cushions are wrapped in soft vegan leather. Sonos shaped the headband and earcups to adapt to various head shapes, hairstyles, and even accessories such as glasses without causing pressure points. An adjustable headband extends smoothly to find that just-right fit, while earcups rotate to keep up with the angle of your head. At $279, the Sonos Ace costs roughly half what you\u2019d pay for AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones and delivers comparable or superior features in several areas. The fact that Amazon has fewer than 12 units left at this record low price suggests other people have already figured out this value equation.

Cloud storage subscriptions will drain your budget month after month and leave you dependent on internet connectivity to access your own files. The Seagate 22TB HDD offers enough capacity for massive photo libraries and years of accumulated digital content in one device, and Amazon just dropped this drive to a record low of $229 for Black Friday, and while that compares to a typical $249 price, this same drive sold for $599 until just days ago. That represents a 60% discount from the price you\u2019ve seen throughout the past year and the lowest this capacity has ever cost. See at Amazon The huge 22-terabyte capacity stores around 5,500 hours of HD video, 5.5 million high-resolution photos, or 440,000 songs at resolutions without compression or quality loss. With this much space, you can keep everything instead of making painstaking choices over what to delete or archive. Professional photographers maintain RAW file libraries spanning entire careers without resorting to cloud services. Video editors store entire project files complete with all source footage, renders, and iterations available instantly. It handles 4K and even 8K video projects that consume hundreds of gigabytes per hour of footage. USB 3.0 connectivity delivers transfer speeds up to 5 Gbps under ideal conditions; you could be moving large files in minutes, not hours. The real world, of course, will vary depending on the USB implementation on your host computer and the drive\u2019s mechanical performance, but sustained transfers of about 100-150 MB per second for sequential file operations are within reason. This speed manages general backup tasks efficiently without tying up your computer for extended periods. Transfers of large files, such as moving an entire photo shoot or backing up a video project, complete within reasonable time frames. Seagate includes Rescue Data Recovery Services that provide professional data recovery should the drive fail mechanically or suffer logical corruption. This service covers the cost of laboratory recovery attempts that cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars if you were to buy them separately. It\u2019s the peace of mind when you\u2019re storing family photos, work for clients, or a lifetime of creative work on a single device. The plug-and-play design instantly works with Windows and Mac computers, requiring no software installation or complicated setup procedures. It means that Windows will immediately recognize the drive and assign a drive letter to it, ready for use. If you are a Mac user, you can easily reformat it to APFS or HFS+, although it will ship formatted for compatibility right out of the box. The drive\u2019s performance suits cold storage and archival purposes where you are writing data once and reading it occasionally, rather than running active databases or applications. Time Machine backups on Mac or File History on Windows work perfectly with this drive\u2019s speed characteristics. Media servers streaming video to local network devices perform well since the sequential read speeds handle multiple concurrent streams. Yes, this means that at $229, you are getting 22 terabytes of storage for just a little over $10 per terabyte. That is exceptional value that was not around at this price until now. The 60% discount from the $599 price that prevailed until recently brings enterprise-scale storage capacity to consumer budgets. This Black Friday deal has space enough to consolidate several smaller drives, cancel cloud storage subscriptions, or simply stop worrying about storage limitations for several years.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang didn\u2019t need any prompting on Wednesday to address the elephant in the room. \u201cThere's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\u201d he said on an earnings call before quickly getting to his main point: \u201cFrom our vantage point, we see something very different.\u201d Huang went on to spend about five minutes trying to explain how the chipmaker, which has soared to become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company over the past three years, would be able to sustain unprecedented customer demand. His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. \u201cAll industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,\u201d will need Nvidia\u2019s products, Huang said. The CEO\u2019s pep talk ultimately drew mixed reactions from Wall Street. Nvidia shares have fallen about 10 percent in recent weeks after hitting an all-time high in late October. Shares budged up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Nvidia reported record quarterly sales and Huang made his anti-bubble comments. But the increase was not enough to fully make up for the recent sell-off. Nvidia has enjoyed three years of booming success since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and caused a massive surge in demand for the company\u2019s GPUs, which are used to train and operate generative AI systems. Nvidia dominates the global market for GPUs, and its latest releases have become highly sought after, with demand far exceeding supply. On Wednesday, Nvidia executives reiterated that it has about $500 billion in unfilled orders. The company has used its newfound wealth to buy back its own shares and invest billions of dollars in AI companies, including top users and customers of its chips such as ChatGPT developer OpenAI, data center operator CoreWeave, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which develops the chatbot Grok. Nvidia\u2019s deals have fueled concerns among some investors that the company is unsustainably propping up sales. AI industry executives contend that partnering closely with Nvidia is crucial for getting access to chips and technical support, and that their revenues will eventually increase enough to fund their GPU purchases. On Wednesday\u2019s call, Huang addressed a financial analyst\u2019s question about the rationale for investing in companies such as OpenAI. \u201cThe partnership that we have with them is one so that we could work even deeper from a technical perspective, so that we could support their accelerated growth,\u201d Huang said. \u201cI fully expect that investment to translate to extraordinary returns.\u201d He added that Nvidia this week had invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic \u201cto have a deep partnership with them\u201d and bring its Claude chatbot onto Nvidia chips for the first time. This parade of partnerships may not be ending any time soon. \u201cThe number of customers coming to us and the number of platforms coming to us after they've explored others, is increasing, not decreasing,\u201d Huang said. Demand in the most recent quarter propelled Nvidia to sales and profit of $57 billion and nearly $32 billion, respectively. Nvidia said it expects $65 billion in sales during the current quarter, exceeding the $62 billion estimate projected by Wall Street analysts. While Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue each of the past two fiscal years, the company projects that growth will slow to 64 percent when the company\u2019s current fiscal year ends in January. Another concern among some investors is that electricity and supply chain constraints could slow down data center construction and curb Nvidia\u2019s GPU sales in coming years. About 90 percent of Nvidia\u2019s sales, which were once dominated by chips for personal gaming computers, now come from its data center business.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"The fresh data arrives about six weeks after its initially scheduled release. Employers hired far more workers than expected in September, defying a sharp slowdown over the summer that appeared to cool off the labor market. The U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure marked an acceleration from the previous month, and it exceeded an average of nearly 100,000 jobs added per month over the first half of 2025. The report included a downward revision for the month of August, however, slashing performance from 22,000 jobs gained that month to 4,000 jobs lost. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%, which marks the highest level since October 2021. Still, the unemployment rate remains low by historical standards. A stock market selloff over recent days underscored the uncertainty looming over the economy as some investors warned of an AI bubble. Blockbuster earnings unveiled by chip giant Nvidia late Wednesday, however, appeared to rebuke such concerns. Mass layoffs at corporate giants like Amazon, UPS and Verizon in recent weeks have drawn attention to a sluggish labor market -- and stoked fears that job losses may spread. It is likely too early to panic, however, some economists previously told ABC News. While the layoffs reflect a weakened labor market and AI adoption in some corners of the tech industry, they added, the prospect of wider job losses remains highly uncertain. Inflation has picked up in recent months while hiring has slowed, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as \"stagflation.\" Those economic conditions have put the Federal Reserve in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. \u201cWe have the situation where the risks are to the upside for inflation and to the downside for employment. We have one tool,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. \u201cYou can\u2019t address both of those at once.\u201d Still, Powell said, concern has tilted toward strain in the labor market, prompting the central bank to reduce interest rates a quarter of a percentage point at each of its last two meetings. \"A further reduction of the policy rate in December is not a foregone conclusion -- in fact, far from it,\" Powell told reporters. Traders peg the chances interest rates will be left unchanged next month at about 66%, while the odds of a quarter-point rate cut stand at 33%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said it would not release a full jobs report for the month of October due to lost capacity during the shutdown. Rather, partial jobs data for October will be released as part of the November report, the BLS said. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}
{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"U.S. stocks whipsawed, with the blue-chip Dow swinging through 1,000 points, before closing lower. Bolstered by strong earnings from artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia and discount retailer Walmart, stocks opened higher and the Dow climbed 700 points. However, stocks slowly started losing ground after the delayed September jobs report appeared to dash hopes for another rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next month. At the close, the Dow was down 386.51 points, or 0.84%, at 45,752.26. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended down 486.181 points, or 2.16%, at 22,078.048 and the broad S&P 500 dropped 103.40 points, or 1.56%, to 6,538.76. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.098%. The employment report, originally due in early October but delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added in September and the unemployment rate inching up a tenth to 4.4%. The data were much better than the 51,000 new jobs some economists had expected, but job gains for July and August were revised down by 33,000, making the picture more mixed. \"Given the Fed's recent hawkish shift and the lack of official data scheduled before (its Dec. 10 meeting), it is understandable that the market thinks the next move won't come until early 2026,\" wrote James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING. The CME Fedwatch tool, which measures the chances investors see for a rate move, show a nearly 40% chance for a rate cut in December. Despite recent hype of an AI bubble, many analysts said they don't see it. \"This question of a bubble being suggested by some is easy to refute,\" said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. \"After all, after the headlines settle,\u00a0stocks ultimately trade on earnings.\" And Nvidia proved its earnings chops, analysts said. \"NVIDIA is miles ahead of any competition in the space with a huge knowledge and intellectual property moat,\" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. \"Whether it was by plan or happenstance, NVIDIA has the right product for the right moment...NVIDIA earnings were not just good, they were a loud 'told you so.'\" In fact, corporate earnings were strong across the board, said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. \"Heading into third quarter, analysts expected just 6% earnings growth,\" she said. \"Now that Nvidia released earnings...we can firmly report that actual results came in more than double that, marking the strongest quarter\" since the last three months of 2021. Uncertainty is the stock market's worst friend, analysts said. Even with Nvidia's results calming some of the AI bubble talk, the outlook is still cloudy, they said. \"Investors looking for an explanation for the current\u00a0market\u00a0pullback should look no further than the recent uncertainties that have resurfaced,\" said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at trading platform eToro. \"Questions around the Fed\u2019s interest-rate\u00a0path, labor\u00a0market, legal ruling on tariffs, and\u00a0government shutdown are just a few of them.\u00a0Markets don\u2019t like uncertainty, and when it rises, we often see volatility as a result.\" The biggest issue, he said, is the market's flying blind on the health of the economy. \"Not only did investors and the Fed have to forgo most major economic reports for more than a month, the incomplete picture we\u2019re receiving makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the economy,\" Kenwell said. The government said it wouldn't release an October jobs report ever because no data were collected last month due to the shutdown. No one can say for certain if the market will rally again soon, but stocks have history on its side. The market's entering \"what\u2019s typically a seasonally strong stretch,\" Kenwell said. Historically, stocks rally at the end of the year, spawning the phrase \"Santa Claus rally.\" The Dow has risen 77% of the time from the day after Christmas through the first two trading days of January. The\u00a0S&P 500 has had a positive return in this period 79% of the time since 1950, with an average return of 1.3%. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        The White House and European leaders rarely see eye-to-eye on much, but they are gradually finding common ground on the issue of deregulating AI companies to spur even more unfettered development. The EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, announced on Wednesday that it wants to \u201csimplify\u201d its AI and privacy laws. The move is impacting two major pieces of European tech regulation that have had a global impact: the first-of-its-kind AI Act of 2024 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive online privacy law that reshaped the internet when it passed in 2018. For the GDPR, that\u2019s going to look like slashing data privacy laws for the sake of AI. Under the proposed changes, tech companies will have more leeway to use anonymized user data to train their AI models. \u201cArtificial intelligence is becoming a driving force of our economies, both in the tech sector and beyond, as it provides new solutions across industries. To be able to compete in this new global market, the EU must be able to fuel AI with high-quality data,\u201d the Commission wrote while explaining the new changes. The bloc\u2019s sweeping cookie laws will also get a revamp. That set of regulations was to blame for the global influx of cookie pop-ups, as many companies found it easier to switch their systems completely rather than create a Europe-specific version of their websites. If the new proposals are accepted, the EU will reduce the pop-ups by allowing users to save their cookie preferences in browsers, in a move that was largely expected for some time now. For the landmark AI Act, that simplification would include delaying the enforcement of some key facets. Although it went into law in 2024, the act\u2019s stricter rules on AI systems that have been deemed \u201chigh-risk\u201d were going to be applied after a grace period ending in August 2026. The latest proposal wants to delay that until \u201cstandards, specifications and guidelines are in place,\u201d the Commission\u2019s executive vice-president Henna Virkkunen said in remarks. High-risk AI includes technology that is used to profile people in use cases like biometrics, job applications, border control, and more. These proposals are not law yet. They will first be submitted to the European Parliament, where they need the approval of a qualified majority. The main objective of this regulatory loosening is to boost European tech competitiveness, the Commission said, and Wednesday\u2019s proposals are apparently only \u201cthe first step.\u201d While it\u2019s not certain how much the Trump administration\u2019s pro-tech anti-regulation push has impacted the European Commission\u2019s thinking, one official wasn\u2019t afraid to make the connection. \u201cNo one is fooled over the transatlantic origin of these attempts,\u201d the EU\u2019s former commissioner for the internal market Thierry Breton wrote in an op-ed published by the Guardian. \u201cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let ourselves be intimidated.\u201d President Trump has defined the EU\u2019s attempts to regulate American tech as \u201coverseas extortion,\u201d and made fighting it a central point of his trade offensive against the EU. Standing ten toes behind him in this fight are Silicon Valley giants. \u201cEurope has an ever-increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there,\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies.\u201d Meanwhile, it\u2019s been a good day for AI companies stateside as well. Republicans are gunning for a moratorium on state AI laws, either as a standalone bill or to be added to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is likely to be finalized soon and voted on next month. Trump posted in support of that in his Truth Social account on Tuesday night, saying that \u201cwe MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\u201d It\u2019s not clear, though, if that moratorium request would pass. A similar Republican attempt to add a moratorium in the Big Beautiful Bill fell through, mostly because of worries that it would help AI companies evade regulation on child safety laws. But in his second term, Trump has been no fan of waiting for Congress to advise and consent. On Wednesday, The Verge obtained a draft of an executive order that the President is reportedly expected to sign as soon as Friday. The order would create an \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI Litigation Task Force\u00e2\u0080\u009d that would be charged with suing states over laws that are determined to obstruct the progress of Big Tech\u2019s AI development. But this time around, while Congress ponders that moratorium, a pro-AI group is forming on the sidelines. According to Axios, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema will be co-chairing a new group that wants to \u201cpush back\u201d on scrutiny of the AI industry. Called the AI Infrastructure Coalition, the organization will officially launch on Wednesday evening. The members allegedly include the usual pro-AI suspects like Andreessen Horowitz, Cisco, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and some energy companies.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Even in challenging times, Walmart continues to deliver solid results. The retail giant reported strong sales for the third quarter, with total revenue increasing 5.8% year-over-year and US same-store sales rising 4.5%, surpassing analysts' expectations. Its US e-commerce division saw a 28% increase from the same period last year. \"We're gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well. We're well-positioned for a strong finish to the year and beyond that, thanks to our associates,\" outgoing CEO Doug McMillon said. McMillon is set to retire in January and be succeeded by John Furner, who heads-up the company's US division. Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, and more than one in four grocery dollars in the US is spent at one of Walmart stores. That scale gives the company a unique lens into the financial health of American households. McMillon said on the call that spending among upper- and middle-income customers remains robust, though lower-income shoppers have been \"under additional pressure of late.\" The chain has benefited from higher-income shoppers who are increasingly shopping at Walmart to save money, and the company has been focused on keeping prices down for consumers in the face of inflation. McMillon said the company now has more than 7,400 active price discounts, and that more than 2,000 temporary cuts have become permanent so far this year. Incoming CEO Furner also said that tariffs have wound up having less of an impact than the company expected earlier in the year. Its strong results this quarter mark a bright spot in an otherwise uncertain retail sector. \"The mood music coming from the nation's largest retailer continues to be extremely upbeat,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \"Walmart continues to advance both its sales line and share of the market. Of course, the tune that plays for Walmart may not be the one that plays for all retailers, which is testament to Walmart's focus and discipline,\" Saunders added. In a way, the tough times for everyone else continue to be a boon for Walmart. \"I think Walmart is better insulated than just about anybody, given the value proposition that we have,\" CFO John David Rainey said. \"If there's more pressure on the consumer, they're only going to become more so.\" Walmart's stock rose in premarket trading, climbing around 2.4% around an hour before the market open.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        A federal jury in San Francisco convicted two executives Tuesday at California-based telehealth company Done for their roles in illegally distributing Adderall and other stimulants online to patients, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Ruthia He, founder and CEO of Done Global, and David Brody, the clinical president of Done Health, were each convicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, four counts of distribution of controlled substances, and one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, according to a press release from DOJ. He was also convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice. The company bought over $40 million of what DOJ called \u201cdeceptive advertisements\u201d on social media to promote its sale of ADHD medications during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, starting in 2020. He, the founder of the company, had no medical training but was responsible for approving clinical practices. He and Brody also bought targeted search ads aimed at people who wanted to get ADHD meds without a legal prescription. The company paid nurse practitioners up to $60,000 per month to refill prescriptions and set up an \u00e2\u0080\u009cauto-refill\u00e2\u0080\u009d technology that allowed for automated refills without follow-ups from the clinic, according to DOJ. He, Brody, and others also conspired to defraud insurers, according to DOJ, by allowing people to get reimbursed for Adderall prescriptions at pharmacies. DOJ also alleged that He and Brody told nurses to keep prescribing Adderall to people who were abusing other medications. Done continued to provide Adderall to patients even after family members contacted the company because their loved ones were experiencing bipolar episodes, Adderall-induced psychosis, or other mental health conditions while taking the drugs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis case represents one of the most egregious abuses of telehealth we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Christian J. Schrank of the HHS Office of Inspector General. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe defendants built a brazen business model based on addiction, deception, and disregard for patient safety\u00e2\u0080\u0094flooding the market with controlled substances while defrauding federal health care programs,\u201d continued Schrank. \u201cTheir intentional disregard for patient safety and the law put lives at risk and eroded public trust in digital medicine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Reuters notes, it\u2019s the first illegal drug prosecution of a telehealth company. Done denied that its executives had done anything wrong in a statement to Gizmodo after He and Brody were arrested in July 2024. \u201cDone Global strongly disagrees with the criminal charges filed last week against our founder, Ruthia He, and Dr. David Brody, which are based on events that principally occurred between February 2020 and January 2023,\u201d the company said at the time. \u201cSince our founding, Done Global has worked to make mental health care accessible for tens of thousands of Americans trapped in a spiraling national crisis. Done Global will continue to operate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and do everything in our power to ensure that tens of thousands of Americans that rely on us do not lose access to their mental health care. At the same time, we will continue to support our clinicians as they exercise independent clinical judgment, practice evidence-based medicine, and provide best-in-class health care.\u201d Gizmodo reached out for comment Wednesday but didn\u2019t immediately hear back. Brody and He both face up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 25, 2026. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fraudulent acts of He and Brody led to clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 substance abuse, addiction and, in some cases, overdose,\u201d said Harry T. Chavis from the IRS Criminal Investigation New York said in a statement posted online. \u201cInstead of putting the care of their customers first, they prioritized their own greed by fraudulently prescribing more that $100 million worth of Adderall and other stimulants. These were shameful acts, and a jury of their peers agreed. Both He and Brody will now face the consequences of this egregious fraud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Explore more on these topics    Share this story           Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

The US added 119,000 jobs in September, far more than the 53,000 economists expected, and unemployment unexpectedly increased to 4.4% from 4.3%. August's job growth was revised from a gain of 22,000 to a loss of 4,000, and July's growth was revised from a gain of 79,000 to 72,000. \"With these revisions, employment in July and August combined is 33,000 lower than previously reported,\" BLS said. Economists expected the unemployment rate to remain steady after two consecutive months of 0.1 percentage point increases. Unemployment has been at least 4% since May 2024. Labor force participation increased to 62.4% from 62.3% in August. The bulk of the job growth came from a handful of sectors. Leisure and hospitality added 47,000 jobs, healthcare and social assistance together added about 57,000 jobs, and state and local governments added about 25,000 jobs. Most other sectors were flat or saw declines. The federal government had a net loss of 3,000. Transportation and warehousing, manufacturing, and professional and business services also had a decline in September. Wage growth was steady; average hourly earnings rose 3.8% from a year ago, as they did in August. Earnings increased 0.2% over the month. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said what's considered a \"good jobs report\" will need to continue evolving because \"jobs gains are moderating, things are getting a little weaker, but also labor supply is getting weaker.\" \"The real question is, which ones shrink faster, or do they shrink in line with each other?\" Stahle said. \"As long as they shrink in line with each other, you can keep people in jobs. But, if you start to see a case where jobs are shrinking faster than the people who want those jobs, that becomes much more concerning.\" The longest government shutdown in US history delayed the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs report, originally scheduled for October 3. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday there won't be an October jobs report, which would have been released at the start of November barring the shutdown. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said recently that payroll estimates for last month can still be calculated, but \"we will never know what the unemployment rate was in October.\" While payrolls are based on a survey of businesses and government agencies that likely still have their October employment records and can report those to the BLS, unemployment is based on a survey of households, which wasn't collected during the shutdown. The agency said it will extend the data collection period for November and will publish that report on a delay, but still in December. Private data providers like ADP, Revelio Labs, and others were able to partially fill the gap for September and October hiring changes, but economists and market watchers have been eagerly awaiting the delayed official figures. The Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting is scheduled to be the last one of the year. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points in September and October. CME FedWatch, which shows the chances of the Fed changing rates, indicated after the jobs report a roughly 65% chance that rates would be held steady, a slight tick down from before the release. Stahle said he doesn't think the Fed's concern about the labor market's performance will dissipate just because of the strong job growth in September. He said real-time data still indicate a cooling job market. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Black Friday is here early, as the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones get $200 chopped off the price.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you're in need of a serious headphones deal, Amazon's Black Friday sale may have you covered. The retailer has chopped 44% off the price of the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones, which are our top pick for the headphones with the best battery life. While they normally retail for $450, this deal chops $200 off that sticker price, making them significantly more competitive when compared with rivals. The Momentum 4s offer up to a whopping 60 hours of battery life, in addition to offering Sennheiser's premium-level audio quality, active noise cancellation, and a wide range of other useful, modern features. Beyond their overpowered battery life, the Momentum 4 headphones also include multi-point connections and easy-to-use touch controls for managing volume and playback. They also sport a particularly luxurious design that makes them well worth the high price tag, and you really can't go wrong with getting almost half off. Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones: $449.95 $249.95 for Amazon's early Black Friday deals \u2705Recommended if: you're looking for a pair of premium wireless headphones, but you don't want to pay the high price tag they typically come with; you want the wireless headphones with the best battery life on the market, and you want them at a serious discount; you're looking for a comfortable pair of wireless headphones with relatively large speaker cups that can easily fit all the way over most peoples' ears. \u274cSkip this deal if: you're looking for a budget pair of headphones and you don't care about foregoing features like ANC, EQ settings, or an overall premium-level audio quality; you need a pair of headphones with a better EQ system than a three-band EQ; you prefer the ability to customize controls on your headphones. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 wireless headphones are no joke within the modern headphone market, offering a wide range of features and powerful audio quality that buyers usually love. Perhaps the biggest upside to the Momentum 4s, however, is their super-long battery life, which can offer users up to 60 hours of playtime per charge. Beyond that, they also include ANC, touch controls, hi-resolution audio via the headphone jack, auto-pause when removed, and simple touch controls using the right speaker can. They also include an easy-to-use Sennheiser mobile app, which offers users the ability to manage ANC settings, a three-band EQ, and more. Unlike some wireless headphones, they also have a rotating foldable design that makes them easy to store, as well as carrying case for the headphones themselves, an aux cable, and the USB-C charging cable.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"A gold toilet that fetched $12.1m (\u00a39.3m) at auction was bought by Ripley's Believe It or Not!, after its first casting was stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019. America, created by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, is a fully functional toilet, made from more than 15st 13lb (101.2kg) of solid 18-carat gold. The first version of the work was initially installed in a public bathroom at the  Guggenheim museum in New York in 2016 but hit the news again three years later when a gang of thieves stole it from the Oxfordshire palace.  The existence of a second golden toilet was later revealed, and went under the hammer at Sotheby's in New York City on Tuesday. The 101 kg toilet received just one bid.  The auction house said that in a world first, the starting bid would be determined by the exact price of its weight in gold, at about $10m (\u00a37.6m). While it only said it was bought by a famous American brand, Ripley's Believe It or Not! later revealed themselves as the mystery buyer in an Instagram post, writing \"we're flush with excitement\". The entertainment company runs attractions including museums of oddities and aquariums around the world. It made headlines in 2022 for allowing celebrity and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian to wear a dress owned by Marilyn Monroe to the Met Gala. Now, their team say they are \"exploring possibilities\" as to whether guests will ever be permitted to \"take the ultimate golden seat\". \"Such an opportunity requires serious planning and someone brave enough to ensure everything keeps flowing in the right direction,\" Ripley's added. The artwork achieved the second highest price for a Cattelan piece at auction. His sculpture of a kneeling Hitler sold for $17.2m (\u00a311.9m) in 2016. It is estimated more than 100,000 people used the first toilet while it was at the Guggenheim before it was moved and exhibited at Blenheim Palace. It was there that in the early hours of 14 September 2019, five men smashed their way in, ripped out the \u00a34.8m solid gold installation and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf. The heist and the trial that followed made news across the world.     James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary in March. Both were both jailed earlier this year. Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was also convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property and given a suspended sentence. Sotheby's revealed that Cattelan created three toilets in 2016, with the second version on display in a bathroom at New York's Breuer Building until it went under the hammer. The auction house described it as a \"cultural phenomenon\" and an \"incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value\". David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's New York, called it Cattelan's \"tour de force\". \"Holding both a proverbial and literal mirror to the art world, the work confronts the most uncomfortable questions about art, and the belief systems held sacred to the institutions of the market and the museum,\" he said. On the same evening a portrait by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was sold for $236.4m (\u00a3179m), making it the second most expensive piece ever sold at auction.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Nvidia's blockbuster earnings just blew a hole through Wall Street's AI bubble anxieties. Analysts said the chipmaker's third-quarter results prove the AI boom is nowhere near running out of steam. On Wednesday, Nvidia posted $57 billion in revenue, topping Wall Street's $55 billion estimates. Its data center division generated revenue of $51 billion, surpassing the $49.31 billion analysts had projected. The company reported earnings of $1.30 per share compared to the $1.26 estimate. It also forecast $65 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations of $61.98 billion. Nvidia's stock rose more than 5% in premarket trading on Thursday. \"Fears of an AI bubble are way overstated,\" Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote after the print. The tech bull called the results a \"pop-the-champagne moment\" for tech investors. \"This is another validation point for the AI revolution,\" Ives wrote. \"We are in the top of the third inning of this AI game.\" Other analysts echoed that view. Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said Nvidia's report shows the AI revolution is \"nowhere near its peak,\" with both demand and supply chain scaling continuing. Despite concerns that ballooning capital expenditures \u2014 estimated at more than $400 billion across top cloud platforms \u2014 could lead to a slowdown, Monteiro said Nvidia's numbers show that tech companies remain committed to scaling their data centers. Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said investors remain wary of what he calls the \"three C's\" \u2014 capex sustainability, circular financing, and rising competition. \"While these issues were not put to rest, the recent print does give investors confidence that Nvidia is still executing at a high level,\" he wrote. Nvidia's results suggest those fears can at least be \"punted\" into the next quarter, he added. EMARKETER tech analyst Jacob Bourne told Business Insider that while Nvidia \"delivered another blockbuster quarter,\" investors are increasingly focused on whether physical constraints \u2014 including power availability, land, and grid access \u2014 may limit how quickly hyperscalers can turn GPU capacity into actual revenue. During the earnings call, Nvidia reiterated that it has \"half a trillion\" in Blackwell and Rubin chip revenue on the books through 2026. \"We'll probably be taking more orders,\" said Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, noting that new customers \u2014 including Anthropic following its recent deal \u2014 would add demand. \"There's definitely an opportunity for us to have more on top of the $500 billion that we announced,\" she added. CEO Jensen Huang revealed at Nvidia's October GTC conference that the company has $500 billion worth of AI-chip orders booked for 2025 and 2026, including orders for Blackwell, its most powerful chip, and Rubin, which is set to surpass it when it launches next year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Huang said in Nvidia's earnings release. Jefferies' analysts said that Nvidia's Blackwell GB300 GPU sales, which accounted for two-thirds of Blackwell sales, were \"very strong.\" \"Nvidia answered the bell with GB300 shipments driving healthy upside to estimates,\" they wrote. They said that Nvidia's results \"should help steady the ship\" for AI stocks into the end of the year. \"Commentary around cloud service providers being sold out across the board and full utilization for Blackwell, Hopper, and even Ampere should help put the useful life conversation to bed,\" the analysts added. The Nvidia CEO kicked off his remarks on Wednesday by taking aim at the \"AI bubble\" chatter. \"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" said Huang, who is a longtime AI bull. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\" Some tech leaders have been warning that AI may be in bubble territory. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in October that the market could be in the middle of an AI bubble. \"The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable,\" Gates said in an appearance on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\". \"But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\" \"There are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends,\" he added. Michael Burry, the contrarian investor who called and profited from the 2008 financial crisis, has also been warning about AI market mania \u2014 and betting against Nvidia. Others, like Huang, have pushed back on the AI bubble narrative. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in July that the AI frenzy may resemble a bubble, but that doesn't mean it is one in reality. \"I think it's unlikely, based on my experience, that this is a bubble,\" Schmidt said during an appearance at the RAISE Summit in Paris. \"It's much more likely that you're seeing a whole new industrial structure.\" Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said both sides of the debate could take something away from Nvidia's earnings. \"Overall the bulls got what they wanted last night, while bearish investors (hello, Michael Burry) will still be able to argue that such exuberant spending will ultimately end in tears,\" he said.

In the age of AI, former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has some very human job-seeking advice for his two teenage daughters. It boils down to: You might soon be managing an AI bot, but that doesn't mean you should become robotic yourself. Speaking at Bloomberg's New Economy Forum in Singapore on Wednesday, Sunak said it's \"critical\" for people to master \"AI literacy skills\" so they don't lose their role to someone who is proficient with AI. Alongside using AI tools, he said his advice to his daughters is to develop \"human-to-human interaction\" skills such as empathy and critical thinking. \"We're never going to lose the importance of being able to think, to reason, to question critically, so I think those skills will be incredibly important for our young people to develop,\" said Sunak, who added that his view on skills and the job market is informed by the work of Stanford economists as well as LinkedIn data. \"And so I'd make sure that my girls spend time developing those skills as they grow up,\" he added. Sunak's comments come as tech leaders, such as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, have warned that AI could squeeze the entry-level job market for white-collar workers. Since his tenure as UK prime minister ended in July 2024, Sunak has taken on advisory roles at Microsoft, Anthropic, and Goldman Sachs. The former prime minister also joined a growing crowd of people predicting that workers will have to learn how to manage teams of AI agents, which are software programs that can autonomously handle tasks. \"Everyone, whether you're a new graduate or a senior leader, is going to have to get used to managing a team of agents,\" he said, adding that the \"age of agents will come relatively quickly.\" He said that \"very young graduates\" will have to understand what it means to manage a team of AI agents, such as how they divide up tasks and how to verify the accuracy of the work they do. \"It will require, I think, a mindset to just keep learning and keep curious,\" Sunak said. While prime minister, Sunak hosted the UK's first AI Safety Summit in 2023, which attracted politicians like then-US Vice President Kamala Harris and tech leaders like Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Speaking at the Bloomberg event, Sunak said it's not incompatible for countries to adopt AI quickly and safely. He advocated for hands-off regulation of AI and said governments should instead work with AI labs to evaluate the technology's risks. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":" AMD  Fans of AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GPUs, which are typically more cost-effective than those made by Nvidia, might be in for some sticker shock in the near future. Team Red is likely to start raising the price of its goods. And unfortunately, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chance this will affect more than just your graphics card. As reported by VideoCardz, AMD has informed its partners of an impending price hike for its GPUs. Last month the company reportedly adjusted prices for its corporate partners to reflect changes in the market, though it managed to save retail customers from the shift. This time around, however, retail prices are likely to get hit. The culprit? Well, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been paying attention to the price fluctuations of computer components, you may already know: the cost of DRAM components, which provide the memory for computers and other electronics, is going up as the AI industry wolfs down the earth. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re familiar with what goes inside consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series machines, or even the upcoming Steam Machine, then you know AMD chips power those too. Retail prices haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone up just yet, but the prospect is frustrating.Sure, PC gaming has always been more expensive than just grabbing the latest Sony\/Microsoft\/Nintendo box and plugging it in, but it\u2019s continued to get worse. And given the central role AMD plays in all of these devices, PC gamers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones likely to get a haircut. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"It\u2019s likely that Hackaday readers have among them a greater than average number of people who can name one special thing they did on September 23rd, 2002. On that day a new web browser was released, Phoenix version 0.1, and it was a lightweight browser-only derivative of the hugely bloated Mozilla suite. Renamed a few times to become Firefox, it rose to challenge the once-mighty Microsoft Internet Explorer, only to in turn be overtaken by Google\u2019s Chrome. Now in 2025 it\u2019s a minority browser with an estimated market share just over 2%, and it\u2019s safe to say that Mozilla\u2019s take on AI and the use of advertising data has put them at odds with many of us who\u2019ve kept the faith since that September day 23 years ago. Over the last few months I\u2019ve been actively chasing alternatives, and it\u2019s with sadness that in November 2025, I can finally say I\u2019m Firefox-free.  It was perhaps inevitable that Firefox would lose market share when faced with a challenger from a player with the economic muscle of Google. Chrome is everywhere, it\u2019s the default browser in Android and ChromeOS, and when stacked up against the Internet Explorer of fifteen years or so ago it\u2019s not difficult to see why it made for an easy switch. Chrome is good, it\u2019s fast and responsive, it\u2019s friendly, and the majority of end users either don\u2019t care or don\u2019t know enough to care that it\u2019s Google\u2019s way in to your data. When it first appeared, they still had the \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d aura to them, even if perhaps behind the warm and fuzzy feeling it had already worn away in the company itself. If Firefox were destined to become a minority player then it could still be a successful one; after all, 2% of the global browser market still represents a huge number of users whose referrals to search engines return a decent income. But the key to being a success in any business is to know your customers, and sitting in front of this particular screen it\u2019s difficult to escape the conclusion that Mozilla have lost touch with theirs. To understand this it\u2019s necessary for all of us to look in the mirror and think for a moment about who uses Firefox. A quick straw poll in my hackerspace revealed a majority of Firefox users, while the same straw poll among another group of my non-hackerspace friends revealed none. The former used Firefox because of open-source vibes, while the latter used Edge or Safari because it came with their computer, or Chrome on their phone and on their desktop because of Google services. Hackaday is not a global polling organisation, but we think it\u2019s likely that the same trend would reveal itself more widely. If you\u2019re in the technology space you might use Firefox, but if you aren\u2019t you may not even have heard of it in 2025. It\u2019s difficult to see that changing any time soon, to imagine some killer feature that would make those Chrome, Safari, and Edge users care enough to switch to Firefox. To service and retain this loyal userbase then, you might imagine that Mozilla would address their needs and concerns with what made Phoenix a great first version back in 2002. A lightweight and versatile standards-compliant and open-source web browser with acceptable privacy standards, and without any other non-browser features attached to it. Just a browser, only a browser, and above all, a fast browser. Instead, Mozilla appear to be following a course calculated to alarm rather than retain these users. Making themselves an AI-focused organisation, neglecting their once-unbeatable developer network, and trying to sneak data gathering into their products. They appear now to think of themselves as a fad-driven Valley startup rather than the custodians of a valuable open-source package, and unsurprisingly this is concerning to those of us who know something about what a browser does behind the scenes. It is likely that I am preaching to the choir here, but it\u2019s\u00a0important that there be a plurality of browsers in the world. And by that I mean not just a plurality of front-ends, but a plurality of browser engines. One of the reasons Phoenix appeared all those years ago was to challenge the dominance of Microsoft Internet Explorer, the tool by which the Redmond software company were trying to shape the online world to their tune. If you remember the browser wars of that era, you\u2019ll have tales of incompatibilities seemingly baked in on purpose to break the chances of an open Web, and we were all poorer for it. Writing Javascript with a range of sections to deal with the quirks of different browser families is now largely a thing of the past, and for that you have the people who stuck with Firefox in the 2000s to thank. The fear is that here in 2025 we are in an analogous situation to the early 2000s, with Google replacing Microsoft. Such is the dominance of Google Chrome and the WebKit-derived Blink engine which powers it, that in effect, Google have immense power to shape the Web just as Microsoft did back in the day. Do you trust them to live up to their now-retired mission statement and not be evil? We can\u2019t say we do. Thus Firefox\u2019s Gecko browser engine is of crucial importance, representing as it does the only any-way serious challenger to Blink and WebKit\u2019s near-monopoly. That it is now tied to a Mozilla leadership treating it in so cavalier a manner does not bode well for the future of the Web. So I\u2019ve set out my stand here, that after twenty-three years, I\u2019m ready to abandon Firefox. It\u2019s not a decision that has been easy, because it\u2019s important for all of us that there be a plurality of browsers, but such is the direction being taken by Mozilla that I am not anxious to sit idly by and constantly keep an eye out for new hidden privacy and AI features to turn off with obscure checkboxes. In the following piece I\u2019ll take a look at my hunt for alternatives, and you may be surprised by the one I eventually picked. Firefox still supports uBlock Origin, Chrome does NOT.  I have switched to Firefox. Exactly, our rights are being eroded day by day and Chrome based browsers have done my dirty.  Firefox still allows for privacy, even if I have to spend 5 minutes unclicking all of the sponsored and invasive reporting crap\u2026that part irritates me a lot.  As for AI, I wholheartedly embrace our AI overlords and look to ways to make my life easier to manage and data easier to find.  Google search isn\u2019t what it used to be, direct searches do not surface exact matches anymore, and the first page is often just sponsored crap.  The lack of advertising, sponsored links, and \u201clook at me, eyeballs\u201d in ChatGPT has made it one of my first lines for internet searching. It\u2019s not just the user\u2019s data that\u2019s stolen when using Chrome. It also gathers metrics about any site you visit, even if that site is not using any Analytics, TagManager et al. Those data are not accessible to public research. The whole web is pwned by Google, and they are too big and too mighty to ever be questioned. You and the sites you\u2019re visiting are the product, not a valued customer. So, if you need chromium for some reason, use a non-Google one. I personally use two browsers, a chromium-based and Firefox. A popular application not performing well with FF is atlassian\/JIRA which I have to use a hundret times a day. They don\u2019t care, Mozilla doesn\u2019t seem to care. Fine, RAM is cheap, fire up two browsers. It would be nice to have a FF addon which embeds chromium within tagged tabs\u2026 Heartily seconded. FF all the way here. It might not be the fastest, it might not be the most full-featured, and it might not be the \u201ccoolest\u201d, but it respects my privacy far more than any other mainstream contender. I say \u201cmainstream\u201d because I\u2019ve considered switching to a fork like Waterfox or whatever, but is further fragmentation of an already-small userbase really in the interests of those of us who want to resist Chrome dominance? This is why I moved to opera, it\u2019s chromium based so has the advantages of webgpu support (firefox only just got this in July I think) But at the same time still has support for uBlock Origin \/ is more resistant to removing the older plugin api i was happy with chrome and then google started being evil so im back on firefox as well. i dont like change. its why i still design my 3d prints in an old version of 3dsmax, why i still haven\u2019t switched to linux or updated windows. i have no reason to change browsers at this juncture. +1, desktop and android So does Edge. Lots of chromium based browsers still do. And that\u2019s what makes Firefox so frustrating \u2013 they did everything they could to drive away users. And they end up surprised they have no users. And then they acquired an Ad Tech company created by former Meta engineers and slipped it in default enabled without telling people. Ublock is great, keeps Amazon off my search results. I consider two things essential for the web today \u2013 ublock origin, and Dark Reader (forces dark mode on sites). When chrome started becoming questionable, I moved to Opera, which uses chrome\u2019s core. However chrome went after ad blockers by altering how chrome\u2019s core worked, and browsers based on it would follow suit. At the time, Opera would not give an answer on whether it keep chrome\u2019s anti-ad block. So I moved to firefox which has its own core, and allowed adblockers. But likely many companies, Firebox is now having AI shoved everywhere it is not needed. I certainly don\u2019t blame anyone for switching but there are forks that remove such things. I\u2019ve been using Librewolf for many years now and will continue to. I still prefer Firefox but for me a fork that removes the things I don\u2019t want\/need has been and continues to be the answer. It would have been nice to include in the article which non-Firefox, non-Chrome based web browser Jenny settled on this November that\u2019s she\u2019s finally fully parted from Firefox. https:\/\/brave.com\/  maybe. We\u2019ll have to wait for the next episode to find out. Brave is Chromium-based and, while it is rather good at privacy, you should also know that its leadership is politically problematic. It\u2019s Hackaday\u2019s version of the cliffhanger, so you have to tune in again next week. I was thinking the same thing\u2026 click-bait article. Not really. Click-bait would be having some kind of sensational claim in the headline, causing you to want to click on the article itself. The article is usually rather un-sensational at that point. Clearly, here, the title states what the article is about, and that it is Part One, thus implying that there will be a Part Two. You don\u2019t have to \u201ctune in\u201d again next week at all. Unless you are eagerly awaiting the second part of the story, in which case you will get what is promised. If you are disappointed you can get a refund of your subscription fee at any time. I only keep portable Ungoogled Chromium for one of those edge cases where site refuses to work in Firefox. For everything else I can\u2019t imagine web without uBlock Origin. Google and their Manifest can fill their filthy asses with expanding AB foam. To be honest\u2026 I very rarely run into a website that doesn\u2019t work on Firefox\u2026 Usually the site itself is just a \u2018modern web experience\u2019 and is generally terrible and broken no matter what device or browser I try. \u2026.friggin\u2026. looking at you Home Depot\u2026. >:( ui design is lostech. I run into it a shocking amount. Probably about once a month. I\u2019ve been forced to use chromium browsers to sign up for benefits. Firefox 140.0 ESR on Fedora 29 KDE. No problems with Home Depot. I tried uBlock Origin a year or 2 ago. Initial setup was too daunting; I gave up after a few hours. I use NoScript, which is a nuisance but effective enough. After using it for more than two decades, nothing saddens me more than Firefox\u2019s demise but the truth is, Mozilla embracing the worst side of AI now is hardly relevant at this point. Firefox turned back on developers when they replaced powerful XUL extensions with what essentially was a copy of Chrome\u2019s crippled web extensions. And then again when they made signatures obligatory to run extensions on anything but nightly or unbranded releases, forcing people to use AMO whether they wanted or not. Mozilla ignored thousands of complaints, even those coming from the devs of the most downloaded extensions. They replaced freedom with restrictions in the name of \u201csecurity,\u201d much like Apple or Microsoft, and using the same excuse, too. I guess it was unavoidable they\u2019d abandon everything they ever stood for when most of their income comes from Google. You raise fair points, but just to put the record straight, Firefox does not force anyone to use AMO \u2013 if your extension is signed you can distribute it anyway you\u2019d like and it can be permanently installed on the release version. And talk about replacing \u2018freedom with restrictions in the name of \u201csecurity\u201d\u2018, remind me again which browser unilaterally came up with the MV3 spec and forced it down everyone\u2019s throat, and which one committed to continuing to support MV2 in response to complaints. Mozilla may not be perfect but if the alternative is to just cede the internet to the whims of a corporation that literally chose to abandon its pledge to not be evil, I for one will gladly stick with Firefox. Glad we got an employee perspective! Don\u2019t take it so personally bud, you didn\u2019t invent Firefox, you just work there the problem is everyone in tech is embracing ai and few are giving us an option to turn it off. airgap all the things. id like to see people start making operating systems and software that works well in an internet free environment. id like to see it become a major movement frankly. I still prefer Firefox developer\u2019s tools over chrome. It makes it easier to pull content out of sites that do not want you to. There are a few reasons why Firefox\u2019s market share fallen: \u2013 lack of marketing, when was the last time you seen an ad for firefox (not their whatever service, but firefox itself as a browser)? \u2013 their management trying to steal every last cent to themselves, just look at how their leadership\u2019s payroll increased tenfold in a few years \u2013 abysmal speed in the mid 2010s compared to webkit\/blink based browsers (luckily they overcome this) \u2013 lack of innovation (just look at chrome with their recent webusb\/webserial or even webmidi), Mozilla is not driving the web standards forward anymore \u2013 no competitor to electron\/nodejs (as much as I hate both) \u2013 random VPN \/ share \/ AI \/ junk services nobody needs, a browser should be a browser \u2013 giving up control over (or abandoning) profitable IP (RUST) (not to mention the servo project) \u2013 not to mention how they shoot themselves in the foot with the removal of NPAPI Firefox is in a downward spiral, less and less websites support it, thus less and less users it can get\/retain, thus less marketshare, thus less and less websites support it \u2026 The only reason it lives is because Google\u2019s support. But that was under attack not too long ago. Chrome obviously have the bigget market share as Google allready from day one where able to push Chrome both through their websites and as an ad in installers. But, I wonder how correct the numbers are, taking into account all the nerds using Firefox but have set the user-agent to Chrome to get a better experience on Googles websites. I do use Firefox, but haven\u2019t changed user-agent myself. Firefox itself is imho still alive but no longer well, it\u2019s Mozilla that\u2019s rotten to the core and that rot has now spread to Firefox. Unfortunately Mozilla has been rotten for decades now and I doubt we can turn things around. The management has been lining their pockets with easy money from Google\u2019s \u201cwe\u2019re not a monopoly if we keep the other guy alive\u201d payments to Mozilla and doing absolutely nothing with it. Firefox should be the main product and raison d\u2019\u00eatre for Mozilla, but when you look at what Mozilla does and how it advertises itself, Firefox seems to be mostly a footnote. Brother, I hear you. In addition to all the other complaints, I\u2019ve noticed several trends over the years that make firefox less and less attractive. They went from an inviting, warm color scheme (oranges and reds) to icy cold. Everything is now steel grey or icy blue, every time I use the product I want to scoot up next to the radiator. Setting the browser to reload the pages on restart is a complete PITA. By default it wants to use local cached pages, which doesn\u2019t work out for sites like Hackaday or the national weather service (or any news feed, or Slashdot). Then there\u2019s \u201cdelayed load\u201d which will only reload the tab when you bring it forward, because I totally want to do nothing for 10-15 seconds while each page loads, instead of having everything loaded in the background and ready for me when I want it. (Note: That last bit might be better now, I only upgrade firefox every compile of years and haven\u2019t looked at it recently.) Then it changed the extensions API and several of my favorite ones no longer work. You can no longer have a custom start page local to your computer, with links for things you frequently need, you can have an extension for that but it\u2019s locked down so that the extension can\u2019t blank the address bar and can\u2019t put the actual location of the file in the address bar and can\u2019t open the page with that address \u201cselected\u201d. And other things that made certain extensions very useful. They got rid of the search field and use the address bar as both address and search, because whenever I  typo an address I want to google search what I typed instead of showing an error. (But you can put the search field back with an extension, but if you do that the address bar still does searches.) I don\u2019t upgrade mozilla on a regular basis, for the simple reason that I don\u2019t want to spend 2 hours trying to find every obscure about:config setting needed to put the broswer back into the mode I\u2019m used to. I do that once, about every 2 years or so. I\u2019m about ready to dump firefox and try something else. WTF is this guy talking about? what AI? Yeah, I use firefox and I checked all the settings and the only AI thing I saw was \u201cuse ai to suggest tabs and a name for tab groups\u201d. Firefox might be constantly pushing browser ad-on services but I have not seen any AI forcibly integrated into my experience. If it tried I just clicked and disabled it immediately. I don\u2019t even remember.  Is it annoying when software adds questionable features in updates which you then have to remove? Yes. But I\u2019m also using windows and by comparison firefox is a dream. It feels like every day microsoft adds some BS thing to my start menu which takes half an hour to remove, an then like a weed it comes back over and over. Using debian package, see no AI. Mac and Windows users have already lost, so it doesn\u2019t really matter what they use. When Chrome first came out it was just faster than Firefox. I switched to it until Google started making me uncomfortable about a decade ago, and only go back to ungoogled chromium (like others said) when a website won\u2019t work with anything else. Even if Google didn\u2019t make me Squamish, I\u2019d stick with Firefox over chromiums because of the Manifest v3 stuff hamstringing adblockers. Looking forward to the next installment. I use Firefox home (Linux) and work (Windoze). I guess I don\u2019t see problems here.  I use the stock one with no extensions except those for blocking (ublock origin, adblocker).  Browsing seems no different than in years past.  Pulls up webpages, stores my bookmarks.  Plays videos.  Best part is it still allows a MENU bar.  Yesss.   Nothing is missing.  It just works.  No thought of having to \u2018move\u2019 to another browser. Other customization is to default to duckduckgo for searches.  But that is it. I was a firefox user for a long time. Their updates seem to be frequent and obstructive to smooth use but that wasn\u2019t the deal breaker. After an update it no longer kept me logged in to Youtube. I didn\u2019t want to keep logging in as I go there more than once a day. So I switched to Edge. Wouldn\u2019t use Chrome I tried years back and wasn\u2019t impressed. Beats me how Microsoft got anti-trust over Windows and IE but google flips by with Android and Chrome. Didn\u2019t want to but I could not find a solution for the login problem. I still like and use firefox. I don\u2019t care for all the tie in products they keep pushing, and I don\u2019t like their data gathering. But the browser stands against google, supports u-block origin, is easy to lock down privacy wise. It also displays the vast majority of web pages just fine. That last point is important as I\u2019ve tried a few of the forks of firefox and the problem I\u2019ve always had with them is compatibility. With websites, and add-ons. I expect that with googles market dominance they will strategically break compatibility in order to crush firefox at some point. But so far they haven\u2019t\u2026. Posting from Servo \u2014 it works! But actually, I use Firefox everywhere. Sure it\u2019s annoying to see the company flounder, but literally anything is better than a Chrome monoculture. iceraven DuckDuckGo is my normal browser on my android phone.  Firefox and Brave are backup there and I never have to use Chrome.  My Windows PC has DuckDuckGo, Firefox, Opera, Edge and Chrome (wife has some specific office software that does not like any other browser) installed.  Mostly I use O,F and DDG and I never use Edge or Chrome.  I use the DuckDuckGo search engine in all browsers and Ghostery helps to block trackers.  Other than Windows I try to stay as far away from Google and Microsoft as I can.  Maybe one day I will venture into the Linux world and in the meanwhile I do the best I can with what I think I know.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":" Kirby Air Riders  Kirby Air Riders is out today, and it sounds like the chaotic kart racer is exactly what fans of the GameCube original wanted (and like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not for anyone else). One of the ways the Switch 2 game embraces disorder is in its vehicle customization, which lets you paint your hoverboard to look like pretty much whatever you want. Some players are using this feature to make cool karts to race around in, and others are seeing what monstrosities they can put on the market for other players to use. Nintendo has held multiple feature-length Direct showcases for Air Riders, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already known about its vehicle customization for a while. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be surprised if fans were planning some of their vehicular shitposts for some time and just needed the game in their Switch 2s to finally bring them to life. But the reason that people can make vehicles that look like Chef Kawasaki in a bikini from a banned fan game (thanks, GamesRadar+) is that the toolset is so good. So for every joke, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a custom kart that actually looks pretty incredible.

After a 76-day wait, data-starved investors finally feasted their eyes on an official jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this morning. It showed that the US economy added 119,000 jobs in September, smashing economists' expectations for 53,000, and that the unemployment rate had risen to 4.4% from 4.3%. The report initially helped boost markets alongside Nvidia's stellar earnings, but stocks sagged again as investors continued to mull weak rate-cut odds and as valuation concerns returned to the conversation.  Still, the two-month-old data had some important takeaways for the market. Here's what to know.  While the jobs report was strong enough to quell recession fears, it also wasn't too strong. That means a rate cut could still be on the table for the Fed's December meeting. Odds of a December rate cut jumped from 30% on Wednesday to 39.5% on Thursday, according to the CME FedWatch tool. \"The Fed now has more justification to shift toward easing,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email on Thursday. Even though rate cut odds jumped, the report didn't leave investors with a clear answer on which way the labor market is trending, and that should make the next Fed decision tougher. The market tumbled after jumping earlier in the day on Thursday, and part of the reversal comes as investors still see weak odds for another cut in next month. A lack of data due to the shutdown has made the Fed's job much harder, even with the long-awaited September payroll report now in policymakers' hands.  \"The mixed messages coming from the September jobs report seem tailor-made to prompt vigorous debate at the next FOMC meeting,\" Michael Feroli, the chief US economist at JPMorgan, said in a note on Thursday. Other commentators echoed that, noting that the next policy move looks uncertain.  \"Fed policymakers have been talking down the likelihood of additional rate cuts near-term after the October decision, and for good reason. The September minutes showed a good deal of harrumphing about stock market valuations, and they don't want to add fuel to that fire,\" Bill Adams, Chief Economist for Comerica Bank, said.  During the government data blackout, investors leaned on alternative data from firms like ADP; Challenger, Gray, and Christmas; The Conference Board; and state jobs data. The September payrolls report showed those alternative sources held their own over the last few months. \"For example, the Conference Board's labor differential had hinted at a gradual rise in unemployment, ultimately borne out by September increase to 4.4%,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, in an email on Thursday. \"In addition, state-level jobless claims had indicated that the labor market was holding up reasonably well.\" Again, we'll need a more timely update to know for sure, but September's data showed that the labor market should continue to support consumer strength in the near term. Investors have been fearing a slowdown among consumers all year, and the Fed has said it would move to support the job market as it weakens. As the market approaches the critical holiday shopping season, all eyes will be on retailers for signs of continued spending or a pullback among shoppers still feeling the sting of inflation.

A tech company has ambitious goals and tells its employees they should be ready for some hardcore work. No, I'm not talking about Amazon. Or Nvidia. Or Tesla. This time around, it's Tools for Humanity, Sam Altman's $2.5 billion eye-scanning startup that wants to help prove people's humanity in the age of AI. \"We will neither fail, nor will we be an average outcome, and that's what we want and that's all I care about every day and all you should care about every day, and nothing else should matter,\" CEO Alex Blania told employees at the start of the year, according to a recording reviewed by BI's Nicole Einbinder. Blania's message has become a common pitch from tech executives to their employees ahead of critical junctures. For Orb, it's about getting more people to opt into what amounts to a human verification tool. Tools for Humanity has amassed millions of sign-ups, but Nicole previously reported it's still well shy of its goal of a billion users. Insiders questioned its long-term strategy, especially in a crowded marketplace for payment and identification products. And then there's the regulatory angle. Some countries, like Spain, India, and Indonesia, have either barred, halted, or investigated the startup. Not one to get left out of the fun, Microsoft is in the middle of a \"rethink.\" CEO Satya Nadella said the tech giant needs to adjust its business model for the AI era, and he's tapping an advisor to help. BI's Ashley Stewart obtained an internal memo from Nadella that explained how the company needs to \"rapidly rethink the new economics of AI across the company \u2014 just as we once did with the cloud.\" For both Tools for Humanity and Microsoft, AI sits at the core of their strategy decisions. As much as the tech has caused anxiety and fear among workers about their future, the companies looking to leverage it are also facing plenty of uncertainty. That's a difficult proposition for employees: Trust your company as it wades into the unknown despite not having a ton of job security yourself. But with an unrelenting job market, workers might not have another choice. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"There are quite a few first-party and third-party OnePlus 15 cases to choose from.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Shopping for the best OnePlus 15 cases? You might have to wait a while to get your hands on some of them. OnePlus 15 sales are currently postponed in the U.S. because of pending FCC certifications, that's why none of the first-party cases are available to buy just yet. This is also why there are close to no other third-party cases either. However, there are still a handful of reliable brands selling cases for the OnePlus 15 right now. Alternatively, you can always window shop today and bookmark this guide for now as you wait for the case of your choice to go on sale.  Why you can trust Android Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.        Best overall The Thinborne 600D Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case for OnePlus 15 is available to purchase immediately, so if you want a case right now, this is your best bet. Made out of real 600D aramid fiber, this is an impossibly thin 0.04-inch wide case with drop protection, embedded magnets, and a tempered glass screen protector.       Most unique The OnePlus 15 Hole-Pattern Magnetic Case offers sensory respite as well as impact absorption in a sleek beige shell. It also has a powerful N52 magnetic ring buried within it, so you can use MagSafe and Qi2 accessories.       Best bumper cover Good news: The Ringke Fusion-X is available for the OnePlus 15. Bad news: Currently, only Ringke India is selling it. If you're located in North America, you'll have to wait patiently for this impact proof clear cover to make its way there.       Best clear case For U.S. residents, the Foluu Clear Case for OnePlus 15 is a cheap transparent option that is readily available. This is a basic soft silicone case with reinforced corners. It will yellow over time, but the below-$10 price tag makes it easily replaceable.       Best affordable Nillkin is an affordable brand that delivers good quality products. I've used both cases and screen protectors from the brand many times. The Nillkin Super Frosted Shield Pro Magnetic Matte Case for OnePlus 15 is in stock right now. It has a grippy textured back.       Most stylish The first-party OnePlus 15 Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case is not only thin, lightweight, and magnetic, but it's also waterproof. You get incredibly strong N52SH magnets inside it for MagSafe\/Qi2 support, and the camera bar has raised red hot bezels.       Best grip The Ringke Onyx has long been my favorite model from Ringke. It has a unique sandstone-like texture that's non-slip and looks very cool. This OnePlus 15 case is also magnetic, but unfortunately, it's not available in North America just yet.       Best plain It won't turn any heads, but the OnePlus 15 Sandstone Magnetic Case is a nice, plain case for everyday use. If you like to keep things simple, you'll be happy with this magnetic black case. OnePlus promises wear resistance from scratches. The OnePlus 15 is a very slim phone by design. You wouldn't want to mar such a wonderful trait with a bulky phone cover. This is why I highly recommend getting a sleek and lightweight case for your OnePlus 15. So many of the best OnePlus 15 cases are from OnePlus itself. However, due to the delay in FCC certification, both the phone and its cases have been delayed. This is why it's really hard to find either product in stock in the U.S. right now. This leaves you with two choices: You can either buy something available right now, or wait patiently until the cover of your choice is released. Of the cases available right now, the Thinborne 600D Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case for OnePlus 15 is the best option for your device. It measures only 0.04 inches wide, is made of robust 600D aramid fiber, has strong magnets, and even comes with a tempered glass screen protector. While Thinborne's sleek offering is pretty expensive, it is an all-in-one solution that you can purchase in North America immediately, making it a great pick. I also like Nillkin's Super Frosted Shield Pro Magnetic Matte Case because it has a dotted, textured back that is incredibly grippy. The entire case is built well and fits the OnePlus 15 rather snugly. I have used plenty of Nillkin cases before, and they usually last a good while, between two to three years on average. Play the long game, and you can get any of the wonderful first-party OnePlus 15 cases listed in this guide. However, be sure to get a cheap in-between case as you wait for the official cases to go on sale. Something like the clear case from Foluu only costs about $7, making it an ideal temporary solution.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Samsung wants to clear out inventory on its last-gen smartwatch, and that's good news for us until the Galaxy Watch 7 is gone for good.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Some early Black Friday deals are traps, getting you to bite on an average deal before the truly big discounts arrive later. This isn't one of those times. The Galaxy Watch 7 has dipped to $129 (48% off), its lowest price ever by $20, and there's no reason to assume that price will fall lower. This is an everything-must-go sale, and the only question is how long the stock will last. Having covered Galaxy Watch deals in Black Fridays past, I remember Samsung followed this pattern with the Galaxy Watch 6, dropping the price by 50% down to $139 before Black Friday and sticking to it through Cyber Monday. After that, Samsung took it off storefronts, and you could only find \"renewed\" models. You can play chicken with Samsung and hope the Galaxy Watch 7 falls even further, but I wouldn't risk it. Amazon's storefront already says \"Deal selling fast,\" which shows that people know this is a steal of a deal. You're paying Amazfit money for a powerful smartwatch with Wear OS 6, Play Store apps, and Gemini smarts, along with the promise of feature updates through late 2028. or: Galaxy Watch 7 44mm at $159.99 ($120 off) \u2705Recommended if: You want cutting-edge performance that pairs closely with your Android smartphone for messaging; you want insights into your health and sleep data such as energy scores, heart rhythm, and sleep apnea detection; and you're invested in the Samsung ecosystem. \u274cSkip this deal if: You need a smartwatch that'll last more than 1\u20132 days per charge, or you'd prefer another Galaxy Watch option, such as the Watch 8 Classic with its physical bezel controls, or the Watch Ultra with its enhanced battery life.      You have other options available, like the Galaxy Watch 8 for $279 ($70 off), but you'll need to do your research and decide if the Galaxy Watch 8 vs. 7 differences are substantial enough to pay the extra $150. The new model is much lighter and skinnier, with an extra 1,000 nits of brightness and new Samsung Health features like Vascular Load and Antioxidant Index. But is this enough for you to give up such an absurdly low price? You should also decide whether you're willing to spend another $30 for the Galaxy Watch 7 44mm, or $50 more for LTE connectivity. The 1.3-inch Galaxy Watch 7 looks more natural on smaller wrists, while the 1.5-inch Watch 7 resizes content to take advantage of its larger screen. Otherwise, you'll need to look at other Wear OS watch brands, and your options are limited. The Pixel Watch 3 at $199 ($100 off) is your next best bet, better suited to Pixel phones, but still significantly more expensive with one fewer year of software support. Likewise, the OnePlus Watch 3 at $249 ($100 off) is a great deal if you need longer battery life, but it's an alternative to a Galaxy Watch Classic or Ultra, not the light, skinny Watch 7.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement              Everyone, from casual cooks to James Beard Award winners, is in on the air fryer. Here's what they're saying about -- and cooking in -- these high-powered countertop ovens.                  It's Wednesday, around 6 p.m. It's been a busy day, but I'm already carving a perfectly roasted chicken on my favorite ebony cutting board, the bird's juices spilling out from under crispy skin and filling up the board's reservoir like a moat.\u00a0        For years, Ina Garten's roasted chicken \u2014 or some variation of it \u2014  has been something of a Sunday tradition for me. It's not particularly decadent or overly involved, but it's reserved for Sundays because of its 2-hour total cooking time. Now, the same recipe, but adapted for the air fryer, hits the table in well under an hour.\u00a0        After months of owning an air fryer and experimenting mostly with versions of traditionally fried foods, such as wings, fries and chicken cutlets, I made my first air fryer roast chicken on a whim. Stunned by the speedy cooking time \u2014  25% faster than traditional roasting \u2014  tender meat and impossibly crispy skin without the usual tablespoon of butter, I haven't put a bird in the oven since.        Of all the kitchen tools I've collected, and there are many, the air fryer has shifted my cooking paradigm the most, making cooking easier, faster and more foolproof. Few and far between are air fryer fails, and frequent are the discoveries of something I'd been \"making wrong\" all along until I roasted it quickly under spiraling superconvection heat.        Save for the rare batch of cookies or large cut of meat for a dinner party, the air fryer has all but replaced my oven. I plan meals around it: If a recipe calls for the use of my oven \u2014   meat loaf, roasted salmon, charred cauliflower \u2014  I consider how I might adapt it for the air fryer.\u00a0        Celebrated chef and restaurateur Stephanie Izard shares my enthusiasm. \"It's such a versatile tool,\" the James Beard Award winner tells me. \"I use mine all the time for dinners,\" she adds, naming fried rice, marinated chicken and salmon as a few of her go-tos. \"It's like making one-pot meals \u2014  but roasted!\"   We're not alone.\u00a0  According to a CNET survey, over 70% of US adults either own or plan to own an air fryer within the year. Additional studies estimate that about 60% of American households have already made the purchase.        To put that in perspective: Since the turn of the century, only the smartphone has matched this level of rapid, widespread adoption for a new category of consumer technology. And no other kitchen appliance even comes close. Even at its peak, the limited available sales data suggest that the Instant Pot never reached such heights. Instant Pot sales have steadily declined following the multicooker boom, and the company that made most of them filed for bankruptcy in 2023. The air fryer, meanwhile, has rocketed from trendy novelty to everyday essential in record time and shows no signs of slowing. \u00a0        Guy Fieri, the chef, restaurateur and impresario of TV cooking shows, is another high-profile acolyte. \"An air fryer has a permanent place on my kitchen counter,\" Fieri tells me. He cites wings, roasted potatoes and leftover egg rolls as a few staples that are regulars in his air fryer. \"You can crisp, roast or reheat and still get that pro-level finish every time.\"\u00a0        Once pitched as a healthier alternative to deep-frying, air fryers are now edging out ovens, toasters and grills for everyday use. For many people I spoke to, the air fryer has become the most frequently used appliance in their kitchen, reshaping cooking routines and eating habits.      Every member of my own family and most of my friends keep an air fryer planted on the counter. Some, like my sister, who regularly cooks for her family of five, uses it so often for quick snacks and meals that she jokingly refers to life \"before and after the air fryer\" as two very different realities. \u00a0        An entire ecosystem has emerged around air fryers as well. Recipe bloggers, cooking influencers, accessory makers and air fryer manufacturers have all contributed to the movement, solidifying the device's place at the center of fast and modern home cooking.        Air fryers may have made their debut as the go-to gadget for crisping up wings and fries, but fans have quickly realized that these countertop convection powerhouses can handle much more than game-day fare.        Take Jenny Catton, a UK-based food blogger who bought her first air fryer in 2022. Three years and one torrid affair with a small appliance later, Catton now runs The Air Fryer Kitchen, a popular recipe blog dedicated to air fryer cooking.        Like many, Catton initially used her air fryer for frozen foods and pub-style snacks, but her approach quickly evolved. Now, her weekly staples include air-fried salmon wrapped in foil with herbs and butter and batches of homemade granola.        Her readers have also moved beyond the basics. Two of the most-visited recipes on The Air Fryer Kitchen? Banana chocolate chip muffins and pork steaks.        A quick internet search surfaces dozens of other websites dedicated to air fryer cooking, and old-guard food magazines are getting in on the act. Epicurious, Food & Wine and others have lists of air fryer recipes that are many scrolls long and include fare decidedly not for game day. Think air fryer burrata and air fryer roast chicken with rosemary and orange sauce.\u00a0        While the air fryer's top-down heat and smaller size may not be suitable for all things \u2014 large roasts and most baking projects are still best in a traditional oven \u2014 one could go months using only an air fryer and not run out of new things to cook. And one \u2014 me \u2014 often does.        For a prior story, we asked chefs about the best vegetables to air-fry, and the list was long. Most meat and seafood also transform into something rather delicious under air fryer conditions.        In our own testing, we unearthed even more unusual air fryer success stories. The fierce, fast heat of the air fryer is enough to char a burger patty to medium-rare in minutes (and you can toast the bun while you're at it). Grilled cheese turns out crispier and less soggy than when pan-fried in oil, and hot dogs earn their coveted caramelized snap without having to fire up the Weber. For reheating leftovers, the\u00a0microwave consistently falls short\u00a0of what an air fryer can do in roughly the same amount of time.  So what's really behind the surge in air fryer popularity? For Catton, it all comes down to speed.\u00a0  \"Air fryers can handle nearly any dish you'd cook in a traditional oven, but in a fraction of the time,\" she says. \"They're ideal for busy people. Once someone tries an air fryer, they usually tell their friends, and then those friends want one too.\"        CNET's survey supports her claim: 64% of respondents said they use their air fryer because it cooks faster, and 65% cited its simplicity.        Another big driver? A healthier approach to comfort food. Air fryers promise the crispy indulgence of fried favorites with a fraction of the oil.\u00a0        According to Ninja, one of the leading producers of air fryers globally, the mighty convection cookers use 75% less oil than deep-frying to achieve the same or similar results.\u00a0  To arrive at this figure, the company, which has a sensory team dedicated to refining the recipes and real-world functionality of its kitchen appliances, conducted extensive testing and consumer research. First, it identified the ideal french fry texture when cooked in oil, then cooked fries in the air fryer using a bit more oil every time until taste testers declared them equal to their deep-fried counterparts.        Healthier fries that taste like the real thing would be reason enough for many of us to splurge, but Ninja'a precise calculation applies to dozens of other traditionally fried foods. For serial snackers, the appeal of the air fryer is sizable and clear.        If you'd asked me a decade ago which kitchen gadget would revolutionize home cooking, I would've confidently said the multicooker. Fast forward 10 years: Instant Pot sales have cooled, and the air fryer has undeniably claimed the mantle.        By the late 2010s, air fryer sales were already soaring \u2014  an impressive feat for any new product category. Then the pandemic hit. Like many home-centric devices, air fryers saw explosive growth during lockdown, with sales jumping 76% from 2020 to 2021. That surge translated to 25.6 million units sold and nearly $1 billion in revenue.        It would be easy to chalk that up to a pandemic-fueled fad, but the momentum didn't stop. During the height of COVID-19, approximately 36% of Americans owned an air fryer. That number has since nearly doubled. Last year, sales rose another 10.2%.\u00a0        The US leads the charge by far. In 2023, American consumers accounted for $233.8 million of the more than $1 billion in global air fryer sales. The UK, the second-largest market, trailed with under $90 million.        Interest in air fryers spans generational lines as well. Our survey found that 62% of Gen Xers use an air fryer, followed by millennials and Baby Boomers at 56% each, and Gen Z at 51%.        In short, everyone seems to be hot on air fryers. According to Statista, if current trends continue, 113.6 million more air fryers will be sold by 2029.        The air fryer made its market debut in 2010, when Philips acquired a patent for \"rapid air technology\" from the late Dutch inventor Fred van der Weij, who developed the prototype four years earlier.        The idea was straightforward: intense convection heat, driven by a high-powered fan, circulates hot air around the food at high speed. This rapid airflow crisps the outer layers while keeping the inside moist \u2014  mimicking the effect of deep-frying, but without all the oil.        At first, the air fryer seemed like another passing gimmick, something destined for the QVC clearance bin alongside Slap Chop, Juicero and countless other overhyped, underused kitchen tools.        The somewhat awkward name didn't help its credibility. Nor did early endorsements from overexposed celebrity chefs like Emeril Lagasse and Gordon Ramsay, both known for chasing product deals and pushing branded cooking gadgets with perhaps a little too much enthusiasm.  Yet, the air fryer slowly earned its place in home kitchens, building a loyal fan base and influential backers. A turning point occurred in 2016 when Oprah included it in her cult-followed \"Favorite Things\" list. From there, its status began to solidify -- joining the ranks of the blender, slow cooker and cast-iron skillet as an indispensable cooking tool. Ten years later, an air fryer \u2014  this time Cosori's TurboBlaze smart oven \u2014  maintains a coveted spot on Winfrey's curated gifting list.\u00a0  Dave Farmer, CEO of Versuni, which acquired Philips' air fryer business in 2021, recalls another landmark moment that signaled the world was taking air fryers seriously.\u00a0        \"At a certain point, we saw consumer packaged goods including air fryer cooking instructions on the back of the box, along with stovetop, oven and microwave,\" he tells me. \"Now air fryer directions are standard on bags of french fries, boxes of veggie burgers and other quick-fire frozen foods.\"        Until recently, air fryers largely came in one of two forms.        The most common type is a basket-style air fryer, recognizable by its pull-out drawer. These models typically include a single basket with a perforated tray \u2014  or a nested perforated basket \u2014  that allows air to circulate around the food for even crisping.        Inside an air fryer, a high-powered fan circulates hot air around the food at high speed using rapid airflow to crisp the outer layers of the food There are also oven-style air fryers, which resemble a standard toaster oven but are supercharged with air fryer technology. These versions typically come with multiple racks and baking trays, offering more cooking space. They're also more expensive, on balance, and decidedly more onerous to clean.        But last year, Ninja disrupted the category with a bold new design: a glass-chamber air fryer called the Crispi. Unlike anything else on the market, the nontoxic Crispi quickly shot to the top of our best air fryers list after we tested more than 24 models. It's the one I use at home and has become my recommendation for readers, friends and family.        According to Ninja, the Crispi didn't just impress me \u2014  it made waves across the industry, earning widespread acclaim and garnering over 715 million social media impressions since its launch.        Less polished versions of the glass air fryer preceded the Crispi, and several brands, including Kismile, quickly launched copycat models. Like a boom within a boom, these transparent, nontoxic and high-performance air fryers are poised to become the new norm \u2014  or at least a defining option \u2014  in future design.        As a longtime leader in home appliances with a rosy market outlook, Ninja isn't taking its foot off the gas.        I visited Ninja's sprawling campus headquarters, just outside Boston, where the team was preparing to launch the Crispi Pro, a $280 upgrade of its headline-making appliance. The brand, known also for its powerful vacuums, blenders and other small home appliances, currently has 20 air fryers on the market and many more products featuring an air fryer setting or similar technology.        I was invited to Ninja's test kitchen, where the sensory team tests air fryer recipes and delivers its findings back to the folks in engineering. Ninja's 3D printing operation enables them to create physical representations of air fryer concepts in just hours, allowing for consumer-ready models to be on shelves faster than ever.\u00a0        Gregory Fish, Ninja's head of product design, is bullish on the air fryer segment and credits the Crispi's success to two standout features: its glass cooking chamber and modular design. The glass allows home cooks to watch their food cook in real time, and the entire chamber is 100% nontoxic, with no nonstick coating. That also makes it easier to deep clean, whether by hand or dishwasher.        \"Much of the insight came from seeing people use their air fryers for everything from simple reheating to full meals,\" Fish says.\u00a0        Beyond the added capacity, convenience and toxin-free makeup of the larger, more modular Crispi, what really struck a chord with consumers was this air fryer's potential to replace their oven altogether.        With air fryers now in roughly six out of 10 US homes and ownership growing steadily, it's fair to ask: How far can this air fryer thing go?        Among owners, usage is impressively high. According to Data Bridge Market Research, the average household turns to its air fryer 4.2 times per week, replacing traditional oven use for 35% of cooking occasions.        I asked Catton, the air fryer recipe blogger, whether she thinks air fryers will eventually overtake full-size ovens. For her, it's not a question of if, but when.        \"I think this will happen,\" Catton says. \"As living spaces shrink, especially in cities, an air fryer could be more practical than a full wall oven.\"        Capacity is one of the few advantages that traditional ovens still have over their modern counterparts. You'll still need them for your Thanksgiving turkey. However, air fryers excel in speed and energy efficiency \u2014  they cook faster, use less energy and don't require preheating.        They're also relatively cheap, with budget models available for as little as $50. Higher-end air fryers exist, but it's not a complex technology. If you're paying more than $200 for an air fryer, you're probably paying too much.\u00a0        Ninja, which gathers extensive user feedback, shares Catton's optimism. \"We're seeing people cook entire meals -- chicken on one side, Brussels sprouts on the other,\" a rep for the company told me. \"In many ways, it's replacing how people use their oven.\"  Traditional oven manufacturers have taken notice. Many modern models, including my Samsung induction oven, now feature built-in air fryer settings. I've tested a few \u2014 they get the job done, but they lack what makes standalone air fryers shine: a compact chamber that circulates hot air quickly and evenly for that signature crisp.        Most health experts agree that air fryers can be a healthier alternative to deep-frying. By using little to no oil, one can reduce calories by up to 80% and significantly lower fat intake.        According to Ninja, air fryers use 75% less oil than deep-frying to achieve the same crispy texture for French fries.\u00a0 In an investigation into the health benefits of air fryer cooking by the Cleveland Clinic, dietitian Julia Zumpano noted that air fryers \"eliminate the need for added oils entirely.\" Research shows that air frying can reduce acrylamide \u2014 a potentially carcinogenic compound found in fried potatoes \u2014 by up to 90%.        But let's be clear: air fryers aren't a panacea for an unhealthy diet. They can't remove saturated fat from bacon or trans fats from highly processed snacks. Cooking refined carbs with less oil still leaves you with refined carbs.        The British Heart Foundation echoes this nuance. Air frying doesn't offer extra health benefits for foods that don't typically require added fat to begin with, such as sausages, bacon or pre-breaded chicken. In those cases, it's just a different way to cook, not necessarily a healthier one.        And so the quest for healthy bacon continues.        While dietitians are quick to praise air fryers, it's harder to find career chefs who share the sentiment, with many dismissing them or refusing to offer comment.        Stephanie Izard is an exception. A champion of Top Chef and Iron Chef, Izard owns six acclaimed restaurants, most of which are located in Chicago, and proudly admits that she \"always has an air fryer on the counter.\"        \"I love using it to bake small batches,\" Izard says. \"It [cooks] so evenly compared to my convection oven, and it heats up incredibly fast. They're perfect for crisping pork belly or other proteins, and for roasting vegetables like squash or Brussels sprouts to get that nice crunch without deep frying.\"        As for using an air fryer in one of those six restaurant kitchens, Izard laments that \"they're just not big enough to be practical. I wish someone would make a supersized version.\"        Fieri, who soared to celebrity status with the show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, is so enamored with air fryers that he has added one to his kitchen collection, featuring a steam function designed to keep food from drying out. (Phillips also makes a steam air fryer.) Asked about the use of air fryers in professional settings, Fieri says, \"I'm starting to see more chefs use air fryer-style tech for quick tests or catering gigs. They're efficient, cleaner and great for nailing texture without dropping everything in oil.\"\u00a0        That love for the air fryer doesn't extend to all chefs and food influencers.\u00a0        YouTube chef Brian Lagerstrom has been notably vocal in his criticism, calling air fryers \"kinda dumb\" and advocating instead for traditional stove-oven combinations. Other culinary pros, such as TV chef James Martin, expressed similar doubts, dismissing air fryers as merely tabletop convection ovens with limited applications and middling results.        Whether air fryers find their way into restaurant kitchens and favor with the culinary elite is, in some ways, irrelevant. Consumers are plunking them down on their counters at a record clip and, according to many I've spoken with, finding more ways to use them. More than 15 years into the air fryer era, with sales still on the rise, it feels safe to move the air fryer from a cooking trend to a kitchen staple.        As Fieri puts it, using his unmistakable parlance, \"I'm about tools that make cooking more fun and flavorful. Whether you're a new cook or a pro, it's the easiest way to bring the heat and still keep it healthy.\"        To understand the unique value an air fryer offers the average home cook and, thus, its breakneck rise in popularity, you needn't look further than my Sunday roast chicken \u2014  now available on weekdays.\u00a0        Simply put, air fryers cook food fast and with less oil or grease. The results, at least for many foods cooked with superconvection, are as good or better than other clunkier, slower, greasier methods -- a sentiment backed by a few of the world's most celebrated chefs.\u00a0        That a reliable unit can be had for less than $75 only bolsters its quest for a home in every kitchen.        While some drag their feet, still, writing the air fryer off as a nothing gimmick; nothing more than a toaster oven with a funny name, unworthy of the countertop real estate it demands, I'll be here enjoying my chicken, salmon, grilled cheese and whatever revelation comes next.\u00a0      CNET commissioned YouGov Plc to conduct the survey cited here. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 1,190 adults, of whom 839 own an air fryer or are planning on buying one in the next 12 months. Fieldwork was undertaken Sept. 24-25, 2025. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults (aged 18 plus). \u00a0 Visual Designer | Cole Kan Art Director | Jeffrey Hazelwood Creative Director | Viva Tung Video Host\/Editor\u00a0| JD Christison Camera Operator |\u00a0Owen Poole Project Manager | Danielle Ramirez Editors | Corinne Reichert, Katie Collins Director of Content | Jonathan Skillings","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"It feels like every company used to produce several\u00a0concept cars\u00a0each year that fueled the imagination of burgeoning car enthusiasts everywhere. Every auto show you went to was littered with imaginative, daring, futuristic concepts\u00a0that we all knew would never make it to production, but boy were they cool. It seems that these imagination-stoking creations have dwindled in numbers as the heyday of the auto show is behind us, but fortunately Hyundai is keeping the tradition alive with the new Crater concept that debuted Thursday at the\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0Auto\u00a0Show. It's a compact yet rugged electric SUV that focuses on something else that modern cars tend to lack: fun. From its adorable little mascot named Crater Man, who's featured in Easter eggs throughout the interior and exterior, to the trunk-mounted record player and video games you can play while it charges, the Crater concept doesn't take itself too seriously, which is refreshing. Hyundai says the\u00a0Crater serves as a preview of the direction that its rugged XRT models might be heading in the near future. Before you ask, Hyundai is not sharing details about any projected timeline for the Crater to hit the market, so it remains a concept car for now, but look out for future Hyundai XRT and XRT Pro models to draw from the Crater's robust design. Despite its imposing looks, the Crater is quite small, and it's begging for you to play with it. On the outside, Crater's 33-inch all-terrain tires are wrapped around wheels that were designed to look like a hexagonal block of metal caused a concave crater to form at their center. Its four windshield-topping spotlights are a play on the traditional smiley face Hella headlamp design, and they incorporate an animated Crater Man face chomping when prompted. One of the bright orange front-mounted recovery hooks features another Crater Man face, and it has a bonus function as a bottle opener, and the vertical vents you see on the outer edge of the front and rear bumpers hide speakers. The concept is finished in a matte yellow-ish color called Dune Gold that's meant to mimic the color of dried, sun-faded sage leaves. Once the electronically opening coach doors glide open, you're greeted with one of the coolest interior concepts I've seen in a long time. The design team developed the Crater's interior using the concept \"The Curve of Upholstery,\" so naturally it has lots of curved elements. From the artful seat design that features cylindrical cushions, head rests, and bolsters to the arched center arm rest that looks a bit like something you'd order from a butcher but in the coolest way possible, curved elements are definitely the theme here. The dashboard has a crash-pad inspired beam that runs the entire width of the interior, with perforations that allow a warm orange glow to permeate the cabin. The center of the beam houses some chunky looking physical controls that operate the four-wheel-drive system, and other helpful off-road readouts like a compass and an inclinometer. As a whole, the Crater's interior looks futuristic, rugged, architectural, and generally badass. Hyundai says the concept's interior features a \"bring your own device\" or BYOD approach. Above the dashboard beam are four small centrally mounted touchscreen displays that are removable and configurable, so you can choose which screens you want to see. The primary display is actually a full-width head-up display that projects important information onto the windshield but also hides some fun tricks that are meant to make its occupants smile. There's a Crater Man video game that's built into the car and uses those removable touchscreens as remote controls.\u00a0 It's set up in a \"Super Mario World\" fashion where players choose their character and run and jump through different maps and obstacles, and there's also a game where you can make your own music. The Hyundai engineers were very excited about these features, and they do seem like a fun way to kill time when you're charging your Crater. Beyond the game, I really appreciated the full-width head-up display because it allows the interior to feature more exciting designs and avoid having the focal point be a massive screen. I don't know how annoying it would be while driving, but the idea is really cool. The Hyundai Crater Concept is a preview of what to expect from the brand's off-road oriented XRT division. The U.S. market loves ruggedized versions of cars, and the XRT division will continue to deliver that moving forward in new and exciting ways. One reason the U.S. market in particular is so fond of off-roadified models is due to our country's geography.\u00a0 A Hyundai engineer pointed out that Americans always have access to snow and off-road adventures in a way that a smaller country like South Korea doesn't; South Koreans have to wait for winter to get snow, and apparently off-roading isn't anywhere near as popular as it is in the U.S., so XRT has the American market in mind. The Crater Concept is supremely cool, and though Hyundai could offer no official comment regarding the future plans for the Crater, it shows that Hyundai is taking the U.S. market and the off-road segment seriously moving forward, while retaining a sense of whimsy. I, for one, am eager to see what comes next for the burgeoning off-road arm of the South Korean carmaking giant.","label":0}

Samsung has officially set foot into the XR scene with the launch of its Galaxy XR headset, and as we know from previous rumors, the Korean OEM is also working on a pair of XR glasses under the codename \"HAEAN.\" According to a recent report from Galaxy Club, initial technical details about these smart glasses have surfaced. The publication notes that details of the smartglasses \"landed on our desk,\" and bear the model number SM-O200P. The website added that the Samsung XR glasses include transition lenses that adapt their tint according to ambient light. It is currently unknown whether the glasses actively project information onto these transition lenses. Furthermore, these smartglasses could be equipped with a built-in camera, and connectivity to a phone is established via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, as the glasses lack their own mobile data capability.      The Android XR glasses prototype was shown off a few months ago at a TED Talk event. More recently, during Samsung's Galaxy XR launch, Samsung also gave us more details about its upcoming XR smartglasses, which are being created with its partnership with Google, Gentle Monster, and Warby Parker. Samsung's Gentle Monster AI glasses will \"bring stylish, fashion-forward eyewear that blends cutting-edge Al-native technology with cultural influence and design leadership,\" Samsung said during its XR headset launch.      It is also claimed that these glasses could carry a Qualcomm chipset, and an NXP chip will be used as the auxiliary processing unit. The device could allegedly have a 12 MP camera with a Sony IMX681 CMOS image sensor. SamMobile indicated that these mixed reality glasses will have a \"155mAh battery, Google's Gemini LLM will be installed on the device to provide AI features.\" Considering that they are expected to be heavily loaded with Gemini, it will allow users to control the glasses using only their voice, as we saw during the demo at Google I\/O this year. As for when the glasses might see the light of day seems unknown; however, the website notes that a version of the glasses is being produced for the US market, meaning they would definitely be pitted against Meta's new smartglasses lineup.

A look at the shift from ranking-obsessed reporting to SEO frameworks that tie visibility, engagement, and influence directly to commercial outcomes. In SEO, we are at a turning point, and after more than a decade of chasing rankings and traffic volume, many of us are beginning to recognize the need to have a broader and more meaningful conversation about what \u201csuccess\u201d really means in SEO. This article reflects on how these conversations are evolving, why the older definitions are no longer sufficient, and how we can reposition the success metrics we use so that they better align with business value and reflect the reality of changing search behavior. For many years, success in SEO was defined in fairly narrow terms, where we measured how many keywords ranked in the top 10 or top three, and reported increases in organic sessions, improvements in domain authority, or growth in backlink counts. These were tangible, easy to track, and often felt convincing in boardroom conversations, but underneath the surface, the limitations of this approach were already apparent. Rankings, while useful, are ultimately vanity metrics, and if they improve without leading to increased clicks or qualified traffic, or if visitors arrive but never become leads or drive revenue, the SEO team may appear successful, but the business does not necessarily benefit. We must now begin with the end in mind, asking what the business goal truly is, what value each new lead brings, and how the website supports those aims. The classic metric stack was keyword positioning to impressions, to clicks, to organic traffic, and possibly to conversions, but it no longer reflects the full story, and we need to think more holistically. Several forces are now converging that make the older success yardsticks less reliable, and search behavior is one of the most prominent. People increasingly expect fast, direct answers, and search engines now deliver results that provide those answers immediately through formats that do not always require a click, such as \u201czero-click\u201d results. This significantly changes how we measure success, because if users receive what they need without visiting a site, traditional click-based metrics lose much of their relevance. The attribution chain is growing more complex, as organic traffic often plays a role early in the decision-making journey or supports brand engagement later in the funnel. The connection between a search visit and a tangible business outcome, such as a sale or a lead, can be indirect, span time, or be difficult to track with confidence. At the same time, the data itself is becoming noisier and harder to interpret, with increasing levels of bot traffic, variations in device usage, growing privacy constraints, and changes in how users interact with results. Metrics such as bounce rate, time on site, or even click-through rate are now more vulnerable to misinterpretation. Expectations of SEO teams have also changed, and we are being asked to deliver clear business value, not just improved rankings. If we are still tracking only vanity metrics, we may be missing the real impact. We need to connect our work directly to outcomes such as revenue, visibility among key audiences, and genuine customer engagement. It is no longer enough to say that traffic is up by 20%. We need to ask what that increase means for the business and whether those visitors were qualified and led to a meaningful result. To define SEO success more accurately, we need to reframe the conversation entirely. These are the dimensions I now focus on. Real success begins by aligning SEO activity to business outcomes. If the objective is to capture high-value enterprise leads, then reporting traffic to low-intent blog content is no longer meaningful. Instead, we need to set goals that are measurable, commercially relevant, and clearly linked to strategic priorities, ensuring the SEO team contributes to those priorities in a language leadership understands. When we do that, the conversation shifts away from keyword counts toward the broader question of how much value organic search adds to the business. While traffic volume still has its place, we need to move beyond surface metrics and focus on the quality of visitors, whether they reflect the right intent, whether they engage with content meaningfully, and whether their behavior suggests a pathway toward a business outcome. Metrics such as engagement depth, lead generation rate, and alignment with target personas tell us far more than raw traffic alone. The question we now ask is whether the right people are finding us and taking action once they do. It is not enough to rank well for a few hand-picked terms. Visibility in search today is about occupying the right positions across a much broader landscape, reaching our audience at various moments of need. This includes winning impressions across multiple query types, appearing in rich results and featured formats, and maintaining a presence that reinforces our authority. The more we dominate relevant search journeys, the more we influence the market, even when that influence is not reflected in click metrics alone. We must tie SEO performance directly to measurable business value, whether that is leads, revenue, brand visibility, or contribution to a broader customer lifecycle. That requires stronger analytics frameworks, and the discipline to identify and follow the signals that matter most. Instead of obsessing over rankings, I now focus on the question of how many of our business outcomes can be reliably influenced or supported by organic search, and what that influence is worth. Search is no longer static, and with the rise of AI, direct answers, voice, and structured data, our measurement frameworks must evolve just as quickly. Success might mean gaining impressions in key places, even if those impressions do not always convert directly. We may see lower click-through rates because our content is being used in answer boxes or overviews. Rather than viewing this as a failure, we should ask whether we are still present, whether our brand remains visible, and whether we are feeding into the new ways people search for and consume information. That adaptability is part of long-term success. To reposition the conversation, we must first return to the strategic context. What does the business want to achieve in the next six to 12 months? Growth, market expansion, brand credibility, operational efficiency? Whatever the goal, we need to ask how organic search supports it, and we must agree early on what success will look like. This means defining shared metrics that matter. We might look at the percentage of relevant traffic, the number of qualified inbound leads from organic, the revenue pipeline influenced, or the share of voice in a competitive space. These metrics need to be discussed, agreed upon, and tracked collaboratively. Once we know what matters, we can classify our metrics as leading indicators, lagging outcomes, and diagnostic signals, ensuring we track progress meaningfully from awareness through to value delivery. When we report results, we must do so in business terms. Rather than quoting percentage increases in traffic, we need to say what that traffic represented, such as how many people matched our target buyer personas, how many converted into something valuable, and what that means in financial or strategic terms. We also need to acknowledge the complexity of attribution, explaining what can and cannot be measured with precision, and why. When traffic rises but clicks are flat due to zero-click results, or when awareness improves without immediate leads, we need to explain what those patterns mean and what the underlying story really is. This process should not be static. As search evolves and business priorities shift, we must revisit our KPIs, our assumptions, and our methods. A flexible, open approach builds trust and keeps SEO positioned as a strategic partner rather than just a technical service. It is no longer a question of if we should change how we define success in SEO, but when. The risks of holding onto outdated metrics are serious. If we keep measuring keyword rankings and traffic counts, while the business cares about conversion, revenue, and growth, then we risk being seen as disconnected or misaligned. The result is often loss of confidence, shrinking budgets, and missed opportunities. But if we reframe how we measure and report success, we gain influence, relevance, and longevity. We align better with leadership goals. We allocate effort where it has the most impact. We stay ahead of search evolution. And most importantly, we build a case for the enduring value of SEO in any business context. In practical terms, this shift means reporting not only what ranks but what that visibility delivers. When I report on keyword positions, I explain the monthly search potential and the conversion rate of the landing pages they drive. When I talk about traffic growth, I segment it by intent and persona fit, and I show how that growth affects demo requests, contact forms, or sales-qualified leads. If the click-through rate falls but featured snippets rise, I report the increased visibility and link it to changes in branded search or engagement with our wider content. If backlinks increase, I focus on their relevance and domain quality, and I explain how they influence brand signals and domain authority. Every number I report should tie back to business relevance, not technical vanity. We are long overdue for a new understanding of what SEO success really means. As behavior changes, as platforms evolve, and as expectations increase, we need to be ready to tell a better story \u2013 one that shows our work is about value, not vanity. The results that matter most are the ones that serve the business, influence the market, and build a sustainable presence over time. If you have been in this industry for a while, now is the moment to lead that shift. Bring your leadership into the conversation. Ask the right questions. Set the right metrics. Build a measurement framework that makes SEO impossible to ignore. Because when we position ourselves as strategic contributors and not just technical operators, the work we do will finally get the recognition it deserves.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"  Home \u00bb Revved-Up Rundowns Sports cars should be selling like hotcakes at a Sunday morning car meet. Instead, some of today\u2019s most capable machines are sitting on dealer lots longer than a project car in your buddy\u2019s garage. It\u2019s not that these cars can\u2019t perform; many of them would embarrass a Porsche 911 on the right day. The problem is more complicated than that. We\u2019re living in the golden age of automotive performance, where a family sedan can hit 60 mph faster than most supercars from the \u201980s. Yet somehow, genuinely great new and used sports cars are struggling to find homes. The culprits? Everything from badge snobbery to the unfortunate reality that most people would rather drive a lifted grocery getter than something that makes their spine tingle. I love sports cars and I love driving them. So you can\u2019t blame me for these cars not selling, I can tell you that much. Instead, we examined market trends and sales data to identify which sports cars were falling short with the general public, focusing on cars that have experienced a decline in sales over the last few years. We also checked out some forums and other places where car enthusiasts go to complain, hoping to gain insight into what might be holding these cars back. Of course, some people love to read their own complaints, so we took it with a grain of salt. Still, if a bunch of people had something to say, we took note. By combining hard data with real-world insights, we identified the sports cars that, despite their capabilities, are simply not connecting with today\u2019s market. Oh and by the way, we know the definition of a sports car, but the world has moved on, and so do we. The thing is that most people don\u2019t think of a 2 seater, 2 door car when they say \u201csports car\u201d , but rather the terminology now includes things like sports sedans, grand tourers and more. So don\u2019t yell at us on that one, please. Starting Price: $41,015 Horsepower: 400 hp 0-60: 4.5 seconds Remember when everyone was begging Nissan to bring back the Z? Well, they did, and now those same people are apparently too busy shopping for Rogues. The new Z packs a twin-turbo V6 that makes 400 horsepower and enough torque to spin the rear wheels in three gears, but it\u2019s selling about as well as a convertible in Seattle. The problem isn\u2019t performance; this thing will outrun most of what\u2019s parked at your local Starbucks. It\u2019s that $41k starting price in a world where you can get a Mustang GT for $38k or a Camaro SS for similar money. Both of those come with V8s and the kind of brand recognition that doesn\u2019t require explaining what a \u201cZ\u201d is to your insurance agent. Plus, the Z\u2019s interior leaves something to be desired (which is why Autopian tried to \u201cfix it\u201d for them). Sales have been so slow that some dealers are offering incentives. When a sports car needs rebates six months after launch, that\u2019s not a good sign. Starting Price: $46,440 Horsepower: 382 hp 0-60: 3.9 seconds Toyota spent years teasing us with concept cars and \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll bring back the Supra\u201d hints, then delivered a car that\u2019s basically a BMW Z4 in a different dress. Don\u2019t get us wrong: it\u2019s a fantastic machine that\u2019ll embarrass most sports cars on a track. But try explaining to your fellow Toyota enthusiasts why your Supra has a BMW engine, BMW transmission, BMW interior bits, and BMW infotainment. The B58 inline-six is actually brilliant; it\u2019s the same engine BMW puts in their M240i and base Z4. It makes 382 horsepower and responds to modifications like a teenager responds to pizza money. However, at $46k, you\u2019re competing against a used Corvette Stingray, which starts at $68k but depreciates so fast you can find low-mile examples for Supra money. The Supra has faced several market challenges, including production delays, elevated dealer pricing, and a two-seat configuration that may not suit buyers seeking more practicality. Sales figures have remained modest, suggesting that while the car appeals to enthusiasts, it may not align with broader consumer preferences. Starting Price: $73,400 Horsepower: 444-575 hp 0-60: 3.5-4.4 seconds The F-Type is drop-dead gorgeous and sounds like Thor clearing his throat, but it\u2019s about as reliable as British weather and twice as expensive to fix. Jaguar managed to create one of the most beautiful cars ever made, then saddled it with electrical gremlins that would make a 1970s British Leyland owner nostalgic. With base prices starting north of $73k, the F-Type competes against Porsches, Mercedes AMGs, and BMW Ms: all of which have better reliability reputations and higher resale values. The supercharged V8 models make up to 575 hp and sound absolutely magnificent, but good luck finding a mechanic who doesn\u2019t charge Bentley rates to work on one. The real issue? Jaguar\u2019s U.S. sales network has been shrinking faster than a wool sweater in hot water. Finding parts and service is becoming a treasure hunt, and most buyers would rather not turn their sports car hobby into a full-time archaeology expedition. The F-Type is entering its final production year, which means it\u2019s basically the automotive equivalent of buying a Zune in 2010. Starting Price: $169,500 Horsepower: 573 hp 0-60: 2.9 seconds The NSX is a technological marvel that can lap the N\u00fcrburgring in 7:37 and hit 60 mph in under three seconds. It\u2019s also from Acura, a brand most people associate with your accountant\u2019s daily driver. That badge confusion has created an identity crisis more complex than a philosophy major\u2019s senior thesis. At $169k, the NSX competed against Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and McLarens: cars with names that make people\u2019s pupils dilate. Meanwhile, \u201cAcura\u201d is better known as an everyday car brand, invoking thoughts of lease specials and complimentary oil changes. The hybrid powertrain is brilliantly engineered, combining a twin-turbo V6 with three electric motors, but try explaining that to someone who just wants their supercar to make big noise and bigger drama. Total NSX sales from 2016 to 2022 were around 2,900 units globally. To put that in perspective, Ferrari sells more 488s in a good month. The NSX is faster around most tracks than cars costing twice as much, but in the supercar world, logic takes a backseat to emotion and badge prestige. Starting Price: $33,045 Horsepower: 181 hp 0-60: 6.5 seconds The Miata RF (Retractable Fastback) is proof that sometimes more isn\u2019t better. Mazda took the perfect roadster formula and added a power-folding hardtop, extra weight, additional complexity, and a $5,000 price premium. The result? A car that\u2019s less pure than the soft-top version and more expensive than buyers want to pay for 181 hp. Miata buyers typically want simplicity, reliability, and that direct connection to the road that made the original car legendary. The RF adds 113 pounds, takes longer to drop its top, and costs more to fix when something inevitably breaks. It\u2019s like ordering a burger and asking them to make it more complicated and expensive. Sales figures show that roughly 70% of Miata buyers choose the soft-top version, leaving RF inventory sitting longer than leftover fruitcake. The RF isn\u2019t bad: it\u2019s still a joy to drive and looks fantastic with the top up. But in a segment built on \u201clight is right,\u201d adding weight and complexity is like bringing a calculator to a poetry reading. Starting Price: $52,500 Horsepower: 255-382 hp 0-60: 4.4-5.2 seconds The Z4 is like that friend who can\u2019t decide what they want to be when they grow up. Is it a sports car? A luxury cruiser? A Supra with different clothes? BMW seems as confused as potential buyers, which explains why Z4s sit on lots like wallflowers at a high school dance. The base Z4 makes 255 horsepower from a turbo four-cylinder and costs $52k; money that buys you a lightly used Corvette Stingray with a V8 and actual American muscle car credentials. The M40i version makes 382 hp and costs $65k, which puts you in Porsche Boxster S territory. Neither price point makes much sense when you consider the alternatives. \u201cThe Z4 fits very awkwardly in the market against its competitors (Boxster, ND Miata, Corvette, and Mustang\/Camaro convertibles),\u201d said one guy on a Reddit thread about the discontinuation of the Z4. \u201cPeople who want a sports car with a high budget just go with the Boxster. People who want a lower-cost sports car always go for the Miata.\u201d Another Redditor added, \u201cBecause people are boring and keep buying SUVs.\u201d\u00a0 BMW\u2019s decision to share the Z4\u2019s platform with the Toyota Supra created another problem: the Supra is faster, cheaper, and has a fixed roof for year-round usability. Meanwhile, convertible sports cars are about as popular as manual transmissions in traffic, appealing mainly to empty nesters who remember when driving was supposed to be fun. Starting Price: $50,900 Horsepower: 228-394 hp 0-60: 4.4-5.3 seconds The TT\u2019s problem was that it was a victim of its own brand\u2019s success. When it launched in 1998, the TT was Audi\u2019s halo sports car. By the end, it was overshadowed by the S3, RS3, R8, and basically every other performance Audi that makes more power and carries more prestige. At $50k, the base TT makes 228 horsepower from a turbo four-cylinder \u2013 respectable but not exactly thrilling in 2025. The TT RS makes 394 horsepower and costs $70k, but at that price, you\u2019re shopping against Porsche Caymans and BMW M2s, both of which offer more engaging driving experiences. The TT\u2019s biggest problem is that it\u2019s become the sensible choice in a segment where nobody wants to be sensible. It\u2019s refined, comfortable, and reliable \u2013 all great qualities for a daily driver, terrible qualities for generating excitement in a sports car showroom. Audi discontinued the TT after 2023, which tells you everything about how well it was selling. Starting Price: $67,495 (when available) Horsepower: 237 hp 0-60: 4.1 seconds The 4C is what happens when engineers design a car for themselves instead of actual customers. It\u2019s a carbon fiber masterpiece that weighs just 2,465 pounds and handles like a slot car. It\u2019s also about as comfortable as sitting on a park bench during a hailstorm. Alfa Romeo equipped the 4C with no power steering (for \u201cpurity\u201d), a harsh suspension setup that transmits every pebble directly to your spine, and an interior that makes a Lotus Elise seem luxurious. The result is a car that\u2019s absolutely brilliant on a smooth racetrack and absolutely miserable everywhere else\u2026 which is where most people actually drive. Sales were so slow that finding one became harder than finding a decent Italian restaurant in small-town America. Alfa\u2019s U.S. dealer network is thinner than the 4C\u2019s sound deadening, making service and parts a perpetual adventure. The 4C was discontinued after 2020, likely because it was more popular as a garage art piece than as a means of transportation. Starting Price: $97,350 Horsepower: 471 hp 0-60: 4.4 seconds The LC 500 is absolutely stunning: it looks like a concept car that accidentally made it to production. Under the hood sits a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8 that sounds like angels singing opera. The problem? It weighs 4,280 pounds and drives like it\u2019s carrying that weight in gold bars. At nearly $100k, the LC competes against Porsche 911s, BMW M8s, and Mercedes-AMG GTs \u2014 all of which are significantly faster and more engaging to drive. The LC is more of a luxury cruiser than a sports car, which would be fine if it competed against other luxury cruisers. Instead, it\u2019s priced against genuine sports cars and consistently comes up short in performance comparisons. Lexus sold just 1,715 LC models in 2022, down from a peak of 4,500 in 2018. Those numbers suggest the LC is more of a halo car than a volume seller, which explains why you\u2019re more likely to see one in a Lexus brochure than in your local Cars & Coffee parking lot. Starting Price: $55,900 (2019) Horsepower: 455-755 hp 0-60: 2.9-3.7 seconds The C7 Corvette was a fantastic sports car that had the misfortune of being overshadowed by its own successor. When GM announced the C8 would move the engine to the middle, suddenly every C7 on dealer lots looked as outdated as a BlackBerry. Even though the C7 Z06 and ZR1 were capable of embarrassing supercars costing three times as much, buyers were willing to wait for the revolutionary C8. The result? Heavy incentives, slow sales, and dealers practically giving away some of America\u2019s best sports cars. C7 inventory sat so long that some 2019 models were still on lots when the 2020 C8 arrived. The irony is that late-production C7s, especially Z06 and ZR1 models, are now appreciating as collectors realize they were the end of an era. Sometimes the market\u2019s timing is as bad as a teenager\u2019s first date These sports cars prove that excellence doesn\u2019t guarantee sales success. In a market where everyone wants practicality, connectivity, and high seating positions, traditional sports cars face challenges that would make a NASCAR driver sweat. Rising prices, shrinking dealer networks, and the unstoppable march toward electrification have created a perfect storm for sports car sales. The real tragedy is that many of these cars are genuinely excellent. The Supra is faster than most buyers will ever need, the F-Type sounds better than a symphony orchestra, and the NSX is a technological tour de force. But in today\u2019s market, being great isn\u2019t enough \u2014 you need to be great, and practical, and affordable, and trendy. For enthusiasts, this creates opportunities. Slow-selling sports cars often mean better deals, lower prices, and the chance to own something special before it becomes collectible. Just remember: today\u2019s sales flop might be tomorrow\u2019s classic. After all, nobody wanted to buy a Toyota Supra Mk4 when it was new either.

This is John Jantsch. My guest today is David Newman. He's a keynote speaker, bestselling author, creator of the Selling Show podcast with over 600 speaking engagements and 30 years in the field. David works with CEOs, consultants, and expert service providers who are ready to elevate their brand and become impossible to ignore. He's been on this show to talk about do it marketing, do it speaking, maybe do it selling too. can't or possibly today we're gonna talk about his latest book, Market Eminence, 22 Strategies to Build a Bold Personal Brand, Become a Business Celebrity and Drive Unstoppable Growth. That's a mouthful, welcome David. David Newman (00:31.127) I think so. David Newman (00:46.648) Thank you, John. Great to be back with you. John Jantsch (00:49.587) I found myself wanting to say marketing eminence. one of my last books, don't ask me why, but it's called The Ultimate Marketing Engine. And everybody kept saying the... David Newman (01:03.342) Yeah. John Jantsch (01:10.078) The mark that's it the ultimate marketing machine everybody I'd go on podcasts and every single one of them did it So funny, so glad to have you back In the subtitle, is the word obscurity in the subtitle? No, but you talk a lot about obscurity being, I think in the beginning of the book, the biggest tax that most of us are paying. What's the obscurity tax and how can we avoid it? David Newman (01:30.072) Yes. That's right. David Newman (01:37.08) So the obscurity tax is doing great work in isolation, basically dancing in the dark. So the question really for most folks watching and listening is how in the world do we get noticed? How do we get noticed? Our products, our services, our company in this crazy, super noisy AI fueled marketplace. And the answer is really three building blocks. Together they make up market eminence. But one is absolutely visibility. So to answer your question, we need to get seen, right? That's basically no one buys products or services or expertise, sight unseen. So job number one is to get seen. Beyond that and above that, we also need to earn respect in the marketplace. And the way that we earn respect is by understanding our prospects to such a degree that they start to respect our insight and our intimacy. with their pains, problems, heartaches, headaches, challenges, gaps, goals, aspirations, dreams, all that good stuff. And then the third component of this is brand preference. And that's simply a combination of differentiation and positioning. So it becomes risky, dangerous, and dumb to hire anyone else. And once those three components are dialed in, you are in the top 5 % of your market. And that's what the whole market eminence theme is about. John Jantsch (03:03.647) So as I listen to you describe that, and I know you have an answer to this, so I want to give you the opportunity to answer. How does that differ from, say, personal? David Newman (03:12.728) So fantastic question. And personal branding is not new. you know, frankly, many of the ideas I talk about in the book are not new. Combining them in this way around visibility, credibility, brand preference, differentiation, articulation, distinction, and doing this level of personal branding, not to bring glory to yourself. That's the key. Personal branding is about, okay, let's put a whole bunch of stuff onto you and your company and your persona so that you're all of a sudden shiny and glitzy and wonderful. This is about rising to the top of your market so that you can impact more people, so you can help more people. So I look at personal branding as sort of the evil twin of market eminence, that personal branding is raising yourself up Market eminence is raising your market up or raising your industry or your target demographic, raising them up. And when I say that, John, by the way, it's not just prospects. A lot of people think, well, this is a marketing strategy or it's a sales strategy. It's for prospects. This is for any stakeholder that you want to influence. This is that you have people that you want to come work for you, people that you want to have invest with you, people that you want to have bring you on their podcast. So media sources, media outlets. This is partners, this is possible acquirers. If you want your company eventually to be bought and you're building a saleable asset, all of those people are watching what you're doing in the marketplace. And if it's all about me, me, me, me, me, right, that's the old school kind of personal branding 101, that is not attractive to any of those stakeholders. If you're looking to change the market, if you're looking to change the rules, if you're looking to impact the trajectory of the future of all of those stakeholders and your industry and your target market that people notice and that come from is totally different than personal brand. John Jantsch (05:22.101) So in a lot of fields, I'm in marketing. Marketing is very competitive. There's lots of us out there. Do you have to have, you believe, and unfortunately the market perceives that, hey, you all do about the same thing. It's like, do I like you better than the other person? That's maybe my decision, right? So do you have to have some sort of polarizing, like here's what's broken in the world and I'm the only one that's fixing it. David Newman (05:36.12) Yes. yes. David Newman (05:48.748) Well, first part, yes, second part, no. Second part, we're getting into like narcissistic sociopath territory that I'm the only one that can fix it. However, you can certainly be one of the few people who sees it. But yes, to answer your question on a macro level with tremendous 1000 % enthusiasm, this is about being contrarian. This is about shifting beliefs. This is about going against the grain and calling out what is missing, funky, broken, and sad. John Jantsch (05:53.589) you John Jantsch (06:00.585) Yeah. David Newman (06:17.344) in your industry, with your industry practices, with the way things are commonly done. So one of the ways that we raise visibility is not just putting out content. This is very, very important. Content has been commoditized. AI can do content way better than any one of us. And the world does not need more content in the age of chat, GPT, et cetera. So what are humans good at? What are humans gonna be visible for, at least for the near term, until AI takes over the world and the robots kill all of us? But until then, it's three different kinds of content. Number one is how to think. So it's not how-to information. How-to information has been commoditized. How to think information is about insight, high level strategic advisory insights. The second kind of content to share is what to believe. what to believe and more importantly, what not to believe. So separating the signal from the noise, separating the myths from the truths, separating the, also separating the myths from the half truths, separating the outdated way of doing things from the current future focused way of doing things. And then the third component of the kind of content that we should be sharing is how to get ready for what's coming next. Because high level people of any kind, corporate people, entrepreneurial people, They hate being blindsided, they hate being ambushed, they hate being surprised by something they could have seen coming down the pike and they just somehow missed it. So if we can focus our visibility strategies in those three areas, number one, how to think, not how to, but how to think. Number two, what to believe and what not to believe. Number three, how to get ready for what's coming next. that will also elevate and separate you from all the noise out there. John Jantsch (08:13.621) So one of the things when you were describing kind of big picture was this idea of attracting right fit clients. what are some ways, I mean, I work with people all the time that they do have a differentiator, but they're still attracting the wrong people. So what are some of the real kind of surefire ways that you help people attract that right fit client? David Newman (08:19.437) yes. David Newman (08:28.877) Yes. David Newman (08:34.552) So I think you really have to double down on being polarizing and divisive. And unfortunately in this climate, when I use the words like divisive and polarizing, everyone goes to politics, red versus blue, your guy versus my guy. It is not about that. It is about alignment with your vision, with your values, with what you stand for, what you stand against. So... John Jantsch (08:44.18) you John Jantsch (08:48.564) Yeah. David Newman (09:01.878) When I'm either speaking or working with a group on this, this is exactly the moment, John, where I get pushed back and they say, well, so wait a second, we're going to upset some people. We're going to get some flack for this. We might not be liked. We might, we might get some negative press on this. And I said, well, I want you to think about this. Think about what if I came to with an offer and the offer is I am going to set up a 10 foot, 10 foot tall gate. John Jantsch (09:14.439) Okay. David Newman (09:31.35) around your business. The only people that we admit through this gate are your best fit. Prospects, clients, partners, investors, media sources, acquirers, that's all we let in. The gate automatically repels and keeps out all the terrible fits. The people you'd never want to do business with, the people that you would never want to partner with, the people that you would never take their money as an investor. And I sometimes go as far, John, as I say, okay, you know what? Let's put on the whiteboard. Let's right now put on the whiteboard all the characteristics of your worst clients, your worst hires, your worst partners. And they say, lack of integrity, lack of ethics, didn't do the work. They come in late, they leave early, right? They're clock punchers. I said, okay, well, let's look at this list on the board now. How do you feel about keeping all those people out of your company and out of your world forever? And then their shoulders suddenly just melt and they go, huh. That would be great. I say, OK, welcome to market eminence. That's exactly what it's designed to do, that the perfect fits are hyper magnetized and the terrible fits want to go anywhere else but anywhere near you. John Jantsch (10:44.841) You know, it's funny how often people have no prob, like if you ask them, who's an ideal client for you, they kind of stumble around a little bit, but they have no problem telling you who they don't want, right? It is pretty amazing. So a couple, and again, the subtitle of the book, 22 Strategies. I do, we were kind of kidding off air. I was going to have you list them all, but I would love to hear a couple. mean, I know you talk about speaking, publishing, podcasting. David Newman (10:54.19) That's right. That's right. David Newman (11:10.648) Sure. John Jantsch (11:12.681) some of the things we're doing. So I'd love to hear a few of the strategies that you really think are kind of core to this approach. David Newman (11:19.828) Absolutely. let me me separate out there's sort of two halves to the to the to the Apple, so to speak. The first half is the internal work that we need to do around making some leadership level decisions about who we are and who we're not and what we stand for and what we stand against and so forth. And that's really the bulk of the book is how to process that how to smartly engage with that level of thinking. The second half of the Apple is OK, now we have that. John Jantsch (11:34.665) Mm-hmm. David Newman (11:48.93) How do we amplify that? How do we magnify that and project that into the marketplace so that every pebble that we drop in the lake, the ripples start getting bigger and bigger. We start reaching more people, impacting more people and helping more people. So I'll give you a couple from part one and a couple from part two. The easiest thing that people listening right now can do is one of the chapters is about your slant, your contrarian slant. So think about three questions. So number one, what conventional wisdom do you secretly think is completely wrong, but you've never publicly challenged? So maybe within the four walls of your company, you're like, my God, we're not doing that again. That's terrible. That never works, et cetera. But you've never said it publicly. So what conventional wisdom do you secretly think is completely wrong, but if you've never ranted and raved against it? Number two, What harsh truth about your industry are clients desperate for someone to finally acknowledge openly? What are some of the elephants in the room in your business, in your industry with your target market when it comes to your category of product or service? And then number three, the third part of contrarian slant is what strong point of view do you already have that you already hold and believe truly that makes industry insiders uncomfortable but resonates deeply and powerfully with your ideal clients. So if you just literally sit down for an afternoon, grab a legal pad, spend 20 minutes really digging into each of those three parts, you will end with a 60 minute block of time with a contrarian slant that's gonna put you in the top 5 % of your industry if you were to amplify it, magnify it, et cetera. And I even have a chat GPT prompt. I know it's gonna be tough for people to... listener watch, but here's the chat GPT prompt if people want to work a little bit on this on their own. And you're going to take the flavor of this. can record, transcribe, whatever. Here's what it sounds like. Using everything you know about my, my, our methodology, training and tools, give me a series of 10 contrarian quote crazy idea headlines I can use to convey my true distinction. David Newman (14:14.892) differentiation and point of view. This should be polarizing, this is still in the prompt, this should be polarizing in that it strongly attracts the right clients and strongly repels the wrong clients. And then you'll get some initial output and then you can start the conversation, right? Make number seven even crazier, tone down number eight, bring more examples to number three. You will have such a fantastic time and no one's brave enough to do this, John. It sounds super simple, but most people are scared out of their minds to even take this one baby step. I hope that folks listening and watching are not the scaredy cats. John Jantsch (14:45.492) Yeah. John Jantsch (14:54.281) Yeah, and I was going to mention, I'm glad you did mention that, because AI is tremendous at that kind of brainstorming, as long as you look at it as kind of a thought partner and not like, you're not looking for the output, you're looking for the discussion as much as anything. I was at a conference one time and we just, we mentioned this idea, we've been kind of just kicking around this idea that business owners are really tired of agencies, or at least David Newman (15:00.909) Yes. David Newman (15:07.202) Yes. John Jantsch (15:22.803) what traditional agencies have done or not done for them. And so we just kind of jokingly, half jokingly mentioned to somebody, yeah, we're promoting the anti-agency model. And literally three or four business owners said, we need to talk. So it's a little bit of what you're talking about. We did it kind of tongue in cheek, but it really, I mean, you got immediate feedback that that idea really piqued a challenge they were David Newman (15:26.53) yes. David Newman (15:32.835) Nice. David Newman (15:48.354) That's right. And that is, you know why that's great, John, all the reasons that you said, obviously, but it immediately telegraphs just with that moniker, un-agency, right? That we are against something that has been traditionally seen as the solution to fix this problem. You don't want an agency, you want the un-agency, like the uncola back in the 70s and 80s. That was 7-Up's claim to fame. John Jantsch (15:58.591) Yeah. John Jantsch (16:10.431) Yeah. Yeah. John Jantsch (16:15.443) What do you find when, especially talking to CEOs, marketers are probably a little more open to this kind of idea of finding a difference. Particularly when you work with CEOs, what's kind of the biggest mindset block that you have to get them past with this idea of market eminence? David Newman (16:22.168) Go young! David Newman (16:35.33) I think it really is that exercise that I mentioned a little bit ago about we're gonna piss some people off, yes. We are gonna have some conflict, we might get some hate mail around this, yes. People who thought they liked us and respected us would suddenly turn us off and unsubscribe and go away, yes. But trust me, all the right people are gonna unsubscribe. All the right people are gonna go away. John Jantsch (16:38.591) Yeah. Yeah. David Newman (17:03.318) all the right people are not gonna come back to work for you or invest with you or buy from you. know, really figuring out, figuring out what is the game that we're playing, right? So sometimes this results in niching down. Sometimes this results in opening things up to an adjacent industry that might be a little bit more, a little bit less risk averse, a little bit more. you know, modern thinking. So people that work with old school industries sometimes realize, well, that's not who we are anymore. And I'm sorry, I stepped on your line there. John Jantsch (17:33.841) let's just face it, they have more money. John Jantsch (17:41.865) No, I was just going to say, let's face it, you're going there because they have more money. David Newman (17:46.53) Yes, yes, that could be true. That could be true. Funny story from a CMO standpoint. I have a friend who's a serial CMO. He doesn't intend to be fractional, but that's how it ends up, because he gets fired every 18 months. He works with banks. And I said to him, I said, what is it with you and changing jobs? He says, David, I have the worst job in the world. I'm a marketer in banking. So they're so risk averse. They want the bank presidents and CEOs They want to look like each other. And then they wonder why are we stuck in this rate war? Why are people leaving us for an extra quarter percentage down the street? It's because you're totally commoditizing yourself by choice. John Jantsch (18:31.145) Yeah, I always find that really interesting that, you know, with industries are like, no, we don't do that in our industry. And it's like, then that's an opportunity is what that is. So so funny. David Newman (18:41.11) Amen. John Jantsch (18:46.481) You mentioned the slant and I did want to, think you had two other gravity and generosity. We talked about gravity attracting right fit, but we haven't really talked about this idea of generosity. And that's one that I, you know, I really want to hit on because you know, this radical sharing of everything of expertise, because a lot of people have a, have a mindset that like I'm the expert. I don't share. They pay me to share. So talk a little about that. David Newman (18:51.638) Yes, yes. sure. David Newman (18:57.964) Yes. David Newman (19:03.565) Yes. David Newman (19:09.838) Correct. I'll expand even further on that, John. They say, I can't share that. That's how I make the big bucks or that's our secret sauce. That's our recipe. I would just point out to folks, if you go online to your favorite online bookseller, walk into your favorite independent bookstore, you will find two giant sections. One is the health and weight loss section. The other is the financial and money management section. You hundreds of books and you know, hundreds more published every year. John Jantsch (19:18.057) Right. David Newman (19:42.442) If it was in a book, we would all be tall, rich, thin, sexy, and have a full head of hair. Clearly, I can read all the books I want. This ain't coming back up here. So I want, I would challenge people that the best kind of generosity that you can give into the marketplace, whether it is in written format, audio format, podcast, webinar, I want you to take client facing content. Everyone clutch your pearls. I hope you're sitting down. Take client facing content that you've been paid for and make that into a giveaway. Make that into a lead magnet. Make that into a special report. Do a webinar on that for free for your target market and watch what happens because people are not paying you for information. We've already talked about this in a couple of ways, right? The information is not in the books. AI can crank out endless information way faster and bigger and better than any of us. John Jantsch (20:31.711) Yeah, yeah, yeah. David Newman (20:39.67) What they're paying for is applied insight and implementation of the ideas. If they could do it on their own, they already would have. So they're not gonna download your report. They're not gonna come to your webinar. They're not gonna watch your video series. But I'll tell you, the more that you treat prospects like clients, the more prospects you will get. John Jantsch (20:46.259) Yeah. John Jantsch (21:04.181) It's funny, I used to always say, especially 10, 15 years ago, people really didn't share, because we didn't have all these vehicles to share, right?

A strategic guide for PPC marketers on managing seasonal demand swings with smarter bidding, budgets, inventory alignment, and post-peak planning. Ecommerce demand doesn\u2019t rise and fall in a straight line throughout the years. It can build gradually, spike hard, stall, or drop with little-to-no warning. During peak shopping periods like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Prime Day(s), Back-to-School, these swings become even more intense. For PPC marketers, that volatility affects far more than just traffic or CPCs. It influences bidding strategies, budgets, inventory planning, campaign structures, and even internal operations. Managing demand fluctuation isn\u2019t just about \u201cspending more when demand is high.\u201d It\u2019s also about knowing when demand is coming, preparing your accounts before the surge, staying in control while competition rises, and stabilizing performance after the peak ends. It means understanding that marketing decisions affect logistics and profitability, not just vanity metrics like impression share. This article will walk you through how to manage demand in a way that improves performance and protects the business across each phase of the season. Predictable seasonal spikes are only predictable if you know what to look for. Demand rarely appears out of nowhere. It ramps up gradually. The marketers who recognize early changes in behavior are the ones who scale at the right time instead of reacting too late. Start with historical data from your own account. Look at when impressions and clicks began to rise last year, not just when the holiday officially started. Compare year-over-year and week-over-week trends to identify whether demand is starting earlier. In many industries, consumers begin researching long before they\u2019re ready to buy, which means waiting until \u201cthe big day\u201d is too late to build momentum. Conversion lag is another signal. If your data shows it normally takes five days from first click to purchase, and your promo begins on Friday, you need to start increasing budget earlier in the week. Otherwise, you\u2019ll miss buyers who started the journey before the event. Don\u2019t ignore external factors. Shipping cutoff dates, competitor promotions, weather trends, and even economic sentiment can accelerate or delay demand. The data in the platform only shows part of the picture, while market behavior provides the context. Forecasting is also critical. Even a simple model based on past revenue, impression share, and growth targets can help you determine expected demand and budget requirements. This helps create a baseline so you can recognize when performance is ahead or behind expectations and adjust accordingly. Once demand starts building, your bidding and budgeting strategy must evolve with it. This is where many marketers either scale too slowly and miss opportunity. On the opposite side, you scale too aggressively and burn through budget prematurely. If you\u2019re using Smart Bidding, seasonality adjustments in Google Ads or Microsoft Ads can help the algorithm prepare for a short-term spike that differs from typical trends. These are best used for specific, limited windows (e.g., a 3-day flash sale) rather than entire multi-week seasons. When demand returns to normal, remove the adjustment so the system doesn\u2019t keep bidding too high in a softening market. Target settings also matter. A tROAS (Target Return on Ad Spend) goal that works during regular pricing may be too restrictive during steep discounts. Likewise, a CPA goal may need to be relaxed slightly if conversion rates are temporarily lower but lifetime value remains strong. In some cases, switching to a \u201cMaximize\u201d strategy gives the system more flexibility to capture demand efficiently, especially when intent is high and margin is acceptable. If using \u201cMaximize Conversions\u201d (or Conversion Value), you could set more flexible bid limits to let the algorithm know you\u2019re willing to pay more for conversions without letting it go haywire and have a mind of its own. Budgets require just as much attention as bids. If campaigns are capping out early in the day, you\u2019re likely missing high-intent shoppers later. Increasing budgets, reallocating across campaigns, or adjusting bids to stretch delivery can help you maintain visibility during peak hours. Shared budgets can also allow strong-performing categories to pull in more spend without manual intervention. Scaling back after the surge is equally important. Abrupt budget cuts or major bid changes can disrupt algorithmic learning. Gradual reductions give the system time to recalibrate as demand normalizes. Even the best campaign strategy falls apart if product availability isn\u2019t properly managed. During peak shopping seasons, inventory can change rapidly. If feeds don\u2019t update quickly, ads may continue promoting items that are low or out of stock. This leads to wasting spend and hurting customer experience. Be sure to increase your feed update frequency during high-demand periods. This could mean multiple syncs per day if possible. Ensure that price, availability, and shipping information are accurate. If your platform or feed tool allows real-time inventory updates, take advantage of it. Custom labels in your feed are one of the most valuable seasonality tools. Try labeling your products by margin, best seller status, promotion type, limited stock, or seasonality. This allows you to structure campaigns around business priorities, not just categories or sub-types. For example: Performance Max and Shopping campaigns require even more attention. In my experience, it\u2019s common to see PMax concentrate budget on a narrow slice of the catalog while other SKUs receive little to no impression share. If that pattern doesn\u2019t match your merchandising goals, segmenting high-priority product groups and tightening feed signals usually helps. If you don\u2019t segment campaigns thoughtfully or monitor product-level performance, the algorithm may stall. Consider using a mix of Standard Shopping and PMax when you need more control over key seasonal categories. Standard Shopping can provide the structure you need, while PMax can help with scaling. Just make sure they serve different roles to avoid internal competition. Campaign structure should work hand-in-hand with inventory strategy. The goal is to ensure your best products get visibility when demand spikes and that you don\u2019t waste spend on items you can\u2019t fulfill. In normal months, PPC managers can operate with relative independence. During major retail seasons, that approach can create problems. Demand fluctuation affects far more than media spend. It touches logistics, merchandising, pricing, site operations, and customer experience. For example, if marketing pushes a product heavily but the warehouse can\u2019t fulfill orders quickly enough, conversion rates could drop, and customer complaints can arise. If a PPC offer launches a \u201c50% off\u201d ad before the site reflects the discount, you\u2019ll likely pay for unqualified clicks or see conversions drop. If inventory runs low but product promotions continue, you\u2019ll burn budget on products that can\u2019t convert. During peak periods, cross-functional alignment is necessary for optimal performance. Be sure to establish regular communication with: Even short daily syncs with these teams can prevent costly mistakes. Something as simple as a delayed shipment or pricing error can change campaign performance within hours. When teams are aligned, marketing decisions become less reactive and more strategic. Also, be prepared to change messaging quickly. If shipping times increase, adjust ad copy or landing page expectations. If a product is selling out fast, highlight \u201climited availability\u201d or shift spend to similar in-stock alternatives. When the surge ends, the work isn\u2019t over. The post-peak period can feel unstable. After peak periods, I\u2019ve experienced many advertisers observe a short re-balancing window: Conversion intent normalizes faster than bidding pressure does. This is where many marketers overreact and cut budgets too aggressively, causing campaigns to lose momentum. Instead, treat the cooldown as a transition phase. Reset any seasonality bid adjustments. Reevaluate ROAS or CPA targets. Gradually adjust budgets to align with current demand, rather than slashing them immediately. Shift campaign focus to retention and LTV where appropriate. Remarketing, post-purchase offers, loyalty initiatives, and subscription promotions can help turn seasonal traffic into long-term value. The conversion window doesn\u2019t always end when the sale does. This is also the most important time to analyze. Don\u2019t wait weeks to reflect; be sure to capture key insights while the data is fresh. When analyzing, ask questions like: Document everything. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll remember next year. Seasonality repeats, but consumer behavior and the corresponding algorithm responses evolve every year. The teams that improve each cycle are the ones who treat post-peak as planning time, not recovery time. Then, build your playbook for the next season. Define earlier ramp-up timing if needed. Establish bidding and budget frameworks. Create inventory and messaging coordination workflows. When the next seasonality surge comes, you\u2019ll be ready to scale strategically. Managing demand fluctuation is more about staying in control when the market becomes unpredictable. That requires preparation, data awareness, cross-team coordination, flexible bidding and budgeting, and deliberate post-peak analysis. Demand shifts will always happen. The difference between chaotic seasons and successful ones comes down to how well you anticipate, adapt, and learn from each cycle. The marketers who treat seasonality as a workflow system (not an event) are the ones who can turn volatility into growth.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Athletic departments are spending too much money on the wrong things. Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. Here\u2019s an idea for overhauling the mess that is money in college sports: For every dollar that a university athletic department spends on coaching salaries fatter than a duke\u2019s inheritance, or locker rooms as luxurious as Hadrian\u2019s villa, a dollar should go toward academic funding\u2014to faculty salaries, library maintenance, and other necessities that benefit all students, athletes included. Such an arrangement might help reform a truly broken system, which demands compulsive, destructive overspending\u2014on coaching, facilities, and more\u2014in a cycle of one-upmanship. The problem is most acute in football, which is the largest moneymaker in college sports but also the most egregious cost driver. Total revenue shared by the 136 major schools that compete in the top-tier Football Bowl Subdivision amounted to about $11.7 billion in 2024. The money comes from media rights\u2014such as the College Football Playoff\u2019s $1.3 billion yearly deal with ESPN\u2014along with ticket sales, corporate sponsors, donor gifts, and, in some cases, student fees and state funds. These schools tend to spend most of (and, in some cases, more than) what they take in\u2014on waterfalls and golf simulators, on $700 showerheads, on wood-paneled locker rooms with custom pool tables, and, most disproportionately, on a handful of coaches. Efforts to curb all this spending are rarely directed at the spenders themselves. Instead, athletes are routinely cast as culprits for demanding to be paid and thus in need of strict oversight to keep them pure, an attitude that President Donald Trump expressed last week in an interview with ESPN\u2019s Pat McAfee. \u201cIt is a very serious problem because even football, where they give quarterbacks $12 million, $13 to $14 million,\u201d Trump said, \u201call of a sudden you\u2019re going to be out of control.\u201d But the behavior that needs correcting in this era of billion-dollar-a-year TV contracts and other accelerant revenues is that of shopaholic college administrators, whose expenditures have become so untethered from any scholastic purpose. Regulate them. Nine head football coaches at major universities began this season with an annual salary of more than $10 million, and 46 others are scheduled to make at least $4 million. Coaches\u2019 pay is the second-biggest athletic expense at Football Bowl Subdivision schools, behind only facility costs. Many of these coaches will collect millions even if they fail. In 2021, for example, Louisiana State University granted Brian Kelly a 10-year, guaranteed contract worth $95 million\u2014only to dismiss him after the team started 5\u20133 this season. His firing triggered an almost $54 million buyout clause, and a lawsuit over what he is owed. Since the College Football Playoff system was launched in 2015, public universities are on pace to pay more than $1 billion in severance to coaches, according to a report from the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, a think tank that studies educational reforms in sports. To repeat: Public universities are paying more than $1 billion in just 10 years to a handful of fired gym teachers. \u201cThe severance payments,\u201d the Knight Commission\u2019s CEO, Amy Privette Perko, told me, \u201chave really put an exclamation point on the problem.\u201d Read: The shame of college sports In a normal business, this would be irrational behavior. But the administrators who make these deals are simply responding to extreme forces in an abnormal market. College athletic departments are caught in an asymmetrical situation: They are part of institutions that are legally defined as educational nonprofits, yet they operate in a kill-and-eat environment awash in torrents of profit. They must spend to win and spend to force their competitors to fail. It\u2019s a \u201czero-sum game,\u201d Kevin Blue, a former UC Davis athletic director, told me. From a \u201cbehavioral economics perspective,\u201d Blue has written, college sports\u2019 financial decision makers are \u201cacting rationally.\u201d But unlike conventional businesses, athletic departments have no owners or boards or shareholders to enforce spending controls. Instead, they\u2019re shadow-ruled by constituencies of powerful alumni donors with idiosyncratic desires. \u201cPeople are spending essentially nobody\u2019s money to service their own objective of being competitively successful,\u201d Blue said. When an additional $10 million comes in\u2014whether from a big donation or higher-than-usual ticket sales\u2014the incentive is to do more competitive spending, not less. These systemic distortions are why coaching salaries have spun out of control. This market is badly in need of regulation by Congress, the only body with the authority and reach to enact reforms that could create a fairer, more reasonable system. The main governing body of college sports, the NCAA, has been hobbled by antitrust litigation and the self-interest of its voting-member schools. State laws have been a patchwork. Without Congress\u2019s intervention, athletic departments at schools that don\u2019t win or have fewer resources will face trade-offs. Runaway expenditures could mean cuts\u2014particularly to some Olympic sports and women\u2019s sports that don\u2019t bring in enough revenue to cover their expenses. \u201cFewer scholarships, fewer teams,\u201d Perko said. It can also mean higher student fees, and for public schools, taxpayer liability. For example: Virginia Tech\u2019s athletic spending rose by 41 percent from 2019 to 2024, and the school recently increased its mandatory student fees to help cover the department. Only a handful of major football powers are equipped to compete sustainably in this landscape. The University of Texas at Austin is one of them. With almost $332 million in athletic revenues in 2024, it is a self-perpetuating department that doesn\u2019t rely on state funds or student fees. Of its nearly $66 million football budget, almost $23 million goes to coach Steve Sarkisian and his staff, who are in the middle of a disappointing season. If Sarkisian were fired, he would be due more than $60 million on his guaranteed, seven-year, almost $81 million contract extension. But the burden would be easily shouldered by the school\u2019s oil-rich, football-fevered boosters, who in 2024 provided $137 million in gifts to the athletic department. Texas\u2019s fiscal behavior squeezes its competitors, especially the smaller ones. The Football Bowl Subdivision is a jigsaw puzzle of different-size schools with varying incomes and priorities. Appalachian State University\u2019s football budget is just $16.2 million\u2014and it grew by 66 percent over five years, while its overall athletics debt rose by 20 percent over the same time. At Middle Tennessee State University, where athletics debt has grown by 102 percent in five years, thanks in part to a more than $100 million upgrade to its facilities, the department has cut back on football uniforms. Texas administrators are not being intentionally villainous. They\u2019re simply playing to win, within the market structure. The great fear of NCAA-member schools is that they are now encountering another artificially inflated market, this one for players. From 2021 to 2025, court decisions and legal settlements have rightly granted long-denied economic rights to athletes, including control of their own names, images, and likenesses (NIL). Ambitious donors have turned NIL into another distorted market by forming \u201ccollectives,\u201d large collaborative funds that sign athletes for real or purported commercial endorsements, in deals known as \u201cpay-for-play.\u201d These collectives essentially establish payrolls, further widening the competitive gap. One coach estimated that some college rosters are being paid as much as $40 million a year. In a panicked response, NCAA lobbyists are pressing Congress and the White House for antitrust protection to restrict athlete compensation. In an obliging July executive order called \u201cSaving College Sports,\u201d Trump identified the \u201cwaves of recent litigation\u201d that \u201celiminated limits on athlete compensation\u201d as a \u201cmortal threat\u201d to American games and commanded various agencies and departments to study federal interventions. An alphabet soup of congressional proposals, such as the SAFE Act and SCORE Act, would also regulate athlete pay and behaviors, though to differing degrees. But none of these measures properly aim at the colleges and universities themselves, or what drives them. Yes, the LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier will reportedly make $4 million on NIL deals this season. But he didn\u2019t create the market. Nussmeier is not the \u201cmortal threat\u201d to college athletics. The mortal threat is a system that compels an otherwise-sage school president to authorize paying a coach $130 million over 10 years. Read: The most difficult position in sports Until the NCAA\u2019s structural fault is recognized, no reform can work. Campus officers actually crave federal help in curbing their reflexive spending. A poll conducted last summer by Elon University and the Knight Commission of 376 school officials found that 79 percent of them fear they\u2019ll have to rely on institutional money and student fees in the future to fund sports. Nearly seven in 10 respondents said that they favor national legislation that would limit how much they can spend on their athletic budgets. Several feasible proposals for spending limits are floating around, which Congress could incorporate into a bipartisan bill. One, from the Knight Commission, would require institutions to devote at least half of shared athletic revenues either directly to the education and health benefits of its athletes, or to university academics. Some schools already follow this guidance, but not many. A similarly strong proposal comes from the Drake Group, another academic think tank. It recommends a mandate that whatever a school\u2019s \u201caggregated annual coaches and staff compensation and benefits,\u201d the same amount must be devoted to financial benefits for student athletes. This is an ingenious cap: LSU probably wouldn\u2019t pay another football coach a ludicrous $95 million under those conditions. The most dominant football programs, and their influential donors, are likely to oppose such broad measures for fear of surrendering their competitive advantage. But Congress has the leverage to make it happen. These institutions badly want a reform of their own: legislative antitrust protection to cap the talent market and stop endless litigation with players. This should be conditional on also capping broader athletic spending. As Blue has written, \u201cIf we are asking Congress to treat symptoms of the athlete compensation problem, we should also ask for help dealing with its root cause.\u201d Lawmakers have a golden opportunity to force these schools to act like what they are supposed to be\u2014schools.

The Bluetooth speaker market overflows with generic black boxes that all sound roughly the same, but Marshall brings legitimate audio heritage and iconic design to an over-crowded category. The Acton III just dropped to a record low of $179 for Black Friday\u2019s opening day on Amazon, down from its usual $299 price. Marshall built its reputation on guitar amplifiers that shaped rock and roll for decades, and that audio expertise translates directly into home speakers that sound like music instead of compressed digital mush. See at Amazon The Acton III delivers a wider stereo soundstage compared to the previous generations, hence giving the impression of sound surpassing the physical speaker cabinet. To achieve better stereo separation in such a compact form factor, Marshall redesigned the internal driver arrangement and acoustic tuning. The signature Marshall sound emphasizes midrange clarity and controlled bass which makes vocals and instruments sound present rather than distant. You get to hear details in recordings that cheaper speakers bury under the boomy bass or shrill treble. Marshall engineered the Acton III to be immediately usable without complicated setup procedures or compulsory app installations. You power on the speaker, toggle on Bluetooth on your phone, select Marshall Acton III from available devices and start playing music within 30 seconds. This straightforward approach saves you from frustration over pairing modes, connection failures, or multi-step configuration processes. This speaker remembers your previously paired device and picks up the signal automatically when it comes in range. Next-generation Bluetooth 5.2 provides more stable connections with lower latency than older Bluetooth versions. The improved protocol keeps connections strong even when you walk into other rooms with your phone and reduces audio lag during video playback. Marshall future-proofed the speaker by building in support for Bluetooth features that haven\u2019t been finalized yet, so firmware updates can enable new capabilities as the Bluetooth standard evolves. The 3.5mm auxiliary input will accept wired connections from devices that don\u2019t have Bluetooth or for situations where you want to avoid wireless compression. You can plug in older MP3 players, laptops without Bluetooth, or use the aux input for guaranteed zero-latency audio during gaming or video editing. For purists who prefer wired, analog input bypasses digital processing. The top analog control knobs adjust the volume, bass, and treble with very satisfying tactile feedback-beating tapping on glass touchscreens any day. Boosting the bass for hip-hop or dialing it back down for acoustic is straightforward; you can easily dial in your preferred sound signature. The treble control brightens up vocals and cymbals or tames overly harsh recordings. At $179, this Black Friday price makes the Marshall Acton III cheaper than many generic Bluetooth speakers that don\u2019t feature the audio engineering, build quality, and design heritage that Marshall has. That 40% discount brings premium audio down to mid-tier pricing, and that wider soundstage combined with Marshall\u2019s signature tuning delivers an experience that justifies the brand\u2019s reputation.

Smartwatches compete based on health tracking accuracy and ecosystem integration, and Apple Watch remains on top despite premium pricing starting at $399 for the latest Series 10. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch 7 brings similar health metrics, AI-powered insights, and advanced sleep tracking at a fraction of Apple\u2019s cost, and Amazon just dropped it to a record low of $129 for Black Friday, down from its $249 retail price. That nearly 50% discount undercuts even older Apple Watch models, but you get hardware that Samsung quietly released earlier this year. See at Amazon The Energy Score calculates your daily physical readiness by analyzing yesterday\u2019s activity, sleep quality, heart rate patterns, and recovery metrics. This AI-driven analysis tells you if your body is prepared for hard work or needs lighter activities and rest. The score updates every morning, based on the data collected during the night, providing actionable information before you plan your day\u2019s training. Samsung\u2019s AI analyses that data on the paired phone rather than in the cloud, keeping health data private while providing personalized recommendations. Over time, the system learns your patterns to fine-tune accuracy while gathering more data about your unique physiology and response to different levels of activity. Performance tracking provides real-time comparisons of your current run or bike ride to past sessions, showing exactly where you\u2019re maintaining, improving, or falling behind your pace. It\u2019s that real-time feedback that lets you dial in your effort during a workout, rather than finding out later that you underperformed. The Galaxy AI removes movement artifacts from the heart rate signals of exercising users, improving the accuracy in cases where an individual\u2019s arms are swinging or vibrations impact sensor contact. Sleep tracking follows your rest cycles and detects patterns that show poor sleep quality or probable health issues. For example, the watch identifies light sleep, deep sleep, REM stages, and periods of wakefulness throughout the night with accuracy that rivals dedicated sleep tracking devices. From there, Samsung\u2019s AI analyzes the data to provide recommendations for improving sleep hygiene, adjusting bedtime routines, or modifying evening habits that interfere with quality rest. The sleep apnea detection feature screens for moderate and severe cases by monitoring breathing disruptions and oxygen levels during sleep. Wellness tips provides personalized recommendations from the advanced health data your watch gathers all day. Its AI looks at patterns of activity, stress levels, and sleep quality, along with heart rate trends, to identify areas in which small changes may help optimize overall wellbeing. Such advice isn\u2019t just about general fitness; it comments on real-life behavior and physiological responses unique to each person. The system may recommend earlier bedtimes when it observes accumulated sleep debt, advise stress management techniques during especially tense weeks, or encourage one to move more on days when mostly sedentary. The 40mm case size fits smaller wrists comfortably without the bulk larger smartwatches create. Bluetooth connectivity keeps a stable connection to your phone for notifications, calls, and data syncing without requiring cellular service that adds to monthly fees. Battery life extends through a full day and night of continuous health tracking, though exact duration varies based on which features you enable and how often you interact with the watch. Samsung\u2019s ecosystem integration works seamlessly with Galaxy phones but also functions with other Android devices and even iPhones, though some features require Samsung hardware for full functionality. The watch face customization options let you prioritize which health metrics appear prominently, adjusting the display to show the data you actually care about rather than generic layouts. At $129, you\u2019re getting Samsung\u2019s latest smartwatch technology at nearly half the price of entry-level Apple Watch models that don\u2019t offer comparable AI-powered health insights. For those who have been priced out of the smartwatch market by Apple\u2019s premium positioning, this 48% discount brings flagship health tracking within reach.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"It was the most momentous event in UK history since World War Two. As a new virus took hold, millions of us were told to stay at home and billions of pounds were spent propping up the country's economy. The Covid inquiry will publish its second set of findings on Thursday, looking in detail at the huge political choices made at the time - including how lockdowns were introduced, the closure of businesses and schools, and bringing in previously unthinkable social restrictions.  \"Did the government serve the people well, or did it fail them?\" asked the lead counsel at the start of this part of the inquiry in 2023. Since then more than 7,000 documents have been made public from the time, including WhatsApp chats and emails, private diaries and confidential files. Here, BBC News has picked out some of the urgent messages and scribbled notes that shine a light on how critical decisions were taken in 2020. On 2 January 2020 an update appears on ProMed, a service used by health workers to warn of emerging diseases. \"World Health Organization in touch with Beijing after mystery viral pneumonia outbreak,\" it says. \"Twenty-seven people - most of them stallholders at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market - treated in hospital.\" The next day England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, sends the bulletin on to Peter Horby, a professor at Oxford University and chair of Nervtag, a group that advises the government on new viral threats. By the end of January, it's clear the health authorities in Wuhan have a major problem on their hands. The deputy ambassador to China, Christina Scott, sends a cable back to London marked DIPTEL BEJING (Sensitive) comparing the situation to the outbreak of another virus - SARS - in 2003. \"Hubei province on lockdown; multiple cities have transport restrictions. Memory of SARS cover-up ensures residual distrust of government response,\" it says. \"They will do everything they can to quickly control this outbreak. But the challenge of doing so is substantial.\" The virus spreads to Thailand and South Korea and then to Iran and northern Italy. At lunchtime on Saturday 7 March the UK's then prime minister, Boris Johnson, is chatting on WhatsApp to his health secretary Matt Hancock ahead of the England vs Wales game at Twickenham. Days later, the Cheltenham horse racing festival goes ahead and Atletico Madrid fans are allowed to fly from Spain to Liverpool to watch their team play in the Champions League. The government's strategy, backed by its scientific advisers, is to try to contain early outbreaks by isolating those with the virus and tracing any contacts. The plan is then to move to a \"delay phase\" as full community transmission is established \u2013 using policies like home isolation advice for those with symptoms to \"flatten the curve\" of the pandemic so that hospitals do not become overwhelmed. But the virus is spreading much faster than expected and it\u2018s quickly becoming clear to many scientists that far stronger action will be needed. On Friday 13 March, two senior No 10 officials are sitting in a key meeting of scientific advisers in Whitehall.  \"WE ARE NOT READY,\" one writes in capital letters in his notepad. The other leans over and crosses out \"NOT READY\", replacing it with an expletive.  That weekend, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is locked in a series of meetings with the PM and a handful of select staff as a new strategy takes shape. Grainy smartphone images show whiteboards in No 10 full of hand-drawn charts and scrawled bullet points. One graph suggests that, if the virus was allowed to run its course without any restrictions in place, then more than 100,000 people would die \"in [hospital] corridors\" in the coming wave. On Sunday 15 March, Cummings sends a WhatsApp to Johnson: \"FYI \u2013 [Patrick] Vallance [the chief scientific adviser] is on board with what will NEVER be discussed as Plan B.\" \"[In a] nutshell: we move through the gears to [do] whatever we need to stop NHS collapse and buy time to increase capacity.\" Over the following week, Covid rules across the UK are tightened. People are advised, but not legally required, to avoid all non-essential contact and work from home where possible. Then schools are closed, followed by pubs, restaurants, gyms and cinemas. But still there are concerns that even those measures are not strong enough. On Sunday 22 March, London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, writes a private letter to Johnson. The next evening, in a televised address watched by 27 million people, the prime minister tells the public they must stay at home as he announces the first national lockdown. It will now be up to the inquiry to decide if making that call earlier could have saved lives and ultimately reduced the total time that people had to stay locked indoors. Over the next month some hospitals do come under severe pressure with intensive care units spilling into corridors and side rooms. Pre-planned or elective care is put on hold but at no point does the NHS have to turn away emergency patients. Covid infections, hospitalisations and deaths start to fall. But the cost of lockdown restrictions is huge: education is disrupted, loneliness and mental health problems get worse, and jobs and businesses are impacted. On 22 May, Johnson sends a handwritten note to his officials asking for a plan to \"start operation BOUNCEBACK\". That month some restrictions begin to be lifted \u2013 soon groups of six are able to meet outdoors and schools start a phased re-opening. In the summer, then-chancellor Rishi Sunak tries to boost the economy with his Eat Out to Help Out scheme - 50% off food and drinks for three days a week in August. The idea is well received by the hospitality industry but there are concerns about the health impact. On WhatsApp (with spelling mistakes), Hancock warns Simon Case, then the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, that it's causing problems in intervention areas - that\u2019s those local authorities with the highest infection rates. In his evidence to the inquiry, Sunak plays down a link between his scheme and the spread of the virus saying a second wave \"happened in every other country in Europe\". But that tension \u2013 between controlling Covid and protecting the economy \u2013 becomes even more intense through the autumn. Many scientists advising the government want to see tighter rules. They campaign for a short \"circuit breaker\" lockdown to try to drive down infections. At times the documents suggest the prime minister supports tougher restrictions, at others he appears determined to avoid another strict national lockdown at all costs. On WhatsApp Johnson's closest aides complain about his decision-making \u2013 using an emoji of a broken trolley as he appears to swerve from one policy position to another. \"This government doesn't have the credibility needed to be imposing stuff within only days of deciding not to,\" writes Case, who is now the new cabinet secretary, to Cummings and Lee Cain, No 10 director of communications, on 14 October. \"We look like a terrible, tragic joke. If we were going hard, that decision was needed weeks ago. I cannot cope with this.\" In his testimony to the inquiry, Case later says he regrets expressing his \"at-the-moment frustrations\" with Johnson, whom he \"barely knew\" at the time. In his evidence, Johnson defends his own leadership style, saying his views changed with the scientific evidence, and he often adopted certain positions because he wanted to hear the counter arguments. As the nights draw in that autumn, it becomes clear that existing restrictions in England - including a 10pm curfew and the so-called tiered system of local controls - are not going to be enough to control the virus. By the end of October, the prime minister's frustration is obvious in the long note he scrawls at the end of a Covid briefing document marked OFFICIAL\/SENSITIVE. In tightly spaced handwriting, Johnson pens 22 detailed points over two A4 pages of the document.  He approves of strengthening some local restrictions but bemoans the \"terrible cost\" and wonders \"for HOW LONG?\"  \"Is NHS T&T [test and trace] actually achieving ANYTHING?\" he asks at one point. A week later, on 5 November 2020, England does enter its second national lockdown, this time lasting four weeks, although most schools remain open. By this point many decisions are being taken independently by the four nations of the UK. Both Wales and Northern Ireland put in place versions of a circuit breaker lockdown, while in Scotland stricter rules are imposed in the central belt. The plan is still to allow families and friends to meet up at Christmas.  But by mid-December a new, more infectious variant of the virus is spreading and millions living in the south-east of England are told at short notice that Christmas mixing will be cancelled. In January 2021, a third and final full national lockdown follows across the UK, as the winter wave peaks and the NHS starts rolling out millions of doses of the first Covid vaccines. Five years on from those dramatic 12 months, the inquiry's findings are long-awaited, particularly by the 235,000 families who lost loved ones in the pandemic. The messages and documents highlighted here are just a snapshot - the report due later will run to around 800 pages. It will examine some of the key questions in much more detail: the timing of lockdowns, the impact of restrictions on the most vulnerable, and public confidence in the rules amid reports of partying in Downing Street and other alleged rule breaches. Groups representing thousands of bereaved families want individuals working in government at the time to be held to account for any pandemic failings.  But - above all - they want the state to learn lessons from any mistakes and be better prepared if and when the next unknown virus arrives on our shores.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"The unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent as the labour market cools. By Andy Hirschfeld and Reuters Share Save United States job growth accelerated in September despite a cooling job market as the unemployment rate rose. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 119,000 jobs after a downwardly revised 4,000 drop in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report released on Thursday. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent, up from 4.3 percent in August. The healthcare sector had the most gains, totalling 43,000 jobs in September. Food and beverage services sectors followed, adding 37,000 jobs, and social assistance employment grew by 14,000. Other sectors saw little change, including construction, wholesale trade, retail services, as well as professional and business services. The federal workforce saw a decline of 3,000, marking 97,000 jobs cut from the nation\u2019s largest employer since the beginning of the year. Transportation and warehousing, an industry hit hard by tariffs, also saw declines and shed 25,000 jobs in September. Average wages grew by 0.2 percent, or 9 cents, to $36.67. The September jobs report was initially slated for release on October 3, but was pushed out because of the US government shutdown. The jobs report typically comes out on the first Friday of each month. Because of the 43-day-long shutdown, the US Labor Department was unable to collect the data needed to calculate the unemployment rate for the month of October. Nonfarm payrolls for the month of October will be released as part of the November employment report, which is slated to be released on December 16. Heading into the economic data blackout, the BLS had estimated that about 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the 12 months through March than previously reported. A drop in the number of migrant workers coming into the US in search of work \u2013 a trend which started during the final year of former US President Joe Biden\u2019s term and accelerated under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration \u2013 has depleted labour supply.      \u201cToday\u2019s delayed report shows troubling signs below the topline number: the underlying labour market remains weak, leaving working Americans with shrinking opportunities and rising insecurity. Month after month, the Trump economy is producing fewer jobs, more instability, and fewer pathways for families trying to get ahead,\u201d Alex Jacquez, chief of policy for the economic think tank the Groundwork Collaborative, said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera. Economists estimate the economy now only needs to create between 30,000 and 50,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population, down from about 150,000 in 2024. The rising popularity of artificial intelligence is also eroding demand for labour, with most of the hits landing on entry-level positions in white collar jobs, and locking recent college graduates out of work. Economists said AI was fueling jobless economic growth. Others blamed the Trump administration\u2019s trade policy for creating an uncertain economic environment that had hamstrung the ability of businesses, especially small enterprises, to hire. The US Supreme Court earlier this month heard arguments about the legality of Trump\u2019s import duties, with justices raising doubts about his authority to impose tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.      Despite payrolls remaining positive, some sectors and industries are shedding jobs. Some economists believed the September employment report could still influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s December 9-10 policy meeting on interest rate decisions. US central bank officials will not have November\u2019s report in hand at that meeting, as the release date has been pushed to December 16 from December 5. Minutes of the Fed\u2019s October 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed many policymakers cautioned that lowering borrowing costs further could risk undermining the fight to quell inflation.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"AVAX One Technology (AVX), an Avalanche-centered digital asset treasury company with hedge fund veteran Anthony Scaramucci heading the advisory board, is the latest to turn to share buybacks to arrest plunging stock prices. The firm said Thursday its board authorized an up to $40 million stock repurchase program, which will be executed at the company's discretion depending market conditions. \"We expect to hit the open market soon and will continue to assess additional repurchases as conditions warrant,\" CEO Jolie Kahn said in a statement. Shares are roughly 70% below their closing price on the day the company announced its crypto treasury pivot. They're little-changed on Thursday. The move comes as several crypto treasury companies are increasingly turning to share buybacks to close steep discounts between their share prices and the value of their underlying holdings. Some firms, such as ETHZilla and FG Nexus, even sold some of their crypto assets to fund similar programs. AVAX One, formerly known as AgriFORCE Growing Systems, pivoted in September to a crypto treasury strategy with plans to raise $550 million to acquire AVAX over time.

As of the end of Dec. 2024, Verizon had 99,600 full-time staffers, some 88 percent of them are based in the U.S.      \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t             \t \tBusiness \t\t\t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tFormer PayPal CEO to Lead Verizon\t\t \t\t\t               \t \tBusiness \t\t\t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tVerizon Says Network Is \"Holding Up Strong\" Amid California Wildfires\t\t \t\t\t         \tThe cuts are not unusual: Amazon revealed it was slashing 14,000 jobs, Microsoft has exited 15,000 employees, Paramount\u2019s new ownership is cutting roughly 2,000 roles and many other blue-chip companies have seen a thousand-plus staffers cut this year. CEOs have implied that they\u2019re reshaping reshaping workforces to compete in the AI age \u2014 whether that\u2019s the reason for the timing of the cuts has been debated.  \t           \tOne interesting detail in Verizon\u2019s Nov. 20 announcement is the unveiling of a $20 million program for those 13,000 cut employees in \u201creskilling\u201d (i.e. retraining) the staffers that are being exited, in hopes of finding them new roles at other companies.  \t\u201cTo help our people prepare for their future, we have established a $20 million Reskilling and Career Transition Fund for employees departing Verizon,\u201d Schulman wrote in a public memo. \u201cThis fund will focus on skill development, digital training and job placement to help our people take their next steps. Verizon is the first company to set up a fund to specifically focus on the opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI. It is my intent to also work with other companies and the public sector to address the opportunities and challenges in a world where technology will impact all of us.\u201d  \t           \tOne employee that was recently exited at the telcom giant was CEO Hans Vestberg, who had led the company for eight years and was bumped from the role on Oct. 6. During Vestberg\u2019s tenure he effectively shuffled Verizon out of the media business, selling Yahoo and AOL to private equity giant Apollo for $5 billion. He\u2019ll stay on as an advisor through next October.   \tDuring Schulman\u2019s first earnings call as CEO on October 29, he candidly set expectations for a major shake-up. \u201cWhen I look at our performance objectively, Verizon is clearly falling short of our potential,\u201d the exec told analysts.   \t\u201cFor the past few years, our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not a sustainable strategy,\u201d Schulman added. \u201cThis cannot continue, and there is no question that meaningful change is needed.\u201d  \tThe new CEO thinks AI will reverse that trend. \u201cI am a strong believer in the growing power and resulting opportunities created by AI,\u201d he said on the call. \u201cWe have barely scratched the surface of how AI-powered innovation can transform our customer experience. I intend to use AI as a key tool to simplify offers, improve the customer experience and reduce churn through smart, consistent and more personalized marketing and offers.\u201d  \tYear-to-date Verizon stock has been mostly flat, as of Nov. 20 it\u2019s trading at $40.78 a share and is up about 1 percent for the year.

Nvidia's blockbuster earnings just brought relief to Wall Street. On Wednesday, the chip giant reported $57 billion in revenue for the quarter and delivered another blowout performance from its data center division, which brought in $51 billion, surpassing the $49.3 billion analysts projected. Nvidia also lifted its fourth-quarter guidance to expect $65 billion in sales. The optimistic outlook reinvigorated AI and semiconductor stocks after several rocky days. Nvidia stock jumped more than 3% in after-hours trading, while shares of other chipmakers, like Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor, also saw gains. Here are the key takeaways from Nvidia's Q3 earnings, from fear of an AI bubble to the various new partnerships the chipmaker is engaging in. CEO Jensen Huang addressed concerns about the AI bubble head-on. \"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" he said as he kicked off his earnings address. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\" \"As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator,\" Huang added. \"We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\" Huang added that the transition from using CPUs to GPUs, AI's ability to generate revenue through ads, and the rise of agentic AI systems that could spark a new wave of applications are all reasons he still sees growth in the coming years. As an AI optimist, Huang had also previously dismissed concerns that AI could displace a large number of jobs. Nvidia gave its new partnerships a big shoutout. Over the earnings call, Nvidia highlighted new deals with OpenAI, Anthropic, Uber, and xAI. Earlier in September, Nvidia announced a joint letter of intent with OpenAI \"for a landmark strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI's next-generation AI infrastructure to train and run its next generation of models on the path to deploying superintelligence.\" The plan, per the press release, is for Nvidia to invest as much as $100 billion into data center infrastructure using Nvidia hardware to start coming online by the second half of 2026. On Tuesday, Nvidia struck a \"deep technology partnership\" with Anthropic and pledged up to $10 billion in investment for the startup. Anthropic also announced on the same day that it would spend $30 billion on compute to scale its Claude AI model on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which would be \"powered by Nvidia.\" On Wednesday, ahead of the earnings call, Nvidia and xAI also announced that a massive data center in Saudi Arabia, which is loaded with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips, will have Elon Musk's AI startup as its first customer. Export restrictions on China continue to be a concern. CFO Colette Kress said during Wednesday's earnings call that Nvidia is \"disappointed\" by the US export rules that continue to limit its ability to sell advanced AI chips to China, and added that large China orders didn't materialize this quarter because of \"geopolitical issues\" and rising competition in the market. Kress also maintained Nvidia's outlook of assuming zero data-center or compute revenue from China in the fourth quarter, though the company plans to keep engaging with both US and Chinese regulators. Despite the uncertainty, DA Davidson analyst Gill Luria said ahead of the earnings that his team doesn't see AI demand slowing next year and expects Nvidia to hold its lead even as rivals grow and trade tensions persist. Nvidia is bullish on robotics and AI infrastructure. In its earnings report, Nvidia highlighted robotics as one of its key growth areas. Automotive sales in Q3 totaled $592 million, which is a 32% increase compared to the same quarter in 2024. On Wednesday, Nvidia said in its latest 10-Q filing that expanding power infrastructure is a \"complex, multi-year process\" that comes with many hurdles, but the company remains positive that AI infrastructures, such as data centers, will drive growth. \"We believe Nvidia will be the superior choice for the three to $4 trillion in annual AI infrastructure built,\" said Kress during the earnings call. \"We estimate by the end of the decade, demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations.\" \"This past quarter, we announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs,\" Kress added. Nvidia says hyperscalers are driving a huge share of its growth. Kress told investors during the earnings call that hyperscalers like Meta are expected to account for \"roughly half\" of Nvidia's \"long-term opportunity\" as they shift more workloads to accelerated computing and generative AI. She added that Nvidia is helping Meta boost service quality, increasing the time users spend on Threads and Facebook. Huang, however, pushed back on the idea that only the biggest tech giants are buying GPUs. He said that investing in Nvidia's GPUs \"only improves their scale, speed, and cost for general from general-purpose computing,\" especially for companies with more limited resources that need to \"keep driving the cost down.\" Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"     A product in development may use your saliva to regenerate tooth enamel. Here's how it works.    Normally, enamel is unable to regenerate on its own, but this new gel may change that by working with your saliva to rebuild enamel.\u00a0 Dental fillings are an unpleasant experience, but they're necessary to fill in cavities and prevent further damage. What if there was a way to avoid them entirely while still keeping your teeth healthy?\u00a0 A research team at the\u00a0University of Nottingham\u00a0in the UK is developing\u00a0a new gel\u00a0that could help protect against tooth decay and regenerate damaged tooth enamel. The gel fills holes and cracks in the teeth when applied, and contains a modified version of amelogenin, a protein that helps guide the growth of enamel in infants, according to research published in the journal\u00a0Nature Communications\u00a0this month. \"The gel was able to grow crystals epitaxially, which means it's in the same crystallographic orientation as existing enamel,\" Alvaro Mata, a professor in Biomedical Engineering and Biomaterials at the University of Nottingham, told New Scientist. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Enamel is the hard layer of the tooth that shields the softer inner layers from damage caused by general wear and tear, acid and bacteria. Tooth decay happens when the enamel layer breaks down. Enamel doesn't regenerate naturally, and while fluoride treatment and remineralization toothpaste\u00a0that uses nano-hydroxyapatite can offer a temporary fix, they aren't a permanent solution, unlike getting a dental filling. Enamel degradation is the major contributor of tooth decay and it's associated with dental problems that affect as much as 50% of the world's population. The new gel creates a thin yet durable layer that adheres to the teeth for several weeks, using calcium and phosphate to stimulate the growth of new crystals in the enamel.\u00a0 In a separate email interview with CNET, Mata explained how long he expects the gel to last. \"The gel is biodegradable, and the process to remineralize takes approximately two weeks.  It is applied once, and it will endure as native enamel would, depending on people's health habits.\"\u00a0 \"Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical and thermal insults,\" said Abshar Hasan, a postdoctoral fellow and leading author of the study. \"When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural, healthy enamel.\" This process was effective even when the enamel was severely worn and the dentine below was exposed, according to the research.\u00a0 Mata said he believes the gel can be used as a preventative solution to avoid dental fillings, although dentists we spoke with are more cautiously optimistic.\u00a0 \"If used as a preventive solution, it can avoid getting to the dental filling stage,\" said Mata. \"In a way, it needs to be managed as a chronic disease where patients need to start at home with more education and care. Having said this, we have been working on this for 16 years, which has allowed us to develop quite a bit of know-how to understand, control and shape the technology. Because of this, we now have a versatile technology that will derive into multiple types of products. I believe that in the future, dental fillings will be a possibility.\"\u00a0 Mata said he's \"very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable.\" He's started a startup called Mintech-Bio and hopes to have the first product out next year, according to New Scientist, following the clinical trial.\u00a0 CNET reached out to several dentists to get their perspective on the gel. \u00a0\u00a0 Bianca Velayo, a general dentist in Henderson, Nevada, and multipractice owner at PDS Health, was cautious about the timeline.\u00a0 \"Dental materials like this rarely hit the market overnight, even with exciting results,\" she said. \"After early lab success, the real test is how it performs in the human mouth under real-world conditions: heat, saliva, bacteria, diet and daily habits. Between lab research, multiple trial phases and regulatory approval, it usually takes five to 10 years before we'd see a material like this in everyday dental use.\" However, Velayo also said she's excited about the prospect of these replacing traditional dental fillings in the future.\u00a0 \"This gel hints at the future of dentistry, where we could actually regrow what's been lost. It's the difference between repairing and truly healing the tooth,\" she said. Another dentist and multipractice owner at PDS Health, Ahmad Mokbil, said that the treatment has potential, but he doesn't believe it'll be possible anytime soon, as it requires a shift in educating patients, dentists, dental coverage and treatment protocols. However, he pointed to existing technology that's in use.\u00a0 \"We use an FDA-approved treatment called Curodont, which has similar characteristics and is effective for treating early tooth decay,\" Mokbil said. \"The number of applications required can vary depending on how the tooth responds, the size of the cavity and how early the intervention takes place.\"","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Top navigation Buffer\u2019s features Supported social media channels Buffer\u2019s resources Blog navigation Buffer\u2019s blog topics Breadcrumbs PublishedNov 20, 2025 As a self-proclaimed tools nerd, I\u2019m testing the ever-growing list of AI productivity tools on the market. These are the ones I keep coming back to. \u201cWork smarter, not harder\u201d is one of my favorite phrases. Now that I\u2019m a working mom of a toddler, it means even more. I only have so many hours each day. If I want any free time, I need to make the most of them. Enter these AI productivity tools. Some of them help me save hours of work, others a few minutes, while some just help me maintain my sanity \u2014 it all counts. Every second I save goes toward that glorious hour or two when my work is done, my daughter is snuggled up in bed, and I can cozy up with (read: pass out on) a good book. Of course, productivity tools are nothing new \u2014 but with the addition of artificial intelligence, they\u2019ve become even more powerful. These AI-powered tools streamline tasks and free you up for more creative work. As a self-proclaimed tools nerd, I've tested many AI productivity tools. These are the ones I keep coming back to. Use AI to brainstorm, write, and repurpose social media posts. \u00a0For example, Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant can help you generate ideas quickly. One of the best ways to grow on any social media platform is to post consistently (the algorithms love it). If you have a full-time job and side projects, content creation can become really overwhelming, really fast \u2014 unless you\u2019re leaning on Buffer\u2019s AI Assistant.\u00a0 The AI tool can help brainstorm, generate, and repurpose social media posts, no matter what platform you\u2019re using. The assistant is social media smart. In other words, it\u2019s trained to understand the nuances of each platform \u2014 for example, that X\/Twitter posts can\u2019t exceed a certain number of characters, LinkedIn posts tend to be a little more professional, Instagram posts are lighthearted, and so on \u2014 without you having to prompt it.\u00a0\u00a0 When I\u2019m stumped on what to post to help me build my personal brand on LinkedIn, I often turn to Buffer\u2019s Create Space and click the \u2018Generate Ideas\u2019 button to start brainstorming.\u00a0 To\u00a0better understand what will resonate, the assistant asks questions. For example: From there, it generates a stream of ideas. You can approve or reject each one. It can help you workshop existing content. For example, you can repurpose a successful post from one platform to another. That\u2019s my favorite use case. Buffer pricing: Buffer and the AI Assistant are free to use for up to three channels. Paid plans start at $5 per month per channel.\u00a0 Use AI to take the admin jobs off your to-do list. There are many AI productivity tools in my tech toolbox. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is the most versatile. I treat ChatGPT like my AI virtual assistant. I ask it to take time-consuming tasks off my plate several times a week.\u00a0 I use it for things like finding target keywords for SEO, writing basic HTML to augment my blog posts (like the handy table of contents at the top of this list, for example), and summarizing long or complicated documents. ChatGPT\u2019s chatbot functionality helps if the first output isn\u2019t right. You\u00a0keep building on your prompt. For example, I ask it to summarize an article into ten bullet points. If it\u2019s still complicated, I add, \u201cExplain the above like I\u2019m a 10-year-old.\u201d ChatGPT pricing: Free for the basic version, with paid plans starting at $20 per month Use AI to generate documents and search all your documents for specific answers. Notion has long been one of my favorite project management tools \u2014 it\u2019s also a big part of our workflow on Buffer\u2019s Content team and Buffer\u2019s company documentation system \u2014 so I was buzzing when they made the powerful product even better with AI.\u00a0 Notion AI can generate text and autofill databases. It can create page summaries and assign action items. These are all handy time-savers. My favorite Notion AI feature is asking specific questions about your stored information. For example, we use Notion at Buffer to store company documentation. When I\u2019m in a hurry, searching can be slow. Instead of scrolling through articles and databases, I hit the search icon. Then I select \u2018Ask AI\u2019 and type my question. For example: \u201cHow do I categorize internet costs in my monthly expense report?\u201d or \u201cWhich Buffer teammates are based in the US?\u201d The AI generates a response and links to the relevant pages. Notion pricing: Notion is free to use for individuals (including a trial of Notion AI), but plans with Notion AI start at $20 per member per month.  Use AI to automatically transcribe and summarize meetings. I\u2019ve used\u00a0Otter.ai since my journalism days. Audio transcriptions have saved me\u00a0so much time. Reviewing calls takes minutes instead of hours now. I\u00a0transcribe interviews, case studies, and meeting notes. After a meeting, I drag and drop the audio into Otter\u2019s web app. Within minutes, I\u00a0get a full transcript and an AI summary of the call. Why I prefer Otter.ai: Another\u00a0handy Otter.ai feature lets you click a bullet point in the summary. It takes you to that moment in the transcript. This makes catching up on key points super easy. Otter.ai pricing: Free for up to 300 monthly transcription minutes. Paid plans start at $8.33 per month for 1,200 transcription minutes.  Use AI to manage and break down your tasks. Todoist is one of my top productivity tools. I rely on it as a task manager. Todoist\u2019s AI Assistant is simple and helpful. It can help you do three things: I\u2019m a\u00a0big fan of the GTD (Getting Things Done) method. It starts with \u201ccapturing\u201d your tasks \u2014 a big brain dump \u2014 and then organizing them into action steps, which Todoist\u2019s AI Assistant can help me do. (Read more about the GTD method in Francesco D'Alessio\u2019s article on productivity apps for social media marketers.) The AI Assistant isn\u2019t built into Todoist by default. You need to activate it under integrations. Then you\u2019ll see the options shown above. Todoist pricing: While Todoist has a free plan, the AI Assistant is only available on their Pro plan and upwards, which costs $4 per user per month.  Use AI to schedule your day and protect your focus. Reclaim AI helps you claw time back from your jam-packed schedule. It\u2019s not a calendar but an AI-powered assistant for your calendar. (It syncs with Google and Outlook Calendars). Based on your role and priorities, Reclaim helps you block flexible time. For example, focused work time, working out, or lunch breaks. I use Reclaim to block time for these things. I also set a bedtime routine for my daughter. My focus time, lunch, and workout blocks shift daily. My daughter\u2019s bedtime is non-negotiable and remains the same Monday through Friday. Reclaim AI also offers: Reclaim AI pricing: Reclaim has a solid free plan that will help you do most of the things above. Paid plans start at $10 per month. Use AI to read any text aloud.\u00a0 Gwyneth Paltrow helped me edit this article \u2014 thanks to Speechify. Speechify is an AI tool that reads any text to you. It offers over 130 voices, including celebrities, and supports over 30 languages. Thanks to AI, the voices sound natural rather than robotic. If you\u2019re an auditory learner\u00a0like me, Speechify will help you digest information faster. You can speed up the reading pace to boost productivity. Speechify is great for: My favorite use case is having it read my articles aloud before publishing. It\u2019s a great way for writers to catch typos and improve clarity. There are\u00a0neat features, too. For example, you can create your own AI Voice clone\u00a0(I know) or translate and dub videos into other languages. Speechify pricing: Speechify offers a limited free plan. Premium plans start at $11.58 per month per user.\u00a0 Use AI to draft content in your unique style. Type does exactly what it says on the tin: it uses generative AI to help you write more, better.\u00a0 Type does exactly what you\u2019d expect from the name. It turns your prompts or ideas into draft content fast. Type\u2019s interface is uncluttered and easy to use. It includes templates for blog posts, onboarding emails, and more. This is helpful if you struggle to create AI prompts. You might wonder, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say ChatGPT and Notion can do that?\u201d Yes, but Type stands out. You can train it to write like you. With each prompt, you can upload or link to a style example. The AI will mimic it in your draft. The results aren\u2019t perfect. You\u2019ll still need to tweak for a human touch. Still, it\u2019s better than other AI writing assistants I\u2019ve tried. Type pricing: 14 days free, then $12 per month for the first year.  While I\u2019ve tested as many AI tools as I could get my hands on, I know there are plenty out there that I\u00a0haven't tried yet. If there\u2019s a tool out there that I have to put through its paces, I\u2019d love to hear about it! Tag @buffer or @bufferapp on all major social channels to let us know, and I\u2019ll put your favorite tool to the test.\u00a0 AI productivity tools take a lot of the repetitive, admin-heavy work off your plate. They can write first drafts, summarize long documents, organize your tasks, help you schedule meetings, and even pull insights from data you don\u2019t have time to read through. These tools use artificial intelligence to automate tasks, support creative work, and make decision-making easier. Think of them as smart assistants that can handle everything from generating ideas to managing your calendar to capturing meeting notes automatically. Most modern tools are designed to be intuitive and beginner-friendly. The quality of what you get out of it improves as you learn how to give clearer prompts, but the learning curve is intentionally light. They\u2019re generally safe as long as you\u2019re mindful of what you share. Every tool handles data differently, so it\u2019s important to check the privacy settings and avoid entering anything sensitive or confidential unless the platform guarantees protection. AI should help you work faster, not put your information at risk. It depends on how you use them. At first, you might spend some time editing or adjusting AI-generated content. But as you get better at prompting and understanding what each tool is good at, the time savings become significant. Most people find that AI handles the heavy lifting, and they only need to polish the final result. Some tools are completely free, others offer solid free tiers, and a few cost more because they\u2019re built for teams or advanced workflows. The right option depends on your needs. A useful way to think about it is whether the tool saves you enough time or mental energy to justify its price tag. Anyone who works with words, ideas, meetings, or tasks benefits almost instantly. Marketers and content creators use them to generate ideas and drafts. Basically, if your job involves thinking, writing, planning, or communicating, AI can take a chunk of friction out of your day. Look for tools that fit naturally into your existing workflow, rather than forcing you to change everything. The best options feel simple, speed up your existing tasks, and integrate with the apps you already rely on. Reliability, accuracy, and ease of use tend to matter far more than flashy features. There can be, especially if you start outsourcing all your critical thinking to it. AI is most helpful when it\u2019s used as a partner rather than a replacement. Let it draft, organize, and automate \u2014 but keep your human judgment, creativity, and verification in the loop. Start by choosing one tool to solve one specific problem, like writing content, capturing meeting notes, or organizing your tasks. Use it for a few days, experiment with different prompts or features, and notice where it genuinely helps. Once you\u2019re comfortable, it becomes much easier to introduce other tools or expand how you use AI in your routine.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"The Google Pixel 10 is a powerful, versatile phone that can compete directly with Apple's iPhone. Google has refined the user experience to provide a tight, sleek experience that suits power users and casual users alike. Pixel phones are unique amongst Android devices in that they have minimal bloatware (unless you consider Gemini and related apps like Pixel Journal and Pixel Screenshots bloat), and are incredibly easy to set up and use. However, there are downsides. Google's focus on its user experience comes at a cost. Pixel phones are some of the least customizable Android phones on the market; the days of Pixel phones offering the stock Android experience are long gone. Nevertheless, Google has started making steps in the right direction, but is it enough?  We at AP love complaining about At a Glance. It's a frustrating blot on the Pixel experience. An immovable widget that's only relevant for a few minutes each day is not what Android should be about. However, recent evidence has shown that Google is     testing a \"Show on home screen\" toggle in the At a Glance settings. If this feature works as suggested, you will be able to remove the widget from your Pixel's home screen.     This will free up a huge amount of space on the home screen. Users can replace it with third-party widgets, apps, or any other tool they find more useful. However, At a Glance does have value, and there's a way Google can find a middle ground. I like At a Glance when it works. It's perfectly named. At a glance, I can see the battery status of connected devices, the time left on a timer, weather alerts, and reminders for upcoming events. There's much more it can do, but this is the information I see most frequently. If I had a Nest doorbell, I could see who's at my door, and the commute timer would be relevant if I drove to work. If Google implements a toggle to remove At a Glance, I still won't remove the feature. I'll deal with the frustration of it taking up dead space on my display for most hours of the day. Removing it is too big a step, but keeping it around is annoying. What I really want is to customize it. To \"fix\" At a Glance, Google needs to take two steps. The first is to treat it like a widget. Let us move it, resize it, and change its appearance. At a Glance doesn't need to take up the entire width of my screen; half would be enough. The white text also doesn't work on many backgrounds. Treating it like a widget would silence many complaints about the feature. Secondly, Google needs to add third-party integration, and (I can't believe I'm saying this), Gemini. Before the Pixel 10 launched, the Magic Cue feature caught my eye. An AI assistant that would pull up relevant information depending on what's on your screen? Great! That's exactly the kind of task I want AI to accomplish. It would save wasted time on menial tasks (for example, scrolling through emails for booking information), but the reality was far less impressive. Magic Cue just doesn't work. It doesn't     integrate with third-party apps, and it rarely appears in the ideal environment. But if it could be integrated with At a Glance, I could see it reaching greater potential.     Let's say someone texts me about a dinner reservation for that evening. I check the message and dismiss it without adding it to my calendar. Magic Cue, however, picks up on the message and sends the information to At a Glance. When At a Glance discovers I ought to leave soon, it displays that information on the widget.  At a Glance is the perfect home for tools like Magic Cue. It already does a decent job of surfacing relevant information, but the potential capabilities of Gemini could drastically improve it, even more so if Google added third-party support. Let's say you don't use Google's Clock app and instead use     a better alternative. At a Glance won't show the timer status if you set one.     If you use a third-party email app, At a Glance can't highlight upcoming trips. If you use a third-party mapping app, At a Glance won't suggest a good time to leave. Allowing us to hide At a Glance is a good first step, but it doesn't solve the underlying problems of the feature. Improving its versatility by adding third-party and Gemini support will turn the feature from occasionally useful to the best software feature of Pixel phones. Don't hide your disappointing features, Google; there's a huge amount of potential just waiting to be used. We want to hear from you!

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"BySiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff andTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The three major market indexes traded down Thursday afternoon after surging earlier in the day, as investors appeared to pull back on dimming hopes the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again in December.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung nearly 1,100 points by Thursday afternoon, falling by roughly 320 points (0.7%) after trading up more than 700 points earlier in the day, with losses across the S&P 500 (down 1.1%) and Nasdaq (1.5%) following a similar rally for both indexes. Nvidia, whose shares rose earlier by more than 3.5% after the chipmaker\u2019s quarterly earnings beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates, declined by 2.5%, adding to losses from Intel (2.8%), AMD (6%), Palantir (5.2%), Qualcomm (3.1%), Amazon (1.8%), Microsoft (1.5%), Meta (1.1%) and Tesla (1.5%). The chip designer led losses across the tech-heavy Nasdaq and Dow, which was pulled down by losses from Boeing (3.7%), Walt Disney (1.8%), Goldman Sachs (1.1%) and Cisco (2.9%). Jeff Kilburg, an analyst at KKM Financial, told CNBC a reversal for Nvidia shares\u2014leading to a broader decline for tech stocks\u2014coincided with the lowering probability for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in December.

Lower odds Thursday followed the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, well above analysts\u2019 estimates despite the unemployment rate rising to 4.4%, as a possible signal of a brief recovery for the labor market.

The goalposts for humanlike intelligence, he said, keep shifting each time AI improves. Intelligence has never been easy to define. For decades, we\u2019ve debated what makes up analytical, creative and emotional intelligence in people, weighing the value of instruction-following against autonomy. We\u2019ve done the same with machines, and my friend is right: the target we\u2019ve set for AI intelligence has continually moved. The subject isn\u2019t merely philosophical. Consider the contract put in place when Microsoft and OpenAI began working together in 2019. OpenAI said in a blog post that Microsoft\u2019s $1-billion investment in the company would \u201csupport us building artificial general intelligence (AGI),\u201d which OpenAI\u2019s charter defines as \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Three weeks ago, on October 28, Microsoft and OpenAI updated their agreement. In it, Microsoft keeps special access to OpenAI\u2019s technology and retains the right to use it first in products until OpenAI says it has reached AGI. Under the new agreement, Microsoft also has the rights to \u201cpost-AGI\u201d models through 2032, and if OpenAI claims it has reached AGI, that declaration will now be independently verified by an expert panel. It raises a difficult question: How will that group of experts decide when human-level intelligence has been achieved? Since 1950 the primary benchmark for machine intelligence has been the Turing test, proposed by computer pioneer Alan Turing. The idea is simple: A human judge communicates with an unseen human and a machine via text and must decide which is human. If the judge can\u2019t reliably tell the two apart, the machine passes. Over the decades that followed Turing\u2019s proposal, researchers built symbolic systems using rules and logic to imitate human problem-solving. Their programs solved puzzles and played games but were largely useless when faced with real-world complexity. Well into the 1990s, \u201cexpert systems\u201d were created that encoded human knowledge but functioned only within extremely narrow domains. The modern era began in the 2010s, when neural networks and large datasets allowed machines to learn patterns instead of relying on fixed rules. In 1997 IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, and chess, which had been a proxy for \u201cthinking,\u201d suddenly became less important in the intelligence discussion. Models for translation, image recognition and language also began to excel. In 2015 a vision model did better than estimated human performance in classifying objects. Other programs surpassed challenges in language and reasoning in the late 2010s. Between 2015 and 2017 AlphaGo\u2014designed to play Go, a more complex game than chess\u2014defeated the world\u2019s best Go players. Cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has argued that we redraw the borders of \u201creal intelligence\u201d whenever machines reach abilities once seen as uniquely human, downgrading those tasks to mere mechanical abilities to preserve humanity\u2019s distinction. Each time AI surpasses the bar for achieving human skills, we raise it. That\u2019s how the concept of AGI emerged\u2014to describe a system that could understand, learn and act across many domains with a human mind\u2019s flexibility. Introduced in 1997 by physicist Mark Avrum Gubrud, it was popularized in the 2000s and stuck because it moved away from the concept of AI as parlor\u2011game imitation and toward the development of benchmarks that evaluate competence across domains and in many different situations. This meant that Deep Blue, ImageNet and AlphaGo had not only to outperform humans in their areas of expertise but also to solve Ph.D.-level math, write prizewinning fiction and make fortunes in the stock market\u2014because, of course, that\u2019s what it means to be human. This is why, when OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 decisively passed the Turing test in 2025, the achievement barely made the news. It\u2019s also why, when GPT-4 received a top-decile score on a simulated bar exam or when any of the current major frontier models solved Ph.D.-level questions, we didn\u2019t arm up to do battle with the robots, as many science-fiction films predicted we would. But if we returned to the 1990s to reveal systems that could converse fluently about science, generate websites in seconds, offer real-time spoken translations and write up a serviceable will, people may well have armed the nukes. Still, there\u2019s something missing. My friend isn\u2019t wrong\u2014machine intelligence meets or surpasses humanlike abilities in many areas\u2014but being an embodied human is complex, and our grasp of intelligence has grown significantly. Although this year\u2019s AI Index Report from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI highlights that the technology is mastering new benchmarks faster than ever, it also stresses that complex reasoning remains a challenge. As many thinkers have pointed out, the problem may simply be in the concept of humanlike intelligence. If AI intelligence is perceived as uneven and ours isn\u2019t, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve set ourselves as the standard. Evolution gave us highly adaptable reasoning skills and a hard skull that limits the size of our databases. Seen in that light, we are also uneven. And as we constantly move the targets for AGI, the intelligence that arrives may be one we hardly recognize. Deni Ellis B\u00e9chard is Scientific American\u2019s senior writer for technology.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"Bloomberg As whispers grow in Washington about President Donald Trump's waning influence over the Republican Party, investors are rapidly backing away from his company's stock. In the past week, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group have fallen 18% and the stock is down 36% in the past month. Shares are ever-so-slightly above their all-time low, currently trading at $10.29, and that's having an impact on Trump's personal fortune. The stock plunge has erased more than $5 billion in wealth for Trump and his family. Trump owns roughly 115 million shares of the company. The decline has been a fairly steady one since the stock's big jump in January prior to the start of his administration's second term. Year to date, Trump Media shares have lost 70% of their value. (The stock was poised to drop once again in pre-market trading Thursday.) Investors are particularly concerned about the company's crypto holdings. The broader cryptocurrency market has been in meltdown for the better part of the past month-and-a-half. Bitcoin prices are now below where they were when Trump took office and just under 2% lower for the year. After spiking as high as $124,000, the price now stands at less than $92,000. Trump Media has been investing heavily in Bitcoin, accumulating $2 billion worth in July, which made up roughly two-thirds of its liquid assets at that time. The crypto problems are likely having a larger impact on Trump's wealth,\u00a0as he has holds or has invested in additional\u00a0crypto ventures including the decentralized finance entity World Liberty Financial and the meme coin $TRUMP, which has fallen from a price of $45 to less than $7 since the start of the year.\u00a0 Trump has been incredibly pro-crypto since taking office, easing regulations for token traders. He has shrugged off concerns about a conflict of interest, noting that his assets are in a trust that's managed by his son Donald Trump, Jr.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"After 43 years, Iowa City's Carlos O'Kelly's Mexican restaurant is closed. The business at 1406 S. Gilbert St., Iowa City, quietly shuttered on Tuesday, Oct. 28, and signage from the building has been removed. \"Thank you for 43 years of celebration, support, and good memories,\" reads a sign on the door. \"We are still operating at our Cedar Rapids location\u2026We look forward to still having the opportunity to serve you.\" The Press-Citizen reached out to the Carlos O'Kelly's corporate contact at its parent company, Thrive Restaurant Group, but the emails bounced back and the phone calls went unanswered. Thrive Restaurant Group, based in Wichita, Kansas, oversees national brands such as Applebee's, Carlos O'Kelly's, HomeGrown, Modern Market Eatery, and Qdoba. The closing of Carlos O'Kelly's in Iowa City is the latest in a series of closings across the state. The Telegraph Herald reported that the Dubuque location of the Tex-Mex restaurant closed June 21 due to the building being sold. The Dubuque staff were reemployed at the neighboring Applebee's. The Waterloo Carlos O'Kelly's permanently closed on March 31. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported that the closure was due to rent and maintenance costs. \"When a building gets older, there's a lot of maintenance to get it up to code, and when a lease expires, it becomes more expensive,\" Thrive Restaurant Group's vice president of marketing, Dave Phillips, told The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. The reasoning for the Iowa City location's closing is unclear, as is whether employees at Carlos O'Kelly's were offered reemployment at nearby Thrive restaurants. The recent closures mean there are only three Carlos O'Kelly's left in Iowa, two in Linn County and the Cedar Falls location. In 2014, two Des Moines metro locations and an Ames location closed. The Mason City location closed in 2017. \"We've been in Des Moines for 18 years, but those stores aren't viable anymore,\"\u00a0Phillips told the Des Moines Register. Other Thrive Restaurant Group dining spots remain open in Iowa, including 25 Applebee's locations, two HomeGrown locations in the Des Moines metro, and five Qdoba locations.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"MLB Trade Rumors  By Nick Deeds | November 20, 2025 at 8:51am CDT  Here are three things we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on around the baseball world throughout the day: 1. Braves getting down to business: Braves president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos has long been known for his desire to move quickly during the offseason, and yesterday saw him kick off Atlanta\u2019s offseason in a big way. The team re-signed closer Raisel Iglesias on a one-year deal worth $16MM and followed that move up by swinging a trade with the Astros for utilityman Mauricio Dubon. Iglesias helps to steady a bullpen mix that bid farewell to righties Tyler Kinley and Pierce Johnson when their club options were declined. Dubon gives the club a viable answer at shortstop should they fail to find an upgrade elsewhere and an excellent bench piece if he does wind up squeezed out of the starting lineup. In addition to further exploring the shortstop market, Atlanta will be on the hunt for rotation help and another reliever or two. 2. Trade market heating up? The Dubon deal was the second notable trade in as many days, joining the surprise swap of Taylor Ward for Grayson Rodriguez between the Angels and Orioles. Neither Ward nor Rodriguez was a potential non-tender candidate, but Dubon and Nick Allen (whom the Astros acquired in exchange for Dubon) both might have been on their previous teams. MLBTR\u2019s list of non-tender candidates released yesterday, and GMs around the league will surely be focused on trying to work out trades for any of their players who they don\u2019t plan to tender a contract to tomorrow over the next day. Some notable trade candidates on that list include Jonah Heim, Adolis Garcia, Jonathan India, Alec Bohm, Jesus Sanchez, and Bailey Falter. 3. Could Iglesias spark more relief market movement? Iglesias re-upping with the Braves wasn\u2019t exactly a shocking move, given Atlanta\u2019s proclivity towards familiar faces and a need for help at the back of a bullpen that lacked certainty outside of Dylan Lee and Aaron Bummer. Even so, there have been indications this winter that the market for relief arms could move more quickly than other parts of free agency. Iglesias is far from the only interesting name available in a market led by Edwin Diaz. Robert Suarez, Ryan Helsley, and Devin Williams are all notable names who should get strong contracts this winter, while Brad Keller, Pete Fairbanks, and Luke Weaver might lack that star power but would still be exciting additions to the back of virtually any bullpen. Who will be the next to sign? The Opener   Donica Lewinsky  10 hours ago Maybe the Royals acquire Adolis Garcia?  Canuckleball  10 hours ago Feels like they should be aiming higher than a seemingly washed Garcia who has hit below average the last 2 seasons.  Donica Lewinsky  9 hours ago Garcia hit better than every Royals outfielder last year, except for post trade Yaz. And he could be had for not too much. They need multiple outfielders.  Canuckleball  9 hours ago Everybody hit better than the Royals outfield last year. That\u2019s not a high bar to leap over. My point was that they should aim higher than someone who is simply \u2018better\u2019 than what they had and go for someone who is actually good. They wasted a year of Witt Jr.\u2019s prime years by putting out a non competitive outfield last season. We all know they aren\u2019t going to shop in the big spenders aisle, but they could at least try taking a stroll down the discount aisle instead heading straight to the landfill like they did for last years outfield.  stymeedone  9 hours ago Sure, they should be aiming higher, but we are talking the Royals here.  They have little depth to trade.  They are on a budget.  They can\u2019t aim very high with those restrictions.  Rsox  8 hours ago Change of scenery could reignite the spark in Garcia\u2019s bat. Even last season\u2019s Adolis Garcia is an upgrade over the Royals current Outfield mix  ASTROS27!  9 hours ago I would love that.  Bennie  9 hours ago What would you offer us for Adolis?  Let\u2019s see if we can make a deal.  brewsingblue82  8 hours ago I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get your hopes high for too much Bennie. Maybe a lottery ticket.  ASTROS27!  8 hours ago Kris Bubic for Adolis Garcia and 2 prospects?  Bennie  7 hours ago I doubt the Royals would go for that.  99Captain Judge99  10 hours ago Maybe the Yankees acquire no one?  Jesse Chavez enthusiast  10 hours ago I\u2019m not a Yankees fan, but in all my years of being a baseball fan, i don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an off-season where the Yankees sit completely still. I\u2019ve seen relatively underwhelming winters, but I don\u2019t think you should worry too much about the Yankees doing nothing.  ASTROS27!  9 hours ago That\u2019s a sign they don\u2019t want their 28th ring.  YankeesBleacherCreature  9 hours ago 99.9% done after Grish accepting the Q.O. Cashman will probably skip the Winter Meetings too. \/s  Salzilla  8 hours ago Nah come on now. I\u2019m annoyed that the Yankees extended the QO to Grisham because I don\u2019t think he can duplicate this past season, and it cuts into the spending, but at the same time I gotta think the Yankees had plans for both scenarios. And yes there will be trades, too, Cashman is profilic in that regard and better than signing FA tbh.  YellowCleats  9 hours ago Prices will be historical high for relievers due to many modern day starters not going deep enough into games. With increased velo and spin rates comes durability issues. Other than certain genetically gifted steel elbow and iron shoulder players most human elbow cannot carry that load on the elbow for long before needing reconstruction . Those teams that stock up on relievers will be wise as long as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not dumpster Diving  brewsingblue82  8 hours ago You have to remember though, modern day relievers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do as much as old time relievers either. Closers used to go more than just an inning. You look at Rollie fingers stats as a closer and he was throwing around 80\u00e2\u0080\u0093100 innings. Nowadays closers tend to be more around 60 innings.  Mikenmn  9 hours ago The Yankees have essentially 3\/4 of a bullpen just with possible non-tenders.  There are a lot of relievers out there, and pretty much every team can build a bullpen on the cheap.  I wonder how fast that market moves, and whether the Owners or the players have the upper hand. There\u2019s not a lot of scarcity.  ASTROS27!  9 hours ago They do have a high ceiling arm coming up. Elmer Rodriguez  Paleobros  1 hour ago I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big glue guy  Big whiffa  9 hours ago Braves are notorious for striking early in the offseason  Great move by the angels ! I like it for Baltimore too but when you can secure an asset like angels did, it was worth parting w ward  ASTROS27!  9 hours ago Ranking Braves Moves Yesterday 1. Sign Raisel 2. Trade for Dubon 3. Trade with Rox  RunDMC  8 hours ago I feel like an Iglesias signing may indicate more interest in a Keller or, more interesting, Luke Weaver, whom has closing and starting experience. He could be the best RH setup option and\/or move into a closer\u2019s role following Iglesias \u2013 similar to their offering Jeff Hoffman (who had the same qualities) last year, before a failed physical.  NashvilleJeff  8 hours ago @Run:  I like your Keller idea best. I was wrong yesterday when I said that I\u2019d taken Iggy and Williams to Atlanta in the 50 FA Contest. I actually took Iggy and Keller, not Williams. No matter the contest, I\u2019m not as high on Weaver due to his recent health troubles.  RunDMC  5 hours ago Don\u2019t forget about Mr. Alaska \u2013 Pete Fairbanks. Your favorite: no QO. Above average velo, closer experience.  NashvilleJeff  5 hours ago Yeah, like Fairbanks but I picked him to the Dodgers\u2026\u2026..  RunDMC  5 hours ago Goodness \u2014 he\u2019s had 2 TJs, so maybe LAD connection is real.  stymeedone  9 hours ago Look at the number of bullpen arms that are non tenders.  They are there because they didn\u2019t produce to their salary.  Absolutely a bullpen can be built on the cheap, but quality suffers.  Finding a diamond in the rough is still rare.   Even reliable middle relief is going up in price.  Teams used to hope for a complete game once a week, then once a month, now its one or two a half season.  Having more than one closer has become a smart choice.  Expect bullpens to become more of a priority as the supply of quality arms cannot fill the demand.  AC Surf Baseball 609  9 hours ago Why do the Phillies want to trade Alec Bohm when there is a lack of quality 3B around MLB? Bohm has a great approach at the plate, low K rate and dramatically improved his D at 3B. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s making less than $10M in his FA walk year, so he should be plenty motivated to produce. If Schwarber walks, Bohm could potentially slide to 1B if the Phillies wanted to get in on the Bregman market (Bryce becomes DH) or sign Pete Alonso to share 1B\/DH with Bryce and keep Bohm at 3B.  For the media\/radio personalities stating the Phillies are going to have to release Nick Castellanos or absorb his entire salary to facilitate a deal, look no further than the Angels\/Orioles trade. A bat first RH hitter (Ward) for a mid rotation SP (Rodriguez). So a team with a lefty heavy lineup, like the Red Sox \u2013 or a team devoid of talent like the White Sox \u2013 wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take Nick Castellanos (1\/$20M) for Jordan Hicks (2\/$25M) or Andrew Bientendi (3\/$45M). Long term salary cleared from the books is the motivation. ChiSox could acquire one of Nick\/Taijuan (1\/$18M) plus 2 or 3 top 20 organizational prospects \u2013 for Luis Robert (1\/$20M) and C Kyle Teel. Chicago probably wants to get out from beneath the uncertainty of the 2 player options ($20M in \u00e2\u0080\u009827 & \u00e2\u0080\u009828) Robert holds over them. Meanwhile he was 99th percentile of batters who faced pitches outside the strike zone. At 28 years old, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s young enough to produce with some protection around him, and moving him to RF potentially keeps him healthy. White Sox would hope Taijuan becomes a reliable innings eater and deadline trade chip, while adding some young\/inexpensive big leaguers or uppers minors prospects from the Phillies \u2013 ie Rafael Marchan, Johan Rojas, Gabriel Rincones Jr, Keaton Anthony, Felix Reyes, Robert Moore, Griff McGarry, Eiberson Castellano, Andrew Baker \u2013 older prospects that still maintain some value. Attach Nick or Taijuan with 3 or 4 of those guys, maybe you moved your worst contracts out the door while simultaneously filling a need in the BP or OF. The Phillies need to get themselves a Howie Roseman bc there are certainly ways and means to fix this club, they just fail to seek out these ways and means year after year.  YankeesBleacherCreature  9 hours ago Taylor Ward was worth 2.7 fWAR and Nick Castellanos was worth -0.8. That\u2019s a stark difference in value. No team is trading for the latter with a 90 wRC+ and terrible defense.  NashvilleJeff  8 hours ago Also the Robert and Teel for (one of) Castellanos\/Walker and \u201c2 or 3 top 20 organizational prospects\u201d \u201cidea\u201d he keeps floating makes no sense. Just because the salary comps doesn\u2019t mean the Sox would have any interest in basically trading Robert and Teel for 3 unnamed prospects of unknown quality. Why would they even consider trading Keel, the top piece in the Crochet deal? He\u2019s their starting catcher, had a good rookie year, and is under control through 2031.  norcalblue  8 hours ago bingo, YBC!  YankeesBleacherCreature  5 hours ago *2.7 bWAR  Canuckleball  9 hours ago @ AC Surf Baseball 609 Nick Castellanos and Taylor Ward are not remotely similar. Ward is a roughly league average defender in the outfield who provides about 10% above average offense for around $11 m. He produced 2.7 bWAR last season, after producing 2.3 bWAR the season prior. He\u2019s a solid but not spectacular player on a reasonable contract. Nick Castellanos is a well below average fielder who should probably have his ball glove confiscated. His bat was below average this last season while being barely above average the year prior. He hasn\u2019t had a season above 1.5 bWAR in the last 4 years. As you say, he\u2019s making $20 m this season. Even paying his contract down to league minimum might not be enough to get someone to bite.  Hammerin' Hank  8 hours ago Yeah, the Phillies would just love that Teel\/Roberts trade. Dream on.  Rsox  8 hours ago The difference between the Ward\/Rodriguez trade and what you are suggesting is each team got something they needed: the Orioles got an inexpensive power bat without having to negotiate against other teams and the Angels got a controllable starting pitcher. Trading Castellanos for Hicks, or worse Benintendi is trading dead money for dead money. If 29 other teams are aware that at some point the Phillies will just cut Castellanos they will just wait them out. Why trade for and have to absorb his salary when you could just sign him for the prorated league minimum when the Phillies release him  Old York  8 hours ago The hot stove has been really burning lately.  Rsox  8 hours ago I like. Better than in years past when we had to wait for the winter meetings for even minor league signings  dano62  8 hours ago Korey Lee to the Rays, Adolis to the K\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 moves that make too much sense. How about the Jays pull a shocker and trade Varsho to Mets for Sprout & Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  YankeesBleacherCreature  5 hours ago The Mets aren\u2019t doing that lopsided trade.

{"date":"2025-11-20","content":"ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Walmart\u2019s stock rallied as trading opened Thursday after the retailer reported robust quarterly revenues, beating out Wall Street\u2019s estimates as business was fueled by a surge in online shopping and rising popularity among high-income consumers.  Shares of Walmart rose more than 5.6% to above $106 shortly after trading opened Thursday, pacing what would be the stock\u2019s second-largest gain this year behind a 9.5% rally in April\u2014the stock is up more than 6% as of 10:40 a.m. EST.
