It's been a few weeks since Amazon announced plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, but many laid-off employees are still coming to terms with it. While the original announcement cited a need to be leaner in the age of AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said, \"It's about culture.\"  Business Insider spoke with six former Amazon employees who lost their jobs in the latest round of layoffs. One was an anonymous single parent who said they'd just moved to Seattle in June due to the company's return-to-office mandate \u2014 only to be laid off. Another, an anonymous former product manager, said he got wind of the layoff timing and set his alarm for 3 a.m. that day to check his email. The unexpected nature of the layoffs \u2014 and the tough job market \u2014 are among the factors making it harder for some workers to move on. Here is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. Iren Azra Zou: Software engineer, 27, based in New Jersey. Employed at Amazon for roughly one year. I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. When I tried to log in to my work account, I received authorization denied errors. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off. John Paul Martinez: Technical support engineer, 35, based in Orlando. Employed at Amazon for over three years. I received an email at 5 a.m. EST from HR advising that I'd been laid off. James Hwang: IT support engineer, 27, based in Michigan. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I got an automated text message from Amazon telling me to check my personal email before clocking in, and then I saw an email from HR. I was home at the time. Joanelle Cobos: Design manager, 37, based in Las Vegas. Employed at Amazon for roughly four years. I was at home getting ready to head to the office, and I happened to notice two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. Since I didn't trust the texts, I went to my work laptop and signed in, only to be met with a message saying that my account had been disabled. At this point, I was already guessing that my position had been eliminated. Zou: There were rumors the day before that something big was coming. I had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be one of them, even though I was performing well \u2014 I had met my goals earlier than expected. This wasn't the first time budget cuts had affected me in my career, and I know how, in these situations, people can become numbers on a spreadsheet. So I was surprised \u2014 but also not surprised. Martinez: Extremely surprised, since we were not given any indication of this massive layoff, and we are heading into the holidays. Hwang: Very surprised. I was a high performer who did a lot for our organization, and IT employees had been safe in the last couple of rounds of layoffs. There's a lot of work to do, and we were already low on team members Cobos: Not terribly. I was hired in December 2021, and my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and RIFs, basically once a year. This is also my third layoff since 2019 and my fourth in my career, so I plan my life around the very real possibility of being laid off. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.\u00a0If you have a story to share, contact this reporter via email at\u00a0jzinkula@businessinsider.com, via Signal at jzinkula.29, or fill out\u00a0this quick form.\u00a0 Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device;\u00a0here's our\u00a0guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Zou: My husband was next to me in bed and awake, so he was the first person I told. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers as we tried to figure out who else had been affected. When I learned that some literal rock stars on my team also got laid off, I was shocked. Martinez: I reached out to my colleague, who worked with me in the same capacity at Amazon, to see if she had also received the email or if this was a joke or a complete misunderstanding. Hwang: My wife and my parents. Cobos: My mother, sisters, and I have a group chat. I sent them a message once I had confirmed everything and read through my announcement letter. They were surprised. Zou: I made it a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, my sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic. I think I built some Legos, talked to friends and coworkers, and read a book. I just gave myself space to process. Martinez: I broke down crying, not understanding what had occurred that morning. I started to think about all the expenses \u2014 mortgage, car payment, credit cards, and my father's medical bills. Hwang: I just processed what happened and looked over my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Cobos: I spent that evening at home enjoying myself. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me, even with the need to find new employment, is exciting. Zou: I'm already looking for new opportunities. I'm not rushing, though \u2014 I want to find a good fit. I'm leaning toward a smaller company where there's less bureaucracy and more space to contribute and see the impact of my work. Martinez: I have been actively searching for employment. However, due to the massive layoffs at Amazon and other corporations, I am extremely fearful of the competition. Hwang: I have been looking for a new role in cloud support or it system engineering. Cobos: I'm looking into starting my own small business that can potentially provide income while I'm unemployed and additional income once I find new full time employment. I'm not in a rush to jump into another corporate job, even though that's where the best income is. Ideally, I'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business. Zou: You can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\" But eventually you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table. A layoff doesn't erase that, and I'm not going to let it make me question my value. Now, I see the layoff as a turning point. It helped me clarify what I want in my next role: more ownership, clearer growth, and a healthier environment. It's still a difficult experience, but I'm feeling more grounded and optimistic as time goes on. Martinez: My feelings have not changed. I think Amazon has done a poor job of communicating with everyone regarding our benefits, stock options, severance package, and job placement assistance. Hwang: It's been a shock. The current job market has been crazy hard. I already applied to 100 jobs and haven't gotten any interviews yet, so I'm concerned, but I have to keep going. Cobos: My feelings on the layoff haven't changed. I'm not a fan of how it was handled, but I'm honestly excited for the time and opportunity to reexamine what I want to do and explore my options. This layoff has forced me to take time to reflect. Jump to","label":0}

Samsung's next folding phone, which unfolds twice to reveal a 10-inch main screen, is far from a concept at this point. The company already teased the phone, known as the Galaxy Z TriFold, at a recent event in South Korea. While the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to have a very limited release outside of the brand's home market, it's slated to come to the U.S. Samsung seems to be making the necessary preparations to bring the Galaxy Z TriFold stateside, like firmware testing for U.S. models. SamMobile reports Samsung is currently testing firmware for another Galaxy Z TriFold model. Previously, it uncovered firmware testing for the carrier-locked variant of the Galaxy Z TriFold, which has a SM-F968U model number. Now, the site reveals a new Galaxy Z TriFold model, SM-F968U1, is undergoing firmware testing as well. This is the unlocked Galaxy Z TriFold version that will be sold directly from Samsung and its retail partners. It all but confirms Samsung plans to sell the Galaxy Z TriFold in the U.S. both through retail channels and cellular carriers.  pic.twitter.com\/MLRXg3a74UOctober 28, 2025 The report notes that it's a bit late in the expected release cycle for Samsung to begin testing firmware for a new phone model. Rumors point to the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold launching before the end of this year. The exact date floating around is Dec. 5, which is less than a month away. Despite the late testing, this is a sign the Galaxy Z TriFold is indeed nearing a U.S. release.      A recent leak pulled the curtain on the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, confirming that will be the public name for the device (even though it only actually folds twice). It'll allegedly sport a 6.5-inch outer screen and a 10-inch main screen, with the cover display featuring a 2,600-nit peak brightness rating. The chip on the inside is expected to be either the last-gen Snapdragon 8 Elite or the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. If the rumored Dec. 5 launch date turns out to be correct, we won't have to wait much longer for official Galaxy Z TriFold pricing and specification details.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Written & Edited byOihyun Kim Bitcoin briefly dropped to $93,000 early Monday in Asia before rebounding, sparking $510 million in 24-hour liquidations and wiping out all year-to-date gains for 2025. The sharp move drove the Fear and Greed Index to 10, signaling extreme fear among traders. Market analysts are watching key support zones to assess whether Bitcoin can recover or faces more downside in the coming days. Bitcoin\u2019s recent correction erased nearly 24% from its early October high of $126,000. The dip at $93,000 marked a notable psychological and technical breakdown, officially nullifying all year-to-date returns for 2025.  Weekend price trends shifted markedly. For the first time in several weeks, Bitcoin declined over the weekend instead of rising, creating what market analyst KillaXBT called a bearish setup heading into Monday. Using 300 days of historical data, this pattern suggests about a 36% probability that Monday will establish a near-term low. $BTCFor the first time in weeks, BTC didn\u2019t pump over the weekend, it actually moved lower. Instead of setting up the usual bullish narrative heading into Monday, this created a bearish one.Based on the last 300 days of price action, there\u2019s roughly a 36% chance that Monday\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/NGkkqLHtYo pic.twitter.com\/3lyd1sRxdI Market sentiment plunged alongside the price. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped to 10, down two points from the previous reading and registering extreme fear. This is a marked reversal from late November 2024, when the index hit a high of 93 amid market euphoria. The price collapse led to a cascade of liquidations across crypto derivatives markets. In 24 hours, exchanges liquidated over 150,000 traders, resulting in closures totaling over $510 million. Long positions suffered the most damage, losing $40.37 million in a single hour and $77 million over four hours. Bitcoin accounted for $41.61 million in long liquidations, followed by Ethereum at $13.99 million. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, also saw multi-million-dollar liquidations as prices followed Bitcoin lower. Market analyst KillaXBT has pointed out several crucial support zones for Bitcoin\u2019s near-term direction. Immediate focus is on $94,100, with more substantial support anticipated at $93,500\u2014the year\u2019s opening price\u2014and the $89,000-$91,000 range. These areas have traditionally attracted high trading activity and open interest, making them key buy zones based on technical analysis. However, the analyst warned against using high leverage now due to ongoing volatility and liquidation risks. With recent price swings of 4-5%, overleveraged positions face elevated risk. \ud83d\udea8NEW: Bitcoin has officially erased all year-to-date gains for the entirety of 2025. pic.twitter.com\/auOwXIHXMd If Bitcoin falls decisively below $85,000, bullish recovery scenarios would be invalidated, signaling a trend reversal. If liquidity is absorbed at lower supports, a move to reclaim the $100,000 mark is possible, though resistance at $98,300 must be overcome first. The current structure points to heightened uncertainty. With sentiment at extreme fear and major liquidations already occurring, the market sits at a critical point. Whether buyers emerge at support or sellers push the price lower will shape Bitcoin\u2019s path through November and year-end trading.

Not long after sharing his predictions for cars that he thinks will rise in value, Doug DeMuro is back \u2014 this time he put out a YouTube video with a list of cars that he believes won\u2019t see the same appreciation. As a well-known car YouTuber and writer, he\u2019s confident that time will prove him right and that his list of seven cars will not go up in value as people may have anticipated. Check Out: Auto Experts Say Stop Buying These 4 Hybrid Cars Immediately Trending Now: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster Let\u2019s see below which cars he thinks are a disappointing investment. 2025 starting price: $70,195 He caveated this first one by saying most Chevy Corvettes, since some are going up in value, but most are not. Although Chevy Corvettes are commonly purchased as third cars and kept in excellent condition, he argues, their value won\u2019t increase mainly because the production numbers are too high and the market is oversaturated. For You: I Asked a Mechanic How To Make My Car Last 300,000 Miles: Here\u2019s What He Said 2017 starting price: $92,990 DeMuro said the Dodge Viper is criminally undervalued. Even though prices are, in fact, going up, they are taking too long to dramatically increase. The price rise is not outpacing the stock market and it\u2019s not at the level of increase people want when they own a car for investment. He said he doesn\u2019t see the market realizing the notoriety he believes they deserve. 2023 average price: $1,700,000 When people bought the new Ford GT in 2017, they expected the price to rise. However, they did not end up seeing the returns they hoped for. The market for the new Ford GT has significantly cooled down, mainly because the market is flooded with them. Ford also has not done enough to support them in terms of parts and servicing. He also claimed that people generally prefer the older models to the newer ones. 2009 average price: $500,750 The SLR McLaren has depreciated in value and has yet to recover. The market is not a fan of this car. Many people are hesitant to buy them because of rumors about how expensive they are to own, with high costs for repairs and servicing. \u00a0According to DeMuro, the market doesn\u2019t believe they are special enough for the price to appreciate. Price: varies by model The next one is more of a category than any one car. DeMuro said the special model McLarens like Speedtails, 675LTs and Sabres are not going up in value. He thinks the main problem with these cars is that McLaren produced too many special editions, so the market doesn\u2019t actually view them as special. 2002 average price: $228,000 (per Hagerty) The R34 Skyline GTR has experienced a significant price drop in the past year. There are too many available in the market and the people who wanted one have already bought one. He thinks anyone trying to sell one of these cars bought something they thought was more valuable than it is. 1995 average price: $56,093 (per Kelley Blue Book) The last car on the list is the Porsche 928 (excluding the GTS). DeMuro listed a few reasons why these Porsches won\u2019t appreciate in value, including that people do not like the way these cars look, many were not well-maintained and they are not considered exciting.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Toyota has long been synonymous with resale value, but one of its newest models breaks sharply from that reputation. Despite wearing one of the most trusted badges in the industry, this vehicle sheds more than 80% of its original price within just five years, an eye-opening contrast to the brand\u2019s usual strong performers. For shoppers who assume every Toyota is a safe financial bet, this outlier proves that name recognition isn\u2019t everything. The steep depreciation isn\u2019t tied to quality issues but rather shifting market demand, segment-specific weaknesses, and a pricing strategy that didn\u2019t age well. In a landscape where buyers increasingly weigh long-term ownership costs, this model simply hasn\u2019t kept up. For anyone considering a Toyota purely for its historically ironclad resale value, this serves as a reminder that even reliable brands have misfires. Understanding why this particular model collapses in value helps buyers choose more wisely, and avoid falling into the trap of assuming every Toyota is a guaranteed investment. In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including the Kelley Blue Books, CarEdge, J.D. Power, RepairPal, and the EPA. Launched back in 2015, the Toyota Mirai is a bit of a niche car. Interestingly, it is one of only a few vehicles in the United States that use hydrogen as a fuel. It uses an on-board fuel cell, converting the hydrogen into electricity, meaning it is also an EV. Unfortunately, it exists in such a niche that its value quickly takes a nose dive, with owners selling their cars for a tiny fraction of what they paid for them. Years of ownership Value lost 1 72% 3 77% 5 84% 7 86% 10 90% Cars generally depreciate the most in their first year on the road, with their value taking a huge dip the second you take it off the lot. The Mirai takes this to the absolute extreme. The fact that it loses 70 percent of its value in its first year on the road showcases just how undesirable these sedans are on the used market. There is no other new car out there currently that loses its value as quickly or as harshly as the Mirai does. This is particularly crazy because of the badge that it wears. Toyota is currently the best brand that you can buy if you care about resale value. On average, a Toyota will only lose about 35 percent of its value in its first five years. Despite its badge, Toyota's hydrogen-powered EV is a massive outlier. The hydrogen fuel cell sedan has a starting MSRP of $51,795, and it only comes in one trim level. This means that if you owned a Mirai for five years and then decided to sell it, you would get a measly $8,075. This is supported by listings on sites like Edmunds, where the Mirai has an average used price of $10,611. There are a number of reasons that the Mirai performs so poorly on the used market. Because of its unique nature, Toyota only currently sells the Mirai in California. This means that there are a limited number of models, the market that you're selling to is limited, and the support for the car after you buy it is limited. The other side of the story comes down to infrastructure. While the technology behind the Mirai is interesting and hydrogen is an incredibly green renewable resource, the infrastructure to support these cars is just not where it needs to be yet. California has one of the best hydrogen refueling networks in the entire country, and even within the state it is hard to get a hold of. One day, this may change and hydrogen might become much more widely available, but until then, nobody wants to buy a second-hand car that they can never refuel. The fact that the Mirai runs off of hydrogen definitely has its downsides, as highlighted above. There is a very limited network of places where you can refuel the sedan, meaning if you don't live near a refueling station, there isn't a point in buying this EV. However, if can get your hands on hydrogen fuel, then you might be wondering how well it works in the Mirai. The answer to that is that it's a mixed bag. Powertrain Single electric motor Horsepower 182 HP Torque 221 LB-FT Driveline RWD 0-60 MPH 9.1 seconds Top Speed 106 MPH If you look beyond the hydrogen fuel, the Mirai is very much like a traditional electric vehicle. It comes with a single electric motor which powers the rear wheels. Unfortunately, power is pretty measly here, and the Toyota doesn't offer the acceleration that we often associate with electric cars. It takes a disappointingly long time to get up to highway speeds. Previously, the Mirai's electric motor powered the front wheels, but after its update for the 2021 model year, it is now rear-wheel drive. The chassis was also updated. The result of these changes is a car that actually handles pretty well and feels pretty enjoyable to drive. It delivers a surprising amount of agility, all while delivering a ride quality that is on par with luxury vehicles. Model City Highway Combined Range Toyota Mirai 76 MPGe 71 MPGe 74 MPGe 402 Miles The EPA tested the 2025 Mirai, and found it to be relatively efficient, on par with some premium luxury EVs. The tanks hold enough hydrogen to get you over 400 miles without you having to fill up again. This is one of the many benefits of hydrogen vehicles, alongside the fact that it takes seconds to refill the fuel cells, compared to the relatively long time it takes to charge an EV. Hydrogen is not a cheap fuel source right now, and it is constantly fluctuating. This is another reason that people avoid buying a used Mirai. Currently, it costs well over $30 per kilogram for hydrogen. This would mean that it would cost anywhere from $168 to $200, at the time of writing, to completely fill up the cells in the Toyota. The Japanese brand is aware that this is an issue, though, and they provide new owners with a $15,000 fuel credit that lasts for six years. Toyota clearly intended for the Mirai to compete with luxurious electric sedans, rather than the other mainstream automakers that the Japanese brand usually does battle with. To this end, it comes really well-equipped when it comes to technology and comfort features, so much so that it rivals a lot of the models that Lexus currently puts out. However, to match its niche approach as a hydrogen-powered EV, Toyota has imbued it with some really odd styling choices. Climb inside the cabin, and you'll quickly notice that Toyota has essentially taken the interior of a Lexus ES and tweaked it. Everything from the dashboard to the center console has a familiarity about it. Plenty of high-end materials have been used throughout the cabin, which helps give it an upscale feel. However, odd quirks like the interior color schemes and the position of the gear selector are a little off-putting. Toyota has loaded the Mirai with plenty of high-end tech features, including a crisp and responsive 12.3-inch infotainment screen. It, of course, comes standard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as in-dash navigation and a Wi-Fi hotspot. Audiophiles will also be pleased with the fact that the standard sound system here is a 14-speaker Bose stereo. We want to hear from you!

Penney store, Friday, Nov. 24, 2017, in Seattle.                                                           Elaine Thompson\/AP                                       hide caption  According to the American Christmas Tree Association, 83% of households who plan on displaying a Christmas tree in 2025 will choose an artificial one. But this year, not even holiday cheer is safe from economic tensions, as tariffs and supply chain pressures are pushing prices up. Mac Harman, founder and CEO of Balsam Hill, an artificial Christmas tree company, explains the increase will be noticeable. \"Whatever price point you might have been looking at last year, expect that to be about 10% to 15% more this year,\" he says. Nearly all artificial Christmas trees are imported from China. While Harman says that manufacturing costs remain steady, the price vendors pay to U.S. customs has increased, as a result of President Trump's ongoing tariffs on China. Trump often says his tariffs are intended to incentivize manufacturing on American soil. However, manufacturing domestically wouldn't be a simple switch for Harman and his team. \"The interesting thing about pre-lit artificial Christmas trees is they've never been made in the U.S.,\" Harman explains. Harman says it's a tedious process to attach the lights by hand like his company does \u2013 involving zip ties and painstaking attention to detail to ensure each bulb is perfectly placed \u2013 a task American workers rejected 30 years ago when prelit trees first hit the market. \"It's very unlikely that something almost like basket weaving is a trade that's going to move from a lower wage, lower cost of living country to the United States for the first time,\" Harman says.                  In this photo, Balsam Brands founder and CEO Mac Harman poses with artificial Christmas trees at the Balsam Hill Outlet store in Burlingame, Calif.                                                           Eric Risberg\/AP                                       hide caption  Other companies in the Christmas industry are facing the effects of tariffs too. Harman says many of his company's U.S. based suppliers, who purchase their component parts overseas, are also seeing higher costs too. \"The prices have gone up no matter if we make something here or if we make it in other places,\" he says. Harman has tried multiple strategies to keep Balsam Hill's prices competitive. Internally, he's made reductions to his workforce, paused hiring, and frozen raises. He's also diversified his supply chain, manufacturing trees in Mexico, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. Last year, when President Trump won the election, Harman pre-ordered his supply for Christmas 2025, almost a year in advance. \"We shipped as many products as we could between November and January 20th, Inauguration Day, because there was a lot of discussion that there was going to be a day one tariff,\" Harman says. Each time the administration lowered tariff rates this year, Harman restocked his supply \u2013 an option he fears may not be available to him next holiday season. For shoppers, his advice is simple: don't procrastinate. Because of the price increases, some retailers ordered less stock, raising the risk of mid-December shortages. \"Look for a tree that you love, and if it's on some kind of sale, buy it,\" Harman says. In past festive seasons, shoppers might have delayed in the hope of getting a bargain, but that might not be such a good idea this time around. \"Seeing if you might get 10% off if you wait two weeks, I don't think that's going to work as well this year as it might in a normal year,\" Harman says.

For years now, Samsung has dominated the foldable phone market with its Galaxy Z Fold line, and the Galaxy Z Fold7 brings forth the sixth generation of this revolutionary smartphone. The great news today is that Amazon currently offers this 512GB variant for $1,680, down from $2,119. Samsung can\u2019t offer that on their website which make it a legitimate all-time low. See at Amazon The Galaxy Z Fold7 boasts dual screens that seamlessly work together to redefine how you use a smartphone. The 6.3-inch cover screen smoothly handles your quick tasks and one-handed operations, while unfolding it reveals a massive 7.6-inch main display, reminiscent of tablet territory. This inner screen incorporates Samsung\u2019s Ultra Thin Glass technology, which feels remarkably different from the plastic screens of folding phones past. A 120Hz refresh rate on both displays ensures smooth scrolling-be it flipping through emails on the cover screen or multitasking on the main display. The hinge mechanism has been refined through six generations of engineering and it\u2019s great: Samsung reduced the crease visibility significantly compared to previous models, though you\u2019ll still feel it slightly when running your finger across the center. The JetBlack finish resists fingerprints better than glossy alternatives, and the Armor Aluminum frame adds durability without excessive weight. Samsung rates this phone for 200,000 folds\u00c2\u00a0which translates to roughly five years of opening and closing the device 100 times daily. The brightness goes up to 2,600 nits peak, and outdoors, it\u2019s perfectly visible even in direct sunlight. You will be very comfortable reading the screen at the beach or navigating maps while walking around town. Samsung\u2019s adaptive color technology adjusts the display to match the ambient lighting, thus reducing eye strain during long uses. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite processor powers the Z Fold7 and dlivers desktop-class performance in a foldable form factor. This chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, gaming, and AI processing without breaking a sweat. The 512GB storage option gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and 4K videos without constantly managing space. Samsung pairs this with 12GB of RAM, ensuring smooth app switching even when running multiple resource-intensive applications. The battery \u2013 4,600mAh \u2013 may sound modest on paper but Samsung\u2019s optimization makes it last over a full day with moderate usage. The heavy users who push both screens hard might need a top-up by evening, but typical usage patterns easily stretch from morning to bedtime. Fast charging at 25W will get you to 50% in about 30 minutes, though Samsung doesn\u2019t include a charger in the box. The new triple camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor that captures stunning details in most lighting conditions. Samsung\u2019s AI processing enhances the photos automatically to adjust colors and sharpness, depending on the scene. Further, the 12MP ultra-wide camera shoots group shots and landscape photography, while the 10MP telephoto lens offers 3x optical zoom for distant subjects. A secondary 10MP telephoto camera includes 2x optical zoom to give you more flexibility in framing without compromising on image quality. Android 15 runs underneath Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 with the interface optimized for foldable displays. When you unfold the phone, it intelligently expands apps to take advantage of the screen real estate. A taskbar along the bottom of the main display lets you quickly switch between your most-used apps and recent tasks. You can drag and drop content between apps, copy text from one application and paste into another, and resize app windows to fit your workflow. Samsung promises four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches. Make sure you don\u2019t miss that early Black Friday deal as it could run out of stock quickly.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":" Decades after giving Steve Jobs his iconic turtleneck, Japanese fashion behemoth Issey Miyake returned to Apple with a product that somewhat felt absurd at first. The iPhone Pocket is an oddly specific handbag for just your phones (and maybe some other bits and bobs), but here\u2019s a reality check the folks at Apple probably didn\u2019t get. Your phone doesn\u2019t need a dedicated solo-bag. It fits in most pockets, and when it doesn\u2019t, people carry handbags or purses. If there\u2019s a single Apple product that DOES need its own \u2018holster\u2019, it\u2019s probably the Vision Pro Battery Pack. This concept from Nathani\u00ebl de Jong cleverly gives that power bank a dedicated holster to make spatial computing more convenient without the added bulk. Almost everyone who\u2019s reviewed the Vision Pro has railed against that silly little appendage that simply hangs off the already heavy Vision Pro. Apple just assumed you\u2019d end up putting it in your pocket\u2026 but somehow it decided to make a dedicated holder for its phones, but not for this?! Designer: Nathani\u00ebl de Jong       The beauty of this entire arrangement is that nothing needs to change. Apple just needs to ALSO market the iPhone Pocket as a perfect holder for the Vision Pro\u2019s Battery Pack. It\u2019s roughly the same size as a small phone, probably weighs a bit thanks to its thick metal design, and gives the Vision Pro a slightly fashionable touch\u2026 with the 3D woven iPhone Pocket matching the 3D weave on the Vision Pro\u2019s headbands. It\u2019s synergy just waiting to happen, and I love that someone decided to cobble up some renders and put them out there just to show us all that there\u2019s a great alternative use for this fairly expensive fabric accessory. The iPhone Pocket is limited to just 10 stores worldwide, and will only be sold in limited stock. Is that a deal-breaker? Probably not, because most Vision Pro users probably live in one of these 10 fancy cities (New York, Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.). The limited stock isn\u2019t a problem either, because the Vision Pro\u2019s fairly limited in its consumer reach too\u2026 and I don\u2019t mean that as a diss. I just think these two are a match made in heaven!

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"A sports car usually isn\u2019t the place you look for long-term value, yet one Japanese performance model is defying that rule entirely. While the average enthusiast coupe tends to lose value quickly, this one is holding onto its price so well that it actually depreciates less than a Toyota Corolla, a benchmark economy car famous for rock-solid resale. For buyers who want thrills without financial fallout, it\u2019s a rare combination. Its surprising value retention comes down to more than brand loyalty. Limited supply, strong enthusiast demand, and a reputation for reliability have kept used prices buoyant, even as the broader sports-car segment faces volatility. Shoppers who assumed a fun car meant fast depreciation may want to take another look. For drivers torn between excitement and practicality, this model offers both. It proves you don\u2019t need to sacrifice long-term value to get genuine performance, and in today\u2019s market, that\u2019s becoming increasingly uncommon. In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including the J.D. Power, RepairPal, Consumer Reports, Cars.com, and the EPA. Depreciation rates were sourced from CarEdge.  The Supra is perhaps one of the most iconic nameplates in the automotive world, especially since JDM culture boomed a couple of years ago. That's why when Toyota brought it back in 2019, we were all thrilled. While some have criticized its obvious ties to BMW, we still think it is easily one of the best sports cars on the road. If you haven't convinced yourself to take one home yet, perhaps the fact that it holds value better than a Toyota Corolla will convince you.  Years of ownership Residual value 1 98% 3 81% 5 77% 7 73% According to CarEdge, the GR Supra holds its value better than just about any other sports car on the market. Usually, when you drive off the lot, your car instantly drops a ton of value, but the Supra has been consistently desirable since its launch. Even more impressive, is that its rate of depreciation is even marginally better than a Toyota Corolla sedan, which retains 76 percent of its value after five years on average. The BMW Z4, on which the GR Supra is based, depreciates more aggressively, losing 40 percent of its value in five years.  After five years on the market, there are plenty of GR Supras that still go for an impressively high amount on used sites, as we'll go into in the next section. On average, it will have only lost around 23 percent of its value. That means that it doesn't just outperform other sports cars in terms of its resale value, but it outperforms most other cars. According to CarEdge's data, it is the fifth-best car out there in terms of resale value after five years.  The automotive market is constantly shifting and moving at a faster pace than ever before. This is why it is disappointing, but not entirely surprising, that the GR Supra is being discontinued after only six years on the market. The 2026 model year marks the end of the current Supra's run, meaning that if you're a fan of the current generation of the sports car, you should go grab one while you can, especially knowing you can get a lot of your money back a couple years down the road.  Being the last year that the current GR Supra will be around, Toyota is selling a special MkV Final Edition model. This is a range-topping trim that comes with a host of unique features to differentiate it from the rest of the lineup. In terms of performance, it gets a unique map for the differential, larger brakes, a stiffer suspension, and a unique tune for the dampers.  As well as some mechanical upgrades, the GR Supra MkV Final Edition model gets some unique aesthetic bits to help it stand out. It comes fitted with a carbon fiber ducktail rear spoiler, which matches the carbon fiber mirror caps. It also comes with unique matte black 19-inch wheels. On the inside, you get red seatbelts and trim stitching as well as the 'GR' logo embroidered into the headrests. Model Starting MSRP 3.0 $57,500 3.0 Premium $60,650 3.0 MkV Final Edition $68,550 Toyota originally launched the GR Supra with both a two-liter turbocharged inline-four and a turbocharged inline-six, with the former being the more affordable option. However, Toyota axed the four-cylinder engine, with the inline-six now being your only choice. While it isn't exactly cheap, the GR Supra delivers one of the best driving experience out there, competing with the likes of the Lotus Emira and the Porsche Cayman despite costing thousands of dollars less.  The MkV Final Edition is pretty impressive, and it'll likely hold its value a little better than the other models because of its special edition status. However, if you're looking for the best bang-for-your-buck, the 3.0 Premium is definitely the way to go. Despite a fairly small jump in price from the base model, it comes with quite a bit of desirable kit, including full leather upholstery, a premium sound system, and a heads-up display.  The warranty package that Toyota offers on a new GR Supra is standard. Both the bumper-to-bumper and powertrain coverage are about average for the segment. Although it shares most of its mechanical bits with the BMW Z4, Toyota offers a powertrain warranty that is a year longer, while BMW offers bumper-to-bumper coverage that is a year longer. Toyota does sweeten the deal with two years of maintenance on the house, though.  CarEdge makes estimates on the long term maintenance costs of a GR Supra, and they're surprisingly low given the sports car's ties to a BMW. They estimate that you'll spend around $5,289 on maintenance over ten years. That is $2,030 less than you would spend maintaining the average coupe.  As we mentioned earlier, there are a lot of critics of the GR Supra because, under the skin, it is near identical to the BMW Z4. However, we try to look past badges, and if you do, you'll find that the Supra is a confident sports car that delivers fantastic levels of performance, a premium feel, and enough fun to permanently plaster a smile to your face.  Engine 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six Transmission 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic Horsepower 382 HP Torque 368 LB-FT Driveline RWD 0-60 MPH 3.9 Seconds Top Speed 161 MPH Under the hood of every new Supra is a turbocharged inline-six. As we mentioned before, the old turbocharged inline-four was cut a couple of years ago. This six-cylinder is BMW's fantastic B58, which not only finds a home in the Z4 M40i, but also powers other fantastic cars in their lineup, like the M340i and the M440i. Rear-wheel drive is the only setup here. Toyota offers you a choice between a six-speed manual and an eight-speed automatic, though we think going with the former is a no-brainer. The automatic may be the quicker option, but there is no arguing against the driver engagement that rowing your own gears provides.  The GR Supra offers fantastic levels of performance. It might not be as sharp as the likes of the Porsche Cayman, but it comes impressively close. Its steering is direct and offers fantastic levels of feedback, which makes it a joy through twisty sections of road. It features a stiffer suspension setup than you'd find on the BMW Z4, but it is still forgiving enough for you to daily drive it. We want to hear from you!

Toys R Us is back \u2014 well, sort of. Children of the '90s and early 2000s are likely familiar with the chain's backward R and giraffe mascot. Like many retailers, however, Toys R Us struggled to navigate the world of e-commerce, and eventually closed all of its US locations in 2018 after filing for bankruptcy protection. But, while the Toys R Us stores of the past may be gone, the brand has gotten a revival under new management. Some in the retail world refer to such stores as \"zombie brands.\" That's because WHP, a brand management company, holds a controlling stake in Toys R Us' parent, and it has been using the chain's name and other intellectual property, such as Geoffrey the Giraffe, in its new stores. Those include a flagship location in the American Dream mall in New Jersey as well as stores-within-stores in some Macy's department stores. WHP and Go! Retail Group, the company that operates the store, did not respond to a request for comment. The latest additions include eight new flagship stores and 20 seasonal locations that are opening for the holiday shopping season, the company said last month.  I wanted to see what it's like to shop at one of these new Toys R Us stores. Here's what I found. I visited this Toys R Us store on a Wednesday afternoon. It's located about a 50-minute drive from central Washington, DC. This store isn't a year-round fixture. It opened a few weeks before I visited with the goal of serving customers \"during the busiest shopping months of the year,\" Go! Retail Group, the company that operates the store, says on its website. This display was the first thing I saw as I walked into the Toys R Us store. With the chain's trademark giraffe and slogans like \"I don't wanna grow up,\" it was clear that the operators were trying to make the most of the Toy R Us brand. There was a wide selection of calendars at the Toys R Us location I visited. It's not what I expected to see at Toys R Us, but it makes sense: Besides operating these seasonal stores, Go! Retail also has multiple calendar brands in its portfolio. In fairness, if you were looking for a 2026 calendar, this was a good selection. Toys R Us had calendars with themes from the Green Bay Packers to Taylor Swift. After browsing through dozens of calendars, I headed to the rest of the store, where I found a wide range of toys. I could imagine Toys R Us selling lots of these Bluey dolls, given how popular that show is with young kids. Hulk Hogan, who died in July at the age of 71, probably isn't a well-known figure among the Gen Alpha kids whom I imagine Toys R Us is targeting. But I could see this figurine bringing back memories for people who grew up in the '80s and '90s, when Hogan was at the peak of his wrestling career. This particular Toys R Us seemed to be a fraction of the space of the stores that I remember from 20 years ago. That said, the selection is impressive. Besides all the branded action figures, there were also dominoes, board games, and pretend food sets, such as this pizza. This toy metal detector was selling for $84.99 \u2014 almost as much as some entry-level professional models from other brands cost. It was one example of a theme I observed while walking around the store: almost everything seemed as costly or slightly more expensive than comparable items at other stores, such as Target and Walmart. And, if you count more discount-oriented chains, such as Five Below, Toys R Us seemed especially pricey. Given that many shoppers are trying to save money this holiday season, I wondered what exactly Toys R Us' strategy is. For 20- and 30-somethings, the Toys R Us name means something. It's that store that you used to beg your parents to take you to \u2014 and that used to command roughly a quarter of the toy market. But after its bankruptcy, Toys R Us is clearly a much smaller company. And symbols of the brand, such as these Geoffrey the Giraffe toys, don't mean as much to Gen Z or Gen Alpha as they do to millennials. Toys R Us lost market share as it tried to compete with big-box stores and online-only retailers. As I left this revival store, I didn't see anything that gave me a reason to return \u2014 or anything that might give Toys R Us a shot at clawing back some of the toy market share. If I need a fun calendar for next year, though, I know where to go. Do you work in retail and have a story idea to share? Contact this reporter at abitter@businessinsider.com. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-16","content":" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The MSI Raider A18 HX is home to the two most powerful mobile components you can buy today, the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D and the RTX 5090. However, that power comes at the cost of battery life and portability. I recommend sticking with an RTX 5080 model rather than wasting your money on the 5090 upgrade, but the Ryzen CPU and the mini-LED display are tops. Exceptional performance from CPU and GPU Generous port selection with USB4, 2.5GbE, UHS-III SD reader (ideal for gamers and pros) Gorgeous and fast 4K mini-LED display Strong cooling potential and lots of venting Camera shutter and fingerprint reader add privacy and security Dismal battery life Camera is just OK Touchpad clicks feels a bit soft Gets loud under load  Why you can trust Windows Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  MSI's Raider A18 HX joins a fairly exclusive club of 18-inch powerhouse gaming laptops, competing directly with the likes of the Razer Blade 18 and ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 18, two laptops we also reviewed this year at Windows Central. Equipped with up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 Laptop GPU and an AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D CPU, MSI's Raider hits the upper limits of power available in a gaming laptop. It's not all about power, though, as MSI has included quite a few premium features to keep you happy while you game or work. Is this the right 18-inch laptop for you? Let's find out. I'm a lifelong PC gamer who has nearly 10 years of professional experience testing and reviewing PC hardware and gaming laptops. If it's worth your money, I'll let you know why. MSI's Raider A18 HX is not an affordable laptop, but that's expected for a device with so much power. The most affordable price I found while reviewing the PC is $2,799 at B&H (after a $500 discount) for a model with an AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX3D CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 2TB SSD, NVIDIA RTX 5080 Laptop GPU, and a UHD+ mini-LED display at 120Hz. You can also find the same configuration available at Amazon for $3,399, at Newegg for $3,299, or at Walmart for $3,799. Models with an RTX 5090 are not recommended due to price and meager performance gains over the RTX 5080. The exception is users who plan to use the Raider A18 HX for creative or AI work, in which case a 5090 might be necessary. \ud83d\udc49 NVIDIA's most expensive laptops are a terrible value \u2014 Here's what you should buy instead This review was made possible thanks to a loaned review unit provided by MSI. The company did not see the contents of this review before publishing. As with any 18-inch gaming laptop designed to accommodate the latest and greatest mobile performance hardware, there's a decent amount of bulk involved. Models with all the best internals weigh in at about 7.94 pounds (3.6kg) with about 1.26 inches (32mm) of thickness. A lot of the chassis is plastic, although MSI uses aluminum for some of the larger panels to add strength. The PC feels sturdy and doesn't have much bend. The back edge has stylized red and black vent covers, with some space at the center for 2.5Gb Ethernet, HDMI 2.1, and a proprietary charging port. This positioning helps improve cable management. The plastic venting extends to the sides to cover additional exhausting. On the left, you'll find dual USB-A 3.2 (Gen 2) and a UHS-III SD card reader. On the right are dual USB4 ports, a third USB-A 3.2 (Gen 2), and a 3.5mm audio jack. It's a decent mix of modern and legacy ports, even if it doesn't officially support Intel's branded Thunderbolt tech (as some of MSI's product notes suggest). Wireless is also as modern as can be, with Wi-Fi 7 support and Bluetooth 5.4. The gem-cut front corners and display bezels add some distinct flair to the PC, and a customizable LED light bar along the front edge is a nice addition that users can choose to disable in more professional settings. The gem-cut front corners and display bezels add some distinct flair to the PC. Above the display, there's a 1080p webcam with an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition. A physical shutter adds some privacy. Overall, picture quality is just OK; if you plan to stream your games, a great standalone webcam will do a lot better. The top-firing speakers remain unmuffled, and they get plenty loud without distorting. The downside is that there's not a whole lot of body to the audio. I do love the manual shutter on the webcam and the fingerprint reader below the keyboard; many gaming laptops ignore these features. Getting inside the PC requires the removal of 12 screws on the vented bottom panel. Once removed, you have access to RAM, storage, and the Wi-Fi card for quick and easy upgrades\/replacements after purchase.      The Raider A18 HX's 18-inch display hits a 3840x2400 (UHD+) resolution, making for an ultra-crisp look whether you're gaming or working. The use of a mini-LED panel provides deeper blacks, brighter whites, and improved contrast when compared to a standard LCD screen. The difference is immediately noticeable. Compared to OLED, mini-LED is better suited for HDR content thanks to its higher brightness. Indeed, the display here is certified for VESA DisplayHDR 1000, and I tested for 558 nits of brightness without HDR using my colorimeter. Also tested was color accuracy, for which the Raider A18 HX scored quite well, hitting 100% sRGB, 94% AdobeRGB, and 100% DCI-P3. These results are crucial for creative work. Combine all of this with a 120Hz refresh rate (quite fast for a 4K display), and you have an impressive screen to work or play with at any time. I also appreciate the matte finish that reduces glare. Running through our standard set of benchmarks, the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D CPU unsurprisingly falls behind Intel's flagship mobile chip for productivity tasks. AMD designed its CPUs to boost gaming performance, and that's evident as soon as you start playing. Paired with a 3840x2400 (UHD+) display, the performance hardware doesn't have an easy job. However, I clocked a 148.7 FPS average in Cyberpunk 2077 using Multi Frame Gen 4x, high overall settings, and ray tracing lighting set to high. In Far Cry 6 with Ultra settings and no DLSS, I got back a 100 FPS average. And in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, with highest settings and DLSS enabled, I saw a 170 FPS average. DLSS is doing a lot of heavy lifting here, but that's no different in any other powerhouse gaming laptop. The fact that you can still max out the UHD+ display's 120Hz refresh rate with these demanding titles is mighty impressive. MSI has also included the fastest M.2 PCIe 5.0 SSD we've ever tested in the new Raider. Thanks to its own heat pipe connected to the full cooling system, I didn't find it overheated.      I kicked off performance testing with a full-system stress test. The Raider A18 HX showed no signs of throttling under these conditions, and you should find that working normally at the PC won't create a ton of fan noise or heat. MSI's included control app allows for intelligent balancing of power using AI, but you can also force it into specific performance categories. The GPU is overclockable, though I'm not sure the added fan noise is worth it. The laptop's fans are not quiet when under gaming duress. I tested about 52 decibels when pushing the system with Cyberpunk 2077. Less demanding titles don't create nearly as much ruckus, but you'll still hear fan noise practically any time you're at the PC. MSI's Raider A18 HX was not built to be an efficiency superstar. Sporting the most powerful mobile CPU and GPU combo for gaming in the world, it focuses on raw power rather than long runtimes. A Windows battery report shows that standby lasting power is excellent (lasting a couple of days), but active power is not the same story. You should not attempt to game on this laptop without it being plugged into an AC adapter unless it's a light title and you have a bunch of the Raider's power settings turned down. Leaving the laptop at full power and going about regular, non-gaming tasks will get you about two or three hours of life, more if you tune the system down. It's the same story for practically any gaming laptop with this much power inside.      A colorful keyboard isn't exactly a rare sight in the gaming laptop world, but MSI's option isn't just flashy. It's a SteelSeries board boasting 99 keys thanks to the full number pad, each with separate and customizable RGB lighting. Key travel is deep enough that I didn't experience any discomfort when typing or gaming, and although it's not a mechanical board, it feels snappy and responsive. I dislike the translucent keycaps on the WASD and arrow keys, but it's overall a quality keyboard.      I'm not as impressed with the mechanical touchpad. There's a lot of movement on the surface that makes some clicks feel spongy, and it seems like MSI could have used up more space on the deck for wider and taller dimensions. The plastic pad is smooth and tracks well, and in the end, that's what matters most. You might wish it were a glass touchpad if you were using the built-in pointer full-time, but I suspect most gamers are switching to a controller or an external mouse anyway.           MSI's Raider A18 HX should be a top choice for anyone who wants the best mobile gaming CPU in the world and a choice of NVIDIA's latest laptop GPUs, including up to an RTX 5090. Battery life isn't great, and the fans aren't exactly quiet, but these are downsides found in practically any high-performance gaming laptop. Considering the Raider A18 HX is competitively priced against similar laptops, there's no reason not to consider it unless you particularly value audio and touchpad quality.       The MSI Raider A18 HX is home to the two most powerful mobile components you can buy today, the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D and the RTX 5090. However, that power comes at the cost of battery life and portability. I recommend sticking with an RTX 5080 model rather than wasting your money on the 5090 upgrade, but the Ryzen CPU and the mini-LED display are tops.

Hybrids have come a long way since their introduction nearly 25 years ago. The rise in popularity has led iSeeCars to add a new hybrid category to its annual study. This year, iSeeCars analyzed over 174 million cars to identify which cars were likely to operate for at least 250,000 miles. Trending Now: Auto Experts Say Stop Buying These 4 Hybrid Cars Immediately Learn More: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster Two brands, Toyota and Lexus, swept the market for the longest-lasting hybrids of 2025. In this article, GOBankingRates explores which models made the list and how they compare to the hybrid mileage average. The Toyota Highlander Hybrid was ranked in the top spot for the longest-lasting hybrids of 2025. In fact, this model has a 31% chance of lasting over 250,000 miles, which is 3.2 times the average hybrid. For You: I Bought a Hybrid Car \u2014 Here\u2019s How Much I Save on Gas Every Month In second place was the Lexus RX Hybrid, which has a 17% chance of lasting over 250,000 miles. This is 1.8 times the average, meaning your chances of driving the RX Hybrid over 250,000 are almost doubled compared to the average hybrid. Third place goes to the Toyota Prius. The Prius has a 12.2% chance of lasting 250,000 miles, which is 1.3 times the average hybrid vehicle. If you\u2019re in the market for a long-lasting car, you can\u2019t go wrong with the Toyota Prius. The Toyota Camry Hybrid is close behind the Prius, with a 10.2% chance of lasting 250,000 miles. This pencils out to 1.1 times the average hybrid. The Camry is another small vehicle that is built to last for years. Next up, in fifth place, is the Toyota Avalon Hybrid. This Toyota model has a 9.7% chance of lasting 250,000 miles, which is one times the average. While the Avalon Hybrid might not have as high a percentage as the Highlander Hybrid, it is still a reliable hybrid. The overall hybrid\u2019s average percentage of lasting 250,000 miles is 9.6%. The Toyota RAV4 Hybrid falls just short of this average at 7.9%. However, the RAV4 Hybrid has excellent customer reviews and a rigorous warranty program. With proper maintenance and upkeep, you have a great chance of driving this vehicle over 250,000 miles. The Lexus ES is in the same boat as the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, with a 7.5% chance of lasting 250,000 miles. While below the hybrid average, the Lexus ES ranks 12th overall for the longest-lasting passenger cars of 2025. By prioritizing maintenance and upkeep, you can extend the longevity of your Lexus ES.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Lo\u00efc Fr\u00e9mond loves living in London. On summer nights the sound of laughter from pubs and bars wafts through his neighbourhood - but so does the stench of rubbish. Bin bags on pavements are a familiar sight where Mr Fr\u00e9mond lives - as in many cities - their contents often strewn across the street; the result of vermin clawing them as they wait to be collected. Some of the bin bags Mr Fr\u00e9mond sees are his own. Eight months ago the bin room in his apartment building in Tower Hamlets was closed at the request of the local council.  Until then, residents would take their rubbish and recycling to the bin room as and when they needed to. On collection day, the concierge would put these bins on to the pavement for refuse workers to empty each week. One day Mr Fr\u00e9mond, 29, came down to find the bin room locked. The concierge had been told a weekly collection was no longer a suitable arrangement. Instead, residents were to leave their bags of rubbish on the pavement outside the building where refuse workers would collect them twice a day. Mr Fr\u00e9mond says not only is this unsightly, it attracts foxes and rats and obstructs the pavement. And to make matters worse, collections are often missed. \"The rubbish just sits on the pavement all night long - sometimes until midday the next day,\" he tells me. \"In the summer in particular, this was an absolute nightmare - the heat causing quite a foul stench.\"  Tower Hamlets Council was contacted for comment. Mr Fr\u00e9mond feels the bin bag-filled pavements make his neighbourhood near Spitalfields Market, a popular spot for tourists known for its food and art stalls, less pleasant for residents and visitors alike. Other London boroughs, such as Wandsworth and Havering, don't collect wheelie bins and ask all residents to place their bin bags on the pavement or just inside the boundary of their property. Outside London, most councils - from the New Forest to Moray - use a flexible approach like Tower Hamlets where residents use wheelie bins if their property can accommodate one - and, if not, their bin bags are collected from the pavement. Mr Fr\u00e9mond heard of one person interested in moving into his building who chose not to after seeing all the rubbish in the street. He says other residents have spoken about moving out.  \"It is a frequent topic of conversation in the tenants' group chat,\" he says. It's not just rubbish from homes that ends up strewn across the streets, it's waste from local businesses too. Businesses place bin bags on pavements for collection by a variety of contracted waste firms, which they can choose from, who pick up at various times of day.  \"It means that, at any given moment you walk down the street, there's a reasonable chance you're going to see piles of bin bags waiting for collection,\" says Nicholas Boys Smith, a former adviser to the government on urban design. This competitive system, which Mr Boys Smith says helps keep the cost of waste disposal down, doesn't just affect people living in dense cities. Towns with historic centres and narrow streets often don't have space for large outdoor bins for businesses to place their rubbish in either - so their bin bags hit the pavement. \"[The system works] OK in areas where you've got some dedicated, pre-built rubbish collection points as part of a big new development,\" he says. \"Where you don't have that is historic high streets and town centres.\" During the summer Mr Boys Smith visited Clamart in France, a suburb seven miles from Paris that was once an industrial site. The local authority has redeveloped it into a residential area full of low-rise apartment buildings and shops - there's even a lake. Subterranean bins have been built into the brick pavement on street corners, where residents can drop their bags into a chute above ground.  This leads to a large underground storage unit which is then emptied by specialist bin trucks that have a crane attached. These subterranean bins are clean, smartly presented, and a better use of public space, says Mr Boys Smith. \"They help avoid 'death by wheelie bin', which plagues so many British streets [on collection day].\" These kinds of bins also exist in Tower Hamlets, though not in the neighbourhood where Mr Fr\u00e9mond lives. In Bethnal Green, a group of apartment buildings named after heroes from Greek mythology have subterranean bins for general waste and recycling. In 2022 authorities in Liverpool installed these kinds of bins in some neighbourhoods. Officials in Sheffield put them in the city centre earlier this year. According to Samuel Hughes, a housing expert from the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, they are the best solution for rubbish disposal in towns and cities and more should be installed to help residents like Mr Fr\u00e9mond. Mr Hughes used to live in the Italian city of Florence where subterranean bins are common and he says they are widely used in most of western Europe. There are some challenges, though. They would need to be installed in locations such as pavements if there is space or, failing that, they could fit into parking bays. \"But obviously this creates a brouhaha because you're taking over some space that people are already using for cars,\" he adds. Buying and installing subterranean bins is also expensive, compared to wheelie bins, so cash-strapped councils might not be able to afford them in large numbers. Another obstacle is the array of cables and pipes under streets which would need to be adapted in locations where subterranean bins are installed. Some British high streets are so busy that there aren't parking bays or space on the pavement for subterranean bins - so people living in flats above shops have no choice but to leave bin bags on pavements. Councils have tried various methods to make this tidier, ranging from placing vinyl stickers on pavements showing where bin bags should be placed, to repurposing plastic storage containers normally made for grit or dog waste. Businesses are trying too. Some in Putney, south-west London, have clubbed together to buy large e-bikes that are used to ferry rubbish from shopfronts to a central collection point. A bin truck then takes all the rubbish away in one go. Mr Fr\u00e9mond hopes something similar might be done to improve things in his area.  \"Everything is on my doorstep,\" he says of living there - but the bin bags on his doorstep aren't so welcome. Five options are put forward for the reorganisation of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough councils. Lancashire's councils are set to vote on plans for reorganisation, with five very different proposals. The chief executive of Scotland's smallest council will get \u00a332,000 extra next year, a 24% rise. Business leaders issue a warning about the state of the high street as a Trago branch is reviewed. Rival proposals for one, two or three new unitary authorities will be submitted to government.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. After announcing it last month, Samsung has quietly rolled out the Aeotec Smart Home Hub 2 in the U.S., and it\u2019s shaping up to be a much more capable hub for anyone invested in the SmartThings ecosystem. Rather than just refreshing the previous model, Samsung and Aeotec redesigned the smart home hub to be faster, work with more devices, and look better in your home. The new version is about half the size of the last one, but it has a processor that Samsung says is roughly 70% faster and 512MB of RAM, which is twice as much as before (via SamMobile). The hub is intended to keep automations snappier, reduce lag, and allow more tasks to run locally so your lights, sensors, and routines don\u2019t stall when your Wi-Fi is acting up. But where the Hub 2 really flexes its muscles is in terms of compatibility. It supports Zigbee, Thread, and, most importantly, Matter, which is quickly becoming the glue that ties together different brands\u2019 smart devices.      SmartThings already works with thousands of products, and adding Matter support makes it even easier to use different brands together. Samsung is also adding smarter automation features, such as climate control that adjusts based on who is home, better monitoring for leaks and smoke, and air-quality sensors that help your home respond to daily changes. It\u2019s the kind of hub meant to sit at the center of a home filled with smart bulbs, sensors, switches, appliances\u2014you name it\u2014and quietly coordinate everything without needing your constant attention. The Aeotec Smart Home Hub 2 is priced at $120, making it a mid-range upgrade that seems fair for the new features. However, unlike its predecessor, this new version has dropped Z-Wave support. If you were banking on this hub managing your older Z-Wave devices, you\u2019ll need a separate dongle or gateway. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Still, for most people interested in newer Matter and Thread devices, the Aeotec Smart Home Hub 2 shows Samsung\u2019s effort to become a bigger part of the growing smart home market.

Rigid config, lack of user control, often mysterious goings-on, etc.  That is on top of Google trying to completely take over what is web standards, mostly in favor of their own products and services (and drag all the other browsers with it, since they are now all Chromium, except Firefox and those based on it). >\"The only way to fix it is to strip out all the telemetry\/AI\/adware\" What little telemetry\/AI\/adware, if you can call it that, is 100% under user control.  Mozilla is completely open about what they do and where, and you can turn all of it off.  Nothing is hidden. And it actually is off when you turn it off.  And it stays off. >\"and preinstall good adblock.\" Mozilla isn't going to put that directly into Firefox.  It would be suicide.  Yes, we all immediately install a VERY good adblock, which is UBO.  And it is the real deal, unlike anything you can put in Chrome or Edge.  But that is our doing it.  If that were preinstalled, it would make Firefox an enemy of some very powerful corporations.  Mozilla has enough issues without adding that. example #45323 of why open source projects lose to big corporations. the only real viable alternative to literally google\/microsoft and apple and what do we get? \"actually perfect is the enemey of good\" and whats the alternative? a whole new browser as a real alternative? no a fucking fork of the very thing being criticized so it relies upon the financial success of the thing we are supposed to hate but will also fragment it continued good work guys, year of the linux desktop anytime now Most likely Firefox will see and change direction. I do think though it'd be ironic if \"Thing that relies on X destroys X and then inevitably dies as a result\" ends up happening to an Internet browser if people are leaving the browser it's based upon because of the AI shit forced into the latter. Most likely people will stop being outraged when they see that they just don't have to use the feature.Vivaldi has support for fricking Hue light bulbs. Never bothered me. They also blogged about why it doesn't complicate the browser.One might only think if Firefox should build a better extension system and put quite a few things into extensions. But I guess with web extensions they gave up on this. Since it is based on Firefox, if everyone leaves it for LibreWolf, who will maintain that? Firefox will fold, and so will LibreWolf. You need a sustainable business model.Right!?!?!

So you use Firefox and they can't track you but then they won't let you make purchases on their website...\" This is actually insightful.  I have noticed that with UBO and lots of tracking disabled (thank you Firefox), many sites, INCLUDING SLASHDOT, are now constantly challenging me to prove I am not a \"bot\" through their use of Cloudflare.  So far it is just annoying.  But that could evolve pretty quickly into downright disaster.  And the more we outsource control of our sites to Cloudflare, the more dangerous it becomes.  Soon, Google will be able to define the web in whatever freaking way they want, ways that will certainly not benefit user privacy or freedom.  And Cloudflare will be able to completely control who is allowed to even browse the web, and how, and using which tools, and from where.  Throw in AI nonsense to remove users from all direct sources of information, power more bots, and confuse everything with fake crap, and the outlook for \"the web\" is looking more dreary every year. If I get the cloudflare, show me the traffic light, challenges more than once I just stop trying. Once they notice the drop in genuine traffic they might reconsider. If not, well there other places to go to. Right now, it is a stupid check box I have to keep clicking.  Just started maybe a week ago.  And it is nearly every time I click on anything Slashdot, if I have a gap of time inbetween.  Sometimes even a few minutes.  It is very annoying. Ironically I just got the cloudflare checkbox clicking on your reply. A first for me on slashdot, but I'm on my phone this morning which might be GNATed (shared IPv4), making it suspicious. I'm logged in though, and with a fairly old account, you would think that would bypass the need for a check. AI bots are probably to blame for this trend. Get ready to drink a verification can of Mountain Dew. Try deleting your profile, start from fresh, re-install your add-ons. I was getting a constant Captcha treatment on my corner of the web (not Cloudflare in my case, some European equivalent). I had privacy-protecting settings in about:config that I set years ago and forgot about, possibly something there triggers the bot suspicion. Restarting with a new profile solved it. I got an email asking for a review on a recent purchase. I spent 15 minutes writing the damn thing and their site decided I couldn't post it because I had an adblocker. I whitelisted them, even disabled it so I could post. None of it worked. I just emailed their \"Contact US\" and expressed how they wasted my time and wouldn't bother with a review. It helps them, not me. These folks need a better way to detect fraud. businesses use that tracking to decide whether or not you're committing fraud or not.\"Hey Mr Businessman! I just bought this brand new PC\/Tablet\/Cell phone and I'd like to buy that really expensive product I saw on your web site. Of course you can't track me. Because I only just turned on this brand new machine this morning.\" Do you really think they'll turn you down? Once the credit card has been approved and the transaction completed, I'll just spin up a clean copy of the VM running my browser. And then next week: \"Hey Mr Businessman! I just bought this brand new PC\/Tablet\/Cell phone ...\"  businesses use that tracking to decide whether or not you're committing fraud or not. \"Hey Mr Businessman!

It is the website developers coding JavaScript to prevent you from blocking ads by blocking your access to their content. It does not stop A.I. and a paywall won't either. I bet the A.I. companies all have hundreds of paid subscriptions and they mask their identity with fake user profiles. Yes they are paying the subscriptions. But then A.I. doesn't even need to render a page, it reads the code and accesses the raw content then reformats it in an out  I don't like those emdash symbols in the article. Why's everything got to be AI to get attention. Can't FF market itself as the non-AI browser? Use AI things in extensions perhaps? Fairly sure I long pressed on a link recently and got an AI preview. I don't remember opting in for that, maybe I did implicitly by allowing an upgrade. Don't remember deliberately doing that though. The reason to market without AI is simple, everyone else is saying how much they're going in on it. My suggestion, merge a bit of what you said in and say \"We don't rely on AI, for things you want, you can enable them, for everyone else, enjoy the longer battery life!\" it'd win downloads, everyone wants more bat  On the one hand says of a single configuration option:...write up a blog post explaining how extraordinarily expensive it is to maintain a configuration option over the lifespan of a global product.100% this! How is that one option sooooooo much work, but enabling all the agentic AI hooks and integration points (that said group doesn't want in the first place) is somehow no big deal and we shouldn't worry about it?!?!

In my experience Home Depot has some pretty primitive security. I'm not sure what troglodyte is running their ecommerce but it's kind of embarassing. I've had experiences where they just block certain useragents, and if you try to access it via a VPN you just get a 403... no messaging, no throttling, no challenges... just blocked. Sometimes it goes away after a while.

Dozens of pro-union flyers have appeared around Starbucks headquarters since baristas at 65 stores launched a nationwide strike \u2014 and the company is on alert for more action. Employees say the flyers have appeared in hallways and bathroom stalls across the Seattle building this week, while some corporate workers whisper support for the baristas on strike. The flyers first appeared just days before baristas launched a nationwide strike at dozens of stores in 40 cities to pressure the company to finalize their first union contract. The strike, which is the unionized baristas' fourth work stoppage in two years \u2014 and their third since Brian Niccol became CEO in September 2024 \u2014 began on Red Cup Day, an annual promotional event that offers customers a free reusable cup with their purchase and generates significant sales for the company. \"Baristas deserve better pay and staffing. SSC workers support a fair contract!\" one of the flyers reads, referencing Starbucks Support Center employees, who work at the corporate headquarters office and are not unionized. It includes a logo for the Starbucks Workers United union and a link to a \"solidarity pledge,\" which urges supporters not to patronize Starbucks while unionized baristas are on strike. Two corporate employees told Business Insider that during a Tuesday meeting, a member of Starbucks' HR team instructed them to inform their team leaders if they observed other staff members taking pro-union actions at work \u2014 but not to intervene, because it could be considered \"protected concerted activity.\" Protected concerted activities are legally protected for union and non-union employees and include discussions about wages, working conditions, and other employment-related matters. A spokesperson for Starbucks declined to comment on the pro-union flyers, telling Business Insider in a statement that it's \"an exciting time to be a Starbucks partner.\" \"This year's holiday launch is breaking records, and yesterday we had our best Reusable Red Cup Day ever,\" the statement said. The flyers also took aim at Niccol's compensation. One includes a meme which depicts a man sweating nervously as he decides which of two red buttons to push. One button reads \"Raises for partners,\" which is how Starbucks refers to its employees; the other button reads \"$96,000,000 for Brian,\" a reference to the CEO's pay package. Niccol's pay package for 2024 was valued at $95,801,676, including a $61,538 base salary, $5 million signing bonus, and significant stock awards, Business Insider previously reported. Niccol's compensation package has been criticized for its high ratio compared to that of the average Starbucks employee. According to data collected by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Niccol's pay package represents 6,666 times the median $14,674 salary of Starbucks employees, the highest disparity among companies in the S&P 500. In August, citing cost-saving measures related to its ongoing turnaround campaign, Starbucks announced that it would give salaried employees a flat 2% pay raise across the board, rather than having managers weigh in on pay increases as they had in previous years. Starbucks is investing $500 million in staffing, training, and support to enhance the coffeehouse experience under its Green Apron Service model, a spokesperson told Business Insider on the day the strike began. Prior to joining Starbucks, Niccol served as chief executive of the fast-casual Mexican chain, Chipotle, where he spearheaded a turnaround campaign that saw the company's share price soar more than eightfold. Just over a year into his tenure at the coffee giant, Niccol's \"Back to Starbucks\" initiative, which has included a $1 billion restructuring, two rounds of layoffs, and a swath of store closures, has started to gain momentum. In October's earnings report, Starbucks said that its fourth-quarter comparable sales rose 1% globally, driven by new protein-focused drinks \u2014 the first time in seven quarters that the coffee chain has reported an increase. Even as Starbucks touts its comeback, the company's long-running labor fight continues to simmer. Since 2021, more than 550 of Starbucks' nearly 17,000 stores across the US have voted to unionize. The union said there has been an increased interest in stores joining its ranks since the September restructuring and layoffs. However, the National Labor Relations Board, which certifies union elections, has not had the minimum number of members needed to issue decisions or take formal actions since the beginning of President Donald Trump's term in January. The company and the union have yet to reach a first collective bargaining agreement, and negotiations have stalled for nearly a year, with both sides blaming each other. The two corporate employees told Business Insider that it is unusual for staff in the Seattle headquarters to publicly express support for the unionized in-store staff. It's not the first time corporate staff have pushed back on policy: Business Insider reported in July that flyers objecting to the company's return-to-office mandate also began circulating at the Seattle headquarters. The new pro-union flyers have been removed from some areas of the Seattle office, the employees said. Have a tip?

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Look, nobody likes landlords. Even if you have the most benevolent landlord of all time, there is an inherent problem with a societal structure that relies on one person owning the place where another person is living. In an ideal world, everyone owns the home in which they live and where no one person is lording over another. A common argument for landlord arrangements is that landlords are providing a \"service\" in renting out their home, preventing them from needing to purchase in an area where they might be temporarily living. The implication is that while the \"landlord\" is renting out their home, they, too, are renting elsewhere, and the cycle perpetuates. But this assumption relies on every family owning just a single home and renting it while they aren't living in it.\u00a0 If that were the case, this argument would have some validity, but it is seldom, if ever, actually the case. No, most rented homes are owned by a person or entity that owns two or more homes. Even if all things are fair and equal in the way that their homes were acquired, there is still the problem of the artificial scarcity created. Take, for example, diamonds. The price of diamonds relies on artificial scarcity, with the corporations that control the supply of diamonds hoarding diamonds that are mined in order to create an artificial scarcity within the market, keeping the price of diamonds sky-high. Landlords, those owning multiple homes, and shady investment companies hoarding houses like diamonds, effectively create artificial scarcity in a market that is already limited by physical constraints. Really, there is a huge problem with any society where natural rights, like having a place to live, are treated like an investment by those with means at the expense of those without. It stands to reason that there should be laws and fees encouraging money to be invested in something constructive to the betterment of society, rather than people and entities hoarding homes like a dragon sitting on a pile of gold Like what you see?

All of this being said, while it is a shame to think that this woman has no stake or ownership in the place that she has called home for at least the last 12\u2014let alone 20\u2014years, it is absolute lunacy to expect you to have a stake or ownership in a place that you have no legal claim to.\u00a0 While paying your landlord's mortgage undoubtedly hurts, and as bad a rap as landlords might have, it would be insane to just suddenly go around acting like you own the place and attempt to wrench control of the property from them. The reality is that, whatever side of privilege they're on and from whatever walk of life, entitled people will be entitled and try to take advantage of any situation presented to them.\u00a0 The image is representative only and does not depict the actual subjects of the story.

If you\u2019re looking to purchase a car, you want one that will last, especially if you\u2019re buying used. The last thing you want is to buy a car and have it break down after a few years. I\u2019m a Car Expert: 5 Luxury Cars To Avoid Before Retirement Explore Next: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster In this article, we\u2019ll discuss four cars that rarely reach 200,000 miles, helping you make a smart purchase decision. One of the main factors affecting the longevity of the Fiat 500e is the high-voltage battery pack. Over time, the lithium-ion battery loses its capacity, leading to shorter driving ranges and charging problems. In fact, the manufacturer\u2019s warranty typically covers the battery for only eight years or 100,000 miles. Even if your battery hits the 100,000-mile mark, there\u2019s no guarantee it will last another 100,000 miles. These batteries are costly to replace, so don\u2019t waste your money on the Fiat 500e. \u201cYou will not be able to count on a Fiat 500e to make it to 200,000 miles,\u201d said Melanie Musson, auto industry expert with AutoInsurance.org. \u201cThe 500e is one of the least reliable vehicles on the market. It is not even built for long-distance driving, but rather designed as a commuter car for in-town use.\u201d I\u2019m a Mechanic: 6 Electric Vehicles I Would Buy and Why They Are Worth It While some Nissan Altima users report a high lifetime mileage, others are disappointed with its longevity. Many Altima models with Continuous Variable Transmissions (CVT) report issues, especially when proper maintenance isn\u2019t followed. Another common problem that contributes to longevity issues is dirt and dust getting into the engine. Without regular cleanings, your engine\u2019s performance could be impacted, causing the vehicle to last well under 200,000 miles. If you are looking for a vehicle that will last forever, avoid the Nissan Altima. \u201cAll new Altimas are made with a CVT, which is notorious for early failure,\u201d said Musson. \u201cIf the transmission is serviced regularly and brought in for repair at the earliest sign of a problem, the vehicle could reach 200,000 miles. However, with average maintenance, the Altima is unlikely to reach 200,000 miles.\u201d The BMW N54 and N55 models rarely last 200,000 miles. While the engine itself in these vehicles might be durable, other components frequently break, like the fuel pump, fuel injectors and twin turbos. These weak points make it extremely expensive to repair, which is why many users opt for purchasing a new vehicle instead. Oil leaks, carbon buildup and belt shredding are three additional issues that affect these vehicles\u2019 lifespan. If you\u2019re looking for a luxury vehicle that can last over 200,000 miles, avoid older N54 and N55 models. \u201cThe N54 and N55 are known to have problems with high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP) failures, turbo\/waste gate failures, injector leaks, oil leaks and carbon buildup,\u201d said Eugine Frost, mechanic at Tinker DIY. \u201cAll of these have high parts and labor costs for repeated repairs. Additionally, multiple systems my require attention as the mileage increases.\u201d The Jeep brand isn\u2019t known for its reliability. In fact, older models have well-documented issues, like transmission failures in 2014 through 2020 models. Although Jeep claims to have fixed the problem with 2021 models and onward, there hasn\u2019t been enough data to support these claims. Similarly, the Jeep Cherokee has malfunctioning sensors and frequent engine oil leaks, both of which contribute to a lower lifespan. If you expect your vehicle to drive for over 200,000 miles, steer clear.

One Wall Street strategist says now is not the time to pull out.   Michael Hartnett, Chief Investment Strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, sees stocks maintaining their momentum into the spring, with support from the Fed, the Trump administration, and dip-buyers, according to a Friday note.\u00a0   Hartnett argues that a \u201cbubble in expectations\u201d\u2014not an actual financial bubble\u2014lies behind the market\u2019s recent weakness. As examples, he cites the government backstopping markets on what are said to be national security grounds; optimism about quantitative easing by the Fed; and a tailwind from tax cuts and tariff dividend checks as dynamics that have supported markets.\u00a0  Artificial intelligence may dominate the headlines, but there are many factors that influence the outlook for the stock market, including interest rate expectations and liquidity. Easing financial conditions, a byproduct of rate cuts or fiscal stimulus like tax cuts, usually support stock markets.  But he sees three reasons to be optimistic that stocks will regain their momentum.   These factors\u2014plus a \u201cgoldilocks\u201d economic set-up defined by declining interest rates, steady profit growth, and AI-driven productivity gains that moderate inflation\u2014should keep the market chugging along, he wrote.   Hartnett expects the sign to sell will come from bank stocks or credit spreads, both of which would reflect investors\u2019 unease with rising debt levels as the Fed slows the pace at which it eases monetary policy. According to Hartnett, those risk-off signals aren\u2019t likely to flash before May.   Granted, the economic outlook has been highly uncertain for most of the year. The fog only grew thicker during the government shutdown, which delayed the release of inflation and labor market data that policymakers will want to consider when setting interest rates next month. It's also not a given that AI will boost productivity and slow inflation in the near term.   Recap Investopedia's coverage of last week's trading here.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Is it time to invest in memory chip manufacturers?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Major PC brands, system integrators, and memory makers are now panic-buying memory chips and modules as the DRAM and NAND chip shortage is taking hold. According to DigiTimes, numerous companies are in a race to build up their stocks as data centers are swallowing up supply, leaving the consumer industry scrambling to get memory modules. Asus said that its memory inventory for production and those that are already in finished products sit at two months, which should be enough for the remainder of 2025. However, unless the situation changes, the company will start feeling the pinch of the shortage by 2026, requiring it to adjust its prices accordingly. While most large companies like Asus and MSI typically have contracts with memory chip manufacturers, reports say that they\u2019re also now purchasing a lot of inventory in the spot market, where prices are more volatile, presumably to shore up their supply. This is a major change and could be a sign of things to come, as it usually only hosts low-volume purchases from smaller companies or when a major institution needs to acquire more memory modules due to unforeseen demand. These actions in the spot market are increasing pricing pressure, and it\u2019s already being felt by retail customers. RAM prices have jumped by 100% or more recently, and we\u2019ve even heard reports of some Japanese shops limiting sales volume per customer because of limited deliveries, with some products remaining out of stock from distributors. Even memory kit makers are reportedly delaying the launch of new models due to the memory supply crunch, with products scheduled for launch in the last quarter of 2025 being moved to 2026. The global infrastructure build-out of AI data centers is driving the massive demand for HBM and RDIMM, pushing out the supply for consumer memory and causing a \u201cpricing apocalypse\u201d that could last a decade. With companies investing billions of dollars in hardware, memory chipmakers are converting existing DRAM lines to take advantage of this lucrative market. Most major memory chip manufacturers have reported record earnings for the 3Q25, with upstream firms also reaping benefits from the massive jump in demand. Unfortunately, they\u2019re also wary of market volatility, especially with some experts saying that we\u2019re in an AI bubble that can burst anytime. Because of this, most of them aren\u2019t willing to invest billions of dollars in additional facilities to increase RAM production. But even if they start construction on new chip fabs right now, it will take several months, if not years, for them to begin operating, and churning out the memory chips we sorely need.

Reselling items on sites like eBay, Poshmark, and Mercari could earn you some extra pocket money. It could also evolve into a full-time, seven-figure business, like it has for Richard Senko, who started selling cellphones on eBay in 2008 after getting laid off from his job. Or, it could serve as a \"double salary,\" as it does for Yinka Ogunsunlade, a full-time lawyer who earns six figures from his eBay side hustle, which he started in 2005. Whether you just want some extra cash to play with each month or are looking to run a full-fledged reselling operation, Senko and Ogunsunlade, with their decades of experience, have some advice. Start with what you already have. Chances are, you can list an item on a platform like eBay today without having to leave your house. \"Don't go out and spend a bunch of money and hope stuff will sell,\" said Senko. \"Start around your house. Evaluate the stuff that you don't need.\" When he switched from reselling electronics to apparel, the first clothing item he listed was a vintage Buffalo Bills jersey that he pulled out of his closet: \"There's no reason at all to reach inside your pocket and start an eBay business when we can turn these items that we have inside our house into cash.\" It's a low-stakes way to test whether you even like the process of reselling \u2014 if you do, you can start going out and buying items to resell, but if it's not for you, you spent minimal time and money testing the waters. Source profitable products from discount stores and sites. After starting with items they already had on hand, both Senko and Ogunsunlade's next step was to source inventory. Senko's go-to discount spots were Goodwill, Salvation Army, and local thrift stores; Ogunsunlade frequented Neiman Marcus Last Call and Saks OFF 5th, and now uses websites like YOOX and NET-A-PORTER to land deals. Both were paying attention to two numbers: the price of the item they planned to buy and resell, and the prices of comparable items on eBay. To find the latter, don't just look at what items are listed for \u2014 use the \"sold items\" filter, as there could be a big discrepancy between what something is listed for and what it sells for. Senko said his sweet spot was finding an item for about $5 that he could sell for $30. After shipping and eBay fees, that would leave him with about $20 per item, he said: \"If you do that 14 times a day, that's $280 in profit a day. You can make $100,000 a year selling 14 items a day on eBay.\" That's not to say you can't run a profitable business with lower price points. If you find an item for $1 that you can list for $10, \"you can run a great business \u2014 however, it's going to involve more processing, more listing, and more photos.\" Niche down and become an expert in your category. The advantage of niching down is knowing your category inside and out. Senko's company, technsports, focuses on pre-owned men's apparel. Ogunsunlade, who runs Fashionably Legal, specifically sells athletic sneakers and apparel. It's easier to follow the trends when you're an expert in your category. For example, at the start of football season, Ogunsunlade knows he has to stock up on cleats: \"Once July and August roll around, I know there's a parent somewhere in America with a kid that needs some football cleats.\" When thinking about what you want to resell, start with what you like. \"I think it's definitely beneficial to sell something that you're passionate about,\" said Ogunsunlade. It'll help prevent burnout. Plus, you'll find it easier to source and list items that you know well. Include specifics in your listing page. Building an accurate, engaging listing page is \"the most important part of the process,\" said Senko. To do so, you first have to know who your customer is. \"The customer for a Tommy Bahama shirt is totally different from a customer who wants a Nike skateboard shirt,\" he said. \"I need to create a listing that will capture the customer that I'm looking for.\" That requires using specific keywords in the listing title. For example, if you're selling a Tommy Bahama shirt, don't just title your listing \"Tommy Bahama shirt,\" he said. \"Everybody can put that part into their title. It's what comes after that, the nuance, and that's the separator of how you get your item seen versus your item never selling.\" In addition to keywords, your listing should have clear photos and a detailed description. If you're selling clothing, \"you have to provide measurements because the customer is buying it sight unseen, so they need a fundamental idea of what they are purchasing,\" he said. Or, \"If there is any sort of flaw or thing you need to bring attention to the buyer, you need to have that filled in.\" Before listing anything, Ogunsunlade considers the listing from the buyer's perspective. If he were to click on the listing as a buyer, would it answer all of the questions he would have about the item? Provide excellent customer service, including a return policy. In any industry, \"the most expensive thing for most businesses is the cost of customer acquisition,\" said Senko. \"So, once we have the buyer in the funnel, if we can sell to them again, that's just a free customer for us.\" He has a few strategies for retaining customers, including a 60-day free return policy, which is the most aggressive policy eBay offers. Ogunsunlade has also learned that to be competitive on a site like eBay, offering a return policy \"is necessary.\" Strong reviews, which can be earned through good communication and fast handling times, are also essential, he said. \"Just as with anything you purchase, you want to see the feedback. If you're looking to purchase a car, you want to purchase from a reputable dealer.\" Give it time. Neither Senko nor Ogunsunlade experienced overnight success with their reselling businesses. \"That first year, it was very, very low margins,\" said Ogunsunlade, whose initial goal with the side hustle was to earn enough money a month to cover his cellphone bill. From there, he set a goal to grow his side hustle income every year. He's grown gradually, but it's required a lot of time. He estimates that he spends 30 hours per week on his eBay side hustle, but he likes that there's \"a direct return on the amount of effort that you put in.\" Ultimately, he added, \"There's no cap on how much you can make on eBay.\" Jump to","label":0}

The beauty of today\u2019s hybrid vehicles is that they\u2019re engineered to last well beyond their warranties, often cruising past 200,000 miles with proper maintenance. These aren\u2019t your neighbor\u2019s experimental hybrids from 2005 \u2014 modern hybrid technology has matured into something genuinely dependable. For retirees who want predictable costs, excellent fuel economy, and the peace of mind that comes from a proven track record, hybrids make tremendous sense. Whether you\u2019re planning cross-country trips to visit the grandkids or just want something reliable for daily errands, these twelve vehicles represent the sweet spot between longevity, efficiency, and value. Let\u2019s highlight the hybrids that could very well be the last car you\u2019ll need to buy. The Camry Hybrid is essentially the Labrador Retriever of the automotive world\u2014reliable, friendly, and nearly impossible to wear out. Toyota has been perfecting this sedan since 2007, and the current generation benefits from nearly two decades of hybrid refinement. Owners routinely report 300,000+ miles with nothing more than routine maintenance and perhaps a battery replacement around the 200,000-mile mark. The ride is comfortable enough for long highway stretches, and the 52 combined MPG means you\u2019ll be passing gas stations more than you\u2019ll be stopping at them. With its spacious trunk and quiet cabin, it\u2019s perfect for retirees who value substance over flash. The resale value remains strong too, which matters if your plans change down the road. Honda\u2019s engineers clearly took the \u201cbuilt to last\u201d philosophy seriously with the Accord Hybrid, which combines a bulletproof powertrain with one of the most refined driving experiences in the segment. The continuously variable transmission might sound concerning to old-school gearheads, but Honda\u2019s system has proven remarkably durable in real-world conditions. You\u2019re looking at 48 combined MPG in a midsize sedan that doesn\u2019t feel like a compromise \u2014 it actually handles curves with surprising enthusiasm. The interior materials hold up exceptionally well over time, which means your Accord will still look presentable when it hits its tenth birthday. Maintenance costs remain reasonable thanks to Honda\u2019s widespread dealer network and parts availability. This is the hybrid for folks who enjoy driving but don\u2019t want to think about their car breaking down. If you need the versatility of an SUV with the fuel economy of a sedan, the RAV4 Hybrid delivers on both fronts without breaking a sweat. This has become one of Toyota\u2019s best-selling vehicles for good reason: it combines all-wheel drive, 40 combined MPG, and enough cargo space for everything from golf clubs to gardening supplies. The hybrid system actually adds power rather than taking it away, giving you a peppy 219 horsepower that makes highway merging stress-free. Ground clearance is generous enough for unpaved roads, which opens up possibilities for weekend adventures in the mountains or at the lake. Toyota\u2019s reputation for longevity extends fully to this platform, with many owners treating 200,000 miles as just the break-in period. The high seating position and easy entry make it particularly appealing for anyone with mobility concerns. Think of the ES 300h as the Camry Hybrid\u2019s sophisticated older sibling who went to finishing school and never looked back. You\u2019re getting essentially the same proven hybrid powertrain, but wrapped in luxury materials and backed by Lexus\u2019s legendary attention to detail. The cabin is whisper-quiet even at highway speeds, and the seats feel like they were designed by someone who actually cares about long-distance comfort. Build quality is exceptional \u2014 these cars age gracefully, with interiors that still look and feel premium after a decade of use. The 44 combined MPG is impressive for a luxury sedan, and the ride quality strikes a perfect balance between comfort and control. For retirees who want to enjoy their golden years in style without sacrificing practicality, this is worth the premium over the standard Camry. The CR-V Hybrid takes everything people love about America\u2019s favorite compact SUV and makes it even better with a fuel-sipping powertrain. Honda\u2019s two-motor hybrid system provides smooth, linear acceleration that feels more natural than many competitors\u2019 systems. You\u2019ll appreciate the 40 combined MPG when you realize you\u2019re filling up about half as often as your neighbors with conventional SUVs. The cargo area is genuinely useful, with a low load floor and enough space to handle everything from Costco runs to helping your kids move apartments. Visibility is excellent from the driver\u2019s seat, which becomes increasingly important as we age. The reliability track record mirrors that of the regular CR-V, which has long been one of the most dependable vehicles on the road. The original hybrid champion refuses to fade away, and the latest generation proves that Toyota hasn\u2019t forgotten how to build a car that simply won\u2019t quit. Modern Prius models have shed much of their quirky styling in favor of a more conventional appearance, though you\u2019ll still turn heads with that 57 combined MPG figure. The hatchback design offers surprising cargo flexibility, and the low floor makes loading heavy items much easier than in a traditional sedan. Toyota\u2019s commitment to supporting Prius owners means parts will remain available for decades, and any mechanic worth their salt knows these cars inside and out. While it may not excite your pulse, it also won\u2019t drain your bank account or leave you stranded. Sometimes boring is beautiful, especially when you\u2019re on a fixed income. Hyundai\u2019s rise in quality and reliability over the past decade is nothing short of remarkable, and the Sonata Hybrid showcases just how far they\u2019ve come. The 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty provides peace of mind that few competitors can match, which is particularly valuable for retirees on a budget. At 52 combined MPG, it matches the Camry Hybrid\u2019s efficiency while undercutting it on price. The styling is more adventurous than the Japanese competition, which either appeals to you or doesn\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s no middle ground. Interior quality feels upscale, with soft-touch materials where your hands actually touch them. The Blue Link connected services are genuinely useful for remote diagnostics and maintenance reminders, helping you stay on top of service schedules. For retirees who need three rows of seating but don\u2019t want to sacrifice fuel economy, the Highlander Hybrid solves a problem most large SUVs can\u2019t even acknowledge. You\u2019re getting seating for up to eight people and 36 combined MPG, which seems almost magical in a vehicle this size. The hybrid system\u2019s extra power means you\u2019re not compromising on highway passing ability or towing capacity. Build quality is Toyota-solid, with a track record that suggests these will still be running strong when your youngest grandchild gets their driver\u2019s license. The second-row captain\u2019s chairs option transforms this into a supremely comfortable long-distance cruiser. Yes, it\u2019s expensive upfront, but the combination of longevity and fuel savings makes the math work over time. The Maverick Hybrid represents something genuinely new \u2014 an affordable compact pickup that prioritizes fuel economy without apologizing for it. At 42 combined MPG, it achieves efficiency numbers that most sedans would envy while still offering a useful truck bed. While it\u2019s still relatively new to the market, early reliability reports are encouraging, and Ford\u2019s extensive dealer network means service will never be far away. The cabin is comfortable enough for daily driving, and the truck bed handles everything from mulch to furniture with ease. For retirees who need light-duty hauling capability but don\u2019t want to feed a thirsty V8, this hits the sweet spot. The NX 350h brings Lexus refinement to the compact luxury SUV segment with a hybrid system that balances performance and efficiency beautifully. You\u2019re looking at 39 combined MPG in a vehicle that feels genuinely premium, with materials and build quality that justify the price tag. The infotainment system has improved dramatically in recent years, finally catching up to the excellence of the rest of the vehicle. All-wheel drive comes standard, providing confidence in inclement weather without the usual fuel penalty. The compact dimensions make it easier to maneuver in tight parking lots while still offering adequate cargo space for most situations. Lexus reliability extends to their hybrid models, with many owners reporting trouble-free experiences well past 150,000 miles. Before Honda discontinued it for 2023, the Insight served as a more conventional-looking alternative to the Prius with Honda\u2019s trademark attention to detail. Used models from 2019-2022 remain excellent choices for budget-conscious retirees who want proven hybrid technology. The styling is handsome and understated, aging better than many competitors\u2019 more aggressive designs. At 52 combined MPG, it delivers Prius-like efficiency in a package that won\u2019t make your neighbors ask questions. The interior is thoughtfully designed with actual buttons for climate control, which some of us still appreciate. Honda\u2019s reputation for building cars that refuse to die extends fully to the Insight, making pre-owned examples smart buys for retirement. This hybrid minivan on the market deserves recognition for doing what no competitor has managed, making three rows and sliding doors coexist with 36 combined MPG. For retirees who regularly transport grandchildren or need maximum cargo flexibility, the Sienna\u2019s practicality is unmatched. The low floor and wide-opening doors make entry and exit easier than any SUV, which matters more with each passing year. All-wheel drive is available, turning this family hauler into a surprisingly capable bad-weather vehicle. Toyota\u2019s commitment to hybrid technology means parts and service expertise will remain available for decades. While minivans aren\u2019t glamorous, they\u2019re incredibly useful, and the Sienna proves you don\u2019t have to sacrifice efficiency for space. The common thread running through all these vehicles is simple: they\u2019re engineered to last while sipping fuel and minimizing maintenance headaches. Hybrid technology has moved well past its experimental phase into genuine maturity, with battery packs routinely lasting 150,000-200,000 miles and longer. For retirees on fixed incomes, the combination of excellent fuel economy and proven reliability translates into predictable, manageable transportation costs. These aren\u2019t flashy choices, but they\u2019re smart ones \u2014 vehicles that let you focus on enjoying retirement rather than worrying about your next repair bill. Whether you need a compact sedan or a three-row SUV, there\u2019s a hybrid option that\u2019ll serve you faithfully for years to come. The best part is that you\u2019re not sacrificing anything meaningful for that efficiency: these vehicles prove you really can have your cake and eat it too.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in -- Listen Share At a recent AI conference in San Francisco, over 300 founders and investors were asked a provocative question: which billion-dollar AI startup would you bet against? The answer was surprising. Perplexity AI topped the list, with OpenAI coming in second. While the OpenAI vote raised eyebrows given its market dominance, the Perplexity verdict reveals something deeper about the AI search landscape in 2025. Perplexity Founded in 2022, the company hit a $20 billion valuation by September 2025, processing 780 million queries monthly with over 30 million active users. Impressive on paper, but the company has raised nearly $1.5 billion in funding, with valuations jumping from $500 million to $20 billion in just 18 months. Fundraising rounds roughly every two months suggests either extraordinary growth or growing desperation to prove the business model works. Here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: Perplexity is increasingly looking like what Silicon Valley dreads most a wrapper. The company initially had a competitive edge when it pioneered AI powered web search with real time information. But that advantage has evaporated faster than anyone expected. ChatGPT now has comprehensive web search capabilities, available to all users since February 2025. OpenAI didn\u2019t stop there they launched ChatGPT Atlas, a full browser with integrated AI search, directly competing with Perplexity\u2019s own Comet browser. Distribution is everything in tech, and this is where Perplexity\u2019s vulnerability becomes existential. OpenAI has hundreds of millions of users who already trust ChatGPT for everything from coding to creative writing. Adding web search wasn\u2019t building a new product; it was enhancing an existing habit. Google\u2019s advantage is even more crushing. With billions of daily users, Chrome integration, and deep Android ties, Google can push AI search capabilities to more people in a day than Perplexity might reach in a year. Perplexity, meanwhile, is stuck acquiring users one at a time and burning investor capital. Their attempt to buy Google Chrome for $34.5 billion a bid that went nowhere revealed just how desperate they are for distribution leverage. In July 2025, Perplexity announced a partnership with Bharti Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions to all 360 million Airtel customers for one year. The Pro subscription, normally \u20b917,000 annually, would be free through the Airtel Thanks app. On paper, this seemed like a distribution masterstroke. The reality? It\u2019s a textbook case of vanity metrics disguising fundamental problems. India is one of the world\u2019s most price sensitive markets. Netflix slashed its basic plan by 60% from \u20b9499 to \u20b9149 just to compete. Amazon Prime raised its fee from \u20b9179 to \u20b9299 and faced significant pushback. Even global giants struggle with conversions at these price points. Now imagine Perplexity\u2019s challenge: converting free users who got the service bundled with their telecom plan into paying subscribers at \u20b917,000 per year. Even if 10% of Airtel customers claim the offer 36 million users the numbers look great in pitch decks. But when those free trials expire in 2026, how many will renew? The harsh reality: when the free year ends, most users won\u2019t convert. They\u2019ll go back to ChatGPT (free), or Google (free). Perplexity will be left with vanity metrics that evaporate the moment payment is required. Perhaps most critically, OpenAI and Google own their foundational models. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and o3, Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 these represent complete control over the technology stack, from training to inference to continuous improvement. Perplexity builds on third party models. They\u2019re always playing catch-up, always dependent on others\u2019 innovation cycles, and always vulnerable to their suppliers becoming their competitors. When your core technology is rented, not owned, you\u2019re not building a sustainable competitive advantage you\u2019re building a temporary arbitrage opportunity that\u2019s about to close. The Silicon Valley founders and investors who voted Perplexity as most likely to fail weren\u2019t being cynical they were being realistic. The company proved the market existed but lacked the resources to defend it once the giants woke up. Perplexity\u2019s early lead has vanished. ChatGPT does web search just as well. Google has integrated AI into its core product. Both companies have deeper technology, wider distribution, stronger brands, and sustainable business models. Perplexity has a $20 billion valuation built on a crumbling foundation. The India strategy reveals the core problem. When you\u2019re giving away your premium product for free to hundreds of millions of users who historically won\u2019t pay for similar services, you\u2019re not building a business you\u2019re manufacturing metrics for the next funding round. The Airtel partnership isn\u2019t a distribution victory; it\u2019s a Hail Mary from a company that knows its window is closing. The AI bubble will eventually deflate. When it does, wrappers built on vanity metrics and unsustainable unit economics will be the first to go. Perplexity\u2019s 360 million \u201cfree users\u201d in India won\u2019t save them when those users discover that ChatGPT and Google do the same thing for free and they don\u2019t need to pay \u20b917,000 for the privilege. -- -- Learning Matrix Multiplication to understand GenAI better Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Rules Terms Text to speech","label":0}

Elon Musk Predicts Humans Could Live Forever In Tesla Optimus Robots Using \u2018Snapshots\u2019 of Their Minds. Musk has gone beyond being a parody of himself, and is now a cartoon character so scientifically implausible that he couldn\u2019t make it as a fourth-tier science fiction writer. If this is who many Americans consider today\u2019s Great Engineer \u2014 its Edison, Tesla, or even merely Ford \u2014 what\u2019s that say about the U.S. today? He seems to have a following for his stories about self driving cars and humanoid robots. The humanoid story could be about an eternal museum to remind future generations why the revolution happened. The headline is also untrue. \u201cHumans Could Live Forever\u201d? No, the humans still die.  However, I can imagine a future where people with the perfect personality for a particular task rent copies of their personality for robots. Musk, unironically probably, expresses the Mormonism concept of \u201cthe soul\u201d.  (expressed in the \u201cCaprica\u201d sci-fi tv serie). ie. if you take an amalgam of an infinite number of 3rd-party representations of you, that is you. oh boy, wait \u2019til.your immortal Optimus soul takes her first \u201cStar Trek\u201d transporter trip\u2026.existential dread awaits, lmao \u201cFaith, Souls, and Battlestar Galactica\u201d https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=dwCXSyB3vA8&t=300 Musk is just a few steps away from being a villain in any one of the 60s or 70s Saturday morning super hero cartoons. Musk is already at the level of lackey-antagonist in a John Carpenter (RIP) film.   Can\u2019t wait til he unveils his lizard face when his net worth hits $1t. You\u2019ll be waiting a long time. He\u2019ll never hit that number. I won\u2019t rule out a hyper inflated us dollar when we hit an AI\/COVID\/war fueled jackpot. In regards to hyperinflation, when everything in your country revolves around the almighty buck and then whammo it isn\u2019t worth anything-a well armed citizenry could get pretty uppity. I\u2019d wondered just how in the world a once mighty power that still wielded financial clout could go the hyperinflation route, as in the past you needed a prop of either coin or currency to make it happen, but our prop is the President!

Oh for the days of subeditors who would have made the India Today journalist rewrite it without errors. If we\u2019re lucky he\u2019ll still try. I am deeply confused by Japan\u2019s new militarism.  That is a country in no position to fight. They haven\u2019t made babies in a long time. They may have had 17% of global GDP in the 1980s, but now they\u2019re at around 3%. There is really nothing that they can do against China.  I suspect it\u2019s very much a Russia\/Ukraine situation. Perhaps Japan (and Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea) will be completely used up to the point of practically disappearing in order to \u201cweaken\u201d China. How very abhorrent. These are cultures with thousands of years of history, it\u2019s a big loss if they\u2019re brainwashed into sacrificing themselves for nothing. I had the same suspicion that you had. That Japan is being set up to be the Ukraine of the Pacific. Japan\u2019s new PM Sanae Takaichi is really doing a job here by burning down relations between Japan and China and you wonder if that was how she came to be selected to be the new PM. Of course she could do the same with Japanese \u2013 Russian relations as well because obviously what Japan really needs is more enemies. Same story with Korea.  Both countries have a slice of their Establishment who want to be \u201cbig man on campus\u201d.   Then toss in irrational distrust\/hatred of China (china \u201ccommunism\u201d).   Heck, Britain and France hated each other for centuries despite having ruling classes who were literally related to some degree. To paraphrase Milton, Better for Japan-Korea be a satrap for the US (with the illusion of equality) than be an overt junior partner to China or neutral. Of course, most of those people have spent tbeir entire professional life living of the gravy train of the US military\/think-tank circles Being related was a big part of the reason why England hated France: the other direction, I think, was much weaker.  Kings of England claimed the French throne until after Louis XVI lost his head, I believe. \u201cBig man on campus\u201d syndrome in Korea is more complicated than that in Japan: it tends to be directed at Japan as much as China, plus it gets mixed with a lot of confused mix of sentiment in the South vis a vis North.  (Ironically, the North is as wary of China as the South is of Japan).  Much harder to predict where they\u2019ll align.  What I can say is that South preferred align directly with US because of its issues with Japan and the North preferred USSR because of its China issues during the Cold War.  South\u2019s attempt at \u201cNordpolitik\u201d and North\u2019s attempt at dealing with US in the post Cold War era can also be seen in this light, too, but nobody really wants to actually \u201cfight\u201d their neighbors, either.  As Koreans say, Japan and China are both \u201cnear but distant\u201d lands. While the USA never seems to have a problem finding a local quisling willing to participate in the destabilization and destruction of their own country, Jolani, Machado, and Zelensky are some of the names that spring to mind, I\u2019d be surprised if there is a lever or a cassus belli that the US can find to manoeuvre stable and prosperous countries like Japan or South Korea into a solo fight against China. The Georgian reaction to being used as a disposable tool, i.e. \u201c(it\u2019s clear the Americans aren\u2019t actually going to come to our rescue so) we surrender\u201d, is still much more likely than the Ukrainian one, \u201c(it\u2019s clear the Americans aren\u2019t going to come to our rescue so) let\u2019s fight to the last Ukrainian.\u201d It\u2019s a few years now since I was professionally involved in that part of the world, and I happily yield to those with more recent on the ground experience. But we need to remember that after 1945 Japan was a profoundly anti-militarist country, and it was only under US pressure that Self-Defence Forces were established in 1954 as a consequence of the Korean War. For decades, the US link was an acutely sensitive political issue in Japan and it hasn\u2019t been resolved even today. The Japanese adopted a deliberate policy of attempted low-profile repair of their reputation after the Pacific War, which was fought, let\u2019s remember, largely in China. This involved a very low political profile, support of  international institutions and being a major overseas aid donor. But there was no quid pro quo, especially from China, which for decades expertly manipulated Japanese war guilt for political and financial purposes. And other Asian nations followed suit: every time a few words were changed in a history textbook, \u201cspontaneous\u201d riots would break out in the region. The result was that, in both theory and practice, any Japanese politician who spoke of, or prepared to do, things which would have been normal in virtually any other country in the world was coded as an extreme right-wing nationalist. This couldn\u2019t go on, and as early as 1989, a multi-authored book entitled A Japan that Can say \u201cNo\u201d caused a significant stir, with its argument that Japan needed far more independence from the United States, and to be able to function as a \u201cnormal\u201d state once again. (The same currents were noticeable in Korea, which began to move noticeably towards military independence in the 1990s.) This being Japan, of course, things happen slowly, but there\u2019s really nothing unexpected in this development: I\u2019ve been predicting it for a quarter of a century. Independent military power, and a defence and security policy which is allied to the US but independent of it, combined with a much more assertive foreign policy, aren\u2019t actually all that radical or even unusual. It\u2019s just that for generations the Japanese were, as they used to say \u201cnothing but an ATM for other nations,\u201d and now that they\u2019re doing their own thing everyone is surprised. I suppose it\u2019s not unlike what happened with Germany for us (although Italy seems to always get off lightly). I am always surprised though at how much modern culture from Japan and S. Korea make it to China, and it\u2019s a huge influence on them. Manga, anime, music, games, fashion and beauty and so on. And the Chinese make up a substantial diaspora in Japan, on top of it being a huge Chinese tourist destination (for good and ill).  I did see talk of flight cancellations. There has been some individual bad stories of attacks, and there is a lot of talking about militarising, but there is obviously some deeper connection here. And at least for younger people in China, Japan and South Korea have plenty of soft power, would it not be better utilising this a bit more. Historical wrongs were never addressed after WW2, General McArthur protected Japan from retribution. People all over East Asia have a grievance about this from their elders and still want Japan punished. China now has the power to do this as the US slides down the wrong side of history. They should keep their heads down. If Japan does move toward military independence, we should expect to see policy independence in relation to the US. Will the number of US bases be reduced? Will Japan have a changed relationship with China that does not conform to US priorities? There has been a sector of the US security establishment that has advocated for remilitarization of Japan, so the new policy might not be a sign of independence. Looks like loosing gen-Z anger in the streets against political foes is going to be a thing. Good luck finding the \u201coff\u201d switch. How will Sheinbaum respond? I\u2019m hoping that these Gen Z protests don\u2019t turn out to be like the Arab Spring protests of the 2010s \u2013 in being supported by western spooks.

Thank goodness Trump deep-sixed The Deep  State, and that we have moved foreign policy away from such banal things as resources like oil\u2026 It remains to be seen how it all develops.  And maybe more on down south of the border. And it just so happens, ahead this and Venezuela, the increased border lock downs, ICE\/military patrols, and detention center$ that just so happened to occur.  And that doesn\u2019t discount the political motives for this ahead of elections in the USA. It can\u2019t be doubted some of the frustration is real and it can\u2019t be doubted the opportunists will come out of the woodwork. We will see\u2026 Except it\u2019s not real. The US is once again trying to stir up a color revolution as it has in countless other countries. The big difference is now these are more likely to fail than succeed.  One more consequence of a multi-polar world. \u201cHow will Sheinbaum respond?\u201d Indeed.  She still has extremely high approval ratings in Mexico. Not real. \u201cGenZ\u201d is not a concept used in Mexico, and if it was, it would not be used for such a middle aged crowd. Furthermore, any news article using \u201cgenZ\u201d in its headline and omitting Sheinbaum stating that these groups were financed from abroad and organized through bots, is part of this staged event. GenZ unrest is the new color revolution. The \u201cblack skull\u201d anime character flags made an appearance. Flag indeed\u2026 I would say it\u2019s part real, no? Agree that those in the color revolution business will tap this resource and is likely in play here. The old political parties in Mexico retain their paid gangs of drunks, petty criminals, cops, and agitators, as do the Americans. All were visible throwing rocks and bottles in the Zocalo. \u2018Gen Z\u2019 isn\u2019t even a concept in Mexico. La Presidenta, like Maduro, is solidly safe. \u2013 \u2018Why the chemtrail conspiracy theory lingers and grows \u2013 and why Tucker Carlson is talking about it\u2019 \u2013 The Conversation When I read that the author \u201cwas a communications researcher who studied conspiracy theories,\u201d I was sure that what followed would be a regurgitation of the usual academic spiel. They always follow the same pattern. Choose an obviously ridiculous theory. Explain how it could not possibly be true, and that only people who don\u2019t understand science or journalism or Karl Popper could believe it. Then explain how such beliefs help such ignorant people cope with their fears of an uncertain world. And somewhere in there you insert the main point of such an article: \u201cAlthough there are liberal chemtrail believers, aversion to uncertainty might explain why the theory has become so popular with Carlson\u2019s audience: Researchers have long argued that authoritarian, right-wing beliefs have a similar underlying structure.\u201d It\u2019s the old \u201cauthoritarian Republican brain\u201d theorem. Not that there aren\u2019t authoritarian Republican brains that believe in the chemtrail conspiracy. But one of the comforting beliefs of educated liberals is that it is mainly uneducated authoritarian types who believe in \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d And they have research like this to back them up.  Right before reading this I read the panel discussion \u2018Why Doesn\u2019t Anyone Trust the Media.\u2019 There, the Dean of the Columbia Journalism School \u2013 also a staff writer for The New Yorker \u2013 said this in response to that question: \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a correlation between the mistakes the media has made and the distrust the public feels toward it. Here\u2019s what I mean: every one of us has been in a conversation in which someone says, \u201cWhat the media won\u2019t tell you .\u2009.\u2009.\u2009\u201d There are certain sentences that, when you hear the first half, you should immediately ignore the second half\u2014and that\u2019s one of them. The reason is that, 99 percent of the time, when someone says, \u201cThe media won\u2019t tell you this,\u201d it\u2019s because the thing they\u2019re talking about is either not true or is not true in the way they conceive it to be. Or they have a pet conspiracy theory that no one else shares, and the media won\u2019t validate their viewpoint.\u201d See what I mean? Let\u2019s call it the \u201cliberal brain\u201d theory: the psychological comfort provided by the belief that only the uneducated dolts see the world differently from highly educated, scientifically sound journalists like us. There is a lot to say about such claims. But a simple response to such champions of Truth and debunkers of Conspiracy Theories these days is always: \u201cGreat. Now do Russiagate.\u201d In a way, they are mirror images of each other, no?  Russiagate is a crazy conspiracy theory that only liberals believe in, in a manner of speaking.   Personally, I think there are two types of \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d The first kind is actually not \u201cRussiagate type,\u201d but people in basements with too much time on their hands.  They actually care about the details and how they fit together.  They look at the facts and know what\u2019s going on at the granular level that few others do\u2026but they often have certain worldviews that they fit all the facts into that are probably wrong and farfetched.  I\u2019d put most good investigative journalists into this camp.  Let me emphasize that I think this sort of conspiracy theory is actually a good thing\u2026if you only pay attention to the facts they bring up and not necessarily their conclusions. Then there\u2019s \u201cmass delusion\u201d type which I don\u2019t think is really a conspiracy theory as such\u2013like Russiagate\u2013but a sociocultural phenomenon.  We hate X, we think they are up to no good, so we are looking for reasons to justify hating X.  So someone publicly says Obama is a secret Muslim and Trump is a Russian mole.  Facts be damned, we hated them anyways and we can now \u201cexplain\u201d why we hate them. Re: 5 issues at the center of the MTG-Trump spat If you were beamed down to earth from another planet, all five of those issues would sound very reasonable in terms of Ms. Taylor-Greene being the sane person. We\u2019ve entered the \u201cMAGA eats itself\u201d phase. People like Taylor-Greene, Thomas Massie, Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson are still sticking with the idea of America First which is why Trump has targeted all four of them and wants them gone. For Trump it is a case of \u2018L\u2019MAGA, c\u2019est moi!\u2019 but fewer and fewer people believed him anymore. When he said in that recent interview that the reason he was bringing in so many foreigners was because Americans just can\u2019t do those jobs, it was insulting as hell and would have lost him even more support. Good thing that there are no elections within the next fifty weeks. Oh wait\u2026. This has been fascinating.  Look for MTG to prevail, eventually, as the perfectly sane side in this fight.  Friends in Georgia politics who know her have always thought she was an honest truth-teller, as she sees it, without fear or favor as the saying goes.  Unlike all other Georgia politicians, she has no fear of the president, and her constituents in NW Georgia will stand by her. According to Track AIPAC, she is the only US Senator or Representative from Georgia with zero on her AIPAC tab.  Her complete take from other lobbyists is essentially zero. I, for one, would not look to MTG as being sane in this fight. While her stand is important vis-a-vis the Trump\/MAGA original stances and demands, this is a huge distraction from the damage Trump has done to the economy and the political landscape, where political beef should be flexed. In every one of her objections, she is for a right-wing solution, which is to say a slightly more moderate stance than Trump and his crazies. Applaudable only if you earn in the high six digits. Further, what will she do? Abandon the Republicans? Join the Democrats? Form an independent movement? With whom- Carlson, Owens, maybe the Tech bros? I smell grandstand, with MTG\u2019s marvelous nose for wind direction. KLG is in Georgia, so only has contacts but also has been getting more detail about her via local press than makes its way to the national rags. MTG has chosen to shoot at a king. If she succeeds, as in she survives in playing a leading part in turning Trump into a lame duck, she does win a lot of power. She is not required to  do anything with that. That is your demand, not any promise she has made. Americans have this weird need to annoint saviors and then trash talk them.

Representative Lisa McClain spent 10 years working for American Express before she was elected to represent the state of Michigan. Chairman James Comer was a Kentucky farmer.

Re the Chemtrails: Living in Boulder, CO, I had a coffee shop acquaintance who was for some time the head \u2018Climate Change Physicist\u2019 at NOAA, also in Boulder.

Part B:What sort of plant is Jim Ferguson on X to make such obscenely false statements regarding Mexico? And to what end?? I have no idea. A normally sound reader sent it to me but it was pretty obvious that at best the comment was over its skis. But what that suggests to me is that Twitter is promoting this sort of thing. To add: I just spoke to an economist who has been an adviser to various Mexican governments over time on topics like how not to fall prey to the IMF. He says this is not a Mexico City flash in the pan, that there are demonstrations in ~40 cities. I knew cloud seeding was a fairly old idea, but I didn\u2019t realize so much was done about this even in\/by US.  (Apparently, there was even an attempt to use it to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail during VN!) https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cloud_seeding When Covid happened all the jets were grounded.  Consequently there were no chemtrails for the duration of the grounding.  As I recall some climate scientists around DC took the opportunity to measure radiational heating and cooling.  Their findings determined that in the absence of chemtrails, the increase in radiational heating was non-trivial.

According to Wiki, \u201cThe UK was a key asset for the EU in the fields of foreign affairs and defense given that the UK was (with France) one of the EU\u2019s two major military powers, and had significant intelligence capabilities, soft power and a far reaching diplomatic network. Without the UK, EU foreign policy could be less influential.\u201d And while the UK Navy is no match for the US, it is, nonetheless, capable of global operations. Second, the EU needs to kiss and make up with Russia and if that requires new leadership within the EU, so be it. The EU is no match for the Russian military but Russia is not a threat. The EU has the world\u2019s third largest economy and Russia has resources and important connections with China and India. The EU might want to consider encouraging the UK to rejoin the EU.  Very unlikely to happen. Just on the UK end, despite whatever polls may be set up to demonstrate about Brexit remorse\u2019s extent, the reality is: \u2013 [1] at the very least a sizable enough chunk of the British population from every part the political spectrum except the purely neoliberal is obdurate enough about never rejoining the EU to fight; [2] almost a decade later, the majority of that population has moved on; [3] and even former remainers are changing their minds as the collapse of the France-Germany engine of the EU economy gathers speed, the bill for the Ukraine war looms, right wing governments get closer to power across the continent, and Brussels is demanding self-destructive limits on trade relations with China which simply aren\u2019t in British interests.* *e.g. the City is by far the largest renminbi trading center offshore of China, the UK has no mainstream auto manufacturing industry to protect so Chinese EVs \u2013including a hundred double-decker buses \u2014 are all over London, and so on.

Stoller is at it again with his reflections on the Epstein scandal.  https:\/\/www.thebignewsletter.com\/p\/larry-summers-and-the-blast-radius \u201cThis moment is a good illustration of the utter disgrace facing our institutional fabric. And it has fostered some self-reflection on my part, regarding why I didn\u2019t take this sordid behavior more seriously. At some level, I just could not fathom that these men would act the way they did. It just couldn\u2019t really be that obvious and bad, could it? But yes, it was. I don\u2019t have a full answer for why we didn\u2019t take this scandal more seriously. I think there\u2019s a way in which we coded ourselves as \u201ctechnocrats\u201d to avoid factional disputes, instead of fully embracing the moral reform that truly animates the populist framework. After all, going up against Summers in this particular way means that Barack Obama tried to make the close affiliate of a sex trafficker the most powerful economic actor in the world. And that was really hard to suggest in Democratic circles without being pushed out as some sort of quack. The truth is, from the Abundance movement to the pro-monopoly financial and economic group to the AI oligarchs, operates a class of human beings who feel completely insulated from any normal sense of political obligation to other Americans. Sam Bankman-Fried was a billionaire fraud and a deviant quack but he poured cash into an elite cult, Effective Altruism. EA turned into the creepy elite AI world at Anthropic, as well as Abundance, a New York Times-driven movement that is right now making a huge play to dominate politics, free from accountability from their association with him. Larry Summers is the legacy of decades of this sordid behavior. It\u2019s not that these people are deviants, or have engaged in shameful personal behavior, or have abused power. These things happen, all the time, in every society. It\u2019s that these men were so cavalier that they could get away with what they were doing, because they realized no one in elite circles could even imagine they might be as gross as they actually are. They bet on our snobbery, on how we looked down on QAnon conspiracy theorists, and they were right. Hopefully, we will stop seeing our two-tiered justice system, and this insane elite world or insulated weirdos, as a conspiracy theory beneath our attention. It\u2019s not. We are living in the world they\u2019ve created, and it\u2019s a world we must see clearly, so we can take it apart and restore some sense of moral order.\u201d IMHO most of us don\u2019t want to think about the sex lives of not attractive older men.

Re: \u201cThe moment the postcolonial domination of Africa finally ended The Globe and Mail\u201d If this all raises questions about how the French legacy in West Africa has turned so sour, one must look toward the Sahel for the most worrisome outcomes. There, in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, France has been totally repudiated. The Sahelian countries are in the grips of some of the world\u2019s most violent and persistent attacks by radical Islamic insurgencies. The main actors are shadowy regional affiliates of Al-Qaeda and Islamic State. Violence by insurgencies in the Sahel accounted for roughly half of the terrorism deaths worldwide in 2024, according to a survey by the Institute for Economics and Peace. What the author fails to mention is that the governing military leaders of the three Sahel countries of the AES alliance assert that the Islamic insurgents in question are funded and directly supported by France and the USA. As for their landlocked status, one of the projects they envision for their future is a cross-north-African railroad line running from Senegal in the West to Sudan in the east. The prospect of this project may well be one of the drivers of the current conflict in Sudan. At the intersection of Climate, Capitalism, and the exploitation of women in India.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"When you're in the market for a new automobile, you might be seeking high-tech features like wireless charging pads, heated and ventilated seats, and automatic emergency braking. Other people prefer high-performing sports cars that can deliver plenty of speed and power. However, you may want to pay attention to another key category: cars that are most likely to be stolen. When you own a vehicle that has a higher-than-average likelihood of being targeted by thieves, you're more likely to suffer not just inconveniences but also pay a higher financial price. If you'd like to reduce the risk of thieves targeting your new car, you might want to skip one iconic American car in particular, the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1. According to the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), insurance claims for stolen cars from model years 2022 through 2024 showed the Camaro ZL1 is 39 times more likely to have a claim compared to the average vehicle. Meanwhile, the regular Chevrolet Camaro is about 13 times more likely to have a stolen car insurance claim\u00a0than the average. Despite this, the Camaro has enjoyed a significant sales resurgence recently, increasing more than 100% from 2022 to 2023\u00a0after GM announced it would stop making the muscle car. Considering the Chevrolet Camaro is also one of the worst cars for retirees because of poor reliability, you might want to skip this model entirely. After learning of the significantly higher likelihood of thieves targeting the Camaro ZL1, the HLDI took a closer look at historical data related to stolen Camaros. Based on information from the organization, and news reports, thieves are cloning the key fob for newer Camaros \u2014 making it easier to steal the vehicle. Thieves target muscle cars more frequently than other vehicles as they're generally looking for automobiles with higher-than-average horsepower and accompanying price tags. The 2024 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 has an MSRP in excess of $75,000 and a maximum horsepower of 650,\u00a0whereas an average mid-sized vehicle cost\u00a0about $33,500\u00a0in 2024, with an average horsepower range of between 180 and 200. The HLDI report did not distinguish between full vehicle thefts and partial thefts for parts. However, thieves do tend to target the Camaro ZL1 in an effort to resell the entire vehicle, or strip it for parts. Some of the most expensive car parts thieves are likely to steal and target\u00a0include\u00a0unique components like the Camaro's engine, transmission, and suspension.\u00a0Some of the highest levels of insurance claims for stolen Camaros have occurred in California, Tennessee, Mississippi, Maryland, and Texas, so you should be on higher alert in these areas.\u00a0To protect your Camaro from thieves, consider a steering wheel lock, kill switch, or even air tags. Some Camaro owners even keep their key fobs in Faraday pouches to block their signals. Many factors contribute to the cost of insurance for your vehicle, including the frequency of thefts for certain models, as well as your driving record and even credit history. If you own a Camaro ZL1, you will probably end up paying more to insure your vehicle because of the statistics that show it's a frequent target for thieves. Plus, if you live in an area that has higher-than-average rates for stolen vehicles, you'll also probably pay higher rates, even if you have never made a claim for theft on your Camaro. Per DeNooyer Chevrolet, estimates place insurance for the Camaro ZL1 at almost $2,000 annually, which is roughly $500 more than the average for any automobile. If law enforcement officials recover your stolen motor vehicle, your insurance company should pay for any damages that occurred to the vehicle \u2013\u00a0as long as you have comprehensive coverage. Your comprehensive coverage should also give you a payout if law enforcement fails to recover the vehicle. This typically means the insurer will pay the actual cash value (ACV) for the vehicle at the time it was stolen, which takes into account its mileage, age, and condition. However, you will still have to pay any deductible included in your policy in either situation, with the average deductible for car insurance policies sitting at $500, according to Kelley Blue Book. If you only have liability insurance coverage for the vehicle, your insurer will not cover any expense related to your stolen car, regardless of whether it's recovered.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        Tim Cook might be getting ready to hang up his hat as Apple CEO. That\u2019s according to the Financial Times, which reported on Saturday that the tech giant was stepping up succession planning with expectations that Tim Cook could resign from his position as soon as next year. Cook, who will be turning 66 next year, took over Apple from founder Steve Jobs and led the company through trillions of dollars worth of record market valuation spikes and a fair share of\u00c2\u00a0controversies\u00c2\u00a0for over 14 years. Many are looking ahead to who could be the latest chief to lead the company after Cook leaves. For years, many names have been floated around, from Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi (famous for his presentations and his full head of hair) to Greg Joswiak, senior vice president of worldwide marketing, and Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer who was the top of that list before he resigned from his post earlier this year. Now the Financial Times reports that the frontrunner is John Ternus, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of hardware engineering. Ternus, aged 50, is currently the youngest top executive at Apple and has been with the tech giant for roughly 24 years. His name was first brought into the spotlight in succession conversations after a Bloomberg report from 2024 claimed that Cook thought Ternus could \u201cgive a good presentation.\u201d That report noted that Ternus is \u201cvery mild-mannered, never puts anything into an email that is controversial, and is a very reticent decision-maker,\u201d according to Bloomberg\u2019s anonymous source close to the executive team. He has also increasingly played a more central role at Apple events, from unveiling Apple\u2019s first in-house silicon chip, the M1, in 2020, to announcing the highly anticipated iPhone Air earlier this year. When compared to Cook\u2019s operations-heavy background, Ternus is more engineering-focused. Equipped with both a bachelor\u2019s in engineering and an MBA, Tim Cook rose through the ranks at Apple as chief operating officer, focusing on sales and supply chain management. Ternus, on the other hand, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 with a major in mechanical engineering. He worked on virtual reality headsets as an engineer at Virtual Research Systems before joining Apple\u2019s product design team in 2001. He worked his way up the company\u2019s hardware team to a leadership position in 2013 and got promoted to lead all of hardware engineering in 2022. AirPods, Macs, iPads, iPhones, you name it, Ternus has had a hand in their production. Ternus has the potential to be a breath of fresh air to some Apple fanatics who have blamed Cook for a perceived slowdown of innovation. Under Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple has released tons of new products, but the upgrades to said products have been deemed incremental rather than revolutionary, and even boring at times. The company has also been criticized for the failed launch of Apple Vision Pro and its self-professed failure to catch up to competitors in the AI race, further ignited in light of the delayed launch of AI-enhanced Siri. Bringing in an engineer-first executive who has taken part in almost all of Apple\u2019s most significant product launches in the past 24 years could, perhaps, help address some of these failings. Correction 11\/17: A previous version of this post stated that Tim Cook is Apple\u2019s third CEO. Six people held the position before Cook took over in 2011.

LFP\u2019s appeal in the EV sector is clear: lower cost compared to batteries based on nickel and cobalt chemistries, low toxicity and good safety due to their superior thermal stability. Tesla\u2019s use of LFP in some of its standard-range models signalled the beginning of a broader trend, now accelerating across Western markets. LFP batteries are also proving a popular choice for renewable energy storage. However, barriers to commercialisation of LFP technology remain. With the core chemistry now in the public domain, the focus of intellectual property protection has shifted. Companies are securing patents around secondary innovation, with a focus on enhancing energy density, improving safety, fast-charging capabilities and reducing costs. For example, CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited) has developed and commercialised cell-to-pack technology with its Quilin battery. BYD and Tesla, amongst others, also own patents relating to LFP technology. Such proprietary engineering technology will still deliver competitive advantage. Trade secrets and manufacturing know-how are also becoming increasingly valuable. Freedom-to-operate (FTO) analysis therefore remains critical for market entrants. Whilst the primary patents have expired, a dense web of secondary patents, covering additives, coatings, and production methods, still poses infringement risks. Firms entering the LFP space need to engage in increasingly nuanced FTO due diligence to navigate this residual IP thicket and minimise their risk of being on the receiving end of an infringement lawsuit. Aside from the patent landscape, there are other structural and strategic barriers for exploitation of LFP technology: In short, the LFP patent cliff is not the end of the story. Rather it is the beginning of a new chapter in EV innovation, where competitive advantage can still be obtained through further technological developments. For IP professionals and EV strategists, the task is to develop protection strategies that reflect this new paradigm. Effective trade secret and patent protection will be essential components of this, as well as the formation of strategic partnerships.\u00a0  This information is for general information purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

This crossover is widely viewed in technical analysis as a bearish signal because it reflects weakening short-term momentum relative to the longer trend.  However, this can also act as a possible positive signal. Bitcoin is currently down about 25% from its October all time high around $126,000 and this correction has been ongoing for roughly 41 days. Despite the reputation of the death cross, this would be the fourth occurrence of the death cross since the cycle started back in 2023 and each previous instance has aligned with a major local bottoms. In September 2023, bitcoin bottomed near $25,000, in August 2024 during the yen carry trade unwind it found support around $49,000, and then in April 2025, during uncertainty around President Trump\u2019s tariff policy, BTC bottomed below $75,000. In the current setup, bitcoin has fallen to $94,000 and in all four prior instances the market put in its low just before the death cross formed, raising the question of whether the same pattern may be unfolding again.  This current drawdown is less severe than the April correction, when bitcoin dropped below $75,000 during the tariff related turmoil.  The April correction was both deeper and longer than the current correction, with bitcoin falling about 30% from the January peak near $109,000 and spending around 79 days trending lower before bottoming in the first week of April. With current selloff of 25% and 41 days, perhaps further downside still possible. However, the broader environment now includes the end of the United States government shutdown on Nov. 12. The closest comparison is the 2019 shutdown, when bitcoin fell more than 9% five days after the government reopened on Jan. 25 2019.  It took until Feb. 9 2019 for bitcoin to recover, approximately two weeks.  This time around bitcoin has already dropped as much as 10% since the reopening. The question now is whether the same pattern will play out again.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":" \u00a9 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.  Massive short positions by top Hyperliquid whales, combined with surging fear and panic across social media, suggest the crypto market might be inching toward a turning point. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) fall below the crucial $100,000 mark last week triggered a wave of short positions from massive whales on Hyperliquid. The largest Hyperliquid whales, with over $50 million in digital assets, have been heavily betting on a further crypto market correction, according to data from Coinglass.     Hyperliquid\u2019s \u201cLeviathans\u201d dominating the market with short positions | Source: Coinglass Data shows that the so-called Hyperliquid \u201cLeviathans\u201d \u2013 referring to a mythical sea monster to illustrate their size \u2013 currently have $3.44 billion in open positions, comprising $1.15 billion in longs and $2.29 billion in shorts, on the perpetual exchange. These whales, with a size of over $50 million, are the only traders betting heavily on a deeper crypto market fall. According to Coinglass data, the traders\u2019 sentiment rises as their sizes decline; the most bullish traders are the so-called \u201cshrimps,\u201d which have a wallet size of up to $250. Following Bitcoin\u2019s fall below $95,000 on Friday, Nov. 14, the sense of fear, uncertainty, and doubt among the crypto community skyrocketed. According to an X post by Santiment, the Bitcoin social dominance spiked to four-month highs, a level last seen in mid-July. \ud83d\udcc8 Though not a guaranteed crypto bottom signal, probabilities of a market reversal greatly increases when social dominance for Bitcoin surges. During Friday's dip below $95K, discussion rates hit a 4-month high, signaling severe retail panic & FUD. \ud83d\udd17 https:\/\/t.co\/uzhzZ7WgFs pic.twitter.com\/qn8HFmy3jv \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 16, 2025  The surge in Bitcoin\u2019s social dominance was followed by retail panic and FUD, which consequently triggered a price correction, from $120,000 to $112,000 within two weeks, for the leading asset. Currently, Bitcoin is seeing similar sentiment, and Santiment is hinting at \u201cprobabilities of a market reversal.\u201d One of the reasons behind the market-wide correction is the massive outflows from Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds in the US. Coinspeaker reported that spot BTC ETFs recorded a net outflow of $1.8 billion last week. According to a Barron\u2019s report, investors are shifting away from riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies, due to concerns about shaky economies and high valuations in tech and AI stocks. However, this cannot be a guaranteed bottom signal for the crypto market. When large whales go against the broader market and the crowd wanders in uncertainty, history suggests something big might be brewing.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"OS\/2 for Mach 20 remains a tiny footnote in Microsoft\u2019s massive legacy  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  In the history of Microsoft\u2019s successes, from Windows to its expansive suite of office software, lies an almost forgotten misstep which stands as a lesson in technological timing. The \u201cworst-selling Microsoft product of all time\u201d is not an obscure game or unused application, but rather a specialized version of an operating system designed for hardware very few people owned. Known as \u201cOS\/2 for Mach 20,\u201d it sold only eleven copies, eight of which were reportedly returned. In the mid to late 1980s, PC hardware was evolving rapidly, with faster processors and richer graphics reshaping what computers could do for business users. For companies still adapting to the digital era, replacing entire systems was costly, and Microsoft\u2019s Mach 10 and later Mach 20 expansion cards were conceived as solutions to this problem. They promised to give older PCs new life by adding faster processors and extra memory through a plug-in upgrade rather than a full replacement. The Mach 20, with its 80286 CPU and expandable memory options, seemed an attractive compromise between cost and performance. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite that promise, it remained limited by older bus architecture and expensive to implement. At the time, the market was already moving toward newer machines that required no such workaround. Businesses that once hesitated to invest in new computers found themselves more inclined to buy fresh hardware than gamble on complex retrofits. Microsoft\u2019s decision to release a dedicated version of OS\/2 for the Mach 20 compounded the problem. OS\/2 itself, developed alongside IBM, was intended to replace DOS and rival Windows as the future of computing. The Mach 20 edition, however, required specific hardware to run, shrinking its potential user base to a handful of enthusiasts. Predictably, sales were dismal. Only a few units ever reached customers, making it one of the most obscure releases in Microsoft\u2019s long catalogue. The Mach 20 and its OS\/2 variant disappeared into obscurity, but its story remains relevant - as its failure shows how even a technology giant can misjudge the balance between innovation and practicality.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. After two decades of breeding what the Times of London once called the \u201cRolls-Royce of turkey,\u201d Paul Kelly wanted to learn from experts with generations of knowledge in America, where turkey farming originated. But once the Briton arrived in 2003, and after spending several weeks visiting turkey farms across Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, Kelly was \u201camazed\u201d to find no farmer or butchery maintained the American traditions, including dry-plucking and hanging, that have set the Essex, England-based KellyBronze apart.  Then again, when a frozen American Butterball costs about a $1 a pound and you\u2019re asking customers to pay around $15 a pound\u2014or nearly $500 for a 32-lb. turkey\u2014high quality has to come with more than a high price. \u201cI thought, it's almost impertinent for an Englishman to take turkeys to America,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cBut there's an opportunity there. I started looking, and we took it big.\u201d  Kelly, 62, is now the owner of the only USDA-approved turkey plant in the U.S. that dry-plucks and hangs its birds, which many believe creates crispier skin and better flavor. Since purchasing 130 acres in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Crozet, Virginia a decade ago, Kelly has opened America\u2019s first newly built turkey hatchery in years.  KellyBronze, which sells its turkeys at Eataly and other high-end retailers across America, had 2024 revenue of $28 million. About 4% of that comes from the U.S., but Kelly expects that to be 25% within three years as he increases production in Virginia\u2014and he is aiming for annual revenue will hit $80 million by 2028.  Founded in 1971 by Kelly\u2019s parents, Derek and Mollie, KellyBronze is 100% family-owned and has never taken any private investment, though there have been many offers over the years. The business has grown steadily for the past six decades with little debt, and it currently has none. \u201cI have slept at night knowing that every decision we made, we could afford to make, rather than hoping it worked,\u201d says Kelly, who admits that the business is challenging as the bulk of revenue comes in November, December and January. \u201cBut, in America, bang, we bought the farm, we built the plant, not having sold one turkey. We were taking risks but risks we could afford.\u201d Kelly acknowledges the high price of his turkeys can be a \u201cproblem\u201d but he is quick to point out that his birds are also three times the age of the typical frozen turkey, and lose 3% of their weight during hanging, and it\u2019s all done by hand, which increases labor costs.  \u201cPeople aren't buying it to save money, are they?\u201d asks Kelly. \u201cThe sales of amazing wines and the best champagnes go through the roof at Thanksgiving in America, the same as here at Christmas. Not everyone can afford it, but for those that can, it's there.\u201d In the U.K, KellyBronze supplies high-end butchers and retailers like Harrods and Selfridges. The Royal Family as well as chef and restaurateur Gordon Ramsay have also supported the brand for years.  In addition to Kelly\u2019s 130 acres in Virginia, the family owns 90 acres across Scotland and England, where it rents another 140 acres. There are also now 13 British farmers raising turkeys for KellyBronze, including British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who started raising a flock five years ago, after spending 25 years as a customer. Oliver calls KellyBronze \u201cthe turkey equivalent of Wagyu beef or Pata Negra ham\u2014simply the best of its kind.\u201d \u201cI became a turkey farmer not out of necessity, but to support an extraordinary artisan family and their craft,\u201d Oliver tells Forbes. \u201cThe Kelly family are a shining example of what\u2019s right in British farming. They brought back values and methods that were nearly lost to history.\u201d Now, after more than 50 years in business, KellyBronze is finally ready to feast on  America\u2019s high-end turkey market. \u201cWe are never going to be a Butterball. We are never going to be big,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cWe are a small niche player and we just want to be producing the best possible turkey we can for Thanksgiving.\u201d Kelly\u2019s parents bought a small farm the year he was born in 1963. His father worked at a big poultry company and after many years he left so the family could start their own turkey business in 1971 when Kelly was 8 years old. Back then, the British turkey industry was producing what was known as \u201cNew York Dressed\u201d birds because, as Kelly explains, \u201cthe whole tradition of what we do came from America.\u201d When Kelly returned to the farm after graduating from an agricultural college attached to Scotland\u2019s Glasgow University in 1983, he pushed his family to take their farming to the next level. In 1984, he changed the family\u2019s breed from a white Wrolstad turkey that originated in Oregon to \u201cthe old traditional bronze breed.\u201d  He also started bringing the birds outside where they could roam, dust-bathe, and peck in peace. The Kellys also started dry-plucking and then hanging the birds\u2014at first for 7 days and now for 2 to 3 weeks. It was an expensive approach to a type of poultry that is traditionally quite cheap. \u201cIt was a race to the bottom,\u201d he recalls of British turkey farmers at the time. \u201cWe were the laughingstock of the industry.\u201d  That first year, the Kellys had an annual revenue around $300,000 (or about $930,000 today). Despite the slow sales, the family doubled down. In 1987, the Kellys bought a former dairy farm for $90,000 at 10% interest over 10 years. The buildings and 5 acres of grasslands (where Kelly later built a house and now lives) helped the family expand its breeding and allowed them to build a small processing facility. \u201cIt was a huge step for us but gave us the space to supply the increased demand that came,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cIt proved to be the best investment ever.\u201d By 1990, \u201cthe butchers were phoning us,\u201d and by 1994, sales had skyrocketed to $1.2 million. After adding local farmers to their network throughout the 1990s, in 2001, KellyBronze was appointed by then-Prince Charles\u2019 organic food brand Duchy Originals to farm its Christmas turkeys.  In 2003, revenue reached $3.8 million and Kelly was ready to broaden his understanding of traditional techniques and learn from farms in the United States, where it all began. The first turkeys are said to have been imported to England back in 1526, when a trader named William Strickland brought back six birds he obtained from Native Americans during an early voyage across the Atlantic. Eating turkey at Christmastime became fashionable at King Henry VIII\u2019s court, cementing the turkey\u2019s place as a symbol of festivity. The birds then traveled back across the Atlantic, as the colonists at Jamestown in Virginia had shipments of domesticated turkeys arriving on boats from England.  And while no turkey was ever formally recorded at the Pilgrims\u2019 first Thanksgiving with the Wampanoag in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621, they were plentiful in the region. Benjamin Franklin once famously called the turkey \u201ca much more respectable bird\u201d than the bald eagle and \u201ca true original Native of America. Eagles have been found in all countries, but the turkey was peculiar to ours.\u201d He even described turkey as \u201ca bird of courage.\u201d Kelly says the stock he is raising in Virginia is inspired by \u201cthe original traditional turkey that was produced in America hundreds of years ago with the Pilgrims.\u201d  In 2014, he brought his turkeys back to the continent they originated on, buying his farm for $750,000, and spending another $2.75 million on infrastructure upgrades\u2014with help from a $1 million bank loan that\u2019s already been paid off. KellyBronze is now producing 4,600 turkeys in the U.S. this year, and Kelly opened his own hatchery in 2018, which has the capacity to produce 15,000 \u201cpoults\u201d every month. It\u2019s currently at 5,500 per year and Kelly wants to open another on the East Coast and one on the West Coast.  Doing business in America isn\u2019t easy. For one, sales are super lumpy\u201495% of Kelly\u2019s U.S. sales occur at Thanksgiving\u2014and KellyBronze might get hit with tariffs from the Trump Administration's trade war. Kelly shipped turkey eggs from the U.K. to his U.S. hatchery just before the tariff start date. Next season, if the tariffs continue, the eggs could face charges of a few thousand dollars. \u201cMy dream would be for people to order it in January or February of every year. They put their name on one and we'll grow it to order,\u201d says Kelly, whose son, Toby, 31, and daughter Ella, 28, are now running parts of KellyBronze. \u201cThe potential is huge.\u201d","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Daimler is a name many recognize as a powerhouse in the car manufacturing business. It has been associated with some of the best-known car brands in the world, including Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz) and Chrysler (DaimlerChrysler), before ultimately rebranding as Daimler AG from 2007 through 2022 when it was renamed Mercedes-Benz Group. This followed\u00a0the decision to\u00a0split the Mercedes-Benz luxury car unit from the truck-making division, Daimler Truck, which had been\u00a0established as a subsidiary of Daimler AG in 2019.\u00a0 Despite being a relatively young company in its current form, Daimler Truck controls several brands that collectively make it one of the largest manufacturers of heavy vehicles. But not every Daimler-operated brand is into semi truck production. Setra, for one, is a bus manufacturer known for models like the ComfortClass S 407 and Setra S 515 HD. It's similar with Thomas Built Buses, which, as the name suggests, produces models such as the Thomas Minotour school bus. And while brands like Rizon specialize in truck manufacturing, the company only makes Class 4 and Class 5 medium-duty electric trucks. With that in mind, here are the Daimler-owned brands that are actually in Class 8 truck production.\u00a0 Freightliner is the largest semi truck manufacturer in the U.S., holding 33.4% of market share as of October 2025, according to data from Transport Topics. But it didn't just stumble upon success by chance. Based in Portland, Oregon, Freightliner started as the truck-manufacturing division of Consolidated Freightways (CF). The company was the brainchild of then-CF president Leland James, who sought to build an aluminum cab-over-engine truck, as he believed that using aluminum instead of traditional steel would reduce weight and enable drivers to tackle climbs better when driving up a steep hill. The company was known as Freightways Manufacturing at its inception in 1940 but was renamed Freightliner Corporation in 1942, the same year it gave us the industry's first all-aluminum cab, the Model 600. However, like many auto manufacturers at the time, the corporation turned to making ship and aircraft components to support the World War II effort. After the war, Freightliner moved truck production from Salt Lake City, Utah, to a new manufacturing facility in Portland, Oregon, where it started building factory order trucks based on customers' specifications. However, it wasn't until 1950 that Freightliner sold its first vehicle outside Consolidated Freightways, to the Portland-based forklift manufacturer Hyster Company.\u00a0 Freightliner saw further success thanks to increasing demand and remained a CF-owned brand until 1981, when it was purchased by Daimler-Benz AG. With Daimler's backing, Freightliner was able to find new customers and bolster sales for its vehicles over the next 10 years, becoming the top-selling heavy-duty truck manufacturer in North America by 1992. It also acquired several brands over the years, including the heavy truck division of Ford Motor Company, which it rebranded as Sterling Trucks\u00a0\u2013 one of the many ventures Ford has sold over the years. After World War I, Gottlieb Daimler's Daimler Motoren-Gesellschaft (also known as DMG) and Carl Benz's Benz & Cie.\u00a0experienced financial difficulties due to post-war economic changes. And so the two companies decided to collaborate, beginning life as a joint venture in 1924 and formally merging in 1926\u00a0to fully exploit economies of scale. That decision resulted in the formation of Daimler-Benz AG, which marketed its vehicles under the Mercedes-Benz name.\u00a0 True to the purpose for which it was founded, Mercedes-Benz has since become a popular brand. Today, its truck manufacturing arm ranks among the leading brands in Europe, thanks to perennial favorites such as the Mercedes-Benz Actros series, known for their blend of driving comfort and fuel efficiency. In addition to its combustion-powered models, Mercedes-Benz Trucks also offers electric trucks such as the ambitious all-electric Mercedes-Benz eActros 600, which even set a reverse driving record.\u00a0 Mercedes-Benz Trucks also serves markets in Asia, Africa, South America, and the Middle East, where it offers light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks. The automotive behemoth equips these vehicles with its own powertrains, which it makes in various production sites across Germany and Brazil. In 2008, Daimler teamed up with Indian firm Hero Group to form a new joint venture \u2014 60% owned by Daimler \u2014 dedicated to building medium and heavy commercial vehicles for the Indian market. However, both companies were forced to backtrack on plans for the Daimler Hero Commercial Vehicles (DHCV) joint venture the following year due to the economic crisis in India. Hero Group exited the alliance a year later in 2009, bringing an end to DHCV in the process. Daimler AG pressed forward with its plans anyway, launching Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV) as its Indian subsidiary, establishing\u00a0BharatBenz in 2012. The same year saw the launch of BharatBenZ's first heavy-, medium-, and light-duty trucks. BharatBenz trucks are produced at DICV's Oragadam manufacturing facility near Chennai in Tamil Nadu. In a little over a decade of operation, more than 200,000 vehicles have been produced for the domestic market at the plant, with a further 73,000 units shipped overseas. When Mitsubishi Fuso Truck & Bus Company (MFTBC) was spun off into its own entity in 2003, DaimlerChrysler AG had already been involved with Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC). The German automotive group had purchased a significant 34% stake in Mitsubishi Motor Corp(worth 2.1 billion) in March 2000 in a bid to expand its presence in Japanese and East Asian markets. So when the opportunity arose to secure a further foothold, DaimlerChrysler didn't hesitate to spend an additional $767.7 million for a 43% stake in MFTBC, with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and other Mitsubishi Group companies retaining ownership stakes of 42 and 15%, respectively. In January of 2004, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. agreed to sell 22% of its shares in MFTBC to DaimlerChrysler AG in a deal worth $489.4 million. That gave the German giant a larger 65% stake, which was further increased to 85% in February, when it was granted an additional 20% as compensation for financial damages resulting from quality issues and defect coverups at Mitsubishi Fuso. In 2011, Daimler raised its stake in MFTBC to 89.29% through a \u20ac271 million investment, leaving Mitsubishi Group Companies with only 10.71%. By 2017, Mitsubishi Fuso had introduced a couple of interesting vehicles, including the all-new Mitsubishi Super Great. Now, MFTBC is looking to push even further into truck stratosphere, as it prepares to merge with Toyota's truck subsidiary, Hino, in 2026 to form a new holding company,\u00a0Archion. Operations are expected to begin in April 2026, although Fuso and Hino will continue to run as two separate companies. Western Star was one of the companies acquired by Daimler through Freightliner, and is by virtue of that takeover now owned by Daimler Truck North America. The $670 million investment gave DaimlerChrysler ownership of several properties, including Western Star's headquarters and truck plant in Kelowna, British Columbia, along with a 460,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina. Ontario\u00a0Bus Industries\u00a0 \u2014 and its bus manufacturing sites in Mississauga, Ontario and Oriskany, New York \u2014 was also part of the deal. Western Star has since moved production to Portland, Oregon. It currently offers premium Class 8 trucks for special-purpose and long-distance haulage. These include models such as the Western Star 47X and 49X for vocational applications, as well as on-highway trucks like the Western Star 57X. However, Western Star's niche focus\u00a0means it doesn't turn out as many vehicles as some of its competitors. Western Star's sales remain well below those of larger rivals such as Freightliner and Kenworth.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"ByTom Mullen, Contributor. Below is a list of grape varieties, regions, appellations and styles that roar with character and quality. These are lesser known on the international wine market. The list is based on tastings made during past decades and does not include specific wines or wineries.  The outskirts of the Madrid metropolis of Spain includes several wine sub regions, including Arganda, Navalcarnero and San Mart\u00edn de Valdeiglesias (El Molar was also added in 2019). These comprise \u2018Vinos de Madrid.\u2019 As I wrote in 2018, \u201cThis is a land of pig farms and rambling goats, wild boars, olive orchards, granite slopes and alluring views of the Sierra de Gredos mountain range.\u201d There are some fifty wineries here, growing mainly Grenache grapes, followed by Tempranillo. What is surprising is how many of these Grenache wines highlight finesse over power; many are unusually light and some share subtle qualities reminiscent of Pinot Noir from Burgundy. Carignan wines from Sant\u2019Antioco Island (sub-island of the Italian isle of Sardinia) can be perfumed, rich, layered and with savage aromas of scrub, as well as of lava cake, black cherries and meaty flavors. They also include suave tannins well integrated with fruit. As I wrote after visiting, \u201cRipe rich dark fruit flavors\u2014think Sangiovese with the heft of a Syrah.\u201d The local Carignan also pairs well with fish, and when that pairing is with local red tuna in season? Outrageous. From more than 400 indigenous varieties grown in the country, 31 grapes are grown to make wine. Areni Noir (or Areni) dominates. As I wrote many years ago, \u201cWine made from the Areni grape is a bit of a chameleon\u2014think Merlot blended with Pinot Noir, or Syrah merging with the swimming energy of an \u00d6k\u00fcg\u00f6z\u00fc. Areni can lilt and seduce, or shout and command. Think cherries and spice: the kick of a Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re with the confident ease and gentle structure of a Beaujolais cru. Here is both grit and velvet, zest and sweetness, versatility and confidence. It\u2019s more quietly seductive than overtly flirtatious. It\u2019s Penny Lane by the Beatles rather than Rolling Stone\u2019s Satisfaction, lamb chops more than grilled sirloin\u2014but only slightly so. More right bank than left bank Bordeaux, more Rh\u00f4ne Valley than Cahors.\u201d Areni wines pair well with Mediterranean fare and grilled meats. I vacationed in the Azores during a winter week in 2009 and sampled their racy white wines. Since then, white wine production from this collection of nine islands has increased 1,500%. The stunning mid Atlantic Portuguese isle of Pico produces white wines from the Arinto, Verdelho and Terrantez do Pico grapes (with descending levels of acidity in that order) as well as from Fern\u00e3o Pires grapes. These pair well with seafood\u2014whether limpets, octopus, shrimp, barnacles or fish: amberjack, tuna, swordfish, wreckfish, seabream or golden grouper.  In the last ten years the production of white wines along the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna has increased by over 117% to rival the volume of the well-known red wines (made predominantly from Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio grapes). For whites, the Carricante grape dominates, and is often blended with Cataratto\u2014which can provide floral aromas. Carricante\u2019s acidity makes it suitable for formidable aging, and after two years in bottle many of these wines rapidly develop caramelized notes\u2014similar to those of Timorasso grapes from the Piedmont region of Italy. The attraction of these whites, according to winemaker Alberto Graci, is that, \u201cThey can have sweetness with a salty expression, structure without softness and have acidity but not be acidic wines.\u201d Sweet wines from Sauternes in southwest France are deservedly renowned for richness and aging potential. Yet sixty miles (100 kilometers) to the northeast, near Bergerac, sweet wines produced around the town of Monbazillac (in an appellation of the same name, established in 1936) are well priced and often delicious. This region, overlooked during the famed 1855 Bordeaux wine classification, has soils with less limestone than Sauternes and receives less rainfall. Its multiple steep valleys are conducive to damp and misty mornings, partially due to the presence of the Dordogne and Gardonette rivers. This allows botrytis cinerea fungus, or \u2018noble rot\u2019 to grow on grapes, which sucks moisture from them, causing them to shrivel and concentrating acidity and sugars. Aromas of Monbazillac wines are general floral, fruity and honeyed, and flavors can include vanilla and toast from barrel aging. Semillon grapes dominate, while Muscadelle can add spice or mint and Sauvignon Blanc bolsters acidity. Treat yourself to a sweet Monbazillac treat at an affordable price. Strictly enforced rules for grape growers in two cooperatives in the Trentino-Alto Adige region, over a period of 130 years, resulted in the collective production of high quality wines within the region. The cooperatives merged in 2008 to become Cantina Terlano. Growers are paid well by the cooperative if the quality of their grapes is high, and metrics are constantly used to monitor outputs from 70 producers. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of a luxury coop,\u201d explained Klaus Gasser, the cooperative\u2019s sales and marketing director, when we spoke three years ago. Wines are predominantly made from Pinot Bianco, followed by Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Aged Terlaner wines can be stunning\u2014with delicate aromas that include white pears and yellow apples and creamy flavors that include rich caramel on the finish. As I previously wrote, these wines can include \u201c\u2026the finesse of a Sauternes and the delicate fruit of a Friuli.\u201d This general heading includes a vast array of wines, but what makes Swiss wines unique is that the country exports less than 2% of its production. The country has six wine regions and 240 grape varieties, although four grapes (Pinot Noir, Chasselas, Gamay and Merlot) constitute the bulk of what is harvested. The lesser known grape of Petit Arvine from the Swiss Valais region is also a treat\u2014fruity, floral with minerality and salinity. Chasselas white wine can include aromas of florals, apples and honey; Merlot from the south is often fine and elegant. Other grapes used to produce excellent Swiss wines are Humagne Rouge and Diolinoir and the Freiburger grape\u2014which is so rare that no wines made from this grape are exported.  Abruzzo in eastern Italy is known for its whites made from Trebbiano d\u2019Abruzzo and its reds made from Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo. Lesser known are the white wines made from Pecorino\u2014which can include zesty acidity and can display precise yet also creamy characteristics. Pecorino flavors may be of green apples, nectarines, butter, wild mint and salinity.  The dark ros\u00e9 wines known as \u2018cerasuolo\u2019 (cherry-like) made from at least 85% Montepulciano d\u2019Abruzzo grapes (which are intensely pigmented) are produced using short maceration and can display aromas of cherries and roses. Cerasuolo is versatile for food pairing\u2014consider lamb shish kebab or fish soup.    ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Routers are tiny computers. They come with their own RAM, CPU, storage, and a barebones operating system glued together by whatever software the manufacturer ships. The problem is that most of that hardware goes to waste. You have a perfectly capable little machine on your shelf, but the stock firmware keeps it muzzled. Router companies are also terrible at maintaining their hardware. It\u2019s painfully common for a router to become \u201cirrelevant\u201d after a year. But these devices deserve more. With OpenWRT, you can actually give them more. Not long ago, I installed OpenWRT on my old router. It\u2019s been a while since then, and here I am again trying to convince you to give it a shot \u2014 except this time, I\u2019m coming with a pile of real examples. I use a VPN at all times. A network-wide VPN was one of my biggest motivations to buy a new, expensive router. But then, I found out about OpenWRT. My VPN provider has apps for almost every platform I use \u2014 but that only solves half the problem. What about the devices that can\u2019t run apps at all? For example, I have a smart clock running some half-baked version of Android. It\u2019s tied to my Google Home. How exactly am I supposed to install a VPN on that thing? My smart TV is already choking from all the bloat and ads; running a VPN app in the background would only make it more miserable. I have nine devices that connect to the internet, and I need a VPN on all nine. Does that mean running a VPN client nine separate times? Absolutely not. Instead, I run the VPN once \u2014 at the source. Network-wide VPNs aren\u2019t a novelty anymore. What is a novelty is a router that supports basically every protocol under the sun. I use WireGuard and Xray. A $700 high-end router (like the Asus ROG Rupture) could probably handle WireGuard, but I still haven\u2019t seen a commercial router that supports Xray. The ASUS ROG Rapture GT-BE98 Pro is a monstrous quad-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router built for extreme throughput, heavy multi-device loads, and multi-gig networks. It delivers advanced features like Multi-Link Operation, 320MHz channels, AiProtection Pro security, and VPN Fusion for OpenVPN and WireGuard \u2014 though notably, it does not support the Xray VPN protocol. My cheap $40 Linksys running OpenWRT can (I bought it used). Right now, I have Xray set up using the Passwall plugin. Installing it is as simple as any Linux package. Once installed, a new tab shows up in the GUI and I can tweak it however I want. I\u2019ve even created custom firewall rules so one Wi-Fi interface uses the VPN while another completely bypasses it. Speaking of interfaces\u2026  With the stock firmware, my router gave me two Wi-Fi networks: one 5GHz and one 2.4GHz. My router has two antennas, so two SSIDs was fair enough. OpenWRT doesn\u2019t care. With OpenWRT, I can create far more wireless interfaces than the default software ever exposes. Why would anyone want six SSIDs? I have no explanation, and I don\u2019t want to explore the psychology behind it. But the point is: you can. Is running a dozen SSIDs wise? Probably not. But you can. And that\u2019s the point. Right now, I\u2019m running four SSIDs \u2014 two per band, one set routed through the VPN and one not. It works perfectly. There is a performance overhead, and that\u2019s probably why manufacturers stop at two. Each SSID adds a bit of load, and although your router becomes a beautifully capable Linux machine with OpenWRT, the CPU is still tiny. Is running a dozen SSIDs wise? Probably not. But you can. And that\u2019s the point.  This one isn\u2019t brand-new in theory, but it\u2019s incredibly convenient in practice. No NAS. No dedicated media server. No custom scripts. No port-forward nightmares. If your router has a USB port and runs OpenWRT, you can spin up a media server right there. I tried it with Samba and had it running quickly. I plugged the external drive into the router, pointed Kodi to the network share, and I could immediately watch everything. Frankly, I moved away from Kodi when I discovered Jellyfin. Jellyfin works so well that despite OpenWRT supporting Samba and much more, I abandoned the router-based media setup. The only downside is that if my computer goes to sleep, the media server goes down with it. The real issue with using your router as a media server is raw power. Your router becomes the bottleneck. Mine is not exactly a powerhouse, so it struggled. Yours might do better \u2014 but even then, your Windows machine is almost certainly faster. The Linksys EA8300 Max-Stream AC2200 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 5 router designed to deliver fast, stable wireless performance across multiple devices. Powered by a quad-core Qualcomm processor with 256 MB of RAM, it offers combined speeds of up to 2.2 Gbps across one 2.4 GHz and two 5 GHz bands. But what matters the most is that you can flash OpenWRT on this bad boy.  This is another cost-saving gem from OpenWRT. Instead of buying a separate 4G\/5G modem, I can turn my router into one using a dusty old Android phone. My router has a USB port. I plug in the phone, enable USB tethering, and suddenly I have 5G injected straight into my home network. Well... not so suddenly. You do need driver packages first. Install them with: This gives OpenWRT the ability to treat your phone as a network interface. If all you want is USB tethering, you're done. But if you want to combine your home internet and mobile data in practice, you can go further. To go further, you install mwan3 (Multi-WAN Manager 3). It lets you load balance across multiple interfaces however you want. You could merge the two networks by setting equal weights, or set all sorts of rules for different devices. For example, you can route your smart TV through 5G while keeping your gaming PC on your wired connection for better latency. A quick note: load balancing doesn\u2019t actually merge your networks. It just splits connections between them according to the rules you set. With a download manager using many parallel connections, the end result feels like your networks have been merged because half the threads saturate one connection and half saturate the other.  Yes, your router can host a website. And this one is a perfect example of something even expensive commercial routers simply won\u2019t let you do. In my screenshot above, I\u2019m running a small webpage directly on my router. It\u2019s just static HTML under 70 lines, but you get the point. OpenWRT already runs uHTTPd for the LuCI interface, so hosting your own site requires minimal setup. You create a second instance, assign it a different port (mine is on :81), upload your files, and that\u2019s it. If I wanted to expose it to the internet and make my router a public web server, I technically could. I obviously won\u2019t \u2014 but I could.  So? Did I win you over to the OpenWRT side? I\u2019m not a networking guru by any stretch; I\u2019m a beginner. But I enjoy tinkering with the hardware I have, and OpenWRT lets me do exactly that \u2014 and actually get something useful out of it. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved  I recently bought a Linksys router to support a remote barn area of the farm and extend my net to it. Although I am using it in the Linksys bridge mode, my intent was to be able to load OpenWRT to meet my configuration requirements longer term.  One expectation was to connect a SSD to the USB port to allow some critical offsite backup storage. I\u2019ve done that in bridge mode but it\u2019s has restrictions. So, looks like I\u2019ll soon be loading OpenWRT to meet the need.  The router's speed isn't ideal for streaming media but should be fine for documents. Just remember to secure it properly!                                                 ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"The Ubiquiti Flex Mini 2.5G has been a highly requested review on STH since we launched\u00a0 The Ultimate Cheap Fanless 2.5GbE Switch Buyers Guide. This is a 5-port 2.5GbE switch also known as the USW-Flex-2.5G-5. Low power, PoE-in, and UniFi management make it quite different. At the same time, we opened it up and found that it is the same internal chipset powering some of the 4-port 2.5GbE and 2-port 10G switches that are under $30, which we had not seen anyone go into detail on previously. As a quick note, we purchased these units thanks to our STH YouTube members. We have refused to sign the \u201cInfluencer Testing NDA\u201d with Ubiquiti that everyone else does because there is a line in there that Ubiquiti would not allow us to remove, saying that we could review the product provided Ubiquiti is allowed to review the post prior to publication, and that we would incorporate that feedback if needed. While we tour data centers, manufacturing sites, and similar locations and let people preview to ensure we are not leaking confidential information, we do not allow vendors to preview and provide substantive feedback that we would be required to incorporate into our reviews. Our readers and YouTube viewers have requested that we review this box over the years, so we purchased a few to provide an honest assessment. As a fun one, when Patrick was at Microcenter this week buying extra units, one of the YouTube viewers said hello and commented on the recent\u00a0Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Gateway Fiber UCG-Fiber Review. Patrick\u2019s Editor\u2019s Note: Ubiquiti reached out the evening after this was published and requested edits to be made to the paragraph above. Although disctinctly recall Ubiquiti told me that everyone else signs the \u201cInfluencer Testing NDA\u201d, there may be people who did not, so we are going to strike that out. Fair point. We also changed the \u201cstandard NDA\u201d to \u201cInfluencer Testing NDA\u201d because Ubiquiti, when making the requests, also said that they were not aware of the review and incorporate feedback language in question. While doing that, they had copied the person in Legal who actually e-mailed me the document and who I discussed my concerns with. I have never had a request like this in 16+ years of reviewing products in the industry, especially when we are buying product for editorial review. If you are just looking for a purchase link, you can find these at B&H Photo (Affiliate link.) The switch has five 2.5GbE ports as the headline feature. What Ubiquiti is doing is also making the profile of the switch minimally larger than the ports themselves. Powering the switch can happen over the 5th port, which has PoE IN or a USB Type-C 5V power input. As a quick labeling note, it would have been nice for Ubiquiti to label this as port \u201c5\u201d to match the other four. The first thing that should strike you about the Flex Mini 2.5G is the size. At only 4.6\u00d73.5\u00d70.8in or 117.1x90x21.2mm it is a very small switch. In fact, the plastic housing makes it one of the smallest switches in its class. That presents cooling challenges which we will get to when we get inside. The sides of the switch do not have vents, so there are no obvious vents in the plastic case. On the top we get the Ubiquiti logo. Here is the bottom of the unit. There are nice rubber feet installed, but if you were thinking that they are hiding screws to open the case, you would be incorrect. This is another snap together design from Ubiquiti. You will notice a reset button at the bottom. That pushes on a small reset button at the bottom of the switch PCB. On the cooling side, Ubiquiti has a challenge. It has a chassis with virtually no airflow, and it is made of plastic, limiting the amount of heat that chips radiate into the environment. Instead of just using a metal chassis and small heatsinks like other devices, Ubiquiti has a custom heat spreader that makes contact with the larger chips and helps cool them. Luckily this is a low-power device. Here is something really cool. The Realtek RTL8372N is the big switch chip. That is the same switch chip driving many of the 4+2 (4-port 2.5GbE and 2-port 10G) switches on the market because it has two 10G SerDes interfaces. It appears to be the same as the main switch chip in the Ubiquiti UCG-Fiber as well. The smaller Realtek chip is the RTL8221B, which is the same as we would find in something like a Yulinca switch going to its 5th 2.5GbE port. Next, let us get to the performance. Hasn\u2019t this switch been out for years? This is the first genuine review. Good on STH for doing real networking reviews. For $50 nobody else has taken it apart? I\u2019ve seen other \u201creviews\u201d When are you firing on FortiNet SonicWall Cisco Palo Alto Juniper and those kinds? I\u2019d like that and more 2.5Gb fanless since there\u2019s new brands. Why not review that Bros one? Is that an ESP32 in there to the left of the RTL8221B? Seems like an odd choice if you didn\u2019t need WiFI\/BT capability, I wonder what it\u2019s used for. You\u2019ve got to love it when STH reviews gear! I\u2019d be more upset, but this is a cheap a$$ switch. I\u2019m more upset that there\u2019s china sellers on the Zon selling 4 and 2\u2019s for $30 and these are $50 since Zon\u2019s takin a 20% cut too. Rohit you\u2019ve done not only a great review, but the best ever on this product I\u2019m more interested in 10G. Ubiquiti has the Flex-10G, which would be great for me to extend 10G to a shed I\u2019d like to convert to a server room, but inexplicably the PoE in port is only 1G Since it is a small plastic box with no vents, as mentioned, I thought there would be some words about the temperature (in Celsius..). Great test! Did you reach out to ubiquity about the start-up issues? Did they have anything to say about this. Would it be something that can be solved via firmware update? So no mention of temperature or load power consumption? :( I\u2019ve seen other older references saying this does NOT support LAGG, curious if that is that still true or if Ubiquiti maybe added it in an update?  I\u2019ve been searching for a small and affordable 2.5Gb switch with LAGG so I can take the 2.5Gb uplink and aggregate two gigabit links to a 24 port switch to give it effectively 2Gb of available bandwidth. Open to other recommendations if this still doesn\u2019t do LAGG. So if i understand correctly, they use the plastic housing as a heatsink? I loved this switch because I could pick it up same day at Microcenter and I expected great things being of the Uniquiti brand (which at first was the case). For a few months, it worked great. I upgraded two of my PCs to 2.5G pci-e NICs and was hitting expected speeds across this switch to speed up intra-network file transfers.  This all changed one day when I found I was unable to remote into one of my PCs. Strangely enough, the switch had no LEDs illuminated. I unplugged the switch for a minute or two then powered it up, seeing no issues and I chalked it up to a \u201creboot fixing the issue\u201d thing. Strange as I\u2019m using it as a dumb switch, but I was just glad to have it working again. Unfortunately shortly after, I saw the same issue with no LEDs almost as if the power distribution board was having issues. I unplugged all my network cables and plugged just the switch into a completely different outlet on a different circuit and sure enough after a period of time the switch went dead again. I didn\u2019t think the switch got warmer than one would expect a fanless design to get (I didn\u2019t get an IR reading by any means either), but I am curious if it has anything to do with the fanless design. I have had several fanless stitches with no issues, so I\u2019m going to start the RMA process and see what Ubiquiti comes back with. @Ben I think the ESP32 is used for management. The switch chip does not have CPU cores to run a management firmware Why on earth does Ubnt requires anyone to sign any documents if STH are buying it and testing it out by themselves. Thank you for confirming the switch chip used. I speculated on this using an RTL8372 back when it was released, but this is the first teardown I\u2019ve seen. That delay before passing traffic is weird. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of it, but perhaps it\u2019s something that only happens when pushing traffic to all ports at the some time or something like that.  Interesting none the less. The language and grammar in the article are atrocious and infantile Do you have a better photo of the IC closest to the RTL8372N? It\u2019s not possible to identify it on the pictures. The RTL8372N has an integraded CPU but from what I hear the Realtek SDK is very limited, apparently you\u2019re limited to only modify the branding, etc. of the standard realtek webinterface (no custom code possible). To make their controller magic happen most likey they used the second 10G serdes to connect to the ESP32 which then controlls the RTL8372N via it\u2019s I2C interface. Since Ubiquiti released the Flex Utility Pro outdoor box and listed pretty much the entire flex line in their compatibility list, I\u2019ve been wondering about how these switches would hold up in outdoor usage.  I\u2019m in Florida, and it can easily get well over the listed operating range of this switch (113f) inside an enclosure.  Any chance of doing a torture test on some of these?

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Ether ETH$3,014.24 traded below $3,100 on Sunday during a broader pullback in digital assets. The token was recently near $3,066 at 9:36 p.m. UTC, down 3.4% over the past 24 hours. It briefly fell through the $3,100 level on Bitstamp at about 4 p.m. UTC, marking its first break beneath that threshold since Nov. 4, based on data from TradingView. Timothy Peterson, an investment manager and digital asset researcher at Cane Island Alternative Advisors, said spot ether ETFs posted net outflows in four of the past five weeks, totaling roughly 7% of the cost-basis capital invested in the products. He said bitcoin ETFs saw about 4% withdrawn over the same period, a smaller share that he believes indicates investors currently view ether as the riskier asset. Cost-basis capital represents the total amount of money originally committed to an ETF, separate from gains or losses accumulated after purchase. The measure reflects how much foundational capital long-term participants have contributed to a fund. When redemptions rise as a share of this original investment base, analysts interpret it as an erosion of conviction among established holders rather than short-term positioning changes. Because the metric focuses on investors\u2019 initial commitments, it can provide a clearer read on sentiment than headline inflow and outflow data, which can be affected by week-to-week volatility.  Traders will now be watching whether ether\u2019s ETF outflows ease or continue in the coming weeks, and how the token trades around key levels after Sunday\u2019s move below $3,100. Future flow data and price action are likely to show whether the sentiment gap Peterson highlighted between ether and bitcoin persists.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"For those of you who are living under a rock, Valve announced three new hardware devices joining their Steam Deck line-up: a new controller, a VR headset, and the GameCube\u2014no wait, GabeCube\u2014no wait, Steam Machine. The shiny little cube is undoubtedly Valve\u2019s (second) attempt to break into the console market. This time, it might just work. The hardware is ready to arrive in at your living room spring next year. The biggest question is: will it arrive at our living room? Reading all the hype has certainly enthused me (e.g. Brendon\u2019s The Steam Machine is the Future, PC Gamer\u2019s Valve is all over ARM, Eurogamer\u2019s Steam Machine preview, ResetEra\u2019s Steam Hardware thread); especially the part where the Machine is just a PC that happens to be tailored towards console gaming. According to Valve, you can install anything you want on it\u2014it\u2019s just SteamOS just like your trusty Deck, meaning you can boot into KDE and totally do your thing. Except that this shiny little cube is six times as powerful. I\u2019m sure Digital Foundry will validate that next year.     Valve's newly announced Steam Machine: a mysterious looking sleek black box.  However, this post isn\u2019t about specs, expectations, or dreams: it\u2019s about tempering my own enthusiasm. I\u2019d like to tell myself why I don\u2019t really need a Steam Machine. The following list will hopefully make it easier to say no when the buy buttons become available. So you see, I don\u2019t really need a Steam Machine\u2026 Fuck it, I\u2019m getting one.  folder icon retro                                  \u00a0 \t\t\t         \t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t    \ttag icon  steam\u00a0 \t\t\t\t\t         \t\t\t\t\t            games\u00a0 \t\t\t\t\t         \t\t\t\t\t                   I'm Wouter Groeneveld, a Brain Baker, and I love the smell of freshly baked thoughts (and bread) in the morning.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Login  Peter  16 November 2025   Weekly poll Nothing  Nothing\u2019s recent market strategy has left us scratching our heads \u2013 and it\u2019s not just us, it seems. Last week\u2019s poll shows that most people gravitate towards other offerings from the company instead of their latest release. The Nothing Phone (3a) Lite failed to convince the majority. Some will wait for reviews, a few are interested but the phone isn\u2019t available near them \u2013 even so, most people would rather get the non-Lite Nothing Phone (3a) or pick up the CMF Phone 2 Pro. And why wouldn\u2019t they \u2013 Nothing\u2019s CMF models offer awesome value for money. We see it with the CMF Headphone Pro too. It costs one-third the price of the Nothing Headphone (1) and it has great features plus a non-controversial design. The same goes for the CMF Phone 2 Pro \u2013 it\u2019s better than the Nothing Phone (3a) Lite and it costs less. Unless you really, really want OIS on the main cam. And if you do and you can spare some extra cash, the Nothing Phone (3a) is better than both.    Nothing Phone (3a) Lite Nothing is not big enough to have so much overlap in the models it sells. Sure it happens to the likes of Xiaomi, but Xiaomi unveils half a dozen new models in any given week. Nothing has 5 current models all told and it probably could have done without this one. Just another unnecessary e-waste. Even Xiaomi needs to stop launching new phones every week and just launch the same model across the entire world. You forgot about the bloatware from which they entered the market and now giving bloatware too This pricing is simply not possible. What profit are you even making at 500-600?

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Justin Sullivan \/ Getty Images  Earnings from artificial intelligence giant Nvidia and retail leaders Walmart, Target, and Home Depot highlight this week\u2019s calendar. Investors will also watch for impacts from the reopening of the government after a 43-day work stoppage, the longest in U.S. history.   The shutdown\u2019s end will likely mean a resumption of government economic reports, which have been on hold due to the furlough of workers needed to collect the data. The reports are critical for investors and officials, who use the data to evaluate the direction of the economy.   While it's unclear whether government agencies will return to their normal data-release schedule this week, only a few reports could still be impacted by the shutdown.   Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events\u2014and one more thing.   All eyes\u2014or, at least, all investor eyes\u2014will be on Nvidia this week as the world\u2019s most valuable company reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The AI trade has driven recent market volatility over worries about corporate valuations in that sector. Nvidia posted earnings that narrowly exceeded expectations in its most recent report as the chipmaker reassured investors that demand for AI technology remained strong.\u00a0   Reports from large retailers are on the schedule, led by Walmart\u2019s on Thursday\u2014just days after announcing that John Furner will take over as CEO on Feb. 1, replacing Doug McMillon. The world\u2019s largest retailer's share price hit an all-time high in October.   Other key retailers reporting this week include Target, which announced a change in leadership when it last posted quarterly earnings. Home Depot\u2019s report on Tuesday comes as the hardware giant raised its outlook on rising demand for home improvement projects. Competitor Lowe\u2019s Cos. is slated to release its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Discount retailers TJX Cos., the parent company of TJ Maxx, and Ross Stores, are also on this week\u2019s calendar.   While it's unclear when government economic data will resume, investors will still have several noteworthy reports to monitor.   Several are to do with the housing market. Existing-home sales data for October comes Wednesday amid a freeze in the housing market that has kept sales near decades-low levels for more than two years. Housing starts, which measures new home construction, is also scheduled to be released this week, but it's unclear if the shutdown will continue to see delays in that government data.\u00a0   The minutes of the October meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee will provide market watchers with more insight into deliberations behind where to set interest rates, which has some officials divided. Investors will also be watching for the final November report on consumer sentiment, which earlier this month showed that the government shutdown was beginning to make some consumers more nervous about the state of the economy.\u00a0   Quick Links: Recap Last Week\u2019s Trading | Read Investopedia\u2019s Latest News   Monday, Nov. 17   Tuesday, Nov. 18   Wednesday, Nov. 19   Thursday, Nov. 20   Friday, Nov. 21   Looking to earn a six-figure salary?

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Strategy\u2019s leveraged bitcoin approach came under fresh scrutiny Sunday as critics questioned whether Michael Saylor\u2019s firm can withstand prolonged market stress. Among the most vocal was longtime Bitcoin detractor Peter Schiff, who chairs Schiff Gold and serves as chief global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management.  In a series of posts on X, Schiff argued that Strategy\u2019s model depends on income-focused buyers of its \u201chigh-yield\u201d preferred shares, said the published yields \u201cwill never actually be paid\u201d and warned the structure could enter a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d if demand weakens.  He also said he believes the company \u201cwill eventually go bankrupt\u201d and challenged Saylor to debate him at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai in early December. His invitations appeared designed, at least in part, to draw Saylor into a public confrontation over the firm\u2019s approach to holding bitcoin. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at digital asset management firm Arca, offered a markedly different view. In his own post on X, Dorman criticized what he called \u201cstupid, inaccurate takes\u201d about Strategy\u2019s risk profile and said concerns that the company might be forced into selling bitcoin overlook the fundamentals of its balance sheet.  While Dorman did not reference Schiff directly, his comments addressed the broader claims circulating among skeptics who argue that Strategy could face severe pressure if bitcoin prices fall sharply. Dorman said Saylor\u2019s 42% ownership makes an activist takeover \u201calmost impossible\u201d and noted that none of Strategy\u2019s debts include covenants that would compel the company to liquidate bitcoin. He added that the firm\u2019s legacy software business still generates positive cash flow, helping support interest expenses he described as manageable. Borrowers also rarely default solely because a maturity approaches, he said, arguing that lenders often agree to extend terms in what he called a familiar \u201cextend and pretend\u201d dynamic. Strategy\u2019s stock has been under pressure despite its expanding bitcoin position. Class A shares closed at $199.74 on Friday, down 4.22% on the day and 33.42% year to date. Over the same period, bitcoin has returned about 0.4%. According to StrategyTracker, which tracks corporate bitcoin treasuries, Strategy\u2019s diluted market net asset value multiple stands near 1.06x, meaning the shares trade only modestly above a conservative estimate of their bitcoin-backed value after accounting for all potential future shares from options, warrants and convertible debt. Dorman added that Strategy is no longer a meaningful marginal buyer of bitcoin relative to ETF inflows but said this does not make the company a systemic risk. \u201cIf you follow anyone saying MSTR is a risk to BTC, tell them to call me,\u201d he wrote. Bitcoin traded around $94,293 at 11 p.m. UTC, down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

Shout Factory's popular Friday the 13th Collection is newly out of print, so you'll want to snag this excellent Blu-ray box set deal while you still can. By      Steven Petite    on November 16, 2025 at 2:15AM PST  Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition (12 Movies)   $105.34 (was $160)    Shout Factory recently discontinued one of its best horror movie box sets, but there's still time to add it to your collection before it's gone for good. Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition is back in stock at Amazon with a huge 34% discount that drops the price to $105.34 (was $160). Released in 2020 to rave reviews from fans and critics, this 16-disc Blu-ray box set is the only Friday the 13th collection with all 12 movies. With Amazon's deal, you're paying $8.75 per movie, and that's without factoring in the mountain of special features, premium display case, and collector's booklet. During Amazon's Halloween horror sale, this box set was discounted to $124 and sold out fast. The $105.34 price is the lowest we've seen in years. And since Shout Factory is no longer printing the collection, Amazon's current deal is also probably the last. Take a closer look at Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition below.   Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition is a 1080p Blu-ray box set compiling every movie in the iconic horror franchise. The classic eight-film story arc--the 1980 original through 1989's Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan--is joined by the divisive Jason Goes to Hell (1993) and Jason X (2002), the Nightmare on Elm Street crossover film Freddy vs. Jason, and the 2009 reboot. Unlike many large box sets, each movie has its own traditional Blu-ray case with reversible cover art. There are 13 cases in all, since the two bonus material discs have a case of their own. The movies and the 40-page booklet featuring essays and production photography are packaged inside the durable slipcase shown above. The slipcase has exclusive artwork by Devon Whitehead on all sides. The first four movies in the collection are based on Shout Factory's new (at the time) 4K restorations. Shout Factory also restored the mono\/stereo audio tracks for the first seven films in the series. The original movie has two discs, one with the restored audio, another with the original sound. Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X received new 2K scan based on the interpositives. If you're a big fan of the series, the treasure trove of special features is worth the price of admission alone. Along with all of the archival content from earlier Blu-ray and DVD releases, this set comes with a bunch of new audio commentaries featuring the cast and crew. It also has new audio commentaries led by other filmmakers who were influenced by the franchise. You'll also find new behind-the-scenes featurettes, making-of documentaries, and interviews. There are so many special features that the final two discs in the box set are loaded with even more of them. For a full list of special features, check the product description section on Amazon's store page. Friday the 13th Collection Deluxe Edition (Blu-ray): If you want to complete your Friday the 13th movie and TV collections, check out the 17-disc DVD box set collecting all 71 episodes of the TV series that aired for three seasons from 1987-1990. Friday the 13th: The Complete Series is discounted to $29.71 (was $40) at Amazon.   When Shout Factory's 12-film box set sells out, fans will still have a few Friday the 13th collections to choose from. Paramount's Friday the 13th 8-Movie Steelbook Collection is available for only $38 at Amazon. This budget-friendly collection was reissued earlier this month (November 11)--the timing probably isn't a coincidence--after being sold out since last holiday season. It comes with Blu-ray and digital editions of the classic Friday the 13th story arc. All six discs are packaged in the single steelbook case shown above. The remastered versions of the first four movies in the classic series are included in this collection, too. The remasters get their own discs, but back half of the classic series is pressed onto two discs. This collection doesn't come with nearly as many special features, but you're getting eight movies on Blu-ray and digital, a nice steelbook case, and eight art cards for $38. The 8-Movie Steelbook Collection is undoubtedly a bargain. It originally released in 202 The Steelbook Collection is actually cheaper than the standard version without the collectible case and art cards. The DVD box set is up for grabs for only $22.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Hosting Thanksgiving in a small space is basically the holiday Olympics (complete with a 300-meter dash to figure out where you even put the forks). But the truth is, many have done it before, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason why you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figure it out! All you really need is a bit of creativity and the confidence of someone who refuses to let square footage dictate their holiday spirit. Here are seven hacks to pull off a cramped-but-cozy Thanksgiving. Rule number one: stop apologizing for your small space. Guests don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come over expecting a Martha Stewart spread with an annex dining room. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there for you and the food at the end of the day. Small spaces only feel awkward if you act like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re awkward. So lean in, and own the cozy charm! Nothing shrinks a space faster than stuff. Before anyone arrives, temporarily rehome anything that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly involved in the hosting process. Any and all surfaces are precious real estate, so keep counters, tabletops, and shelves as clean as possible. Future you will be grateful. Forget the fantasy of one grand table with matching chairs and monogrammed napkins. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 creative seating here. Floor cushions, stools, ottomans, benches, your roommate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yoga blocks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00c2\u00a0 it all counts. Kids especially love sitting on the floor, hallway, or even clustered around a coffee table like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tiny banquet hall.\u00c2\u00a0 If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re short on table space, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste it with the turkey parade. Set up a buffet on your kitchen counter or a folding table instead of the dining space. Setting things up with specific stations keeps traffic flowing and frees up space where it matters. Small spaces mean small ovens, tiny counters, and exactly zero room for last-minute chaos. So plan more than you think you need to! Make sides the day before, borrow roasting pans, outsource a dish or two, use your slow cooker, and let guests bring dessert (or make the whole thing a potluck!) Every make-ahead moment buys you sanity on the big day. Short on cutlery? Not enough serving bowls? Dining table the size of a placemat? Just ask your guests to supply whatever you need. People love to contribute, especially if it spares them from cooking a full turkey. Years from now, no one will remember how tightly packed the living room was or whether they balanced their plate on an ottoman. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember the laughter, the shared food, and how fantastic it was for their friend to offer up their cozy, tiny home. Loading recommendations...

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tAlexis Coe   Aaron Sorkin set me up for a lifetime of heartbreak. As a kid, I was ensorcelled by The American President, Sorkin\u2019s 1995 film, the dress rehearsal for The West Wing four years later, and the beginning of his lifelong flirtation with civic virtue \u2014 and, inadvertently, my profession studying presidents. Andrew Shepherd, the widowed Commander-in-Chief, spoke in full sentences about gun control, civic duty, and moral responsibility. I didn\u2019t want to marry him. I wanted to study him \u2014 which turned out to be its own kind of delusion.  \tPresident Shepherd (Michael Douglas), despite a 66 percent approval rating, spends most of the movie losing ground \u2014 his crime bill stalls, he forgets to sign his daughter\u2019s permission slip, his love life becomes scandal, and his silence leaves space for conservative rival Senator Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) to accuse him of being a man without \u201cfamily values.\u201d Meanwhile, Michael J. Fox, who plays caffeinated squirrel of an aide Lewis Rothschild, channels the conscience of the American public, pushing Shepherd to act on their behalf. And when he finally does, he delivers the best speech I\u2019ve ever seen any president, real or imagined, give in my lifetime.\u00a0  \t           \t\u201cWhatever your particular problem is,\u201d Shepherd says, steady and unsparing, \u201cI promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He\u2019s interested in two things, and two things only: making you afraid of it, and telling you who\u2019s to blame for it.\u201d Then comes the dagger: \u201cThat, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections.\u201d  \t           \tWhen I re-watched the movie 30 years later \u2014 as a presidential historian watching Trump\u2019s reelection returns \u2014 the experience was brutal. The distance between Sorkin\u2019s imagined president and the reality of American politics felt cavernous: empathy replaced by grievance, rhetoric by noise, public service by self-interest. The country had reelected Shepherd\u2019s feral heir, but this one incited an insurrection and called it patriotism. Sorkin\u2019s brand of idealism suddenly felt like science fiction \u2014 an elegy for a republic that mistook grift for governance.      \t \t\tEditor\u2019s picks \t \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\t\t \t         \tOn the film\u2019s anniversary, I talked to Sorkin about the president he invented, the ones we got in real life, and what\u2019s changed. Turns out, everything.  Every D.C. insider claims The West Wing put them on their path. Have you met anyone, like me, who was shaped by The American President instead?  \tLast September, the White House had a reception celebrating the 25th anniversary of The West Wing. And I met a bunch of people there who talked about The American President and The West Wing \u2014 but The American President was the beginning of their career in public service.\u00a0  That was the Biden White House, right? Have you heard the same thing from other administrations? I\u2019m wondering about Trump staffers. \u00a0  \tIt was in the Biden White House. [The American President] was [an influence] in the Obama White House, it was in the Bush White House, and the Clinton White House. I honestly don\u2019t know anyone in the Trump White House.\u00a0  I\u2019ve always had a strange affinity for Shepherd\u2019s nemesis, Bob Rumson \u2014 the slick, moralizing senator who fit right into the Contract With America [Newt Gingrich\u2019s 1994 Republican manifesto that weaponized moral indignation into strategy] era I grew up in. His outrage once felt ordinary; now it feels almost quaint. Do you see any parallels in today\u2019s post-bipartisan landscape?    \t \t\tRelated Content \t \t       \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tFCC Chairman Shares Trump Post Calling for NBC to Fire Seth Meyers \u2018Immediately\u2019\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe War Between MTG and Trump: How Did We Get Here?\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'SNL' Weekend Update Hammers Trump Over Epstein\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'SNL' Cold Open: Nervous Trump Fumbles His Epstein Defense\t\t \t         \tI\u2019ve never written anything that I didn\u2019t wish I could have back and write again, but something as early in my career as The American President sort of feels like my high school yearbook picture. I do wish I could have it back again. One of the things I would do is work on that character. I don\u2019t \u200b\u200bthink that was fair really to that character. However, even in that unfair iteration, no, I don\u2019t see any parallel. All I see in the Republican Party today is a creepy, weird fealty to someone who doesn\u2019t deserve it.\u00a0  \t           \tThe average screenplay is about 120 pages long. The first draft of The American President was over 350 pages long. I delivered it to Rob Reiner in a shopping bag. And one of the reasons for that: I wrote a lot about Bob Rumson. The idea was that when he was a widower, that was kind of an armor he had against what was then the attack du jour against the left, which was that they don\u2019t have any family values. However, when he began dating that armor went away, and suddenly he could be attacked, and that\u2019s what I used, [the] Richard Dreyfuss [character] for, and that was unfair.\u00a0  It fits that era, though, doesn\u2019t it? I still love telling people the press once dubbed George H. W. Bush \u201cRubbers\u201d because he talked about family planning so much \u2014 right up until he became Reagan\u2019s VP and dropped it entirely.  \tAnyone watching [The American President] for the first time today, would think it was quaint. It\u2019s part of the time machine. What woke was in \u201994 was family values.\u00a0  \tEarly on in the research for The American President, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, I really didn\u2019t know what I was going to write, except that it was going to be Robert Redford as a widowed president of the United States.  \tAt the 11th hour, [Redford] and Rob Reiner had a falling out. When Redford dropped out, actually Warren Beatty wanted to play the part, which I thought would be great, but as Warren said, nobody likes to see you fall in love with your wife. So, it wasn\u2019t Warren, it was Michael [J. Fox].  \tBut at the time, all I knew was Robert Redford\u2019s playing a widower president of the United States, and we didn\u2019t have an understanding of the personal lives of these people or that there was a personal life. Clinton changed that, popular culture changed that. But my research began with the president\u2019s Daily Diary from a bunch of different administrations going back. It\u2019s simply an accounting of what the President did that day, minute by minute. At 7:25 a.m., he met with the following people in the Oval Office, 8 a.m. he was in the Residence. What I was overcome with was the idea that this is just a regular guy in a temp job, and it\u2019s the regular guy part that really got me interested. So the president trying to ask a woman out on a date. The president trying to get her flowers, that kind of thing.  I remembered the first time I read H.W. Bush\u2019s Daily Diary \u2014 not for any reason, just for fun \u2014 and he was dieting. He ate like a very Nineties, cottage cheese-starvation diet. And then he ordered a pizza for dinner.\u00a0  \t           \tIt\u2019s so great you see that stuff. I had to go check on Hoover for October 29th, 1929, which was the day the stock market crashed. And I saw that at 4 o\u2019clock, he had to attend a cocktail reception for something. And that would have been right when the stock market was closing. And I thought, he probably had a couple [drinks at] that cocktail reception. He probably had a few.\u00a0  Yes, I hope so. One of the most surprising things I found in Woodrow Wilson\u2019s letters was when he wrote to his wife, \u201cI will assail you with my lovemaking.\u201d\u00a0  \tThat\u2019s fantastic. Speaking of Woodrow Wilson, there was something [about his biography] that made its way into The American President\u2026 Did Wilson have a girlfriend?\u00a0  He did, yes. And about six months after promising to \u201cassail\u201d his wife Ellen, she died \u2014 and he married that girlfriend.  \tThe assailing didn\u2019t go as well as you\u2019d hope. I\u2019m just going to be going around today telling people I\u2019m going to assail them with my lovemaking.\u00a0  Honestly, I use that line all the time. It\u2019s a good reminder that presidents are people, too. You remind us of that constantly \u2014 though I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true anymore. I just testified before Congress, and my depressing takeaway was that there\u2019s no there there. But anyway \u2014  \tYes, yes, I think having the \u201cthe there there\u201d is as important as, you know, as the intellect and confidence. You know, I have a daughter, and ever since she was born 24 years ago, I\u2019ve believed that the easiest thing in the world to do is for one parent to empathize with another parent. If you tell me you\u2019re a parent, I feel like I know the important stuff about you already. So, when we were separating kids from their parents at the border, I just thought, \u201cThis can\u2019t be. Is there there there? Anybody? You\u2019re a parent? You can\u2019t do that. You just can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0  That\u2019s what\u2019s different about your presidents \u2014 they\u2019re Sisyphian in their beliefs that they can do good.\u00a0  \tSysphian is right, well put. A bunch of the stuff that fell away from that 350-page screenplay became the opening of the pilot episode of The West Wing, and I told the cast, these people are going to fail as often as they\u2019re gonna succeed. They\u2019re gonna slip on banana peels, but they\u2019re always gonna be trying to do the right thing.\u00a0  Shepherd\u2019s a political anomaly \u2014 a widower, a single dad, and somehow untouchable because of it. Do you think someone like that could survive the modern political crucible and actually win the White House today? Would that still command respect, or is that impossible to imagine today?\u00a0            \tIf a widower were to run today, particularly if that widower was the Democrat, somehow the candidate would be responsible for their spouse\u2019s death. The boundaries wouldn\u2019t be there. Is this forever? I don\u2019t know. Maybe we\u2019re just in this period of darkness. But that\u2019s the way it is today.\u00a0  When you wrote The American President, who did you imagine the viewers \u2014 or the electorate \u2014 to be? The voters in that world seemed grounded in kitchen-table concerns: the economy, their kids\u2019 futures, a basic faith that government might still work for them. Do you see a difference between that imagined electorate and the one you\u2019d write for now?  \tI\u2019m a sports fan, and one of the things team sports is great for is having completely irrational likes and dislikes, right? I truly love the city of Boston. I love being there. I love everything about Boston. So, why do I hate them when they\u2019re playing the Yankees? It\u2019s just the way it is. I\u2019m a Yankees fan, they\u2019ve got the Red Sox, they\u2019ve got the Celtics, who I hate. And these irrational likes and dislikes make watching sports more fun. This has become our politics, but much more serious. People vote for the candidate that is going to piss off their enemies.\u00a0  And there\u2019s a crisis of authenticity today that Shepherd never suffered from \u2014 he was always unmistakably himself. Trump, for all his chaos, struck many voters as the most authentic option. So I wonder how you think Shepherd\u2019s sincerity and steadiness would play with today\u2019s electorate. Would authenticity still resonate?\u00a0  \tI think that if we were having this conversation 10 years ago, before [Trump riding down] the escalator [in 2015], it would be a much different conversation. During Covid, I binged every Netflix documentary about cults \u2014 NXIVM and the Way Down Cult and Sarah Lawrence, everything. And what they all have in common is this weird, passionate devotion to an utterly unremarkable person. That\u2019s where I feel we are now. I see the man-on-the-street interviews where people are calling Donald Trump authentic and honest, and he means what he says, [I think] you got to be kidding me. What\u2019s new is this strange, cult-like devotion to the very last person who would deserve it. The electorate changed, and I\u2019m not good at explaining what changed it. Maybe the left drove people out of their minds.\u00a0      \t \t\tTrending Stories \t \t       \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tFCC Chairman Shares Trump Post Calling for NBC to Fire Seth Meyers \u2018Immediately\u2019\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tR.E.M., Hootie, Black Crowes Supergroup Tells All: Meet Howl Owl Howl\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t\u2018The Next Wave in the Opioid Crisis\u2019: A New Drug Stronger Than Fentanyl Is Taking Off\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe Fast Rise, Long Decline, and Agonizing Downfall of the MTV Empire\t\t \t         \tLook, [The American President] is a romantic comedy, but the two political issues at the heart of it were guns and the environment, right?

The heroes I wrote in those two stories, they did things even though it would cost them popularity, which is not something you see professional politicians of either party do very often.

{"date":"2025-11-16","content":"Gunning for Threadripper's crown.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Intel is currently preparing a serious rival to AMD's Threadripper 9000WX series: Granite Rapids-WS. The company has been mainly out of competition with AMD in the server market, with Granite Rapids restoring core parity between the two only last year. Granite Rapids-WS now looks to gain even more ground with potentially class-leading specs in the workstation space. Seasoned leaker momomo_us has seemingly found out every SKU that will be part of this lineup, along with a few details that can help us speculate. According to the post and its reply, Granite Rapids-WS will reportedly have at least 11 models in total, with the Xeon 698X being the flagship, clocked at 2.0 GHz (base), and carrying 336 MB of combined cache. On the other hand, the Xeon 634 will be the lowest-end offering, with only a 48 MB cache pool and a base clock of 2.7 GHz. We didn't get specific core counts, but it's reasonable to expect Intel's next-gen \"extreme\" Xeon chips to top out at 128 cores, since the current-gen 6980P also rocks the same config, which the 698X is likely an offshoot of. GNR-WS \ud83e\udd14678X : 2.40GHz 192M676X : 2.80GHz 144M674X : 3.00GHz 144M658X : 3.00GHz 144M656 : 2.90GHz 72M654 : 3.10GHz 72M638 : 3.20GHz 72M636 : 3.50GHz 48M634 : 2.70GHz 48MNovember 15, 2025 To achieve such a high core count, Intel uses three compute tiles, and the same layout on Granite Rapids-WS should allow it to pass even the flagship Threadripper 9995WX's mighty 96 cores. On the server side, EPYC 9965 has Xeon beat, though, so the Blue Team can pull a reverse and take the lead in the workstation market. Granite Rapids-WS is expected to be fabricated on the Intel 3 process and will work on the company's W980 platform. The architecture itself has tough competition ahead, considering how efficient Zen 5 is. One chip from the GNR-WS lineup already has its first benchmarks out in the wild, thanks to an early GeekBench listing spotted by BenchLeaks. The mid-tier Xeon 654 scored 2,634 points in the single-core test and 14,743 points in the multi-core test. More importantly, we find out that this chip has 18 cores and 32 threads. Interestingly, there's no 18-core SKU in the Granite Rapids server series, so we don't have a direct point of reference. The processor boosted to 4.77 GHz with a minimum reported speed of 2.9 GHz, close enough to the 3.1 GHz base clocks the leak mentioned.      Unfortunately, that's where the details end and speculation begins. A couple of months ago, we covered another Granite Rapids-WS chip with 86 cores and 172 threads, operating at 4.8GHz \u2014 we can now safely assume that was the Xeon 678X. Granite Rapids-WS seems to have significantly less cache across the board, likely to manage costs for a workstation audience, compared to data centers that can pay much more. Intel's next-gen Xeons are shaping up nicely against AMD's Threadripper, with heated competition on the horizon for the first time in a while.

But the book, Booms, Busts and Market Cycles, written by Maneesh Dangi and published by penguin is unlike the other books in this genre. The book presents the brutal reality of stock market investing without couching it in softer tones. It bursts myths in investing such as -- investing for long-term always pays or the power of compounding is infallible. It doesn\u2019t hesitate to tell us that heroes such as Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Warren Buffett also have feet of clay. But what sets it apart is the strong philosophical undertone. It stresses on the need to be self-aware before beginning to invest. As Dangi writes, \u201cphilosophy is not a retreat from investing reality. It is its highest, most necessary preparation.\u201d It reflects the deep understanding of market and investing that Dangi has gained through his long career as an analyst and fund manager. Some of the ideas are so deep that they may have to be read twice to be properly understood. He presents his ideas in an interesting format, in a series of essays and conversations, with characters ranging from Buddha and Mahaveer to Thanos of Avengers and Vijay of Agneepath. The initial part of the book on the philosophy of investing is very interesting and will be quite invaluable to new investors. \u201cIf one looks at investing from the lens of Buddhism, it is about being mindful of the market, aware of every twist and turn and observing every economic data with full attention, without getting emotional about it and not reacting to it like our monkey mind would have us do, but simply assimilating all of it\u2026 watching the market as if it were a mindful meditation and then, at times, before we act, acting as if it needed us to pour infinite attention and reason to do so.\u201d At a time when there is an overload of information and a penchant to react to every small news, slowing down and going into a meditative state that enhances concentration may be the key. As Dangi writes, \u201cAwareness, not analysis, holds the key to the right action.\u201d What stands out in the book is the honesty with which the author has written about stock market investing. Instead of singing paeans about all those who became billionaires through stock markets, he writes that in \u201cdefault mode, failure is not an accident, it is the norm. This book documents the many ways you can fail. Failure is an integral part of investing. An investor must not only learn from his own failures and mistakes but also from others.\u201d He asks readers to not obsess with data and stick to rigid structures in investing. \u201cNot all truth screams from spreadsheets. Some whisper in instincts. To invest well is to know when numbers lie.\u201d He says that it is alright to be unsure and afraid. If being superstitious and praying to God helps, he asks investors to do just that. For, \u201csuperstition is both an acknowledgement of the error in the neat equation and a cure for fear of the wilderness. An acceptance that anything can happen\u2026 In the streets of medical science it has been given another name, placebo.\u201d The warning about logical fallacies is especially important at a time when the entire investing fraternity is raving about the potential of AI. The author points out that logical fallacies arise when we take a leap from seemingly sound premises to conclusions that aren\u2019t guaranteed. He warns about the false bridge created by using \u2018thus\u2019 in an argument. The book has many valuable lessons for investors. For instance, Dangi writes that while investing in stocks, it is best to accumulate slowly and exit fast as soon as the news turns adverse. However, for fund managers or a macro speculator, the strategy should be to buy fast and sell slowly. This is because when there is panic in the market, prices tend to collapse very quickly, and the moment needs to be seized. But rallies tend to get extended in Indian markets so exits can be gradual. The author also advises leaving some cash, some slack and some humility in the portfolio, given the unpredictable nature of markets, and using stop losses to survive the market. The mantra that has worked best for the author is buying based on valuation and selling based on macros. The narrative is a little jumpy in parts. But the brief introduction before each essay helps summarise the key ideas. A little more expansion of the ideas put forth in the book would have helped younger readers, who may find it more difficult to absorb the concepts. But overall, the book is a treat for those who have been closely connected to the stock market over the years and have the intellectual honesty to acknowledge its fallacies.

Once prized for their durability and utility, modern SUVs now sell just as much on vibe as they do on versatility. But here\u2019s the catch: all that comfort, capability, and curb appeal? It comes at a price, one that\u2019s often a lot higher than you\u2019d expect. Sure, the base model might fit your budget\u2026 until you add the trim you actually want, the features you thought came standard, and the maintenance that comes with moving two tons of metal. Let\u2019s get something straight: this isn\u2019t a list of the\u00a0worst\u00a0SUVs, and we\u2019re not here to bash your favorite ride. We\u2019re just calling out the ones that tend to cost more than people expect\u2014whether it\u2019s from expensive options, higher-than-average maintenance, or long-term ownership surprises that creep up like a check engine light at the worst possible time. We picked\u00a014 SUVs\u00a0because that\u2019s the number we couldn\u2019t ignore. These were the ones that kept showing up in owner forums, long-term cost reports, and mechanic horror stories. Some of them look like a bargain up front\u2014until you add the trim level that makes it livable. Others just love spending time on a lift. Either way, this list is here to help you go in with your eyes open, not your wallet wide. The BMW X5 represents a sweet spot between luxury and performance, drawing buyers with its athletic styling and refined interior. Starting prices appear reasonable for a premium German SUV, often beginning around the mid-$60,000 range. Yet real-world purchases rarely stay at that number. Adding must-have packages like the M Sport trim, upgraded sound systems, and adaptive suspension can push totals well beyond $80,000. Routine maintenance also comes at a premium due to the vehicles complex engineering, and buyers often forget how pricey insurance becomes for such a high-value model. In many ways, the X5 feels worth it, delivering technology and comfort at the level of high-end sedans. Still, it requires a willingness to go well beyond base numbers for the experience BMW promises. Insurance premiums for the X5 average between $3,000 and $3,500 per year, reflecting its luxury status and advanced technology. These costs often rise further for performance trims like the M50i, making it one of the more expensive midsize SUVs to insure. Mercedes-Benz designed the GLE for drivers seeking style and prestige, but ownership quickly exceeds what most expect. With starting prices hovering near $63,000, the GLE tempts with its luxurious cabin and smooth ride. Buyers who add advanced driver-assistance systems, upgraded infotainment, and premium upholstery see their costs climb sharply, often crossing the $80,000 threshold. The GLE\u2019s sophisticated systems also mean higher-than-average upkeep, with routine servicing priced above mainstream options. Insurance premiums reflect its luxury classification, adding to long-term expenses. Resale values are respectable but do not fully offset depreciation over the first few years. Drivers appreciate its commanding presence and elegant execution, yet the GLE illustrates how one can easily underestimate what it takes to fully enjoy a luxury SUV of this caliber. The Audi Q7 blends modern technology with understated luxury, making it a favorite among families seeking refinement. Starting around $60,000, it appears to compete fairly with other midsize luxury SUVs. However, the packages most buyers want including the Prestige trim, premium sound systems, and advanced safety suites raise costs significantly, with many models sold closer to $80,000. Its fuel economy trails some competitors, adding steady expenses at the pump. Insurance also trends high, particularly for trims loaded with technology. Repairs and parts often require specialized service, contributing to increased ownership costs. The Q7 rewards drivers with an impressive driving experience, thoughtful technology, and a versatile interior. Still, those shopping on initial pricing alone quickly discover how easily Audi transforms this SUV into a much larger investment. The Range Rover Velar radiates sophistication with its minimalist design and upscale materials, appealing to those who want a luxury badge without committing to the flagship Range Rover. Entry prices sit near $62,000, though most buyers aim for trims that climb toward $80,000 or beyond. Land Rovers extensive menu of personalization options from premium paint to upgraded seating makes it easy to stretch budgets. Complex electronics and air suspension systems increase servicing demands, often requiring specialized care. Fuel efficiency also lags compared to rivals, further inflating ongoing costs. Ownership comes with a sense of prestige and exclusivity, yet the true financial picture becomes clear only after accounting for add-ons, upkeep, and insurance. The Velar delivers striking design and luxury, but at a far greater cost than its starting price suggests. Volvos XC90 delivers a Scandinavian approach to luxury, emphasizing comfort, safety, and restrained elegance. It starts near $57,000, appearing competitive for a seven-seat SUV. However, selecting the popular Inscription or Recharge trims quickly sends pricing past $75,000. The plug-in hybrid version provides appealing fuel savings but adds considerable upfront cost. Maintenance, particularly for hybrid components, also proves more expensive than anticipated. Insurance rates reflect the SUVs high-tech safety features and luxury positioning, increasing overall costs. The XC90\u2019s minimalist yet premium interior wins admiration, as does its reputation for advanced safety. Families love the space and amenities, though most underestimate how high pricing climbs when opting for the configurations that make the XC90 feel truly complete. It is a refined and rewarding choice, but one that stretches budgets. The Lexus LX builds on Toyotas legacy of durability while embracing full-fledged luxury. Starting near $93,000, it already sits at the upper edge of premium SUV pricing. Buyers seeking a modern cabin often add optional entertainment systems, advanced off-road technology, and upgraded leather, which can push totals well above $110,000. While Lexus is known for reliability, routine maintenance and fuel costs remain substantial for an SUV of this size. Insurance for the LX generally starts near $3,200 annually and can climb for upper trims with added off-road technology and luxury packages. Combined with its fuel use and maintenance needs, these premiums make the LX a long-term financial commitment. Resale value softens the impact slightly but does not offset the steep initial outlay. The LX appeals to drivers wanting capability and prestige in a single package, though that combination comes with a price tag that consistently exceeds what many initially expect to spend. The Cadillac Escalade stands as a symbol of American luxury, with a road presence few rivals can match. It enters the market at around $81,000, yet real-world configurations often cross into six figures. Adding premium sound, advanced driver-assistance technology, and extended-wheelbase variants increases costs substantially. Fuel consumption remains one of the highest in its class, adding ongoing expenses that compound its total cost of ownership. Maintenance and insurance also run above average, reflecting the SUVs size and luxury classification. Buyers are captivated by its cutting-edge infotainment and commanding style, but that excitement carries financial weight. The Escalade embodies modern opulence with space and technology to spare, though anyone considering it must prepare for a final cost far beyond its opening number. The Lincoln Navigator combines classic American luxury with contemporary design, offering a serene ride and immense interior space. Prices begin near $84,000, but desirable trims with extended seating and luxury packages easily exceed $100,000. Adding premium entertainment features, adaptive suspension, and top-tier leather elevates pricing quickly. Fuel efficiency trails smaller SUVs, leading to significant ongoing costs, particularly for frequent drivers. Insurance and routine maintenance reflect its size and status, contributing to a total that surprises many owners. The Navigator delivers a sense of elegance and quiet confidence, perfectly suited for families who want both prestige and practicality. It is a rewarding choice, but only for those prepared to handle the financial realities of owning such a large, fully equipped luxury SUV. The Jeep Grand Wagoneer reclaims its position as a flagship American SUV, merging rugged character with luxurious touches. Priced from about $93,000, it competes directly with established luxury players. Buyers often select upper trims that push the cost toward $110,000, especially when adding advanced driver aids and premium interior upgrades. Its powerful engine provides confident performance but results in heavy fuel usage, increasing long-term expenses. Insurance and maintenance also reflect its luxury positioning and intricate systems. The Grand Wagoneer impresses with a spacious interior, extensive technology, and an air of heritage, making it a desirable choice for buyers who want more than just utility. Yet it stands as a clear example of how quickly initial assumptions about pricing can be exceeded. The Porsche Cayenne offers sports-car excitement in an SUV form, attracting drivers who value performance above all else. Starting around $80,000, it quickly becomes a six-figure vehicle when performance packages, upgraded brakes, and bespoke interiors enter the picture. Maintenance and insurance are costly, reflecting its high-performance capabilities and German engineering. Porsche Cayenne\u2019s insurance costs around $3,500 per year, rising sharply for higher-performance configurations. Its sports-car DNA means even small repairs require premium parts and specialized service, influencing both insurance rates and upkeep expenses. The Cayenne chugs down high octane fuel (of course, only the most expensive) like someone who has just found water in the desert. Depreciation hits harder on models with unique customizations, influencing long-term value. The Cayenne\u2019s athletic handling and premium cabin make it an exhilarating choice for those wanting the Porsche experience without sacrificing practicality. However, the real cost extends far beyond base numbers, particularly for those who wish to unlock its full performance and personalization potential. The Genesis GV80 challenges traditional luxury brands with competitive pricing and upscale features. It begins around $57,000, creating an impression of affordability. Yet popular trims with advanced driver-assistance technology, upgraded audio, and premium seating easily cross $70,000. Maintenance and fuel costs remain significant due to the GV80s size and technology. Insurance pricing reflects its premium positioning, while depreciation runs steeper than some German competitors. Buyers value its elegant design, intuitive technology, and strong warranty coverage, but those advantages come with added costs when choosing the features that make the GV80 feel truly luxurious. It captures attention as an alternative to pricier European models, though the final tally often surprises buyers who expected the value story to remain intact across every configuration. The Infiniti QX80 combines brawny capability with a luxury badge, appealing to buyers who want size and status. Its starting price near $76,000 feels approachable for a full-size luxury SUV. However, adding advanced entertainment systems, upgraded leather, and optional driver-assistance packages raises prices close to $90,000. Its powerful engine translates to high fuel consumption, and routine maintenance reflects the complexity of its design. Insurance premiums align with its size and luxury status, further straining budgets. Buyers appreciate its spacious cabin and confident performance, yet many underestimate what ownership truly entails. The QX80 offers a compelling package for large families or those who need towing capability, but it demands a willingness to absorb long-term costs that exceed what its entry-level pricing suggests. The Acura MDX Type S introduces a performance edge to a family-friendly SUV. Priced around $68,000, it appeals to buyers who want athletic handling alongside luxury amenities. Adding packages for enhanced audio, upgraded seating, and adaptive suspension quickly pushes costs closer to $75,000. Maintenance is higher than the standard MDX due to performance-oriented components. Insurance pricing also reflects its more powerful engine and elevated positioning within Acuras lineup. While fuel economy remains competitive, drivers pay a premium for the added thrill and advanced features. The MDX Type S stands out by offering sporty dynamics without fully entering the German luxury price bracket, though the numbers still climb faster than many expect when aiming for its best-equipped configurations. The Toyota Sequoia Capstone combines Toyota\u2019s reliability with near-luxury amenities. Starting near $80,000, it offers an appealing alternative to traditional luxury SUVs. Buyers who add advanced towing packages, upgraded audio, and extra safety features can see costs approach $90,000. Fuel economy remains modest, leading to higher long-term expenses for frequent drivers. Insurance premiums are also elevated compared to Toyotas mainstream offerings, reflecting the Sequoias upscale features.\u00a0 Maintenance stays manageable but rises for hybrid versions due to complex components. The Capstone trim transforms the Sequoia into a refined full-size SUV with a comfortable interior and advanced technology. It delivers significant value for those who want a capable, upscale Toyota, but the true price of ownership often surprises those expecting a purely budget-friendly experience. SUVs offer unmatched flexibility, but their true cost often goes well beyond the sticker on the window. Between trims, tech packages, fuel bills, and maintenance surprises, what starts as a practical purchase can turn into a financial curveball. That\u2019s why doing your homework up front isn\u2019t just smart, it\u2019s essential. Take the time to compare models, dig into ownership costs, and be honest about what you actually\u00a0need\u00a0versus what just looks good on the lot. Don\u2019t let slick sales pitches or fancy extras talk you into stretching beyond your comfort zone. A little planning now can help you enjoy all the perks of SUV ownership, without the buyer\u2019s remorse later. After all, the only thing that should surprise you after buying an SUV is how often your friends ask you to help them move. 12 Vans That Secretly Make Great DIY Campers 12 Times Mazda Nailed Proportions Better Than BMW 14 SUVs That Will Cost You More Than You Think The Most Affordable New EVs That Don\u2019t Feel Cheap The 15 Most Legendary NASCAR Liveries Ever About Us | Contact Us\u00a0 | Disclaimer Editorial Policy | Privacy Policy\u00a0 | Terms and ConditionsThis website contains affiliate links to trusted partners.Guessing Headlights, Beavercreek, Ohio 45430 \u00a9 2025 Guessing Headlights | ALL RIGHTS RESERVED","label":0}
