{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"You\u2019ve seen it on social media: \u201cThis $15,000 Chinese EV will DESTROY the auto industry!!\u201d In fact, 2025 was to be the year when electric vehicles reached global price parity with gasoline cars in their segments: They\u2019d cost the same, regardless of whether they had an engine or a battery with electric motors. In North America, that didn\u2019t happen. As US vehicle prices continue to soar, it begs the question: When will the US get EVs that are more affordable, as cheap as gas cars, to make mass-market shoppers pay attention? They face new headwinds: The $7,500 national EV purchase incentive ended September 30. That month brought the highest ever EV sales\u2014and many predictions of doom to follow. Let's define \u201caffordable\u201d as around $30,000. The average new vehicle in the US now sells for an eye-watering $50,080, and that number will likely rise. Cheaper EVs are coming, though not as fast as they have in Europe and China. WIRED spoke to industry analysts as well as executives at Ford, General Motors, Kia, and others about how they see the market, and, crucially, when we\u2019ll have affordable EVs in volume. Every maker is keenly aware of the global threat posed by Chinese contenders like BYD. The existential question is whether non-Chinese makers will innovate fast enough to be competitive when today\u2019s tariff barriers ultimately fall. There are three basic ways automakers can cut EV prices and still make money: First, radically simplify the vehicle and build process; second, use far cheaper batteries; and third, make vehicles smaller. Most makers combine elements of all three approaches, but stress one or another. Ford CEO Jim Farley has been vocal about how good Chinese EVs are, after six months with a Chinese Xiaomi SU7 as his daily driver in Detroit. He said last October he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to give it back,\u201d and he acknowledges that Ford must compete globally with the best of those companies. He\u2019s also said Ford won\u2019t build and sell any EV on which it can\u2019t make money within a year. For that reason, Ford killed a planned midsize EV crossover and delayed the opening of a second battery plant. Then in August, it announced an entirely new, radically simpler EV platform. In interviews with Farley and Ford\u2019s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field, they told WIRED the company\u2019s \u201cskunk works\u201d in Southern California rethought every aspect of designing and manufacturing an EV to lower costs, streamline development, and simplify assembly. The first of its new vehicles will be a 2028 electric pickup truck roughly the size of the current Ford Maverick, possibly called the Ranchero. It\u2019ll come from a retooled assembly plant in Louisville, Kentucky, in the second half of 2027. Its platform will spawn two further EVs, now scheduled for 2028: replacements for the current full-size Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup and the Ford e-Transit commercial van. Field told WIRED the group started with a \u201cclean-sheet process\u201d untethered to Ford\u2019s traditional development process. Small teams will now design different aspects of the car concurrently and collaboratively, rather than handing off from one team to the next. They looked hard at every single component or assembly, stripping each down to the bare essentials. \u201cThe best part is no part,\u201d said Field. The company, Farley told WIRED, is investing heavily in large die castings, similar to those used by Tesla, in which giant cast structures replace dozens of smaller stampings welded together. The new vehicles will also use \u201cstructural batteries,\u201d meaning the metal top of the battery case serves as the vehicle\u2019s floor. Seats and carpets are installed directly on top of the pack. The rethought assembly process is a \u201ctree\u201d rather than a traditional line: \u201cThree different lines feed into a relatively short end of line.\u201d Field characterized those processes as \u201cthe front, the middle, and the rear.\u201d Overall, the new process will supposedly eliminate one-third of existing fasteners and 130 separate stations from the process. Farley said the combined effect of fewer parts and simpler assembly improves production speed by 40 percent over a comparable internal-combustion vehicle from the Louisville plant. Field\u2019s team also focused on cutting aerodynamic drag to the absolute minimum, to use battery energy most efficiently. A reduction of \u201cone count [0.01] of Cd [drag coefficient] is worth $25 of battery,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed by this,\u201d Field told WIRED. Farley added that in the future, Ford's \u201cbattery could be so small, so much smaller\u201d than a battery in a comparable BYD model that the lower cost would potentially offset BYD\u2019s advantage from vertical integration. Earlier this year, Ford told analysts it has also benchmarked the best and lowest-cost EV parts makers in the world, meaning it may add new suppliers from outside the traditional industry ecosystem. In the summer, it also asked its existing EV suppliers to reduce costs. Producing modern battery cells is complex and very expensive; economies of scale are crucial. That\u2019s why most EV makers first bought cells from the biggest, most experienced global makers: Panasonic, LG Energy Solutions, and CATL. Only later did makers form joint ventures to bring cell fabrication in-house. Tesla was first, as it often is. The least expensive battery chemistry is lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP), invented in the US but extensively developed by Chinese scientists over 25 years. It uses none of the metals (cobalt, manganese, nickel) that make today\u2019s cells expensive\u2014iron ore is cheap and plentiful\u2014but its energy density is roughly 30 percent lower by weight. It\u2019s taken 15 years of development for LFP cells to reach a density that gives US vehicles adequate range. Although General Motors has two joint-venture NMCA (nickel manganese cobalt aluminum) cell plants with its partner LG, none of the dozen EVs it now offers has LFP batteries. The upcoming 2027 Chevrolet Bolt, built in Kansas, will be its first to use LFP cells in volume. It\u2019s a refreshed Bolt EUV (electric utility vehicle) with an entirely new battery, motors, and power electronics, and 265 miles of range. Cells will be imported from CATL in China until its Ultium plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, starts to make LFP cells by late 2027. GM\u2019s EV sales have quietly surged this year: It\u2019s on track to become the second-highest-volume seller of EVs in the US after Tesla. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, with a version starting around $36,500\u2014below the crucial $40K mark\u2014is now selling close to 10,000 units a month, In a Bolt press release, Chevy said, \u201cTogether, Bolt and Equinox EV are expected to account for most of Chevrolet\u2019s 2026 EV volume\u201d\u2014suggesting it believes buyers will be there for affordable EVs. GM revealed its longer-term battery strategy back in May. Within a few years, Ultium Cells plants will manufacture cells based on a revised chemistry dubbed LMR, for \u201clithium manganese-rich.\u201d The company says the chemistry provides one-third higher energy density than comparable LFP cells\u2014but at the cost of LFP. It\u2019s targeting full-volume production in 2028. Ford, too, is creating a battery plant to make prismatic LFP cells for future EVs. The site in Marshall, Michigan, has attracted political opposition amid controversy over Ford\u2019s decision to license intellectual property for those cells from CATL, China\u2019s largest battery company. Ford pushed back on the criticism, arguing that America needs LFP batteries to lower EV costs and \u201creshore\u201d a technology initially invented in the US. GM, meanwhile, says the IP in its LFP cells is fully owned by the two Ultium partners, LG and itself. So far, Hyundai-Kia has not said it will offer LFP cells in any of its US EVs. The release date of its 2026 Kia EV4 compact sedan, expected in 2026, is now \u201cdelayed until further notice\u201d due to \u201cchanged market conditions.\u201d The EV4 was thought to be priced in the mid $30,000s. No VW Group brands, Toyota, Nissan, or other EV makers selling in the US have announced LFP plans. The largest single segment in the US market is small crossover SUVs. Future low-cost EVs will be \u201cthe same subcompact and compact segments we know today,\u201d says Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cThe larger the vehicle, the higher the cost, and the larger the battery it needs.\u201d New low-cost EVs can\u2019t be much smaller than today\u2019s small SUVs, and yet they have to remain utility vehicles. The 2026 Nissan Leaf and the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt fit this mold (kind of): They\u2019re tall hatchbacks with the \u201cpresence\u201d and \u201cstance\u201d of SUVs, minus all-wheel drive. The new Leaf S+ starts at $31,485 including mandatory destination fee\u2014and offers an EPA-rated 303 miles of range. The more popular mid-range SV+ still stickers below $36,000 for 288 miles, And Nissan promises a bare-bones Leaf S to come in below $30,000. When the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt LT hits dealers early next year, it will start at $29,990\u2014but a 1LT trim with fewer features will follow later in 2026 for $28,995. Another approach is to offer a very different vehicle at a very low headline cost. Startup Slate Auto plans to offer a $25,000 compact pickup truck that radically simplifies the vehicle: no central touchscreen (drivers mount their phones on the dash), one color (wraps are optional extras), no power accessories (the windows wind manually!). The basic vehicle is a two-door, two-seat, small pickup roughly the size of the gasoline and hybrid Ford Maverick. Slate may be onto something: Reportedly, Toyota is now planning its own smaller EV pickup models. The $25,000 \u201cBlank Slate\u201d version will have 150 miles of rated range. The sole factory option is a larger pack, at 84.3 kWh versus the base 52.7 kWh, to take range to an estimated 240 miles. Slate hasn\u2019t revealed a price for the bigger battery. A $5,000 accessory converts the two-seat pickup into a five-seat SUV, which can be installed by the owner (out of a flat pack) or by a distributor for a fee. The most popular Slate may cost around $35,000, if it ships by the end of 2026 as planned. Slate CEO Chris Barman told WIRED that every aspect of the truck and its production were designed to keep costs low. The decision to make one single model allows Slate to build EVs more efficiently by eliminating the complexity of multiple variants\u2014including paint. \u201cNot having metal stamping presses [for large body panels] and a paint shop saved Slate $350 million to $500 million,\u201d she said, based on a projected scale of up to 150,000 vehicles a year. Will the Slate, Bolt, Leaf, and Ford pickup be joined by other cheap EVs? Sam Fiorani, VP of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, is pessimistic. With the end of incentives, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t expect much growth in the entry-level EV market until around 2030 or later,\u201d he said. However, for analyst David Thomas of CDK Global, the question is whether shoppers seeking an affordable, efficient car will pick an EV from a known brand over a similarly priced Toyota Prius or Honda Civic Hybrid. A report from Urban Science cites key trends (rising consideration of EVs as more are seen on the road, more manufacturer deals, and better charging infrastructure) that will keep EV sales growing as reasons for optimism. The overarching factor defining when cheaper EVs will spread across the US is when Chinese mass EV makers will venture into North America\u2014the most prestigious and profitable global market they\u2019re not presently in. That seems unlikely before the end of the current president\u2019s final term. His first administration put in place steep tariffs on Chinese goods, which were left intact and later reinforced. Canada is a possible wild card; it is rumored to be considering the end of all barriers to Chinese EV imports. Any foreign maker faces unique challenges in the US market. They\u2019re not insurmountable, as Japanese makers and then Hyundai-Kia showed, but they require decade-long commitments and billions of dollars. As such, several reasons affect the kinds and prices of Chinese EVs that will be sold in the US. First, to make new-car buyers aware of your brand inevitably costs an awful lot of time and money. For example, Kia's digital ad spend in the US alone reached $142 million in 2021, 28 years after starting to sell cars in the country. Makers must barrage consumers with ads to let brand awareness sink in, most intensely in the short window when they\u2019re actively shopping. Second, North Americans drive much bigger vehicles and more SUVs than cars. A 17- to 20-foot Ford F-150 pickup weighing 2 to 3 tons is largely unsellable in much of the rest of the world. Truck buyers are also more brand loyal, and more focused on towing specs than are shoppers for passenger cars and SUVs. That\u2019s tough for affordable EVs. Meanwhile, US sales of \u201ccompact\u201d cars\u2014a VW Golf or Jetta, say\u2014have fallen as trucks and SUVs take over the market. Third, US drivers log more miles each day on average than drivers in Europe, Britain, Japan, Korea, or China. American vehicles cover 33 miles a day on average in the US. A comparable figure for China is 28 miles, and just 20 miles for the European Union. Which means that range is paramount. The current state of on-road EV fast charging in the US is hardly stellar. On a six-hour, 350-mile journey to visit relations, one charging stop may be OK, even if it\u2019s longer than a fueling stop, but two or three isn\u2019t. Nor is hunting for a working station. Hence, higher range is mandatory\u2014meaning higher-capacity batteries at greater cost. In other markets, a 150-mile EV may be a sensible choice. Trains are often faster for longer trips anyhow. Not so in the States. Shoppers will only consider EVs that offer \u201cenough\u201d range, which GM surveys show is minimum 300 miles, to ensure an EV can do every trip a gas vehicle can. Crucially, the Chinese test cycle for determining EV range, known as China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC), is even more biased toward lower speeds and stop-and-go city driving than the European version, WLTP\u2014and neither is as grueling as US EPA range ratings. That \u201c300-mile Chinese EV\u201d might well be rated up to one-third lower on the EPA cycle. For these reasons, many inexpensive EVs now on sale in Europe and China aren\u2019t well suited to North American life. Then there\u2019s the issue of \u201cFederalization\u201d: fitting equipment to comply with US motor-vehicle rules, plus safety structures to ace Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash performance ratings. This makes all US vehicles larger, heavier, and pricier. Analysts vary in their predictions for low-cost EVs and the impact of Chinese models. S&P Global\u2019s Brinley notes \u201cthe timing is far from clear,\u201d and Chinese makers\u2019 ability to replicate the same low-cost structure they enjoy at home is unknown. The final word comes from China automotive hand Michael Dunne, of Dunne Strategies. In the UK, he noted, Chinese EVs\u2014led by BYD and MG\u2014are roughly 15 percent cheaper than Japanese and Korean models. They\u2019ve captured 13 percent of the new-car market, which dealers expect to double or more within two years. \u201cThe Chinese don\u2019t have to be scary cheap,\u201d Dunne said. \u201cThey just need to be priced low enough to make you pause\u2014then take a closer look.\u201d With Chinese EVs blocked from the US for the short term, buyers\u2019 best hope right now for cheaper EVs lies in the incremental advances that produced 120 years of auto-industry innovation. Cheaper batteries that improve at roughly 8 percent a year; simpler design and assembly processes; and smaller, more basic cars will all play roles. Shoppers will see more offerings below $40,000, and within a few years, under $30,000. Will there be 300-mile SUVs for $15,000, as social-media blurbs trumpet? Not any time soon. Consider the frequent best-selling electric model in China, the $6,200 Wuling Hongguang Mini EV. Its sales alone are more than double the total of every EV sold by GM in the US. It\u2019s also just 10 feet long in its four-door version, tops out at 62 mph, and has a range of 75 to 100 miles based on the old, very gentle NEDC driving cycle. American buyers won\u2019t buy a vehicle like that. The BYD Seagull, now on sale in Europe, is a better candidate, but it\u2019s still rated at only 190 or 250 miles of range on a gentler test regime, and it\u2019s just 12 feet, 4 inches long. Known as the Dolphin Surf in European markets, it costs $25,000 to $30,000 there versus its Chinese price of half that amount\u2014meaning a version that meets European requirements isn\u2019t that much cheaper than a new Bolt EV or Nissan Leaf. TL\/DR: Don\u2019t believe the clickbait. Cheap Chinese EVs present an existential threat to the world\u2019s automakers, no question. But you ain\u2019t getting a $15,000 compact SUV with 300 miles of EPA-rated range and US safety ratings anytime soon. The laws of physics haven\u2019t changed that much. Want an EV for $15K?

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"A newly public financial disclosure filing has put a spotlight on the stock trades of one of the Federal Reserve's recently departed governors. Adriana Kugler \u2014 who stepped down from her post as the Fed's governor in August after being appointed in 2023 \u2014 filed a financial disclosure form that ethics officials declined to certify and referred to the central bank's inspector general's office for review. The report, which Kugler filed with the US Office of Government Ethics in September, lists trades that she or her spouse repeatedly made in individual company stocks \u2014 including Apple, Cava Group, Southwest Airlines, and Caterpillar \u2014 that are restricted under ethics rules announced by the Fed in 2021, following trading controversies involving senior policymakers. These types of ethics reports are a standard requirement for senior officials and are normally certified by agency ethics officers. In Kugler's case, however, Sean Croston, the deputy associate general counsel, and designated agency ethics official at the Federal Reserve Board, said \"matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year by the Board's Ethics Office to the independent Office of Inspector General,\" in a comment on Kugler's public financial disclosure report on October 10, explaining why the OGE had declined certification. In an earlier report filed in September 2024, Kugler disclosed individual stock trades, and stated they were made by her husband, Ignacio Donoso, an immigration attorney and founder and managing partner of Donoso & Partners in Bethesda, Maryland. In Kugler's latest report, she said the trades occurred without her knowledge and, in a 2024 disclosure, reported and divested the holdings at the direction of ethics officials. Kugler and Donoso did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for a comment. Her 2025 filing lists individual stock sales of Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar, and CAVA Group, as well as other purchases made across 2024. Several of Kugler's 2024 trades appear to fall under restrictions in Fed ethics policy, which bars officials from trading individual stocks and making trades during \"blackout periods,\" when Fed officials are barred from trading before major monetary policy decisions are made. Kugler's disclosures were referred to the Office of the Inspector General in January of 2025, a Fed official told Business Insider, after additional compliance concerns came to light during ethics training sessions held last fall after Kugler's 2024 disclosure. In July 2025, Kugler discussed with officials \u2014 including Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 the possibility of a waiver from the Fed's pre-clearance and blackout-period trading restrictions to adjust her portfolio, according to the Fed official. Kugler ultimately did not attend the meeting, which occurred on July 28 and 29, citing personal reasons, the official said. On August 1, she announced her resignation from the Fed, effective August 8. Kugler also disclosed she received nearly $50,000 in pro bono legal work from Arnold & Porter in her filing. She returned to her role at Georgetown University on August 11, where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics, according to her biography on Georgetown's website.

You might be hugging your job, but the big boss \u2014 not so much. CEO departures across corporate America remain at record levels, while many everyday workers are clinging to their roles as they face a cooling job market, anxiety over AI, and a resurgent no-nonsense management style. The result is a corporate split screen: CEOs can generally roll out and land on their feet, while workers feel stuck, said Richard Smith, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. Unlike many rank-and-file employees who rely on regular paychecks and fear layoffs, erstwhile CEOs often have a financial cushion. That means they don't have to worry if they go a year or two without working, he said. \"As the old saying goes, it's good to be at the top,\" Smith told Business Insider. Whether it's worries about job security or just a painful hangover from the role-swapping frenzy of the Great Resignation, metrics like worker engagement and well-being are down. Smith, who runs the Human Capital Development Lab at Johns Hopkins, has surveyed US employees annually since 2019 and, in newly tabulated data from 2024 involving more than 1.3 million workers, found that managers and senior leaders reported greater rates of well-being than the average employee. That's a reversal, he said, from the early days of the pandemic, when managers reported lower well-being than workers as leaders were fretting over challenges like running remote teams. Smith said many workers are now grappling with quality-of-life concerns, such as return-to-office mandates. In other cases, some employees are feeling threatened by AI or otherwise sensing that employers' demands for their skills are softening. For many workers, he said, it's leading to a sense of, \"I can't make a move right now.\" CEOs, for various reasons, don't appear to be as constrained. By the end of September, 1,650 CEOs at US companies had departed, reports Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The 2025 exits are in line with 2024, which saw the highest annual level since the staffing and coaching firm began tracking CEO turnover in 2002. Some of the chiefs making moves have high profiles. Linda Yaccarino, who had been running X, stepped down in July. And Spotify's cofounder and CEO, Daniel Ek, plans to become executive chairman of the streaming service in January. On Friday, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, 59, said he would retire in January after about a decade in the role. CEOs' tenures are also getting shorter. Departing chiefs had been on the job 7.2 years as of the third quarter, less than the average of 8.4 years in 2021 and 2023, the leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates found. Not all CEOs give up their jobs because they want to, of course. Boards can be quick to oust underperformers because directors are under a lot of pressure from shareholders, Jesse Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider. The third quarter of 2025 saw record levels of global shareholder activism, Barclays reports. Broadly, CEOs have more things to juggle than leaders did decades ago, Fried said. \"The environment has become much more dynamic, which makes their job harder,\" he said. The exits come as those in the corner office are also generally getting paid more \u2014 a development that Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett assailed on Monday in a letter to shareholders. CEOs earned a median of 176.7 times what their typical employee made in 2020, rising to 194.5 times in 2024, the data firm Equilar found. Regardless, hefty pay packages can give CEOs a big cushion to fall back on if they get the boot \u2014 or simply get antsy. In many cases, Fried said, \"If they never want to work again, they can do that.\" Do you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.

Power outages leave you sitting in the dark with dead phones and spoiling food in the fridge while camping trips often mean sacrificing modern conveniences or lugging noisy generators. Jackery\u2019s Explorer 1000 portable power station solves both problems by delivering 1,500W of clean and quiet power that runs refrigerators, charges laptops and keeps essential devices operational wherever you need electricity. Amazon has slashed the price to $349 from the usual $699 for Black Friday, which marks an all-time low that undercuts even Prime Day pricing. This 50% discount makes backup power accessible at a price point where you\u2019d normally find much smaller capacity units with limited output capabilities. See at Amazon The 1,500W of continuous AC output tackles demanding appliances that smaller power stations can\u2019t touch: air conditioners, full-size refrigerators, electric kettles, and power tools. The 3,000W surge peak covers the inrush of power at startup for appliances with motors, which generally requires two to three times the running wattage for a brief moment. That surge capacity means you can cold-start a refrigerator or air conditioner without tripping the protection circuits on the power station-a problem that frequently occurs with underpowered portable generators. The battery capacity, 1,070Wh, translates to approximately 1.07 kilowatt-hours of stored energy-sufficient to keep an average refrigerator running for about 12 to 15 hours, charge a laptop eight to ten times, or run LED lights for days. This capacity sits in the sweet spot between smaller units that drain too quickly and larger systems that become impractical to move around. At just 23.8 pounds with a foldable handle, the power station remains genuinely portable rather than being a stationary unit that requires two people to relocate. Jackery fitted this model with LiFePO4 battery chemistry instead of the more conventional lithium-ion, which grants it much better longevity and safety characteristics. The LiFePO4 cells retain more than 70% of their original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, which equates to well over a decade of regular use before you\u2019d notice significant capacity degradation. The capability for one-hour fast charging requires the emergency charging mode, which can be turned on via the Jackery app and will push this power station from empty to full in sixty minutes when you need a quick turnaround. The default for the system is a 1.7-hour charging mode that optimizes battery health by reducing stress on the cells during charging, adding to the long lifespan. Port selection largely covers most device types: two USB-C ports providing 100W each, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC outlets. The 100W USB-C ports can charge modern laptops at full speed with no need for bulky power adapters, while pure sine wave AC output safely powers sensitive electronics like medical devices or audio equipment that can be damaged by modified sine wave inverters found in cheaper units. For sale at $349, this power station is half its regular price and brings with it capabilities that easily command between $600 to $800 in today\u2019s market.

It might sound like something out of a sci-fi flick, but Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk didn't flinch when asked whether Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, could one day house a human mind. At last week's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholder meeting, a question from the audience went straight for the philosophical jugular: \"Do you see a path for Optimus to have human consciousness downloaded to it?\" Musk didn't brush it off.

RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse \u2014 Just $0.81 a Share An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform \"It's not immediate,\" he said, before laying out the possibility. \"But if you say, down the road, would you be able to, say, with a Neuralink, have a snapshot of what is an approximate snapshot of somebody's mind and then upload that approximate snapshot to an Optimus body? I think that at some point, that technology becomes possible, and it's probably less than 20 years.\" Yes, he really said that. Less than 20 years from now, it may be possible to upload a digital copy of your mind\u2014memories, thoughts, personality quirks and all\u2014into a humanoid Tesla robot. Musk made sure to add that it wouldn't be a perfect replica. \"Of course you won't quite be the same,\" he said. \"You'll be a little different because you'll be in a robot body, and the mental snapshot will not be precise. It'll probably be pretty close, but not exactly the same.\" Trending: Bill Gates Says Climate Change \u2018Needs to Be Solved' \u2014 This Award-Winning Building Material Is Tackling It Head-On He even threw in a little philosophical curveball: \"On the other hand, are you the same person that you were five years ago? Nope. I mean a lot of things have changed, so\u2026\" So what's the takeaway? Elon Musk isn't saying you can log into your Optimus account next Tuesday and live forever. But he is suggesting that within two decades, it may be possible to create a digital version of your mind that could live on in one of his creations\u2014complete with a humanoid shell and a brain chip powered by Neuralink, another company of his that makes implantable brain-computer interfaces. Musk closed the thought with a line that summed up the whole idea: \"I guess at some point if you want to be uploaded to a robot body, my guess is that becomes possible.\" See Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

It's meant to look like a robot\u2014but one that can navigate the real world, interact with humans, and maybe, one day, house a digital mind. The potential is staggering\u2014and a little eerie. Would it really be you? Or just an imitation? A memory bank with facial recognition and a confident gait? Musk didn't address that. But the fact that he's entertaining the possibility\u2014with a timeline\u2014has already sparked a fresh wave of speculation, awe, and existential dread online. At the very least, it's one more sign that the line between man and machine isn't just theoretical anymore. And if Elon Musk has his way, it might not even be that far off.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"                 Reading time 7 minutes        Screenless fitness trackers can sometimes feel like they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing the job they set out to do. Sure, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no constant stream of data to obsess over every time you turn your wrist. But in the absence of that quick peek, I find myself opening a tracker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s companion app\u00e2\u0080\u0094constantly\u00e2\u0080\u0094to check on the data it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collected. In the end, I find myself spending more time staring at those charts and figures than if I took a look at the tiny screen on my wrist every now and again. So when I began testing the Polar Loop\u00e2\u0080\u0094a new screen-free wearable health and fitness band\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that excited. After all, the new product from Polar (the company that introduced the first wireless heart rate monitor nearly 50 years ago in 1977), almost exactly resembles the Whoop 5.0. In fact, the device, which came out in early September, has been nicknamed the subscription-free competitor to Whoop. The Polar Loop costs $199 and all its features are free in the accompanying\u00e2\u0080\u0094again, free\u00e2\u0080\u0094app. Whoop on the other hand, includes its band in the membership, but that starts at $199 a year and goes up from there. Polar Loop If you want a true break from all the distracting data some health trackers provide, but still want to track your basic health, the Polar Loop could be an ideal companion.  Pros Cons If you anticipate using your device for more than a year, the cost of a Whoop 5.0 really adds up whereas the Loop, literally, does not at all. I spent a few weeks training with the Loop, and in the end, what made me fall in love with it was less about the cost (which, obviously, is still crucial to making a decision about purchasing a wearable) and more about what the Loop does not do: dump tons of health and fitness data at you. If this sounds counterproductive, that is almost the point. If the goal of creating a screenless fitness tracker is to make you spend less time looking at the thing, and more time living your life, then the accompanying app should match that same tone. And there are almost no screenless wearables on the market today that do just that. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deep dive into more. Polar is a company that is no stranger to monitoring our health. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company introduced the first wireless heart rate monitor, the Sport Tester PE2000, which was initially designed for elite endurance athletes, particularly cross-country skiers. The design\u00e2\u0080\u0094a chest-strap transmitter connected to a wrist receiver watch\u00e2\u0080\u0094allowed for real-time monitoring without wires, which was revolutionary at the time. But a chest strap worn 24\/7 would annoy just about any regular person. These days, almost all heart rate tracking systems on the market use an optical heart rate monitor, which works by shining a light into the skin to detect changes in blood volume with each heartbeat. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much you can ascertain from your heart rate, and most wearables today use heart rate to track everything from sleep to step count to exercise and recovery. The Polar Loop is no different in this regard. The accompanying app, the Polar Flow, provides a detailed picture of your last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep and includes other basic metrics like step count and heart rate. The step count and heart rate lined up with what my Apple Watch was telling me (I often wore both of them at the same time, though not always). The sleep tracking also seemed to match with the Oura 4 Ceramic, which I was also testing at the time. While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to know for sure how accurate the sleep trackers are, as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the exact moment I fall asleep or wake up throughout the night, they seemed fairly in line with when I went to bed and woke up. During a few of the testing nights, my cat woke me up to get fed at around 4 a.m., and the Loop successfully tracked that wake-up and the fact that I fell back asleep as well. One aspect of the Loop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep tracker that I particularly liked was that it actually asks each morning how restful I thought last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep was (with a series of emojis ranging from a sad face to a happy face). So much of sleep tracking science is still a black box. Scientists don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet know enough about the correlation between time spent in various sleep stages and a good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest. So the basic question of how well rested you feel is still pertinent. While there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing you can actually do with that data right now, I still found it useful to reflect on my night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest rather than just rely on the app telling me I got a good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest. But what stands out for the Loop is what it puts emphasis on and what it leaves out. The bulk of the Polar Flow app focuses on fitness training. When you open it, you\u2019re automatically given a \u00e2\u0080\u009cCardio Load Status,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is essentially a measure of how fit you are. It estimates this based on the workouts you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done (again, nothing any fitness watch like Polar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own running watch or the Garmins or Coros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the world can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do). The Polar Loop excels because of its simplicity. There were days when I could go out for a run with nothing but the Loop and forget about pace, time, and distance and just enjoy the run. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that most running watches and fitness trackers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really do. Technically, you could just set a running watch or your phone to a 30-minute timer, but the accessibility of seeing your pace, distance, and heart rate with the turn of your wrist is too tempting for me (and most runners I know). To me, all of this is what sets the Polar Loop apart. Its pared-down app accompanied by its nonexistent screen means that, if you want, you can actually passively track your health and not obsess over it. Perhaps this will soon change as the app seems to be in its infancy and major updates are expected over the next year. But right now, the Polar Loop is an ideal health companion for me: not too much information, but not too little, either\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the ability to zen out during a run knowing you are still tracking it is exactly what I want right now. This begs the question: Is there a perfect or ideal health or fitness tracker? Absolutely not. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be like demanding there be a perfect pizza topping. The perfect one is the one that fits all your wants and needs at any given time, and we all prioritize different things when it comes to fitness and health tracking. One size doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit all, despite what a certain fruit-named company wants everyone to believe with its smartwatches. The battery life on the Loop is pretty amazing. Polar says that it lasts eight days on one charge and it can store data without syncing for up to four weeks. While I want to refrain from only comparing the Whoop 5.0 to the Loop, one small quibble I had with the Whoop 5.0 was that for whatever reason it was so uncomfortable on my tiny wrist. The Loop, on the other hand, I found incredibly easy to put on, take off, and wear indefinitely until it was time to charge. To me, a device that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended to be worn all day long for days needs to be comfortable\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the Loop delivers. For stat nerds: the tracker itself is 27 x 42 x 9mm and it comes with a fabric band (which comes in two sizes) and weighs 29 grams. The Loop also comes in three colors: Greige Sand, Night Black, and Brown Copper. Aesthetically, both the Loop and the Whoop 5.0 look and feel generally the same (though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue the Loop is way more comfortable for people with smaller wrists). At their core, they are each screenless, passive health monitors. The key differences are their price and what they offer in their apps. Because the Whoop requires a subscription, year over year, it will be far more expensive than the Loop, which is a one-time expense with an accompanying free app. As for what they both offer, they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more different. The Whoop is an all-encompassing health tracker that is attempting to cram as much health information into its app as it can and spit out a daily strain and recovery score, which is focused on optimizing your overall health\u00e2\u0080\u0094essentially becoming a health perfectionist. The Loop is almost like its laid-back cousin. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going after the same goal of improving health but with a more relaxed, casual approach. To get into the nitty-gritty, they both offer heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep stages, and fitness training status. In addition to these, Whoop also offers body temperature, oxygen saturation, and advanced insights like strain and recovery scores, so you do get more tracked stats. Taking all of that into account, Whoop is better for users who want to dig deeper into their health and wellness, whereas the Loop, at least in its current iteration, is more geared towards people who want to just wear it and forget it and get a more basic daily update on their health without inundating themselves with extra insights or needing to achieve a perfect strain or recovery score. While I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see someone who is training for a specific fitness goal, like a marathon, using the Polar Loop as their sole device, I can see it being used in two ways: 1) as a sole device for someone who just wants to passively track their everyday health and fitness without a specific goal in mind or 2) someone who does use a fitness watch for workouts and wants something else that just tracks their everyday health that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to look at or obsess over. Though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that the Loop doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an internal GPS. That means the Loop estimates distance (and pace) based on internal sensors (accelerometer, wrist movement) rather than satellite data. On that note, the Polar Loop does sync with Polar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fitness watches, which are arguably among the most accurate around for tracking heart rate, pace, and distance, though their tradeoff is that they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as sleek or compact as smartwatches like the Apple Watch Series 11 or Pixel Watch 4. So whatever way you like to track your health, the Polar Loop could be ideal to add to the mix.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Apple is preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO of the company \"as soon as next year,\" according to the Financial Times. The company's board of directors and senior executives \"recently intensified preparations for Cook to hand over the reins,\" the report said. While the report said that Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, it went on to explain that an announcement early in the year would allow for a smooth leadership transition, ahead of Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June and iPhone event in September. No final decisions have been made, and the timing could change, the report said.  Cook has been Apple's CEO since August 2011. He turned 65 this year, which is a common age for retirement in the United States, but he has yet to publicly announce any plans to step down. Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, is widely viewed as Cook's most likely successor when the time comes. Ternus joined Apple in 2001. At 50, he is one of Apple's younger senior executives, so he could potentially have a lengthy run as CEO. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman pushed back on the report. \"I don't get the sense anything is imminent as the [Financial Times] is claiming,\" he said, in a post today. In any case, the report said Apple's succession plans are not related to the company's current performance. Apple reported record revenue in the September quarter, and the company expects the current December quarter to be the best quarter in the company's history. In addition, Apple's stock price is near its all-time high. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Products rise and fall like the changing tides of the sea. Some go away, new ones launch \u2014 it's a never-ending dance between manufacturers and consumers that touches nearly every industry, including automotive. Vehicles can get phased out because they don't sell well, new or improved models become available, or something else entirely, like the parent company going under. In any case, there are a host of electric vehicles on the market this year that look like they won't be around for much longer, and certainly not in 2026. If you're interested in owning one, you might want to hurry up and order, funds willing, because once they're gone, they're probably gone for good. Depending on how much used stock is available, that may or may not be an exaggeration. It depends on the market and how in demand these vehicles truly are. Just to provide a few quick examples, some electric vehicles that are already gone, but not forgotten, include the Ford Focus Electric, Ford Ranger EV, Fiat 500e, BMW i3 (here's what happened), Toyota RAV4 EV, and Chevrolet S-10 EV (here are 13 EVs that have been discontinued in the U.S.). As for the electric vehicles that won't make it to 2026, here are five others that will make a few folks wince. In September 2025, Acura officially announced that the ZDX, its first electric vehicle, would be discontinued. Part of the reason is because of slow EV adoption across the board, causing some automakers to backtrack on EVs. The electric model of the ZDX debuted in 2024, just a year prior to its cancellation. While not necessarily a standout in its class, the Acura ZDX is capable and enjoys a roomy interior. It features good fuel economy ratings (for an EV, anyway), with 313 miles per charge estimated for the rear-wheel-drive version and 278 miles per charge for the all-wheel-drive model. (The real-world results are lower for the\u00a0all-wheel-drive model,\u00a0according to\u00a0Car and Driver's test of the vehicle.) Of course, if you know what you're doing,\u00a0you can extend your electric vehicle's range in a few ways, hybrid or all-electric included. That could help eke out a little more range out of something like the Acura ZDX EV. The ZDX EV was a suitable alternative to the Chevy Equinox, though a bit pricier than some of the other options in its class. That may change now that it's being discontinued, especially when it comes to used and pre-owned models. It remains to be seen how or if the discontinuation will change demand going forward. For now, it's worth noting that if you've been looking into the ZDX, you might want to pull the trigger soon. Or, you could wait until prices drop and dealerships are clearing out excess stock. Dodge unveiled the Ram 1500 REV, an all-electric full-sized truck, in 2023, but it never quite made it to market. After several delays, Ram officially cancelled plans in September 2025, which means its rendition of a supercharged electric truck will never see the light of day. According to the company, it did so because of the slow demand for EVs in North America, but it's entirely likely the hassle wasn't worth the investment in the end. Consumer reports show that EV trucks are among some of the least reliable on the market, after all. You won't be able to buy the Ram 1500 EV new or used \u2014 you won't even be able to buy this model at all, actually. But don't fret: If you are looking for an EV truck, the REV models are staying in production, like the plug-in hybrid Ram 1500 planned to release soon. The all-EV model is gone, but the Ram 1500 Ramcharger is still around the corner. The\u00a0extended-range hybrid\u00a0has two electric motors working together to produce 663 horsepower and 615 pound-feet of torque. It also uses a liquid-cooled battery pack offering up to 141 miles per charge. But that, too, has been delayed a year \u2014 it's set to release in early 2026 \u2014 and it remains to be seen what changes or upgrades will make it into the production model. The all-electric Ram 1500, on the other hand, was only ever a concept, and that's all it will ever be now. The Dodge Charger electric, the Daytona EV, comes in two trims for the 2025 model year, the Scat Pack and the R\/T. Well, after just a year in production, Dodge is already phasing out the Daytona R\/T model, leaving the would-be electric muscle drivers with just one option in 2026. While the EV model will technically still be around, which is a positive, it's sad to see some of that variety go. There are also rumors that Dodge cancelled development of another, even more powerful model called the Banshee EV. It's unfortunate to see because it's not like the muscle car EV market is flooded with options. The model saying bye was capable of 496 horsepower, had all-wheel drive, and gave 308 miles per charge, a slightly better fuel economy than the\u00a0241 miles from the Scat Pack. No doubt the range difference is due to the higher horsepower and better performance in the Scat Pack model. Still,\u00a0with a 0 to 60 miles per hour time at 4.7 seconds, the Dodge Charger Daytona R\/T was impressively fast, but it didn't come close to some of the fastest electric vehicles in the world. That doesn't really matter, though \u2014 it still stings to see an EV that's fun to drive go away, even if it is only half of the model being postponed. Launched in 2023, the Nissan Ariya EV is apparently no more. According to the automaker, production has been officially halted for the U.S. market, but Nissan did say \"paused\" and not necessarily discontinued. The company has mentioned they're reallocating resources to the Leaf EV, another electric vehicle, so it's not abandoning the technology completely. The Leaf is also going to be more accessible, with a lower planned MSRP, which could be another reason why the Ariya is being phased out. The 2025 Nissan Ariya is a compact\u00a0all-electric SUV. Drivers can expect 205 miles from the Engage e-4orce model to 289 miles per charge from the Evolve+ option, and there's plenty of room inside with five available seats. It features a handsome yet unique design inside and out. The sophisticated cabin is a stunner, which is what makes the loss of this vehicle sting a little, more so because it's only been on the market for a short while. It will be interesting to see how well-received the upcoming Nissan Leaf EV is and also how long that one stays in production versus the Ariya's short but notable run. It does seem like most manufacturers are shifting focus to hybrid models overall rather than all-electric models, likely due to market demand cooling. The Genesis Electrified G80 was an electric car that looked nothing like an electric car. From the outside, you'd probably clock it as a luxury sedan, and that was certainly the goal. But it was also pretty expensive, starting at $77,000, up to an estimated $82,000 depending on the trim and features you choose. Maybe that's why it didn't sell as well, or maybe it's just that EVs in general aren't as exciting. Either way, Genesis announced that the Electrified model won't be returning in 2026. Initially, the company simply removed the vehicle's information from its website. It seemed like the EV would go quietly into the night, but Genesis did eventually make an announcement through the media. What is somewhat surprising, if you can call it that, is that the Genesis Electrified G80 faithfully recreated\u00a0the bulky sedan styling\u00a0of its gas-powered sibling, the standard G80. People still weren't buying it. It appears consumers aren't all that interested in EVs that mimic gas counterparts well, beyond your average electric model, possibly indicating that no EVs are going to land the popular vote. No matter what they achieve and what they look, sound, or feel like. There's also the point that the federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases expired in September 2025. Buying electric vehicles from the end of September and on will no longer net you any tax breaks at the end of the year.","label":0}

Robinhood, founded in 2013, is a fintech company that lets users trade traditional stocks, cryptocurrencies, options, and exchange-traded funds through its platforms. It helped popularize retail trading during the pandemic and was famously at the center of the GameStop meme stock drama. The company has expanded over the last 12 years, and recently announced new products and features during its Hood Summit in September. In addition to extending index options trading and increasing the number of investment accounts users can open, Robinhood said it is building a finance-focused social media platform where users can share strategies and follow other traders. A beta version of Robinhood Social will be made available to about 10,000 users during the first quarter of 2026.

This is the same playbook, we're running out of oil, E&P is down, ... as a way to pump up oil prices. The larger trend is that oil companies have been in a cost cutting mode since 1986. It's a problem for the government because ~3 percent of the entire US working population is working directly for oil companies, and that multiple states have an outsized reliance on oil production as one of the largest employees (Oklahoma 15% of employment and 28% of stage GDP). https:\/\/www.api.org\/news-polic...

Green energy requires oil based plastics and oil based chemicals. EVs require oil based plastics and oil based chemicals.

That video is 4 years old and claims EV's are expensive and have poor range. Not the case at the present time. >> EVs require oil based plastics and oil based chemicals So what? Most oil is used as transportation fuel which is burned into the atmosphere, and EV's reduce the demand for that.  I don't think OP was dissing EVs, just noting that they, like other things, also use petroleum product for things other than fuels and some things that use fuels can't be easily replaced with EVs. Imagine how much more plastic and other petrochemicals you'd have if we stoppes burning most of it. Green energy requires oil based plastics and oil based chemicalsNot really. Plastics require hydrocarbons that can be sourced from anything, including coal or wood. Oil is just the most convenient source, but it's certainly not the only one.  And anyway, only 6% of oil is used for plastic production. Even increasing the demand for plastics won't materially affect oil consumption. Fossil hydrocarbons are also used as a feedstock for other industrial processes (fertilizer production mainly), but adding up all these uses accounts for just about 15% of global production.

And we could consume so much energy that the oceans will start to boil if we don't get most of the loads off the planet first. The reason is because energy use expands to consume all available resources. Energy is an enabler for too many nice things. We have equally demonstrated otherwise on global action.  But it does require an agreed consensus that is stuck to by all major parties.  ie: Serious participation at the UN. Not judging or preaching, eh? The UN doesn't do the work and never did.  It was always up the participants to execute. People were not born voluntarily, once alive we mostly don't die voluntarily. We won't stop voluntarily because it would be akin to dying voluntarily.   We have to accept the fact that we are not in fact the Borg, we don't have one hive mind. This has nothing to do with billionaires. You can decide right now to stop buying plastics, stop replacing your phone every year, give up your car and move to a city center, and stop supporting businesses that are oil based. If everybody who is concerned about oil consumption did this, oil consumption would shrink. Oil companies are simply meeting demand, burning more. Instead we want someone else to do something about it but no one can really say what that something is. Easier to blame the billionaires when the culprit is staring at you from the mirror. Well, if not you the who? And I realize this may not be your specific behavior, but too many people squeal like stuck pigs when in reality it is they who refuse to change behavior. \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\" - Walt Kelly This has nothing to do with billionaires.

The oil industry has a half dozen or so new technologies for extracting oil from the ground that wouldn't be otherwise accessible. They aren't using them because it costs a lot to ramp up manufacturing and deployment of new gear, and training people to use it. Fracking and traditional pumping work fine for now. Once what's available gets harder to extract using those methods, prices will go up and they'll switch to a different technology. What does \"net-zero\" mean?  What does \"carbon neutral\" mean?  Humanity will always produce large amounts of CO2 making concrete and through agriculture (and other sources).  To get to \"net-zero\" doesn't that mean that industrial scale CO2 removal needs to begin immediately?

Meteoric levels of investment in AI infrastructure have sparked concerns that Big Tech's latest boom is veering into bubble territory. So, is Meta, along with the rest of Silicon Valley, overspending on AI? \"Clearly no Meta executive would ever answer that question with a 'yes,'\" Alex Schultz, Meta's CMO and VP of analytics, said in an interview with Business Insider at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon this week. Meta plans to spend up to $72 billion this year on AI infrastructure, and has said spending will climb higher next year. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this year that he'd rather risk \"misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars\" than be late to the development of superintelligence. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and privately held AI companies like OpenAI are logging record-breaking capital expenditures on all things AI. That includes chips and data centers, as well as big salaries to attract and retain top AI research and engineering talent. There are eyewatering sums of money at play, but Schultz said that, compared to historical bubbles, the current trend is not huge as a percentage of the sector's market capitalization or revenue. Compared to the US railroad bubble of the late 19th century, \"it seems aggressive, but not crazy,\" said Schultz of the current AI boom. In an October research note, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that AI-related investment in the US is under 1% of GDP, compared with the 2% to 5% of GDP reached during earlier technology booms, including the railroad expansion. Schultz said Meta's AI investments are already translating into billions of dollars in revenue for the company, as they improve its advertising tools and content ranking algorithms. Meta is expected to ring in around $200 billion in revenue this year and is trading at a market cap of about $1.5 trillion. Schultz said the biggest AI-powered revolution for Meta has been its more sophisticated content recommendation system. He said this was necessary because the majority of time spent on Facebook and Instagram now is people looking at \"unconnected content\" \u2014 content that isn't from a friend, or from a page or group you actively follow. \"If we hadn't made that pivot, how much smaller would we be as a company today?\" Schultz said. \"We managed a massive disruption without becoming irrelevant, and it is incremental to our business.\" Schultz said the Meta AI app's newly released Vibes feed \u2014 a feed of short-form, purely AI-generated video content \u2014 represents \"probably a large chunk of the future\" for the company and has demonstrated \"good retention\" of users so far once they use it. (Vibes has been panned by many online as \"AI slop.\") Video-generation models require more computing power than text or image ones,\u00a0creating huge energy demands that have the potential to strain power grids and water supplies. The popularity of apps like OpenAI's Sora has sparked questions about whether the entertainment value is worth it for the environmental trade-offs. \"Vibes isn't that big \u2014 it's not draining lakes or using multiple nuclear power stations,\" Schultz said. He added that it's one of many experiments the company is working on to train and learn from its AI models. \"There's sort of this Western European Calvinist streak to society that's like, doing nice things that are fun is not what life's about,\" Schultz said. \"And life is about doing nice things that are fun, and we do all the other stuff so that we can do nice things that are fun.\" The AI wave has prompted what Schultz described as productive conversations about the safety of nuclear power stations and the use of desalination plants to produce freshwater from seawater. \"In general, humanity has the ability to have a lot more abundance than it does,\" Schultz said.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"I was looking over the week\u2019s posts on Hackaday \u2013 it\u2019s part of my job after all \u2013 and this gem caught my eye: a post about how to make your own RP2040 development board from scratch. And I\u2019ll admit that my first thought was \u201cwhy would you ever want to do that?\u201d (Not a very Hackaday-appropriate question, honestly.) The end result will certainly cost more than just buying a Pi Pico off the shelf! Then it hit me: this isn\u2019t a project per se, but rather [Kai] was using it as an test run to learn the PCB-production toolchain. And for that, replicating a Pico board is perfect, because the schematics are easily available. While I definitely think that a project like this is a bit complicated for a first PCB project \u2013 I\u2019d recommend making something fun like an SAO \u2013 the advantage of making something slightly more involved is that you run into all of the accompanying problems learning experiences. What a marvelous post-complete-beginner finger exercise! And then it hit me again. [Kai]\u2019s documentation of everything learned during the project was absolutely brilliant. It\u2019s part KiCAD tutorial, part journal about all the hurdles of getting a PCB made, and just chock-full of helpful tips along the way. The quality of the write-up turns it from being just a personal project into something that can help other people who are in exactly the same boat, and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a number of you out there. In the end, this was a perfect Hackaday project. Yes, it was \u201ctoo simple\u201d for those who have made their 30th PCB design. (Although I\u2019d bet you could still pick up a KiCAD tip or two.) And yes, it doesn\u2019t make economic sense to replicate mass-market devices in one-off. And of course, it doesn\u2019t need that fun art on the board either. But wrap all these up together, and you get a superbly documented guide to a useful project that would walk you through 95% of what you\u2019ll need to make more elaborate projects later on. Superb! Surely you do \u201cfinger exercises\u201d too. Why not write them up, and share the learning? And send them our way \u2013 we know just the audience who will want to read it. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do if you intend to actually make something out of the RP2040. The development board is nothing but a minimal reference implementation, which you can then expand upon or remove from, depending on your needs. Knowing how to replicate the development board means you know how to adapt the chip into a product. Unless you\u2019re one of those people who stuff Arduinos and other development boards into products as is, pay the extra cost to the middle man, and live with the fact that it\u2019s a product outside of your control, not built or sold for your purpose in the first place, and may vanish from the market at any time. Of course the SOC chip may also vanish from the market at any time, though hopefully it\u2019d be rescued as open-source hardware. That would be true of all components in the end, but that\u2019s a different matter. Btw. it\u2019s called parasitic design or parasitic engineering: when the host dies, the parasite dies as well. So you have to be extra careful about what products you latch on to.  For example, you might design an electric bicycle to use a bespoke motor for a food mixer, and the only way to obtain those motors is to buy them as spare parts meant for the food mixers. Once the host company EOLs that product and stops producing spare parts for it, you\u2019re screwed. That\u2019s why parasitic engineering is typical of hit-and-run products, kickstarters, etc. that are only meant to turn a quick buck by shoving something out there and raking the money in while it lasts. Hold on \u2026 Isn\u2019t that almost literally 90% of these projects? Doesn\u2019t every project start as: I want to learn 25 more skills this year and make something with them so I have experience. And this project could cover 4 skills so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. If that\u2019s not how you have been looking at HaD projects, then I don\u2019t actually understand. Different backgrounds and view points I guess. But I figured our fundamentals would be similar. This! While I am not fluent in this specific field I feel like you captured a philosophy here that has truly inspired my own tinkering and testing. I get scoffs from some off my coworkers at time for \u2018re-inventing the wheel\u2019 but my argument was always that we can \u2018trust\u2019 that the wheel can roll or we can \u2018know\u2019 how it rolls. I agree that it is not always the most economic in most ways but the value of learning at times can\u2019t be understated. Such co-workers are accustomed to being \u201cLEGO engineers\u201d. Many companies, especially startups, operate under the minimum viable product principle where they\u2019ll push a prototype directly to production under the motivation that it\u2019s better to make money now to pay for refinements later. They use whatever is available at minimum effort to make something that sells, and the peril is that the management may be more willing to pay their investors and themselves first rather than investing in the future. That\u2019s not a stable position, especially if there\u2019s a threat of competition later on when the patents and copyrights expire. Others will take the time to go back to the fundamentals and make the same thing better and cheaper. If you don\u2019t \u201cre-invent the wheel\u201d, you\u2019ll be run over by the better wheel. I bought a \u201cmake you\u2019re own Arduino kit\u201d so I could learn about the ATMega328 hardware requirements. It benefited me in a couple of different ways: I rapidly learned how to break the ATMega328 out of the Arduino and use it in my own circuit designs. I built a bare chip programmer, using the kit parts, to burn ATMega328s, without the need for the Arduino bootloader and the long boot up delay. ;-) If you want to learn stuff it is good to break out of the box and projects like this are excellent for that. I read the HaD article about how to bare-metal program AVR chips, and skipped the Arduino fad entirely. I only started using them later because saving 15 bucks on parts no longer seemed like worth the trouble. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

First major Black Friday deals just landed on Amazon and Xbox controllers finally joined the discount party with their deepest price cut ever. Gaming controllers take a beating from intense button mashing, thumbstick abuse and the occasional rage-induced floor meeting so having a backup or upgrade becomes essential rather than optional. The Xbox wireless gaming controller in Carbon Black just hit an all-time low of $49 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $64 price, and over 20,000 people grabbed one this month as stock moves incredibly fast. This 2025 model works across more devices than any previous Xbox controller which makes it useful beyond just console gaming. See at Amazon Microsoft designed this controller with universal compatibility extending well beyond the Xbox consoles, wirelessly connecting to Windows PCs, Android phones and tablets, iOS devices, FireTV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets. This means that you buy one quality controller and use it everywhere, rather than having different gamepads for every different platform you own. That Bluetooth connection rapidly pairs with any device it\u2019s hooked up to, which sidesteps the clutter of dongles and adapters found with older controllers. You can easily toggle between playing Halo on your Series X, streaming games on your phone during your lunch break and changing media on your Fire TV Stick without juggling multiple remotes or controllers. The ergonomic design refines the proven Xbox controller shape that\u2019s felt natural in gamers\u2019 hands for over two decades with subtle improvements to grip texture and button placement. The textured surfaces on the triggers, bumpers and back casing provide a secure grip even during sweaty gaming sessions or when your hands get slick from snacks. Microsoft positioned the buttons and thumbsticks at distances that reduce hand fatigue during extended play, so you can game for hours without developing cramping or soreness in your thumbs and fingers. The hybrid D-pad delivers accurate input for fighting games, platformers and any title that requires precise directional commands. This design marries the best aspects of traditional cross-shaped D-pads with the faceted style that most hardcore fighting game players prefer, providing you with tactile feedback for each direction press without mushy or ambiguous inputs. You\u2019ll nail complex move combinations and rapid direction changes more consistently compared to cheaper controllers with spongy or imprecise directional pads. Textured grips on the triggers and bumpers improve control in those split-second moments of intense gaming that determine victory or defeat. The triggers feature smooth analog travel that works perfectly for racing games where gradual acceleration and braking come into play, while also providing crisp digital clicks for shooters that need instant fire response. Battery life runs on two AA batteries that are expected to give about 40 hours of gameplay before needing replacement, giving you weeks of casual gaming or several marathon weekend sessions between battery swaps. The AA battery design lets you choose between disposable batteries for convenience or rechargeable batteries for cost savings and environmental benefits in the long term. You can also connect the controller via USB-C cable for wired play that eliminates any potential wireless latency while simultaneously charging rechargeable batteries if you\u2019re using them. The 3.5mm headset jack connects any wired gaming headset directly, thereby routing game audio and chat through your headphones without the need for separate dongles or adapters. This direct connection reduces the audio latency compared to wireless headsets and gives you instant sound feedback, which helps in competitive gaming when hearing the enemy\u2019s footsteps or gunshots a fraction of a second earlier provides strategic advantages. At $49, you get Microsoft\u2019s official controller quality for less money than most third-party alternatives that lack build quality or platform support.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Not many bikemakers dare to depart too much from building motorcycles. Even less so for an electric motorcycle company, especially when you have \u201cmotorcycles\u201d in your name.  Well, apparently, Zero Motorcycles doesn\u2019t care about those boundaries. After all, who the heck said you can\u2019t do both? And Zero has done exactly that, now venturing into the scooter segment in addition to its illustrious e-motorcycles, with the LS1 electric scooter. Unveiled at this year\u2019s EICMA, the LS1 was introduced as a part of Zero\u2019s \u201cAll-Access\u201d initiative, which is all about making electric two-wheelers accessible for more people. And when you talk about accessibility, the low-step, fuel-efficient, maneuverable, zippy rides offered by scooters make a strong case for top billing in the commuter mobility market. The LS1 comes with two swappable batteries. Both of these are mounted on the floorboard, but Zero also offers you an optional third battery. In its stock two-battery setup, the e-scoot offers up to 71 miles (115 km) of range, while the more expensive three-battery configuration offers a 106-mile range (170 km). The swappable batteries can also be charged indoors with the included 800-W charger, which would take about 4.5 hours to go from 0\u201395% or about 3 hours to go from 20\u201380%. You can also opt for an optional 1,500-W fast charger that almost halves those times. Rolling power comes from a mid-mounted motor that produces 11.3 horsepower and 38 lb.ft (51 Nm) of peak torque. Top speed is listed at 62 mph (100 km\/h), while Zero states a \u201csustained\u201d top speed \u2013 which the e-scoot is able to \"hold for an extended period of time\" \u2013 is around the 53 mph (85 km\/h) mark. The scooter is built around a compact chassis and short wheelbase \u2013 both instrumental for maneuverability in tight spaces. You get 4.3 in (109 mm) and 4.1 in (104 mm) of travel at the front and back, respectively. The scooter comes with floating, dual-piston brakes at the front and a floating, single-piston brake at the rear. There\u2019s ample under-seat storage, large enough for a helmet or groceries. Electronic aids like ABS and traction control, alongside a low seat height of 30.7 inches (780 mm), and 291-lb (132-kg) curb weight mean the LS1 is built to be versatile enough for European streets. And there's the rub. It doesn\u2019t seem like it will be sold in the USA. \"The LS1 is designed for the people we see every day in cities like Paris, Milan, or Barcelona,\" said Zero CEO, Pierre-Martin Bos. \"It\u2019s simple, stylish, and makes electric riding accessible to a whole new group of riders.\" That's probably a smart decision, since scoots aren't that popular in the US anyway. The company is likely looking at the other markets in addition to Europe though, where small commuter bikes and scooters play a much more active role in the transport mix. The LS1 was built as part of Zero's growing cooperation with Zongshen, which also saw the company launch two trail-oriented e-motos. Considering the Chinese collaboration, the pricing is pretty decent too: around \u20ac5,200 (US$6,000) depending on the country and market. Zero says that deliveries will start in the latter part of December this year.  Source: Zero Motorcycles","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"\"Pluribus\" sees former \"Better Call Saul\" star Rhea Seehorn play romantasy author Carol Sturka, who isn't actually all that impressed by her own work. Now, Apple TV is hoping real-world viewers will be impressed with the fictional novelists' writing chops. The company announced via its X (formerly Twitter) account that fans can read an excerpt from the \"Bloodsong of Wycaro\" novel penned by Carol Sturka herself, in a genius marketing move previously used for Apple's biggest sci-fi success story, \"Severance.\" For a long time now, Apple TV+ has had some great shows that nobody is watching. The platform that hosts the best spy show on TV in \"Slow Horses\" and which gave us TV's trippiest mind-bender in \"Severance\" has long been deserving of more attention. But if the Apple TV marketing team keeps up the stellar job it's been doing, we might soon see things change in that regard.\u00a0 So far, we've seen real-world \"Severance\" pop-up events, which proved perfectly designed to become viral hits across social media, especially since the actual cast turned up to reprise their roles for these brief real-world set pieces. Then, Apple released the in-universe self-help book \"The You You Are\" for download, bringing a piece of the \"Severance\" universe to life. Now, Apple TV is doing the same for \"Pluribus.\" The new show from \"Breaking Bad\" creator Vince Gilligan was, as you might expect, given his previous work, highly anticipated. With the marketing team borrowing a trick from \"Severance\" and giving fans a chapter from Carol Sturka's book, that momentum will surely only build, proving the streamer clearly intends to continue with inventive forms of marketing in the wake of its \"Severance\" success and perhaps become a bigger force in the streaming sphere. In \"Pluribus\" (the latest remake of a sci-fi classic), Rhea Seehorn's Carol Sturka must save the world from an alien virus that turns the populace into placid, obsequious drones. But she starts out as the author of a series of tawdry romantasy novels known as the \"Winds of Wycaro\" books. In episode one, Sturka hosts a live reading event for the latest installment, \"Bloodsong of Wycaro,\" where she's surrounded by rabid fans who are a little too fanatical in their love for the books. Now, \"Pluribus\" viewers can become just as fanatical by reading an extract from the novel \u2014 billed as the \"fourth book in her epic romantasy trilogy\" \u2014 for free over on Apple Books. No subscription is necessary to read the 11-page chapter, which comes complete with a message from the author in which she picks up on a point from the \"Pluribus\" premiere, wherein fans of the novel were evidently outraged that a character by the name of Raban is not on the cover of the latest book. She also implores readers to refrain from spoilers before providing a full chapter for \"Wycarians\" to pore over. The pitch-perfect marketing for 2024's \"Longlegs\" was a masterclass in how to sell a horror movie. Now, Apple TV is once again proving it knows how to sell its sci-fi shows. The release of this chapter literally fulfills calls to make the \"Winds of Wycaro\" series a real thing\u00a0and shows Apple has its ear to the social media ground. Will we get a full book in due time? Perhaps if \"Pluribus\" becomes a hit. In \"Severance,\" Michael Chernus plays Dr. Ricken Lazlo Hale, PhD, brother-in-law to Adam Scott's Mark Scout and a self-help author who wrote \"The You You Are, A Spiritual Biography of You.\" The book is full of pseudointellectual musings such as \"Bullies are nothing but BULL and LIES,\" and platitudes the likes of which can, unfortunately, be found in multiple real-world tomes on bookshelves today. As such, Apple decided to release the book as a promotional stunt, alongside an audio version narrated by actor Michael Chernus himself. It was an inspired choice, helping build even more engagement for one of the streamer's biggest shows. Now, the company has done it again with \"Pluribus.\" The description for \"Bloodsong of Wycaro\" promises an epic tale in which Lucasia, Captain of the duneship Mercator, \"traverses the amaranthine sands of Wycaro seeking a cure for the insidious illness felling her crew.\" While haunted by memories of lost love, Raban, Lucasia soon learns \"the only thing worse than finding yourself alone in the dark ... is discovering you're not alone.\" Yes, it's essentially the plot of \"Pluribus\" in fantasy form. With marketing like this, Apple TV might soon become a bigger player in the streaming game. According to estimates from FlixPatrol, the platform likely has around 30 million subscribers, while the reigning king, Netflix, has more than 300 million. To be sure, Netflix won the streaming wars long ago, but with the amount of money Apple has at its disposal, the company can afford to go on the offensive via its marketing, which will hopefully continue to be as novel and interesting as the \"Severance\" and now \"Pluribus\" promotion has been.","label":0}

Indian automaker Tata Motors has turned heads with its funky, compact vehicle designs. According to Carscoops, the company revealed the Tata Ace Pro at the 2025 Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January, offering fully electric and bi-fuel options. The Tata Ace Pro is a mini-truck with a payload of 750 kilograms (1,653 pounds), featuring a 14.4 kilowatt-hour battery that lasts 155 kilometers (96 miles) between charges. It also comes with a battery warranty valid for eight years. As for the bi-fuel option, Carscoops reported that \"it represents a healthy increase over the 11 horsepower from the 611 cc gasoline engine of the Tata Ace Zip.\" While that might be an attractive option for potential customers, purchasing an EV is much better for the planet. No tailpipe means no tailpipe pollution, so no harmful gases are released that increase already rising global temperatures. Furthermore, with a reduced need for maintenance because of fewer moving parts and no need for oil changes, it is less likely that an EV will lead to unexpected costs. While it's true that EVs tend to have high sticker prices, there are several ways to make it work for your wallet. Home solar panels, for example, can reduce charging costs. EnergySage offers free, impartial quotes on solar panel installation and can save customers up to $10,000. Purchasing a home charger can be another way to save in the long run. Charging an EV at home is often cheaper than using public chargers \u2014\u00a0and it can even be free if using solar energy. According to Qmerit, EV owners with at-home charging spend about $1,000 less each year than those with gas-powered cars. Public charging isn't cheap either; in fact, it can cost almost three times as much as home charging. Would you be more willing to buy an EV if it could travel over 600 miles per charge?

Picking a new laptop isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy these days. With endless options flooding the market, most of us tend to stick to reliable brands and Lenovo remains one of the few that never disappoints. Right now, one of its most complete models, the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 15.3\u00e2\u0080\u0091inch FHD+ display, Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD, is down to an all\u00e2\u0080\u0091time low of $549 from $2,499, now 78% off. See at Amazon The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is built for the kind of multitasking modern life demands. The 13th\u00e2\u0080\u0091gen Intel Core i5\u00e2\u0080\u009113420H chip delivers eight cores (four Performance + four Efficiency cores) and twelve threads which means you can run multiple professional apps, stream media, and browse with dozens of tabs open \u2013 all without slowdown. Its turbo frequency reaches 4.6 GHz, giving the extra power burst needed for quick data crunchingor content creation sessions. Storage also gets a serious boost thanks to the 512 GB PCIe SSD: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough space for a full library of files, photos and software, while keeping boot and loading times near\u00e2\u0080\u0091instant. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of performance jump that makes going back to a traditional hard drive nearly impossible. You only need to lift the lid and the system wakes instantly, ready for work or play. Then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the display: a 15.3\u00e2\u0080\u0091inch WUXGA panel (1920 \u00c3\u0097 1200) with a 16:10 aspect ratio for extra vertical room. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crisp, bright at 300 nits, and features an anti\u00e2\u0080\u0091glare coating that keeps reflections minimal even under strong lighting. The narrow bezels make the entire setup look modern, while the 45 percent NTSC color coverage produces consistent tones for everyday use. Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re streaming shows or reviewing presentations, the wide\u00e2\u0080\u0091angle IPS screen ensures what you see is both vibrant and fatigue\u00e2\u0080\u0091free. The IdeaPad Slim 3 features Wi\u00e2\u0080\u0091Fi 6 for faster and more reliable wireless performance and Bluetooth 5.2 for low\u00e2\u0080\u0091latency peripheral pairing. Its generous port selection makes life easier: two USB\u00e2\u0080\u0091A ports, one USB\u00e2\u0080\u0091C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, an HDMI output, a 3.5 mm audio jack, an SD card reader, and of course the power connector. That means no annoying dongle juggling when you want to plug in a mouse, transfer photos or connect to an external monitor. This 15\u00e2\u0080\u0091inch Lenovo is slimmer than the previous generation by around 10%. At roughly 4 pounds, it strikes the right balance between portability and sturdiness. The hinge feels solid but light enough to open with one hand, and the full\u00e2\u0080\u0091size keyboard with number pad makes typing comfortable even during long sessions of data entry or writing. Lenovo always manages to hit that sweet spot between form and function and this one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a perfect example. Daily usability shines through small, thoughtful touches like efficient cooling that keeps fan noise low and the Copilot key on the keyboard, giving instant access to Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI assistant. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rare feature for a laptop in this price category, and it aligns perfectly with the growing shift toward AI\u00e2\u0080\u0091enhanced productivity. Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re browsing the web, managing spreadsheets or taking Zoom calls, the IdeaPad Slim 3 stays responsive and cool through it all. Its battery performance comfortably lasts through a full workday with light productivity mixed with streaming. Pair that with fast charging and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re back to 50% in roughly 30 minutes using any modern USB\u00e2\u0080\u0091C charger. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking for a reliable daily driver, the IdeaPad Slim 3 is about as balanced as it gets. Amazon discounts come and go but this one feels special.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"                 Reading time 8 minutes        My parents always used to say, \u201cYou get what you pay for,\u201d and at the ripe old age of 33, I\u2019ve often found that to be true. If you buy a knockoff, that\u2019s usually what you\u2019re going to get: an imitation of something that\u2019s cheaper, but probably not quite as good as the real deal. Usually,\u00c2\u00a0that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. But not always. Sometimes, if Soundpeats\u2019 new Clip1 wireless earbuds are any indication, what you actually get (for a lot less money) is your favorite new pair of open-style wireless earbuds for the price. Soundpeats Clip1 The Clip1 are a great-sounding pair of open-style wireless earbuds with an enticing price. Pros Cons I\u2019ve used a few pairs of open wireless earbuds in my day, and there was always one pair that stood as my favorite: Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds. I personally love Bose\u2019s clip-on design, which is comfortable and (at least in my opinion) looks pretty good\u00e2\u0080\u0094more like a piece of jewelry than a pair of wireless earbuds. Also, Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds shouldn\u2019t work, but they do. The wireless earbuds actually tuck the speaker behind your ear, while a solid plastic lip rests inside and holds the whole thing in place. Despite that strange, very indirect method of delivering audio, they sound great. There\u2019s just one problem, and that\u2019s that they\u2019re kind of wildly expensive. Coming up on nearly two years since their release date, the Ultra Open Earbuds are still $300. That\u2019s a steep price to pay for wireless earbuds that you\u2019re probably not going to want to use all the time, every single day. But $70? Now we\u2019re talking. Unlike Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, Soundpeats\u2019 Clip1 start at less than half the price. While you might be raising your eyebrows, wondering what kind of sacrifices you\u2019re making in the sound department, I\u2019m here to tell you that the Clip1 might be a lot less of a compromise than you\u2019d expect. Immediately upon sliding the Clip1 onto my ears and loading up Spotify, I noticed that Soundpeats paid special attention to fidelity. I started off with some jazz, Wes Montgomery\u2019s \u201cWhile We\u2019re Young,\u201d and noticed ample low end and very little distortion even with the volume turned up past 75% on my phone. Guitar tones sounded natural and nuanced, like I was in the room. I could hear subtle string buzzes and even the soft fuzz of the recording process from 1961, an artifact of how the tune was recorded back then. More than a solid start. Other genres translated equally as well. I listened to some rock songs with a lot more going on instrument-wise and in the production department, and the Clip1 crushed it. In \u201cCastleman\u201d by Floatie, I was able to hear all of the guitar tracks clearly and separately, with very little distortion. Vocals stood apart from the mix but weren\u2019t too pronounced, and the low end was present but not overwhelming. Similarly, with electronic music, the Clip1 continued to impress. I listened to Todd Terje\u2019s \u201cDelorean Dynamite,\u201d and the driving arpeggiated synths sounded perfectly gritty, with shakers and other reverberated percussion came across as atmospheric but well-accounted for. If this all sounds like I\u2019m gushing, well, I kind of am. The Clip1 exceeded my expectations in the sound department, and it\u2019s clear that Soundpeats made the effort on a hardware level to deliver. Inside the Clip1, there are 12mm drivers, which are backed up by dual magnets. The use of two magnets, according to Soundpeats, is meant to decrease distortion and deliver a more precise, uniform sound, since the two magnets equate to less variability in the way the wireless earbuds\u2019 diaphragm moves. The results are clear\u00e2\u0080\u0094literally. These are some of the best-sounding open wireless earbuds I\u2019ve used to date, and I\u2019ve used quite a few now from Sony, Nothing, and Bose. On top of sounding great, I also find them to be equally as listenable in louder volume scenarios as Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, if not a little more so. Because of the design of open wireless earbuds, no pair will ever be ideal in high-volume situations where you\u2019d want a more traditional pair of wireless earbuds with tips and active noise cancelation (ANC). There\u2019s a middle ground to be struck where you can still hear your audio well while also being able to hear your surroundings, though. In my humble opinion, Soundpeats strikes that balance well. On the crucial subway test, I was able to hear my post-work Buffalo Bills sports talk podcast while still keeping one foot in the environmental sound. That\u2019s more than I could say for other entrants in the open-ear audio game, which have a bad habit of being drowned out in loud environments. Outside of being able to hear your surroundings more, another reason why people buy open-style wireless earbuds is that they\u2019re just a lot more comfortable than using something that gets put inside your ear, even if it\u2019s only a little bit. While both the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds and Soundpeats\u2019 Clip1 have a similar design (a clip that you wrap around your ear), there are subtle differences between the two you should know. As I mentioned, Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds have a plastic knob that goes inside your ear, while the speaker, a round little drum, actually gets tucked behind your ear. The indirect approach to delivering audio somehow produces solid, well-balanced sound. Similarly, the Clip1 also tucks around your ear like a clip, but instead of tucking the speaker behind your ear like Bose, the speaker rests in your outer ear in the Clip1, while the battery and magnets actually located behind. I\u2019ve already covered how that design seems to deliver sound, and as satisfied as I am with that end, I\u2019m equally as satisfied with the comfort. The Clip1, like Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds are great to wear over long periods and feel sturdy and comfortable while wrapped around my ears. If you\u2019re the type of person who hates the feeling of shoving silicone tips into your ears like you would with wireless earbuds that have ANC, the Clip1 will feel like a massive relief. The Clip1 might even have a slight edge over Bose, since Soundpeats manages to get the weight of each of its earbuds down to 5g as opposed to Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, which weigh 6.3g per earbud. Like Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, the Clip1 also allows for a good amount of ambient noise bleed, which, in this case, is exactly what\u2019s supposed to happen. While wearing the Clip1, I was still able to hear colleagues and respond to people in my office, while they were unable to hear what I was listening to; in this case, that happened to be a podcast at about 75% volume. While I didn\u2019t test the Clip1 on a bike, I would be more than comfortable wearing these open wireless earbuds in a situation where I needed to hear my surroundings. I f you\u2019re in need of hands-free controls, the Clip1 also have touch inputs which allow you to double and triple-tap the piece that rests behind your ear on either earbuds to play and pause, and skip tracks respectively. It\u2019s a little awkward at first, tapping behind your ear like that, but once you get the hang of it, they work just fine. As long as we\u2019re talking about design, it\u2019s worth mentioning one area that I actually don\u2019t think the Clip1 takes the crown over Bose in, and that\u2019s looks. There\u2019s nothing particularly offensive about the Clip1 design, but it\u2019s not my cup of tea if Bose is the comparison. The Clip1 is a little bit lower profile compared to the Ultra Open Earbuds, which is nice, but I actually appreciate the almost cyberpunk look, even if they\u2019re more noticeable when they\u2019re clipped onto your ears. Similarly, the charging case of the Clip1 is fine but very cheap-feeling, thanks to the shiny, smooth plastic as opposed to Bose\u2019s almost matte plastic. That\u2019s a minor gripe, all things considered, and even more forgivable when you keep in mind that the Clip1 is $70 compared to Bose\u2019s current $300 price tag on the Ultra Open Earbuds. Open wireless earbuds may not have the benefit of canceling noise like other wireless earbuds, but that lack of ANC is actually a blessing in some ways, mostly when it comes to battery life. According to Soundpeats, the Clip1 should get 8 hours on a single charge when being played at 60% volume. That battery life tracks in my testing; after more than two hours of listening, I was at about 80%, though I wasn\u2019t listening to audio the entire time (I took some short breaks intermittently). I wouldn\u2019t call 8 hours impressive by wireless earbuds standards, but it does notably beat the Bose Ultra Open, which get about 7.5 hours on a single charge. For context, some wireless earbuds that I\u2019ve tested this year, like the Technics EAH-AZ100, get 10 hours on a single charge with\u00c2\u00a0ANC activated. Again, though, those wireless earbuds are also $300 compared to the Clip1\u2019s $70 price tag, so maybe that comparison is a little unfair. For me, I have no major complaints in the battery life department when it comes to the Clip1; I think they\u2019ll last long enough to satisfy most people. As for features, there are quite a few things to take advantage of in the Soundpeats app, including the ability to toggle on Dolby audio for \u201cmovie mode\u201d and \u201cmusic mode,\u201d which are meant to provide \u201cimmersive 3D sound.\u201d I tested both, and while I could do without movie mode (sorry, I know it\u2019s supposed to give in-movie audio a sense of space, but I think it just makes everything sound worse), music mode actually sounds pretty good. I don\u2019t need music mode toggled on to enjoy how the Clip1 sound, but I do think using it provides a heightened sense of space and atmosphere in most songs. There are also additional EQ options in the Soundpeats app, including preset EQ for genres like rock and electronic, and even one for enhancing treble, and also a granular 10-band EQ if you\u2019re that kind of person. There is an option to custom-tune the EQ with a hearing test so that the wireless earbuds conform to your specific hearing, but when I tried to take the test, I noticed that lots of the tones being played for me were hard to hear. Picking them up is a lot harder when you\u2019re wearing a pair of open\u00c2\u00a0earbuds, where ambient noise is a factor. For that reason, I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that while you can\u00c2\u00a0take the hearing test for personalized EQ on the Clip1, you should make sure you\u2019re in a very silent location when you do so. As an added bonus, the SoundPeats app also has free, playable white noise for when you just want to zone out (think rain sounds and airplane noises) as well as something called \u201cEQ space\u201d where people can share their custom EQs for things that they like to listen to. Let\u2019s be honest, most people are never going to take advantage of that sort of thing, but having the option is always nice. As I mentioned previously, there are a lot of open-style wireless earbuds on the market nowadays, so making a decision can be tough. Ultimately, though, the equation is simple. Most people, when it comes to open audio, just want something that sounds good, is audible in a range of settings, and is comfortable and practical in terms of battery life and features. For the Clip1, all of those boxes are checked, and while the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds still have the edge in terms of design, that only matters if you really\u00c2\u00a0care about that sort of thing. For most, the $70 price tag and great fit and sound should be enough to give Soundpeats a shot at being their go-to open-ear wireless buds.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"The stock market isn\u2019t just for rich people anymore.\u00a0 More than half of low- and middle-income Americans now invest in capital markets, according to new research by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, a financial nonprofit.\u00a0\u00a0 And a majority of those less-affluent investors, with household incomes ranging from $30,000 to $80,000, started investing in the past 5 years.\u00a0 In prior generations, owning stocks often meant you had a broker and a lot of money. Even today, the top 1% of wealthy Americans owns half of all stock, federal data shows.\u00a0\u00a0 But technological leaps and industry shifts have dramatically lowered the bar for entering the market. Nowadays, just about anyone can buy in.\u00a0 \u201cThe entry barriers are lower,\u201d said Timothy Flacke, CEO of Commonwealth. \u201cYou can start with 50 dollars or, in many cases, a dollar, and a smartphone. That matters.\u201d Stock tips used to circulate in highbrow finance magazines and subscription newsletters as well as country-club golf courses.\u00a0\u00a0 Today, anyone with internet access can summon an avalanche of investment advice with a simple Google search. YouTube and TikTok brim with investment influencers.\u00a0\u00a0 And buying stock has never been easier. Online platforms allow consumers to purchase shares without the aid of brokers or the burden of fees. For the price of a coffee, you can own a piece of the market.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThese days, no brokerages charge commissions, and many of them allow for fractional shares,\u201d said\u202fRobert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser and financial planning expert at The Motley Fool.\u202f\u201cYou can invest as little as 5 dollars, in some cases, and get a portion of a share of Nvidia or Microsoft.\u201d\u00a0 The report from BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, published Oct. 13, draws from a nationally representative survey of more than 2,750 Americans, all from households with low or moderate incomes.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s part of a larger initiative to study the flood of new investors into the stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic years. In 2020 and 2021 alone, individual investors opened 46 million new brokerage accounts.\u00a0\u00a0 The pandemic inspired many Americans to try their hand at investing: They were stuck in their homes, spending less and amassing savings, partly thanks to the federal stimulus effort.\u00a0 \u201cThere were some folks who found themselves either with more cash or with more time,\u201d Flacke said.\u00a0\u00a0 For middle-class Americans, stocks and real estate have served as gateways to the American Dream, rewarding a modest investment with a lifetime of capital gains.\u00a0\u00a0 In recent years, however, spiraling home prices and rising interest rates have pushed homeownership out of reach for many. The stock market, with no minimum investment, remains a viable alternative for building wealth.\u00a0 \u201cA lot of younger people and a lot of lower-income people have not been able to buy their way into the housing market,\u201d said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. \u201cBut they have been able to build their net worth by investing in the stock market, and by owning individual stocks.\u201d\u00a0 As a tool for building wealth, the stock market has done an admirable job of advertising itself.\u00a0\u00a0 The S&P 500 rose by 261% over the past decade, climbing at an annual rate of 13.6%, according to The Motley Fool.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith a few exceptions, the market has been on an extraordinary tear over the last 10-15 years,\u201d Brokamp said. \u201cThat just attracts more attention, and more people invest.\u201d\u00a0 In time, rising stock ownership among lower-income Americans could chip away at historic wealth disparities.\u00a0\u00a0 In the first quarter of 2025, the bottom 50% of Americans by net worth owned just 1% of all stocks, according to a Motley Fool analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 With many more lower- and middle-income consumers owning stocks, perhaps their portfolios will eventually grow.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAmericans are very good at being consumers,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also becoming better at being owners, owners of the companies that they\u2019re spending money on.\u201d\u00a0 Lower-income investors have much the same aspirations as higher-income Americans, according to the BlackRock report. Survey respondents cited these as their top investment goals:\u00a0 The survey does not include 401(k) accounts, IRAs and other tax-favored investments. It focuses on consumers investing through standard brokerage accounts.\u00a0 The survey found that newer investors are more likely to own individual stocks, rather than mutual funds or ETFs.\u00a0\u00a0 That could be a problem. All stocks are volatile, and individual stocks are generally more mercurial than mutual funds and ETFs, which often mirror the performance of a stock or bond index.\u00a0 \u201cMy personal preference is for people to start with index funds and then move into individual stocks,\u201d Brokamp said. \u201cBut it looks like the opposite is happening now.\u201d\u00a0 The survey suggests new investors \u201care really hungry for information about how to diversify\u201d their investments, said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. \u201cOne of the things the industry can do is meet people where they are.\u201d\u00a0 The financial services industry could help new investors, for example, by encouraging more households to open emergency savings accounts, Chamberlain said.\u00a0\u00a0 A recent analysis by Investopedia found that the average American family should have at least $35,000 in emergency savings to cover unexpected expenses.\u00a0\u00a0 Emergency savings deliver financial security. Without savings, a lower-income family is more apt to cash out an investment account if a car breaks down or the roof leaks.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne of the things that this survey revealed is the importance of having emergency savings,\u201d Chamberlain said, \u201cto support the investor\u2019s ability to stay the course.\u201d\u00a0","label":0}

Read more here OnePlus finally officially launched its next flagship, the OnePlus 15, on Nov. 13. This is the first time we are witnessing an earlier-than-usual global launch, just two weeks after its initial debut in China. The OnePlus 15 evidently looks nothing like its predecessor; it ditches the unique circular camera bump on its rear panel for a more iPhone-esque camera array, off to the left of the device. The phone features an aluminum frame with a ceramic-like feel, including completely flat edges, unlike the slightly curved OnePlus 13. It features a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset and an advanced camera setup with three 50MP lenses powered by OnePlus' DetailMax imaging engine. The OnePlus 15 comes with OxygenOS 16, based on Android 16, which takes personalization up a notch with features like Plus Mind, Gemini-integrated Mind Space, and more. The OnePlus 15 is available in three color options: Infinite Black, Sand Storm, and Ultra Violet. It will be available in two main configurations. The phone will be available for purchase in Canada; however, U.S. customers may have to wait a bit longer, as OnePlus has announced that sales have been postponed due to the U.S. government shutdown. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android      Read more here Galaxy tri-folding phone is supposedly gearing up for a launch next month, and more information seems to be coming in about the device. This week, tipster Evan Blass on X shared \"confirmed details\" about the device. Blass says Samsung has reportedly finalized the branding of its first trifolding phone and that it will indeed be called the \"Galaxy Z TriFold.\" Blass also mentions that the Z TriFold will come with a 6.5-inch outer display and a 10-inch inner panel when fully unfolded, something that has already leaked. However, the new detail here is the peak brightness numbers. Blass says the cover display will reach 2,600 nits, while the inner foldable display will reach 1,600 nits. The phone will allegedly show up with a 5,437 mAh battery and feature a 200MP primary camera, powered by a Snapdragon chipset. Other details about the phone are still a mystery; hopefully, we'll know more soon.      Read more here Google just dumped a whole host of new features for Pixel 6 users and up this week! The November Pixel drop brings a mix of fresh AI tools, safety upgrades, and a themed makeover inspired by Wicked. It also brings Remix in Google Messages, a new feature powered by Google\u2019s Gemini Nano Banana model. It lets you tweak photos in a chat. You and your friends can pass the same image back and forth, tweaking and remixing it without ever leaving the conversation \u2014 much like the edit feature in WhatsApp. Furthermore, the Wicked: For Good theme pack offers Wicked-inspired wallpapers, icons, sounds, and GIFs, featuring themes based on Glinda, Elphaba, and the song \"For Good.\" Google is also tightening up security on Pixel phones, which checks message content and shows a \u201cLikely scam\u201d alert before you open the app. For Pixel 9 and newer, Call Notes is also expanding internationally. Google Photos gets Personalized edits, while Google Maps gets a boost with a new Power Saving Mode.      Read more here We're a few months away from Samsung's Unpacked event; however, the Galaxy S26 leaks keep getting better. While there were tons of specs and launch day-related leaks, this one specifically addresses rumors about its launch. Earlier this month, we heard some chatter that Samsung's replacing the Galaxy S26 Edge with the Galaxy S26 Plus, leading to delays. However, a new leak from Korean outlet ChosunBiz (via @Jukanlosreve on X) suggests that Samsung is targeting a late January launch for the Galaxy S26 series, with market availability by mid-February. In other news, we got our first look at the alleged Galaxy S26 Plus, thanks to life-like CAD renders. The Galaxy S26 Plus could feature a 6.7-inch AMOLED 2X flat display with thin, uniform bezels and a centered camera hole. However, as seen in previous leaks, Samsung could be making the phones more ergonomic, meaning the device may have more rounded corners when compared to the Galaxy S25 Plus. All buttons, including the power\/lock and volume keys, seem to be located on the right side.      Read more here Motorola recently announced two new phones in its affordable lineup. However, the word on the street is that it could be working on a premium device that isn't the Motorola Razer. According to a post on X, the Edge 70 Ultra is expected to get the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, and could have an Adreno 829 GPU and 16GB of RAM. Rumored to show up with some flagship specs and Android 16 out of the box, details about this premium device remain scarce. However, the tipster did mention the XT2603-1 model number, suggesting a Chinese variant of the phone, which could be called the Moto X70 Ultra, going by Motorola's usual naming convention. The phone could see the thinness of the Edge 70 and some of the latest AI quirks, although we don't know much about the phone just yet. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":" There\u2019s something slightly absurd yet completely mesmerizing about the idea of working out with equipment covered in Swarovski crystals. But here we are in 2025, and Polish luxury fitness brand PENT has partnered with Swarovski to create gym equipment that looks like it belongs in a museum rather than your basement workout space. Let\u2019s be honest. Most of us have dumbbells tucked away in closets or gathering dust under the bed. They\u2019re functional, sure, but they\u2019re not exactly objects you\u2019d want to display on your coffee table. PENT is completely flipping that script with their \u201cEmbellished with Crystals by Swarovski\u201d collection, which features handcrafted dumbbells and kettlebells that are as much about aesthetics as they are about bicep curls. Designer: PENT x Swarovski        The collection includes the COLMIA dumbbells and LOVA kettlebells, each one meticulously handmade in Poland using materials that sound more suited to a luxury yacht than a home gym. We\u2019re talking walnut or ash wood handles, Italian leather, stainless steel, and of course, those signature Swarovski crystals hand-applied to every piece. Even the storage racks are designed with architectural precision, so the equipment becomes a sculptural element in your space rather than something you need to hide away. What makes this collaboration particularly interesting is how it challenges our assumptions about where luxury belongs. Fitness equipment has traditionally been purely utilitarian. You want something that works, not something that sparkles. But as home wellness spaces have evolved from dingy garage setups to carefully curated environments, there\u2019s clearly a market for equipment that doubles as design objects. According to Iron House Design, which is bringing the collection to the U.S. market, these pieces are intended for luxury home gyms, private spas, hotel suites, and superyacht interiors.       The price tag reflects this positioning. The collection starts at around $613 for dumbbells with a wooden stand and goes up to $681 for kettlebells, though more customized sets can reach $25,000 depending on the level of crystal detailing and personalization you want. That\u2019s a significant investment for equipment you could theoretically replace with a $30 set from a sporting goods store. But that misses the point entirely. These aren\u2019t meant to be practical purchases in the traditional sense. They\u2019re statement pieces that happen to be functional. Tanya Ryno, founder of Iron House Design, describes them as being \u201cfor those who make bold statements with every choice.\u201d It\u2019s for the person who wants every element of their home to reflect a certain level of taste and refinement, from the artwork on the walls to the weights on the floor.  The collaboration also taps into a broader cultural shift around wellness and self-care. Exercise is no longer just about breaking a sweat or hitting certain fitness goals. For many people, especially in the luxury market, it\u2019s about the entire experience. The space you work out in matters. The equipment you use matters. And increasingly, people are willing to invest in making those experiences feel special. That said, there\u2019s an inevitable question hovering over the whole thing: would you actually work out with crystal-covered dumbbells, or would you just keep them on display? According to reports, many owners treat them more like collectible art pieces or conversation starters rather than everyday workout tools. Some designers are even using them purely as decorative elements in high-end spaces. Technically, these pieces are engineered to meet professional fitness standards, so you absolutely could use them for your actual workouts. The wooden handles are smooth and ergonomically designed, and the stainless steel ends are weighted properly. But when something is that beautiful and that expensive, there\u2019s an understandable hesitation to actually get your sweat all over it.   What the PENT x Swarovski collection really represents is the ongoing blurring of boundaries between different design categories. Furniture looks like art.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Investing  \t\t\t\t\tSending You to Google News in 3  \u00a9 William Potter \/ Shutterstock.com  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to dominate the tech landscape as a powerhouse in consumer electronics and services, with its stock delivering robust returns for investors amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Valued at over $4 trillion, the company thrives on its integrated ecosystem, where custom silicon plays a pivotal role in driving performance gains across iPhones, Macs, and emerging AR\/VR devices.\u00a0 By prioritizing in-house chip design through Apple Silicon, Apple reduces dependency on external suppliers while enhancing efficiency, power management, and AI capabilities \u2014 key factors in maintaining competitive edges against rivals. This strategic focus on semiconductor innovation not only fuels product differentiation but also positions Apple for sustained growth in high-margin segments. And it just engineered a strategic coup that investors should seize upon when searching for tomorrow\u2019s cutting-edge tech leaders to buy.\u00a0 The tech giant just gave itself a strategic advantage over rivals by securing over half of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2018s (NYSE:TSM) 2 nanometer (nm) production capacity for 2026. This deal underscores Apple\u2019s proactive approach to chip supply amid surging demand from the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and others for advanced semiconductors, demand that far exceeds Taiwan Semi\u2019s current and projected supply, even with production ramping up significantly for 2026.\u00a0 Taiwan Semiconductor \u2014 the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker \u2014 plans to ramp up mass production of its 2nm process by late 2025, with Apple earmarking the capacity for upcoming products like the iPhone 18\u2019s A20 chips, MacBook\u2019s M6 processors, and Vision Pro R2. The agreement extends to the foundry\u2019s expansion efforts, including accelerated 2nm development at its Arizona facilities. Taiwan Semi is investing heavily in the U.S., with commitments topping $165 billion, driven by AI demand from American clients. About 30% of its 2nm and more advanced output will come from Arizona, helping diversify production away from Taiwan amid geopolitical tensions.\u00a0 Apple\u2019s lock-in ensures priority access, potentially depriving rivals like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) of ample supply as the foundry\u2019s two main 2nm plants in Taiwan are already sold out for 2026. For Apple, this reservation guarantees a technological edge. By dominating 2nm capacity, the company can integrate cutting-edge chips into its devices, boosting performance in AI-driven features like on-device processing for Siri enhancements and machine learning in photography.\u00a0 This move aligns with Apple\u2019s shift toward custom silicon, reducing reliance on third-party designs and enabling tighter hardware-software optimization. It positions Apple to maintain premium pricing and market share in smartphones, computers, and AR\/VR, where efficiency gains from smaller nodes translate to longer battery life and faster computations. For Taiwan Semiconductor, it benefits from secured revenue streams, as Apple\u2019s orders represent a significant portion of its output. However, the tight capacity highlights supply chain vulnerabilities; with 15 customers vying for 2nm slots, mostly in high-performance computing and AI, the foundry faces pressure to expand rapidly.\u00a0 The Arizona acceleration \u2014 pulled forward due to the AI boom \u2014 could mitigate risks but involves higher costs from U.S. labor and regulations. Overall, this partnership strengthens Taiwan Semi\u2019s dominance while exposing it to demand fluctuations if economic slowdowns hit. The 2nm node represents a leap in semiconductor manufacturing. Node size refers to the transistor gate length; smaller nodes pack more transistors per chip, improving speed by up to 15% and reducing power use by 30% compared to 3nm. This is crucial for AI inference, where efficient, low-power chips enable real-time processing in edge devices like phones and wearables.\u00a0 For industries beyond consumer tech, 2nm fuels advancements in data centers, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare AI. As Moore\u2019s Law slows, mastering 2nm cements leadership in the $500 billion chip market, where supply shortages could spark an \u201cAI arms race\u201d among tech giants. This development could propel Apple to the forefront of tech innovation by ensuring unrivaled chip performance, fostering breakthroughs in AI-integrated products and sustaining its ecosystem moat. It\u2019s also not unprecedented. Apple followed a similar pattern with the 3nm node, where it secured a large portion of the initial supply, giving it a first-mover advantage. For investors eyeing Apple\u2019s stock, it signals long-term growth potential amid AI hype, with supply security mitigating risks from global chip shortages. However, consider valuation \u2014 Apple still trades at a premium (though not unreasonably so), so its success hinges on executing these chips into hit devices.\u00a0 Apple stock still should be considered as a core long-term holding in portfolios, but it could be balanced by pairing it with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for full exposure to the broader advanced semiconductor upswing.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Next year, Apple is reportedly going to debut a new MacBook model beneath the MacBook Air. It\u2019ll be the first MacBook to utilize iPhone silicon, and it\u2019ll be the first MacBook that sells far beneath the $999 price point. It sounds like a winning formula \u2013 but will it actually be one? The budget MacBook has a couple key specifications already rumored, though a lot of it is up in air still: Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes this\u2019ll sell around 5-7 million units in 2026, bringing the Mac lineup back to its COVID-19 peak of around 25 million annual units. This means that the new budget MacBook might make up at least 20% of overall MacBook sales. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman also reports that this\u2019ll target \u201cwould-be iPad buyers who might prefer a traditional laptop experience instead.\u201d Ultimately, whether or not it\u2019ll win depends on the price point, as well as what it offers at that price point. Given Apple\u2019s ambitious sales numbers, it might be closer to $600 or $700, which would be quite compelling. Given the fact that it\u2019ll have an A18 Pro chipset, one could reasonably guess that the Mac might have 8GB of RAM, compared to 16GB on newer models. This would be an okay compromise at the sub-$700 price point. However, if the cheaper MacBook comes in closer to $800, that\u2019ll be more of a tough sell \u2013 given the fact that MacBook Air models regularly go on sale for that ~$800 price point.  For example, M4 MacBook Air is on sale on Amazon for $749 right now. Currently, Apple offers the M1 MacBook Air through Walmart for $599, and that\u2019s seemingly been performing well. If this new MacBook doesn\u2019t compromise too heavily while coming in at a nice price, it could be a worthwhile buy. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman specifically highlights that the \u201cupcoming model will be an entirely new design, rather than a discounted older machine,\u201d suggesting that this design will certainly look different compared to everything else we\u2019ve seen. Overall, I still think this new cheaper MacBook will be one of the most interesting Apple product launches of 2026. It\u2019s always fun to see Apple enter new markets. Unlike iPhone 16e, I do think this one will stick the landing, so long as Apple doesn\u2019t overprice it. Gurman reports it\u2019ll launch in the first half of next year, so it shouldn\u2019t be too long before we know all of the details. What do you think of this upcoming budget MacBook? Are you in the market for one? Let us know in the comments.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"REWIND and PLAY    Although we make regular trips down under, your humble author is based in California and so is the Floodgap computer lab. For newly manufactured items and parts it has generally been my policy to buy parts from United States sellers even prior to the tariffs, mostly because that gets around various irregularities and it arrives more quickly. If they're going to drop-ship then it's their problem, not mine, because they advertised it was already here. Since such items are typically newly produced, the current tariffs would logically apply and this policy thus has the additional benefit of me not having to deal with that directly: any tariff should already have been paid to get them States-side.  But for NOS and used parts, especially if you are a collector like I am for certain systems, you buy where you can find them. Coincidentally I wanted to buy a second Apple Network Server logic board since my ANS 700 is acting a little weird (don't say caps) and I still want a good spare for the ANS 500. These don't exactly grow on trees but, as it turns out, the seller I bought my current spare logic board from (pre-tariffs) had another in stock. The logic board doesn't come with the regular ANS AIX ROM SIMM nor cache, so we'll want one each of those just in case, and he also had an Apple BTO Twin Turbo video card (I believe originally for the Power Macintosh 9500) which might also be nice for one of the other beige PCI Macs. These are all new old stock items in their Apple Service packaging because obviously Apple hasn't made nor sold any of these parts in decades. Per the seller, they came from the teardown of new machines which Apple was unable to sell and got turned into official surplus new stock. The seller is in an European Union country, so we're not talking some shady Shenzhen shop operating off an alley liftgate. (I'm not naming the seller because none of this is his fault and I'm sure he'd not like to be contacted about this.)  The items came to \u20ac296.00, about US$355 at the spot exchange rate, plus \u20ac48.10 for UPS shipping. This would have been well-under the prior de minimis exemption even with the shipping rolled in. We had to do UPS because his particular country's postal service limits shipment value to the United States to US$100 due to the tariffs, causing him to spend a substantial amount of time at the UPS drop-off depot and on the paperwork, which was way more than he was required to do and I very much appreciate. For any import you need to come up with a Harmonized System code for what you're shipping, which then maps to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule code specific to the United States. These parts are all populated PCBs and most populated boards are, by prior rulings, classified with an HTS code of 8473.30, which is what the seller tagged all four items with. This code is for \"Parts and accessories of the machines of heading 8471 [Automatic data processing machines and units thereof].\" If you look under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule search engine for this code, you find a duty rate for certain subheadings that at most would be 35 percent, or even if these were products of the People's Republic of China (they're old enough that I don't know their exact provenance, but I have no evidence to believe these were originally), then maybe, maybe, maybe an additional 25 percent. The declared value was the purchase price in euros and he even picked up the insurance. The package left the depot uneventfully and worked its way across the continent.  The first sign of trouble was over the weekend when I got an unexpected message.    The UPS shipping agent had indicated the parcel was subject to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, which required me to fill out a UPS-specific form attesting to the steel and aluminum content of the package. (This is an important distinction because Section 232 is not currently part of the present matter before the U.S. Supreme Court (PDF), only reciprocal tariffs under the IEEPA.) There should be little or no aluminum in these because the board and traces would be copper. However, a PCI card is probably going to have a steel bracket, so I looked at the typical mass for those and picked a sufficiently high number of 149g, almost certainly an overestimate but that's always safest with this stuff, then looked at the spot price of stainless steel and based on that weight computed a steel content value of $0.48. I marked \"not applicable\" for everything else and sent it back. They accepted that.  In the background, all this goes into a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501, also known as an Entry Summary. It is important to realize that in this circumstance, with UPS as the broker, you are not actually the importer of record \u2014 they are. You are the \"ultimate consignee.\" Based on the information provided and the judgement of the broker's agent, then a tariff is assigned and added to the paperwork, which is \"assessed\" by CBP but in practice is being assessed by the broker based on what they expect CBP would charge under current regulation. Ordinarily you don't see this form. CBP does spot-check these but the majority just go through. Since UPS is the importer in this situation, they also pay the tariff they computed \"in advance\" to clear customs, and then they charge you for that plus their broker fee.  It took several more days for the actual tariff bill to arrive, which was early Monday morning. Now, the initial E-mail said this:    Yes, the initial bill was for US$711. When I logged in, however, it gave me a total of $698 because it hadn't yet been delivered, which included a $14 brokerage fee.    Time was of the essence, however, because it was arriving that day. I was absolutely incandescent to have to do it, but I paid the entire charge in full on the spot, and this is the correct thing to do. The last thing you want is for your package to get redirected to a warehouse pending your payment, because any shipper will start tacking on storage fees and they have no incentive to get it out of storage quickly. For UPS, a direct quote from their own agents, \"Warehouse charges will be added on shipments that are held in our warehouse over two business days at a rate of $20.00 per day and $0.04 per pound. ... On the 15th day, all shipments will be eligible for General Order warehousing by U.S. Customs. Any shipment moved to a G.O. warehouse will be assigned additional warehouse fees over and above any UPS warehouse fees. If imposed, these fees must be paid in full before the shipment can be removed.\" Obviously I wanted no part of that.  After I had been advised by the system the package would be delivered as scheduled, I then relentlessly abused the AI chatbot on UPS' home page until it asked for my phone number and I got a callback into their phone support line. The first person on the line advised me they didn't handle tariffs and transferred me to another department, after which I spent (not an exaggeration) 45 minutes on hold until it was answered. This new agent said that this was dealt with through a specific subgroup on the UPS post entry team that didn't do anything by phone. (These brokerage teams generally operate out of the Kentucky UPS Worldport hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, formerly Standiford Field, hence its IATA code of SDF that also turns up in UPS documentation.) He gave me an E-mail address that looked like line noise but I confirmed it twice with him and also that I had to put the tracking number into the subject line with the magic words \"Disputing Duties and Custom Charges.\" I indicated in the message the fees were paid but that I believed they were unreasonable and incorrect, and also pointed out I submitted the Section 232 paperwork when requested.  It took a day to get a reply, then came the United States Veterans' Day holiday, and finally I heard back yesterday from a second agent that they had \"corrected this shipment.\" What they had done was file an amended Form 7501 and this 7501 they actually sent me so I could see the results. The declared value was changed to US$342 (I presume a difference in the spot exchange rate at the time of filing) and now it had two HTSUS numbers. The entire $342 was attributed to 8473.30.2000, a slightly different code for \"Parts and accessories, including face plates and lock latches, of printed circuit assemblies\" which might be referring to the bracket I declared in the Section 232 form. There was no tariff on this (\"FREE\"). However, a second code 9903.02.20 was added, a long-winded way of saying a tariff (in this case 15%) on \"articles the product of the European Union.\" This was $51.30 and the final tariff.  Everything arrived safely, by the way, and in excellent condition (though I cracked open the antistatic bag on the ANS board to take off the Maxell battery which Apple always shipped logic boards with back then). However, I would like to point out for the sake of accuracy that the ANS logic board, ROM SIMM and cache DIMM have no country of origin printed on them. Only the Twin Turbo card does, and it says ...    .. but since it wasn't the major part of the order it seemed like I'd be wasting even more time over ten or fifteen bucks to appeal this too. Your mileage and motivation may vary.  Now that UPS was into me for $632.70, the revising agent said, \"Any difference between the amount paid and the amount now reflected will be auto-refunded to you. Most of the time, this is done by check sent to the billing address, you can expect this between 2-6 weeks.\" They didn't say when they don't use a check (I paid with a credit card), but they did give me a phone number for accounting, which I'll call if UPS fails to pay back this particular interest-free loan.  So that's the sordid tale. Even though UPS (mostly) made this right, I'm still unhappy with them for screwing up so badly in the first place because I'm out the money until they get around to reimbursing me. You'd think someone would have noticed that a thumping big duty like that seemed a little weird for a transaction of this size and maybe called a supervisor or something. The fact it could be so promptly appealed \u2014 and reversed in a few days, something that hardly ever happens with the federal government \u2014 pretty much demonstrates it was their call to ding it for that much in duty in the first place. I'm also unhappy with them for only alerting me to the final cost of the tariff when the shipment was inbound and due for delivery instead of earlier when it was assessed, because they have you over a barrel at that point unless you want to take your chances with their brokerage warehouse. This obviously nets them more money with the people who won't pay up immediately, but it's undeniably pretty bad customer service. Unfortunately, my unscientific survey of reports in the UPS Reddit indicate I am far from the only person to get a disproportionate assessment of this type.  Regardless, if this happens to you \u2014 whether it's FedEx or DHL or UPS or whatever \u2014 pay it and then appeal it. Don't let your shipment go to a warehouse and don't bounce it back to the sender; since odds are the shipper (because they are likely the importer of record) has already paid the duty, they're going to want their money back and you'll be out the money and the items. But, by golly, appeal it: just because you might agree with it politically doesn't mean they did it right.     Although we make regular trips down under, your humble author is based in California and so is the Floodgap computer lab.

This code is for \"Parts and accessories of the machines of heading 8471 [Automatic data processing machines and units thereof].\" If you look under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule search engine for this code, you find a duty rate for certain subheadings that at most would be 35 percent, or even if these were products of the People's Republic of China (they're old enough that I don't know their exact provenance, but I have no evidence to believe these were originally), then maybe, maybe, maybe an additional 25 percent. The declared value was the purchase price in euros and he even picked up the insurance. The package left the depot uneventfully and worked its way across the continent.  The first sign of trouble was over the weekend when I got an unexpected message.    The UPS shipping agent had indicated the parcel was subject to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, which required me to fill out a UPS-specific form attesting to the steel and aluminum content of the package. (This is an important distinction because Section 232 is not currently part of the present matter before the U.S. Supreme Court (PDF), only reciprocal tariffs under the IEEPA.) There should be little or no aluminum in these because the board and traces would be copper. However, a PCI card is probably going to have a steel bracket, so I looked at the typical mass for those and picked a sufficiently high number of 149g, almost certainly an overestimate but that's always safest with this stuff, then looked at the spot price of stainless steel and based on that weight computed a steel content value of $0.48. I marked \"not applicable\" for everything else and sent it back. They accepted that.  In the background, all this goes into a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501, also known as an Entry Summary. It is important to realize that in this circumstance, with UPS as the broker, you are not actually the importer of record \u2014 they are. You are the \"ultimate consignee.\" Based on the information provided and the judgement of the broker's agent, then a tariff is assigned and added to the paperwork, which is \"assessed\" by CBP but in practice is being assessed by the broker based on what they expect CBP would charge under current regulation. Ordinarily you don't see this form. CBP does spot-check these but the majority just go through. Since UPS is the importer in this situation, they also pay the tariff they computed \"in advance\" to clear customs, and then they charge you for that plus their broker fee.  It took several more days for the actual tariff bill to arrive, which was early Monday morning. Now, the initial E-mail said this:    Yes, the initial bill was for US$711. When I logged in, however, it gave me a total of $698 because it hadn't yet been delivered, which included a $14 brokerage fee.    Time was of the essence, however, because it was arriving that day. I was absolutely incandescent to have to do it, but I paid the entire charge in full on the spot, and this is the correct thing to do. The last thing you want is for your package to get redirected to a warehouse pending your payment, because any shipper will start tacking on storage fees and they have no incentive to get it out of storage quickly. For UPS, a direct quote from their own agents, \"Warehouse charges will be added on shipments that are held in our warehouse over two business days at a rate of $20.00 per day and $0.04 per pound. ... On the 15th day, all shipments will be eligible for General Order warehousing by U.S. Customs. Any shipment moved to a G.O. warehouse will be assigned additional warehouse fees over and above any UPS warehouse fees. If imposed, these fees must be paid in full before the shipment can be removed.\" Obviously I wanted no part of that.  After I had been advised by the system the package would be delivered as scheduled, I then relentlessly abused the AI chatbot on UPS' home page until it asked for my phone number and I got a callback into their phone support line. The first person on the line advised me they didn't handle tariffs and transferred me to another department, after which I spent (not an exaggeration) 45 minutes on hold until it was answered. This new agent said that this was dealt with through a specific subgroup on the UPS post entry team that didn't do anything by phone. (These brokerage teams generally operate out of the Kentucky UPS Worldport hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, formerly Standiford Field, hence its IATA code of SDF that also turns up in UPS documentation.) He gave me an E-mail address that looked like line noise but I confirmed it twice with him and also that I had to put the tracking number into the subject line with the magic words \"Disputing Duties and Custom Charges.\" I indicated in the message the fees were paid but that I believed they were unreasonable and incorrect, and also pointed out I submitted the Section 232 paperwork when requested.  It took a day to get a reply, then came the United States Veterans' Day holiday, and finally I heard back yesterday from a second agent that they had \"corrected this shipment.\" What they had done was file an amended Form 7501 and this 7501 they actually sent me so I could see the results. The declared value was changed to US$342 (I presume a difference in the spot exchange rate at the time of filing) and now it had two HTSUS numbers. The entire $342 was attributed to 8473.30.2000, a slightly different code for \"Parts and accessories, including face plates and lock latches, of printed circuit assemblies\" which might be referring to the bracket I declared in the Section 232 form. There was no tariff on this (\"FREE\"). However, a second code 9903.02.20 was added, a long-winded way of saying a tariff (in this case 15%) on \"articles the product of the European Union.\" This was $51.30 and the final tariff.  Everything arrived safely, by the way, and in excellent condition (though I cracked open the antistatic bag on the ANS board to take off the Maxell battery which Apple always shipped logic boards with back then). However, I would like to point out for the sake of accuracy that the ANS logic board, ROM SIMM and cache DIMM have no country of origin printed on them. Only the Twin Turbo card does, and it says ...    .. but since it wasn't the major part of the order it seemed like I'd be wasting even more time over ten or fifteen bucks to appeal this too. Your mileage and motivation may vary.  Now that UPS was into me for $632.70, the revising agent said, \"Any difference between the amount paid and the amount now reflected will be auto-refunded to you. Most of the time, this is done by check sent to the billing address, you can expect this between 2-6 weeks.\" They didn't say when they don't use a check (I paid with a credit card), but they did give me a phone number for accounting, which I'll call if UPS fails to pay back this particular interest-free loan.  So that's the sordid tale. Even though UPS (mostly) made this right, I'm still unhappy with them for screwing up so badly in the first place because I'm out the money until they get around to reimbursing me. You'd think someone would have noticed that a thumping big duty like that seemed a little weird for a transaction of this size and maybe called a supervisor or something. The fact it could be so promptly appealed \u2014 and reversed in a few days, something that hardly ever happens with the federal government \u2014 pretty much demonstrates it was their call to ding it for that much in duty in the first place. I'm also unhappy with them for only alerting me to the final cost of the tariff when the shipment was inbound and due for delivery instead of earlier when it was assessed, because they have you over a barrel at that point unless you want to take your chances with their brokerage warehouse. This obviously nets them more money with the people who won't pay up immediately, but it's undeniably pretty bad customer service. Unfortunately, my unscientific survey of reports in the UPS Reddit indicate I am far from the only person to get a disproportionate assessment of this type.  Regardless, if this happens to you \u2014 whether it's FedEx or DHL or UPS or whatever \u2014 pay it and then appeal it. Don't let your shipment go to a warehouse and don't bounce it back to the sender; since odds are the shipper (because they are likely the importer of record) has already paid the duty, they're going to want their money back and you'll be out the money and the items. But, by golly, appeal it: just because you might agree with it politically doesn't mean they did it right.     But for NOS and used parts, especially if you are a collector like I am for certain systems, you buy where you can find them. Coincidentally I wanted to buy a second Apple Network Server logic board since my ANS 700 is acting a little weird (don't say caps) and I still want a good spare for the ANS 500. These don't exactly grow on trees but, as it turns out, the seller I bought my current spare logic board from (pre-tariffs) had another in stock. The logic board doesn't come with the regular ANS AIX ROM SIMM nor cache, so we'll want one each of those just in case, and he also had an Apple BTO Twin Turbo video card (I believe originally for the Power Macintosh 9500) which might also be nice for one of the other beige PCI Macs. These are all new old stock items in their Apple Service packaging because obviously Apple hasn't made nor sold any of these parts in decades. Per the seller, they came from the teardown of new machines which Apple was unable to sell and got turned into official surplus new stock. The seller is in an European Union country, so we're not talking some shady Shenzhen shop operating off an alley liftgate. (I'm not naming the seller because none of this is his fault and I'm sure he'd not like to be contacted about this.)  The items came to \u20ac296.00, about US$355 at the spot exchange rate, plus \u20ac48.10 for UPS shipping. This would have been well-under the prior de minimis exemption even with the shipping rolled in. We had to do UPS because his particular country's postal service limits shipment value to the United States to US$100 due to the tariffs, causing him to spend a substantial amount of time at the UPS drop-off depot and on the paperwork, which was way more than he was required to do and I very much appreciate. For any import you need to come up with a Harmonized System code for what you're shipping, which then maps to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule code specific to the United States. These parts are all populated PCBs and most populated boards are, by prior rulings, classified with an HTS code of 8473.30, which is what the seller tagged all four items with.

The entire $342 was attributed to 8473.30.2000, a slightly different code for \"Parts and accessories, including face plates and lock latches, of printed circuit assemblies\" which might be referring to the bracket I declared in the Section 232 form. There was no tariff on this (\"FREE\"). However, a second code 9903.02.20 was added, a long-winded way of saying a tariff (in this case 15%) on \"articles the product of the European Union.\" This was $51.30 and the final tariff.  Everything arrived safely, by the way, and in excellent condition (though I cracked open the antistatic bag on the ANS board to take off the Maxell battery which Apple always shipped logic boards with back then). However, I would like to point out for the sake of accuracy that the ANS logic board, ROM SIMM and cache DIMM have no country of origin printed on them. Only the Twin Turbo card does, and it says ...    .. but since it wasn't the major part of the order it seemed like I'd be wasting even more time over ten or fifteen bucks to appeal this too. Your mileage and motivation may vary.  Now that UPS was into me for $632.70, the revising agent said, \"Any difference between the amount paid and the amount now reflected will be auto-refunded to you. Most of the time, this is done by check sent to the billing address, you can expect this between 2-6 weeks.\" They didn't say when they don't use a check (I paid with a credit card), but they did give me a phone number for accounting, which I'll call if UPS fails to pay back this particular interest-free loan.  So that's the sordid tale. Even though UPS (mostly) made this right, I'm still unhappy with them for screwing up so badly in the first place because I'm out the money until they get around to reimbursing me. You'd think someone would have noticed that a thumping big duty like that seemed a little weird for a transaction of this size and maybe called a supervisor or something. The fact it could be so promptly appealed \u2014 and reversed in a few days, something that hardly ever happens with the federal government \u2014 pretty much demonstrates it was their call to ding it for that much in duty in the first place. I'm also unhappy with them for only alerting me to the final cost of the tariff when the shipment was inbound and due for delivery instead of earlier when it was assessed, because they have you over a barrel at that point unless you want to take your chances with their brokerage warehouse. This obviously nets them more money with the people who won't pay up immediately, but it's undeniably pretty bad customer service. Unfortunately, my unscientific survey of reports in the UPS Reddit indicate I am far from the only person to get a disproportionate assessment of this type.  Regardless, if this happens to you \u2014 whether it's FedEx or DHL or UPS or whatever \u2014 pay it and then appeal it. Don't let your shipment go to a warehouse and don't bounce it back to the sender; since odds are the shipper (because they are likely the importer of record) has already paid the duty, they're going to want their money back and you'll be out the money and the items. But, by golly, appeal it: just because you might agree with it politically doesn't mean they did it right.     In the background, all this goes into a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501, also known as an Entry Summary. It is important to realize that in this circumstance, with UPS as the broker, you are not actually the importer of record \u2014 they are. You are the \"ultimate consignee.\" Based on the information provided and the judgement of the broker's agent, then a tariff is assigned and added to the paperwork, which is \"assessed\" by CBP but in practice is being assessed by the broker based on what they expect CBP would charge under current regulation. Ordinarily you don't see this form. CBP does spot-check these but the majority just go through. Since UPS is the importer in this situation, they also pay the tariff they computed \"in advance\" to clear customs, and then they charge you for that plus their broker fee.  It took several more days for the actual tariff bill to arrive, which was early Monday morning. Now, the initial E-mail said this:    Yes, the initial bill was for US$711. When I logged in, however, it gave me a total of $698 because it hadn't yet been delivered, which included a $14 brokerage fee.    Time was of the essence, however, because it was arriving that day. I was absolutely incandescent to have to do it, but I paid the entire charge in full on the spot, and this is the correct thing to do. The last thing you want is for your package to get redirected to a warehouse pending your payment, because any shipper will start tacking on storage fees and they have no incentive to get it out of storage quickly. For UPS, a direct quote from their own agents, \"Warehouse charges will be added on shipments that are held in our warehouse over two business days at a rate of $20.00 per day and $0.04 per pound. ... On the 15th day, all shipments will be eligible for General Order warehousing by U.S. Customs. Any shipment moved to a G.O. warehouse will be assigned additional warehouse fees over and above any UPS warehouse fees. If imposed, these fees must be paid in full before the shipment can be removed.\" Obviously I wanted no part of that.  After I had been advised by the system the package would be delivered as scheduled, I then relentlessly abused the AI chatbot on UPS' home page until it asked for my phone number and I got a callback into their phone support line. The first person on the line advised me they didn't handle tariffs and transferred me to another department, after which I spent (not an exaggeration) 45 minutes on hold until it was answered. This new agent said that this was dealt with through a specific subgroup on the UPS post entry team that didn't do anything by phone. (These brokerage teams generally operate out of the Kentucky UPS Worldport hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, formerly Standiford Field, hence its IATA code of SDF that also turns up in UPS documentation.) He gave me an E-mail address that looked like line noise but I confirmed it twice with him and also that I had to put the tracking number into the subject line with the magic words \"Disputing Duties and Custom Charges.\" I indicated in the message the fees were paid but that I believed they were unreasonable and incorrect, and also pointed out I submitted the Section 232 paperwork when requested.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"     What do you get with the stripped-down Model Y and Model 3? A lower price, for starters.    The Tesla Model Y Standard model in white. Notice that the front has standard headlights instead of the light bar found on the original version. Tesla has finally launched a range of more affordable electric cars. These aren't all-new cars, but rather stripped-back versions of the\u00a0refreshed Model Y\u00a0and\u00a0Model 3\u00a0to lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to step into Tesla ownership.  This change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both EVs, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\u00a0  The idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.  It comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from\u00a0Kelley Blue Book, the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.  This is what the rear of the Tesla Model Y Standard looks like. It has the same light bar as the regular version. The Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.  Inside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\u00a0  Tesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.  Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. The rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.  The Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\u00a0  The front of a Tesla Model 3 Standard driving along a road. It looks identical to the regular Model 3. Meanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\u00a0  Tesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.  It retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\u00a0  Charging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.  Both cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\u00a0  Full Self-Driving is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.  I think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\u00a0  In my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.  Pricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\u00a0  For now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Apple unveiled the new M5 iPad Pro last month, kicking off a new iPad lineup. While it didn\u2019t bring any headlining upgrades, it does provide us some clues as to what\u2019s coming next for the iPad lineup. Plus, there are many rumors to follow, which we\u2019ll be diving into. The first big iPad launch of 2026 will likely be the next iPad Air model. This\u2019ll bring the M4 chip to the iPad Air, introducing another 10-20% boost in performance compared to the M3 chip. Given the introduction of the N1 chip and the C1X modem in the M5 iPad Pro, it\u2019s probable that the next iPad Air will also make the switch to Apple\u2019s in-house modem and networking chips. This\u2019ll bring faster cellular connectivity and Wi-Fi 7 support. Other than internal chip improvements, there aren\u2019t many clear upgrades for the M4 iPad Air. Plausible, but not rumored upgrades would include a 600 nit display (currently exclusive to the 13-inch model) and new color options. A 90 or 120Hz screen would be nice as well. While OLED has been in the cards for iPad Air, it likely won\u2019t debut until 2027 or later. After that, the budget iPad, which retails at $349 but often goes on sale for $299, is rumored to gain the A18 chip. This one isn\u2019t just a spec bump, as it\u2019ll bring Apple Intelligence capabilities to the budget iPad for the first time. Similar to iPad Air, the budget iPad is also likely to gain Apple\u2019s in-house N1 chip and C1X modems.  Personally, I\u2019d love to see a proper keyboard for the budget iPad, something more akin to the Magic Keyboard for iPad Air and iPad Pro. Currently, the budget iPad is stuck with the Magic Keyboard Folio, which restricts you to just utilizing it on a table, since it relies on a kickstand to be propped up. iPad should receive the A18 chip sometime in the first half of 2026. Last but not least, iPad mini is set to get its first refresh since 2024. This upgrade will likely introduce the A19 Pro chip, but it\u2019ll also introduce a much bigger upgrade\u2026 OLED. This upgrade will happen later in the year, but according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple has its eyes on the iPad mini to be its next major product to make the transition. Apple first introduced OLED to the iPad Pro back in early 2024 with the M4 model, after bringing it to the iPhone lineup starting in 2017. On top of OLED and the A19 Pro chip, the next iPad mini is reportedly going to feature a more water resistant design, per Bloomberg. The iPad mini hasn\u2019t received an overhaul since 2021. Based on these rumors, it sounds like Apple has big plans for the 5 year mark since that initial redesign. All in all, it\u2019s a rather tame year for iPad, excluding iPad mini. Looking ahead, Apple plans to bring a vapor chamber cooling system to the M6 iPad Pro, set to hit the market in early 2027. That\u2019s a bit out of scope for this coverage, though. If none of these updates excite you and you\u2019re happy with the current iPad models, you can currently find $50-100 early Black Friday discounts on all existing iPad models on Amazon: iPad, iPad mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Two excellent value options that come with some unexpected compromises. Over the last few years, we've seen a real explosion in true mass market Android phones that match flagship phones spec-for-spec without too many apparent sacrifices. Indeed, for a while now, when someone has come to ask for a phone recommendation, I've suggested they buy a budget to mid-range headset with a good OLED screen, a decent set of cameras and long battery life. At the end of the day, that's what's important to most folks. With that in mind, I thought it might be pertinent to take a look at two promising phones in this category: the \u00a3299\/$370 Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro and the \u00a3499\/$499 Poco F7 Proy. I've put them through their paces in a couple of mini-reviews below to gauge how well they perform and if they're worth your hard-earned cash. Buy:  The Redmi Note 14 Pro impresses at first with a pleasant teal finish (called Coral Green) to its plastic rear panel. It's two-tone, too,  and extends to both the top and bottom sides of the phone for added flair. It is also available in black or purple, if you'd prefer. There have also been upgrades against last year's model, such as a move to Gorilla Glass Victus 2, as well as to a proper IP68 water and dust resistance rating that you only got on the Pro+ model in 2024. The move to IP68 has had the unfortunate move to remove the headphone jack, though. The screen is a lovely and big 6.67-inch OLED with a 2712x1220 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate that provides decently detailed and responsive output. There is also support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+ HDR standards in supported content, while the actual screen curves at the edges to help the Redmi Note 14 Pro feel slimmer than it actually is both in hand and pocket. This panel can also get even brighter than its predecessor at 3000 nits peak, leading to lovely and punchy HDR performance and good visibility on sunny days when I took this phone out and about in London for work. The Redmi Note 14 Pro's cameras aren't too much different from the previous year, with a 200MP main snapper with a 1\/1.4-inch sensor, alongside a \u00bc-inch 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro lens. The selfie camera has seen a bump from 16MP up to 20MP with a wider f\/2.2 aperture. General wide shots are perfectly okay with good detail and more natural colours. However, without the lack of a dedicated telephoto, cropping in and zooming too much leads image quality to fall to pieces. If you stick with the main sensor, you'll be more than happy with the results that the Redmi Note 14 Pro provides for the price. Internally, the Redmi Note 14 Pro features a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra SoC, which is a boosted version of the same mid-range chip found in cheaper phones such as Nothing's CMF sub-branded Phone 1. In the run of benchmarks I put it through, results weren't too impressive, and the gulf between this being a cheaper phone becomes a little clearer. However, benchmarks are only one side of the story. In actual use, the Redmi Note 14 Pro felt zippy and responsive for casual use, including writing up some words in a pinch in Google Docs when I was out and wanted to get my head down, and browsing through social media and Google Discover for news. Go beyond that kind of casual use and into more power user territory, and you might notice some slowdown and stutter. In trying some heavier games out, such as Wuthering Waves, you do need to turn settings down to get a higher frame rate out of the device. Lighter titles such as Mario Kart Tour are more than playable here, while EAFC Mobile felt responsive on default settings, although it needed some help from the phone's gaming mode to push to higher frame rates. The Redmi Note 14 Pro comes with a range of gaming features to try and optimise performance for the best experience possible. Swiping from the left when the phone is in landscape mode in a game allows you to check on real-time FPS figures, as well as allowing you to choose whether the phone prioritises visual fidelity or frame rate. You can also do things such as screen record directly from the tab and turn on a do not disturb mode so that you keep your head in the game. Software here comes in the form of HyperOS, Xiaomi's highly customised version of Android 14, which, like Honor's MagicOS, borrows some cues from Apple's iOS. This is particularly noticeable with its quick settings menu that's accessed by swiping on the right side of the screen and has a very Apple feel in terms of brightness and volume control. It's the same as MagicOS, so I've been quite used to it, but if you're moving from other Android variants, it can take some getting used to. As a variant of Android, it's perfectly cromulent, coming with some of Google's latest additions, such as Circle to Search and utilising Gemini as an assistant. There are Xiaomi-specific AI gubbins here, which mostly feature in the gallery app when editing images, such as object removal and portrait blurring with an artificial bokeh effect. There are also a few more advanced options, like the ability to remove backgrounds, FOV expansion and AI-powered automatic video editing. What I dislike about HyperOS is the amount of bloatware that comes pre-installed, such as Xiaomi's own MI app store, as well as OneDrive, the Opera browser, and the Booking.com app. Honor is guilty of this, too, and I wish more brands would opt for a cleaner approach to their Android skins. As for updates, Xiaomi says the Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G is set to get three OS upgrades and four years of security updates. Battery life here is generally pretty good, with the PCMark Work V3.0 test at half brightness showing the phone's 5110mAh capacity cell to last for just over 13 hours of multi-tasking and general use. It also supports up to 45W fast charging, although you don't get a charger in the box, and this wattage is lower than the 67W of its predecessor, and just over a third of the 120W supported by the higher-end 14 Pro+ model. For the \u00a3299\/$370 asking price, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G is a generally competent phone. It isn't going to be flagship quality for that price, but it's more than serviceable in looks and feel, as well as offering reasonable camera performance, good battery life and handy performance for lighter games and multi-tasking. I'm not the biggest fan of HyperOS, but some light housekeeping well keep your phone clean if you're too fussed. Buy:  The second willing volunteer is the Poco F7 Pro, which jumps up the price ladder to verge on more mid-range territory at \u00a3499\/$499. From the outset though, it feels like you're getting a lot more phone for your money. It's a pleasant blend of a sturdy aluminum frame and a glass back to offer a stylish, silver rectangular slab that's easy to hold. It is available in black or blue if you'd prefer \u2013 Poco's signature yellow is notably absent. There has been a noteworthy upgrade to the F7 Pro's IP rating, with this new model having a full IP68 water and dust rating, which is a large improvement over the F6 Pro's splashproof designation and IP54-grade seal. It also comes with a handy pre-applied screen protector and a case in the box for extra protection, which is a nice touch. The F7 Pro has a large 6.67-inch AMOLED screen with a high QHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate for a lovely viewing experience that's slick, detailed and sharp. A peak brightness of up to 1800 nits in the screen's high-brightness mode is especially punchy, and it can also reach as high as 3200 nits in HDR content, although this comes at the expense of losing some detail and definition, as is typical. Where this handset felt more in the midrange as opposed to being a flagship was with the F7 Pro's dual camera setup that features a main 50MP sensor and an 8MP ultrawide. No telephoto lens here. The main snapper here is great for your general photography needs, with images that have plenty of punch and peppiness in light or dark situations. It also maintains a good amount of detail. Using the 2x mode for some portrait-style shots results in natural bokeh around subjects, which I was particularly impressed with. The lack of a telephoto is pronounced though, as zooming in any further than the 2x zoom causes detail and sharpness to fall off a cliff. In addition, the ultrawide lens isn't up to the same standard as the main snapper; for the most part, images can come out quite grainy and lacking in fine detail. In typical F-series fashion, the real focus of the F7 Pro is its internal power, and this model packs in a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. That was, up until quite recently, the most powerful processor you'd find in an Android phone, so to get it in a mid-ranger provides a lot of oomph for the price. It's the same processor found inside the Honor Magic V3 and Magic 6 Pro, for instance. As such, it's perhaps no surprise to learn that this is an excellent phone for everything from gaming to moderate productivity and multi-tasking loads. The results in the likes of Geekbench 6 are virtually identical to the Magic V3, although the F7 Pro slightly wins out in multi-core performance. In addition, it garnered high frame rates in the pair of GFXBench tests that were comparable to the cover display on the Magic V3, and above the main screen. The F7 Pro proves seriously capable in more intense titles such as COD Mobile or Wuthering Waves in testing, while it also has the same Game Turbo features as the Redmi Note 14 Pro. That means swiping from the left when the phone is in landscape mode in a game allows you to check on real-time FPS figures, although you can't choose whether the phone prioritises visual fidelity or frame rate, oddly. You can also do things such as screen record directly from the tab and turn on a do not disturb mode so that you keep your head in the game. Poco is technically a sub-brand of Xiaomi, so it makes sense the two phones run the same skin of Android. That means HyperOS is present on the F7 Pro, and it feels very similar to how it does on the Redmi Note 14 Pro. That means some similar cues to iOS, such as the notification menu, and the presence of some bloatware, such as the Opera browser, pre-installed, plus add-riddled system apps that can't be uninstalled. As for updates, Xiaomi says the Poco F7 Pro  is set to get four OS upgrades and six years of security updates. Battery life here is rather excellent, with the PCMark Work V3.0 test at half brightness showing the phone's large 6000mAh capacity cell to last for 20 and a half hours of multi-tasking and general use. It also supports up to 90W fast charging, and you do get a charger and cable in the box, which is very nice. I'm a little bit more wholehearted in my recommendation of the Poco F7 Pro for its \u00a3499\/$499 asking price, given its flagship-esque performance, excellent battery life and sleek looks for a more modest price tag. The cameras here are reasonable, while the HyperOS variant of Android isn't as clean as some rivals, though. So, there you have it - a bit of a look at the world of cheap and mid-range Android phones in 2025, and how well we seem to be getting on. The answer I think is, surprisingly well, albeit still with a couple of quirks in the instance of these two choices.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"The current market offers a fantastic value proposition for enthusiast gamers. This early Black Friday deal proves you can achieve smooth 4K frame rates in modern AAA titles with a mid-to-high-tier GPU priced at $849.99.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  As we inch closer to Black Friday, we're seeing more and more juicy discounts for items you normally wouldn't be able to afford on most days. Like this limited-time 15% bargain for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, one of the most powerful GPUs with high performance and gen-to-gen uplift, for $849.99 at Newegg and other retailers. \"The Nvidia RTX GeForce 5070 Ti offers absolutely incredible performance for its MSRP and delivers the kind of gen-on-gen uplift that enthusiasts demand, even over the RTX 4070 Ti Super.\" ~  John LoefflerTechRader Review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\ud83d\ude0dAlternative Deals: $849.99 at Amazon (Prime Members only) | $849.99 at Walmart | $849.99 at Best Buy      Our friends at TechRader went hands-on with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 TI and walked away so impressed by its capabilities that they gave it a near-perfect score. Their praise for this GPU stems from its NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation technology, 16GB of RAM, base GPU clock frequency of 2.588 gigahertz, Phase-change GPU thermal pad, and GPU Tweak III software. With these advanced components working in tandem, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 TI can perform absurdly well to the point that it will enable PC games to run at 1440p with 120fps or 4K resolutions with 60fps. The only major drawback of this GPU is that its MSRP of $999.99 is too high to warrant its performance rates. This is especially apparent when compared to other graphics cards that have similar performance but cost less at retail, like the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super (which TechRader also reviewed and gave it 4.5\/5 stars) Thankfully, this month's ongoing early Black Friday sales event has chopped the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 TI's MSRP down to a somewhat more manageable cost of $849.99 at Newegg and other retailers. So, if you're looking to get one of the best premium GPUs to help your PC run spec-hungry AAA titles like Cyberpunk 2077 or the recently released Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, then now's the best time to upgrade, as this item is running out of stock fast all over the internet. The RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 have higher performance rates for 4K gaming, but they cost way more than the RTX 5070 TI, as the RTX 5080 has an MSRP of $1599.99, and the RTX 5090's MSRP can be $2,999.99 or higher, depending on the brand. This GPU's performance won't be severely bottlenecked when put into a computer's PCIe 3.0 or 4.0 slot, but when paired with an outdated CPU, it could be. As such, it is recommended you pair it with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D to help the RTX 5070 TI reach its full potential. There are rumors flying around that plans for \"Super\" variants of NVIDIA's RTX 50 GPU series have been cancelled due to memory shortages caused by AI. If this turns out to be true, you may have to settle for regular versions of the RTX 5070 TI while it's on sale before the whole RTX 50 series gets its prices potentially hiked. Black Friday is set to start on November 28, 2025, and last until December 1, 2025, when it will be replaced by Cyber Monday. However, retailers have already begun hosting deals for the past month, like this collection of early Black Friday GPU sales, and will continue to do so as we head into Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"It's hard to believe we're halfway through November already, as 2025 rapidly draws to a close with no firm signs of several smaller hardware updates we've been hoping to see before the end of the year, although we did get one surprising new iPhone accessory this week. This week also saw the fifth anniversary of the very successful Apple silicon effort on the Mac, contrasted with the future of the iPhone Air seeming shakier than ever. On the software side, Apple made some more tweaks with the second beta of iOS 26.2 and released the Digital ID feature to allow users to add their U.S. passports to the Wallet app, so read on below for all the details!  This week marked the fifth anniversary of the Apple silicon chip that replaced Intel chips in Apple's Mac lineup. The first Apple silicon chip, the M1, was unveiled on November 10, 2020, and it debuted in the MacBook Air, Mac mini, and 13-inch MacBook Pro. The \u200cM1\u200c chip was impressive when it launched, featuring the \"world's fastest CPU core\" and industry-leading performance per watt, and it's only improved since then. We've had five total generations of Apple silicon chips, with the M5 unveiled in the 14-inch \u200cMacBook Pro\u200c just last month, so check out our look at how Apple's latest M-series chip compares to the first one.  While Apple branched out into the crossbody strap accessory market with the iPhone 17 lineup, the company has now gone a step further with the release of the special-edition iPhone Pocket, a knitted accessory much like a stretchy pocket or sock that can hold an iPhone, AirPods, or other everyday items. Available in a number of vibrant color options, the iPhone Pocket comes in both short strap ($149.95) and long strap ($229.95) options, although it almost immediately sold out in the United States upon launch. The iPhone Pocket was created in a partnership between Apple and Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE, whose namesake founder was the designer of the iconic black turtleneck worn by Steve Jobs.  The thin and light iPhone Air has sold so poorly that Apple has decided to delay the launch of the next-generation \u200cversion that was scheduled to come out alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and foldable iPhone in Fall 2026, reports The Information. Apple has not necessarily canceled the second-generation iPhone Air, but the company is reportedly looking at ways to improve it such as by adding a second rear camera to try to improve its appeal, and a revamped version could appear in Spring 2027 alongside the regular iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e as Apple moves to split up its flagship iPhone launches across the year. Another report this week claims that the iPhone 16e has similarly \"failed\" at its $599 price point that marked a significant increase compared to its iPhone SE predecessor, though there have been no reports of a potential delay beyond the rumored Spring 2026 time frame for a follow-up iPhone 17e model.  Rumors of updates for the HomePod mini, Apple TV, and AirTag have regularly pointed toward the middle or end of 2025, but it's looking less and less likely to happen as the time ticks down. While HomePod mini stock in particular is running low at many third-party retailers, the holiday shopping season is already kicking into high gear with Apple even featuring the current model among its top gift ideas. Delayed releases for HomePod mini and Apple TV updates could be tied to ongoing delays with Apple's revamped Siri that will drive an expansion of the company's smart home platform with new hardware such as a home hub device and cameras, but it's unclear what might be holding up the release of a second-generation AirTag with greater range and other improvements.  Apple this week provided developers with the second beta of iOS 26.2, which adds a few new features worth knowing about. Changes since the first beta include a new Liquid Glass look for the Measure app, an option to turn off pinned conversations in the Messages app when in CarPlay, improvements to animations and the Games app, and more.  Apple has announced that iPhone users can now create a Digital ID in the Apple Wallet app based on information from their U.S. passport. The Digital ID can be used for domestic air travel at TSA checkpoints in more than 250 airports, and in the future it will be able to provide identity and age verification at select stores, in compatible apps, and on supported websites. The Digital ID does not, however, fully replace a physical passport, as it can not be used for international travel and border crossing purposes.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"This is a newsletter bonus question, and Pay Dirt is Slate\u2019s money advice column.\u00a0 Dear Care and Feeding, My parents are aging and live in a beautiful paid-off home in a very desirable town. I have one brother. We\u2019re both  in our 30s, and we\u2019re close\u2014we\u2019ve always been friends. But recently, the topic has been coming up of what happens with my parents\u2019 home when they are no longer living in it. They have been wishy-washy about their wishes in their will. My brother lives in our hometown where the house in question is located, has no children, and is unmarried. I have relocated to an equally desirable and expensive town north of where we grew up, am married, and have one small child (17 months old). I own my home, and we have a mortgage with a high interest rate. My brother is renting from a friend but has recently gotten approved for a home loan and is looking to buy a home in our hometown. I have assumed the fair thing to do would be to sell the house and split the value of the house down the middle. It is a beautiful home full of happy memories,\u00a0but it deserves to have a family grow there just as we have over the last 30 years, in my opinion! But during our last visit, my brother told me he doesn\u2019t plan to sell the house, he wants to keep it. He does not feel that he should have to buy me out. He said he does not plan to live in it or raise a family. In fact, he didn\u2019t say exactly what his plan would be for the property. I was shocked. He was very adamant that he is entitled to the house. I love my brother and don\u2019t want this to put a wedge between us, but I have my own family and mortgage to look out for and we both lived there 30 years. Assuming my parents leave us both the house in equal portions, how do I navigate this scenario and get what is left to me? Do I need a lawyer? If he refuses to sell, do I have to wait until he is ready? What happens in the meantime? I\u2019ll mention there is $4 million dollars in a generational skipping trust that I utilized for the $150,000 down payment on my home. My brother intends to do the same when he buys his home, hopefully within the next few months. I don\u2019t know if that is relevant but figured I\u2019d mention it. \u2014Love My Entitled Brother But Want What\u2019s Rightfully Mine Dear Love My Entitled Brother, Before this becomes a legal battle, ask your brother one critical question: Why does he want to keep the house if he\u2019s not planning to live in it or raise a family there? Is this about sentiment? Control? Investment? The fact that he won\u2019t articulate a plan is telling. Is he thinking of renting it out? Using it as a vacation property? Just\u2026 having it? Understanding his motivation matters, because if this is about emotion rather than logic, you might be able to find common ground by opening up a conversation around his feelings rather than the value of the property. Your next step is to talk to your parents because, and this is key, they\u2019re still alive and can control how this plays out. They may not be aware of your brother\u2019s attachment to the house or the fact that you two are already talking about who gets what after they\u2019re gone. Now is the time to nail down what they want to do with their assets. They may seem wishy-washy about the house because they don\u2019t care what happens to it after they die. Or, they want to leave that decision to you both, or to the executor of their estates (if that isn\u2019t you or your brother). Here\u2019s one potential solution you may not have considered: Your parents could structure their estate plan so your brother inherits the house and you receive an equivalent value in other assets\u2014stock, trust distributions, cash, whatever. If the house is worth, say, $1.5 million, you\u2019d get $1.5 million more from other estate assets to equalize things. This is a completely standard estate planning approach when one child wants to keep a specific asset. But this only works if your parents design it that way in their will and trust documents. Which brings up another topic: Their estate plan and how the assets (house, accounts, cars, etc.) are titled. You should have a direct conversation with them now to discuss where everything is and how it is being held. At that time, you can tell them your brother wants to keep the house, and ask them to work with their estate planning attorney to structure the inheritance fairly. If they want your brother to have the house, great\u2014but if the goal is to divide their assets equally between you, they need to ensure you receive equivalent value from other assets. If your parents don\u2019t plan ahead and instead leave the house to both of you as equal co-owners, then your brother has three legal options: (1) buy you out at fair market value with his own money, (2) agree to sell and split proceeds, or (3) face a partition lawsuit where a court forces the sale. He cannot simply keep it without compensating you. You might want to have a clarifying conversation with an estate planning attorney (even your parents\u2019 estate attorney) to understand how it will work. Your brother may feel \u201centitled\u201d to the house, but without your parents structuring the estate appropriately, his feelings don\u2019t override property law or probate court. While you love your brother, inheriting money can change people and their relationships. Work to resolve these issues now, while your parents are alive, so you preserve your relationships once they\u2019re gone. \u2014Ilyce My husband and I have been married for three years. We have a 4-year-old son and 16-month-old twins. I have four older children. My husband was briefly married once before me; I was previously married for 12 years. We were both going through our divorces around the same time, messed around, and got pregnant. We hadn\u2019t planned on anything serious, but we gave it a shot and ended up falling in love. Early in our relationship, I shared something vulnerable with him: I got pregnant with my oldest at 16, and I never told her birth father.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"The iPhone\u2019s Portrait mode uses computational photography to simulate the shallow depth of field of a digital SLR or mirrorless camera with a larger sensor. It\u2019s evolved from a very crude tool into something which is now pretty convincing, but it\u2019s still no substitute for the real thing. There are some circumstances in which you can get genuine shallow-ish depth of field with an iPhone shot, but these are very limited as we\u2019ll discuss. The Sandmarc 2x telephoto lens is a much more practical way to get true optical blurring when shooting portraits \u2026  Depth of field is a way of describing how much of your photo is in focus. Sometimes we might want the entire photo in focus, while other times we might want a wafer-thin focal plane. Let\u2019s use a couple of digital SLR shots to illustrate. In this first case, I wanted everything in focus from the leaves of the tree just a few feet in front of me right the way through to the opera house and bridge around half a mile away. I therefore used a narrow aperture of f\/16 to create a very deep focal plane. This is pretty similar to the default depth of field you\u2019ll get from an iPhone. Contrast with this shot where I\u2019ve shot at f\/1.4 so that only the closest eye is fully in focus and even her hand, just a foot or so behind, is completely blurred. This is something completely impossible on an iPhone. Achieving a depth of field this shallow was only possible because I was shooting on a full-frame camera with a very fast (wide aperture) lens. What Portrait mode on the iPhone does is to simulate shallow depth of field by computationally figuring out what is in the foreground and then artificially blurring the background. In recent years, it even simulates a gradual fall-off of focus as things get progressively further away from the camera. I\u2019ve grown increasingly impressed with this over the years, especially since it started supporting night shots too. However, it\u2019s far from perfect, sometimes delivering what looks like a green-screen cutout effect. Even when the result looks natural on an iPhone screen, you generally can\u2019t make large prints from Portrait mode photos without seeing noticeable glitches. For that reason, it\u2019s always preferable to get true optical shallow depth of field. One of the factors that helps create shallower depth of field is a longer lens. When Apple boosted the telephoto to a 5x lens, we started to see natural bokeh pretty much for the first time. The problem, however, is that you can only take portraits with a 5x or 8x lens if you can get a long way away from the subject. Even then, you are limited to this kind of close-up, as the bokeh very quickly reduces as you back up even further to capture more than just head-and-shoulders. This is the problem the Sandmarc 2x Telephoto lens is designed to solve. Like the macro lens I tested last week, you can either use the supplied clip to attach the lens to your iPhone, or you can buy the company\u2019s iPhone case. Since I\u2019m using several Sandmarc lenses, I opted for the case, and I\u2019ll simply quote what I said about that last time \u2013 along with the look & feel of the lens itself, as my comments would be identical. I generally use dedicated iPhone cases for accessories with some reluctance as I tend to have a preferred case of my own. However, in this particular, uh, case, I found that it was good enough to leave on my iPhone permanently. It\u2019s fully compatible with MagSafe charging and accessories. It has a matte finish which offers a very secure grip, and the metal buttons offer a very positive and reliable clicky experience. The camera bump is obviously a little deeper to allow space for the screw threads for the lenses, but to my eyes has a pleasantly industrial look. The lens itself looks like a very generic camera lens. There is quite distinctive white lettering on the side, which some might find distracting, but is helpful if you have more than one iPhone lens. The telephoto lens attaches to the main camera lens, which is 24mm. That effectively turns it into a 48mm lens, which is very close to the 50mm lens which SLR photographers refer to as a \u201cnifty fifty\u201d because it is a very flexible focal length. This includes being at the lower end of the typical 50-90mm range we would normally use for portrait photos, and I\u2019ve certainly shot plenty of portraits using a 50mm lens. To be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting that you are going to get very shallow depth of field with this lens, but it does provide enough background separation for typical portrait shots, even in quite a busy city environment. I started with a deliberately tough test: an extremely cluttered background with several layers to it. This includes a mesh fence only around 15 feet away and a tilted metal sculpture about 20 feet behind the subject. With a standard iPhone shot, this would just be a horrible mess. However, the lens gives sufficient separation for Pippa to stand out from all the background elements. You can see the way the focus gradually falls off as we look in turn at the pier, the bridge, and the buildings on the far side of the river. While we wouldn\u2019t deliberately choose a composition as cluttered as this, there are times when we just get a second to grab a spontaneous shot, and don\u2019t get any control over the background. There isn\u2019t as much separation from the sculpture as I would ideally like, but it\u2019s still good enough for this kind of impromptu shot Once we position Pippa with a more distant background, then the effect is very pleasing indeed. There is a way to \u2018cheat\u2019 with iPhone shots, which is to get very close to the person you\u2019re photographing. The closer you get to the subject, the more background blurring you\u2019ll get. However, where that plan falls apart is where you want to get a wider shot but still have enough separation from the background. This shot, for example, just wouldn\u2019t be possible without an accessory lens. We can only get away with the lampposts emerging from her head because they are blurred. Check out other sample shots in the gallery below (click or tap each one to enlarge). The Sandmarc Telephoto 2x Lens Edition, to give it its full name, costs $159.99. That\u2019s not a trivial price for an iPhone accessory. Indeed, it\u2019s more expensive than a typical DSLR 50mm lens, although the price of those is only low because they are such a popular focal length and are sold in their millions, leading to massive economies of scale. My view is that the purchase would make sense for two target markets. First, keen iPhone photographers and videographers who regularly shoot people and are using their Apple device as a primary or only camera. For this market, it adds a huge amount of performance and utility for a relatively affordable cost. Second, anyone who uses an iPhone as a supplementary camera for a DSLR or filmmaking rig. In this context, the cost is pretty trivial and means that a C-camera becomes significantly more flexible. There is a potential third market in the form of parents who take lots of photos of their kids. My test here would be whether you either print them or display them on a large photo frame, as that\u2019s where the limitations of the artificial Portrait mode tend to show up. If you\u2019re happy viewing photos of your kids on your iPhone or iPad, then you can probably stick to Portrait mode. In my own case, I found that the iPhone is a fantastic camera for run-and-gun B-roll footage, and I do expect this lens to really assist with these shoots.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"The Senate Agriculture Committee released its own discussion draft market structure bill, addressing digital commodities and how the Commodity Futures Trading Commission might oversee that sector of the crypto market.  You\u2019re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.   We have a new draft crypto market structure bill! Are we any closer to seeing this bill pass through Congress? Sort of. The Senate Agriculture Committee publishing a first draft bill text is a key step. The draft as released has a number of parts that will likely be updated or otherwise need agreement between Republicans and Democrats before it can progress further, but we now at least have confirmation that lawmakers and their staffers are still working on this. The new draft bill defines digital commodities and explains how Congress might like to see the CFTC regulate them as it moves the agency closer to being the primary spot market overseer for crypto.  The text of the bill included a number of bracketed sections, indicating areas where the lawmakers had not yet come to a firm agreement on what the final text should say. These bracketed sections included items as simple as definitions, as well as more complex rulemaking directions for the CFTC.  \u201cThe CFTC plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and stability of our financial and derivatives markets,\" said Committee Chair John Boozman in a statement. \"As Congress works to expand authority for the commission to oversee the trading of digital assets that are commodities, it\u2019s essential that we also ensure it has the tools, personnel and resources necessary to carry out this new mission, along with its current responsibilities. Strengthening this institution better protects consumers, encourages innovation, promotes transparency and upholds liquid and resilient markets.\"  Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement that the bill was \"a first step,\" but that lawmakers \"still have significant work to do before advancing the legislation out of committee.\"  \"I\u2019m specifically concerned about the lack of resources and the bipartisan commissioners at the CFTC, preventing regulatory arbitrage, as well as the ongoing corruption of public officials and whether Congress has created the correct guardrails to prevent those misdeeds,\" he said. \"I urge my colleagues and external stakeholders to come together to address these issues.\"  One provision in the draft would call for the CFTC to have at least two commissioners and minority party commissioners before it could actually begin any rulemaking. Another provision touched on conflict-of-interest concerns, but both of these provisions had the brackets suggesting that the wording or the provisions themselves might change before the bill is finalized.  The crypto industry's representatives seemed to appreciate that the bill is still moving forward, despite the recent record-breaking government shutdown and the decreasing amount of time left in the year for Congress to get anything done.  In a statement, Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger called the release of the draft \"another important step,\" while DeFi Education Fund Executive Director Amanda Tuminelli said it was \"good to see the [Agriculture] Committee make progress on market structure.\"  Ji Hun Kim, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, called the draft \"meaningful positive progress toward establishing a comprehensive, fit-for-purpose market structure framework for digital commodities in the U.S.,\" in a statement.  The process still needs to be joined together with the Senate Banking Committee's, Mersinger noted in her statement.  \"We are hoping that the section left open for DeFi will be filled in with robust developer protections that clearly distinguish centralized intermediaries from software developers without custody and control of other people's money,\" Tuminelli said.  Looking ahead, the specific pathway to passage is a little hazy. One individual who works in D.C. policymaking told CoinDesk that there are roughly three work weeks in December for Congress, severely limiting the amount of time available for lawmakers to hold hearings and votes on crypto legislation this year. That means that any floor work on the bill is unlikely to happen until next year, this person said, a view echoed by Ron Hammond, head of Policy and Advocacy at Wintermute.  Hammond told CoinDesk earlier this week that one or both committees could hold a markup hearing and vote on passage out of committee by the end of the year, but it would require a lot of work.  And even then, the bills would have to be combined before any possible Senate floor vote. Once that happens, the combined market structure bill would then go to the House of Representatives, which could vote on the Senate version (as it did with the Genius Act) or try to get some of its own priorities in.  \"I do think the House is going to be in the awkward position of having to take what the Senate produces,\" said Chainlink Head of Public Policy Adam Minehardt on CoinDesk TV on Thursday.  The House might want to ensure some form of its own bill, the Clarity Act, is included in whatever President Donald Trump signs, but \"the Senate is going to continue to be in the driver's seat,\" he said.  However it shakes out, the bill won't go to Trump's desk until after the House has a floor vote, and that could take us well into 2026 \u2014 and election season \u2014 before he's able to sign it.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Crypto market sentiment has deteriorated sharply, with the Fear & Greed Index dropping to 10, a level indicating \u201cextreme fear,\u201d marking a near nine-month low as it\u2019s the lowest reading since late February. The plunge in sentiment follows a week of losses across major cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin's decline to just under $96,000 in a major sell-off that, for the second time this month, saw the cryptocurrency drop below the $100,000 mark. The index, a popular gauge of investor emotions, reflects growing unease as bitcoin lost more than 5% over the past seven days. The largest cryptocurrency is now trading at levels not seen since early March, following a steady decline from its all-time high above the $120,000 level. The wider crypto market, as measured via the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, alsolost around 5.8% of its value over the week. \u201cThe selloff is a confluence of profit-taking by LTHs, institutional outflows, macro uncertainty, and leveraged longs getting wiped out,\u201d Jake Kennis, Senior Research Analyst at Nansen, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWhat is clear is that the market has temporarily chosen a downward direction after a long period of consolidation\/ranging.\u201d The factors behind the sell-off also include fading hopes of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this month, with the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool now placing the odds of a 25 bps cut near 50%. On prediction markets such as Kalshi and Polymarket, traders weigh similar odds. On top of this, the White House\u00a0said\u00a0that recent key economic indicators, including October inflation, may not be released at all due to delays from the recently ended government shutdown. This means traders have less macro data to work with. The cherry on top comes in the form of low liquidity, as the market has yet to fully recover from the major crash seen back in October, with order-book depth across major centralized exchanges remaining structurally lower since.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"MLB Trade Rumors  By Anthony Franco | November 15, 2025 at 1:26pm CDT  The Blue Jays are among the teams with interest in free agent closer\u00c2\u00a0Raisel Iglesias, reports Francys Romero. That\u2019s a logical fit with Toronto on the hunt for a late-game arm. They\u2019ve also been linked to Edwin D\u00c3\u00adaz at the top of the relief market. Iglesias remains one of the better relievers in MLB as he enters his age-36 season. The Cuban-born righty is coming off a 3.21 earned run average in 67 1\/3 innings for the Braves. Iglesias went 29-34 in save chances, narrowly missing what would have been his sixth career 30-save campaign. Iglesias punched out an above-average 27.4% of opponents while limiting walks to a 6% clip. He got swinging strikes nearly 15% of the time while still getting opponents to frequently chase outside the strike zone. In aggregate, this year was Iglesias\u2019 worst since at least 2019. That\u2019s mostly attributable to an early-season home run spike. He gave up seven longballs before the end of May and carried a near-6.00 ERA into June. Once he got the home runs in check, Iglesias looked like his usually excellent self. He turned in a 1.96 ERA with a 29.3% strikeout percentage over the final four months. Opponents hit .163\/.224\/.219 with one homer in their last 174 plate appearances. Jays general manager Ross Atkins has already said they\u2019re not committed to keeping\u00c2\u00a0Jeff Hoffman in the ninth inning. Signing a closer would allow manager John Schneider to use Hoffman as a multi-inning leverage arm earlier in games. Hoffman allowed the second-most home runs (15) among MLB relievers this year. The longball is the biggest concern with Iglesias as well but not to the same extent. Iglesias\u2019 age is going to cap him at a maximum of two years. He should command an eight-figure annual salary. The Braves didn\u2019t find much trade interest with Iglesias making $16MM this past summer. He elevated his stock by allowing just one run in 23 2\/3 frames after the deadline, so it\u2019s not out of the question that he commands something similar to this year\u2019s salary on the open market. That\u2019d especially be true if he takes a one-year guarantee, though MLBTR predicted he\u2019d command a two-year contract at $13MM annually. The Dodgers are the only other team that has been publicly connected to Iglesias this offseason. The Braves don\u2019t have an obvious closing replacement and will probably stay in touch, but president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos said this week that they\u2019re focused on shortstop and the rotation in the short term. If Iglesias receives strong two-year offers this month, he could sign elsewhere before the Braves are ready to pivot to the bullpen.

JUMP TO: AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West The Blue Jays will aim to run it back and reach the World Series after their Game 7 heartbreak. The Yankees want to re-sign a key offensive piece. The Red Sox need to settle things down and shore up some pitching. The Rays will return to their home stadium and will look for some normalcy. The Orioles should build on a young and promising lineup that\u2019s due for a bounce-back season. READ MORE The Mets spent big last offseason but couldn't reach October baseball. The Phillies took the division crown and looked poised for a World Series run but fell short once again. Both teams are expected to headline the NL East next season, but three other teams \u2014 the Marlins, Braves, and Nationals \u2014 will try to build toward making the division race a bit more interesting.

READ MORE The Mariners will try to turn their ALCS heartbreak into championship fuel. The Astros are hungry to get back into contention after missing the playoffs for the first time in nine years. The Rangers desperately need their once-powerful offense to find success again while their All-Star starting pitchers are still dealing. The Athletics have a West Sacramento problem. And the Angels, once again, are facing significant challenges to build a winning club. READ MORE The Dodgers won the World Series again and are going for a three-peat. The Padres are under pressure to revamp their starting rotation against the backdrop of a potential sale of the franchise. The Giants might have something special cooking, but they'll need to sign some intriguing pickups. The D-backs will have to work hard and get creative to address their roster flaws.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"For months now, bitcoin has followed a frustratingly familiar pattern for the bulls: seemingly over-correlated with the Nasdaq 100 when that stock gauge headed lower, but losing nearly all correlation when the leading tech index moved higher. This week proved no different, with the Nasdaq tumbling on 2% on Thursday and bitcoin plunging twice as much. Friday then brought a modest rally for tech stocks, one that bitcoin didn't come close to matching. Headed into the last 6 six weeks of 2025, year-to-date gains for the Nasdaq 100 now stand at 20%, while bitcoin is barely in the green, up just 3%. What's happening, according to a report this week from Wintermute's Jasper De Maere, is not a loss of correlation with the Nasdaq 100, which remains high at about 0.8. \"This isn\u2019t a breakdown of correlation, but a reflection of asymmetry, the uneven way BTC responds to risk,\" said De Maere. \"When equities rally, BTC\u2019s reaction is muted. When they sell off, BTC tends to move more sharply in the same direction.\" De Maere measures this through \"performance skew,\" with \"positive skew\" being bitcoin outperforming in a risk-on environment and \"negative skew\" being bitcoin lagging in a risk-off environment. It will be no shock to anyone paying attention that skew has been solidly negative for some time. Attempting to put a number on it, Da Maere charted the percentage of days on a 365-day rolling basis in which BTC has seen positive performance skew versus the Nasdaq. What he found is that it's fallen to levels not seen since the bottom of the last major bear market in late 2022. Why so bad? Da Maere suggests a loss of mindshare for bitcoin as both institutional and retail speculative appetites have been quite satisfied in stocks. There are also liquidity issues as ETF inflows have slowed, stablecoin issuance has plateaued and market depth across exchanges still remains below early 2024 levels. \"Historically, this kind of negative asymmetry doesn\u2019t appear near tops but rather shows up near bottoms,\" concluded Da Maere. \"When BTC falls harder on bad equity days than it rises on good ones, it usually signals exhaustion, not strength.\" \"The current BTC\/Nasdaq performance skew suggests that BTC investors are somewhat exhausted and have been for a while.\" More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security  What to know:  More For You Is 2025 Worse Than 2022 for Crypto?

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Crypto markets might look calmer after October\u2019s leverage wipeout, but under the surface, liquidity remains absent.  Data from CoinDesk Research shows that order-book depth across major centralized exchanges remains structurally lower, suggesting a more cautious market-making environment heading into year-end. This environment paves the way for thinner markets and sharper moves, increasing the likelihood that routine trading flows will produce outsized price swings. The October liquidation cascade erased billions in open interest in a matter of hours, but it also triggered something more subtle and far more persistent: an exodus of resting liquidity from centralized exchanges.  The damage is most apparent in the two assets that anchor the entire market. In early October, just before the wipeout, bitcoin\u2019s average cumulative depth at 1% from the mid-price hovered close to $20 million across major venues, according to CoinDesk Research data. By Nov. 11, that same measure had slipped to $14 million, a decline of nearly one-third, the data showed.  Market depth is a metric used by traders to assess the scale of liquidity in a market. At a 1% range, this assesses how much capital would be required to move the market by 1%, taking into consideration the cumulative value of all limit orders on the book.  A thin book could deter traders looking to buy or sell higher volume as it would quite often cause slippage, which is where price deviates to an area where liquidity is sufficient. Depth at 0.5% from the mid-price fell from close to $15.5 million to just under $10 million, while depth at the broader 5% range dropped from more than $40 million to slightly below $30 million. Ether shows an almost parallel pattern. On Oct. 9, ETH depth at 1% from the mid-price sat just above $8 million, but by early November it had receded to just under $6 million.  There was also a significant drawdown in depth within 0.5% and within 5%, creating an entirely new market structure. According to CoinDesk Research, this failure of BTC and ETH liquidity to recover is not a quirk of timing but a structural shift. The analysts concluded that both assets suffered a significant decline in average depth that has not resolved, \"suggesting a deliberate reduction in market-making commitment and the emergence of a new, lower baseline for stable liquidity on centralized exchanges.\" This is not just impactful to directional traders with long or short bias, but also for delta-neutral firms and volatility traders. Delta-neutral firms rely on strategies such as harvesting an arbitrage spread on funding rates; however, a lack of liquidity means that size will have to be reduced, potentially eating into profits.  Volatility trades may have mixed results as the lack of liquidity can ultimately lead to violent swings. This is ideal for those operating an options straddle, which involves purchasing a call and put option with the same expiration and strike price, as wide price movements in either direction will result in profit. The liquidity crunch contrast between BTC and ETH versus major altcoins is stark.  A composite basket of SOL, XRP, ATOM and ENS experienced an even deeper liquidity collapse during the October washout, with depth at 1% diving from roughly $2.5 million to about $1.3 million overnight. Yet this group staged a rapid technical recovery, with market makers quickly restoring orders as volatility receded. That rebound, however, did not restore liquidity to its early-October levels. Depth within the 1% band remains roughly $1 million below where it stood before the wipeout, and depth at broader bands shows the same pattern of partial repair without full restoration.  CoinDesk Research believes this divergence reflects two fundamentally different liquidity regimes: altcoins experienced a knee-jerk collapse that forced market makers to re-enter aggressively once the market stabilized, while BTC and ETH endured a slower, more purposeful withdrawal of liquidity as participants reassessed risk. \u201cThe altcoin collapse was a temporary, panic-driven event requiring rapid order restoration,\u201d the analysts noted, adding that the larger assets \u201cunderwent a more deliberate and enduring risk-off positioning.\u201d  The pattern, a violent drop, a quick bounce, and a lower plateau, suggests that altcoins were shocked, while bitcoin and ether were re-priced in terms of market-maker commitment. If liquidity providers were already hesitant after October\u2019s dislocation, the macro climate has given them little reason to re-risk.  CoinShares data showed $360 million in net outflows from digital asset investment products during the week ending Nov. 1, including almost $1 billion withdrawn from bitcoin ETFs \u2014 one of the heaviest weekly outflows of the year.  The U.S. accounted for more than $430 million of these outflows, reflecting the sensitivity of U.S. institutional flows to the Federal Reserve\u2019s shifting communication on interest rates. Market makers tend to reduce inventory, widen spreads and limit posted size when macro uncertainty clouds directional conviction. The persistence of ETF outflows, the ambiguity around December rate policy and the general lack of strong fundamental catalysts have all contributed to a cautious stance. The practical consequence of this reduced depth is that crypto markets are more fragile than price charts imply.  Simply put: very sharp moves ahead for traders.  It now takes significantly less capital to move spot markets in either direction. Large trades from funds, arbitrage desks, or ETF intermediaries can create a disproportionate impact, while even routine macro releases, such as an unexpectedly strong CPI print, a shift in Fed commentary, or further ETF outflows, risk producing exaggerated price reactions. Lower liquidity also leaves the system more vulnerable to liquidation cascades. Should open interest rebuild quickly, as it often does during periods of calm, the absence of a thick order book increases the odds that relatively small shocks could trigger another wave of forced selling. In a more benign scenario, thin liquidity can also amplify upside moves. If risk appetite returns abruptly, the same lack of resting liquidity could fuel outsized rallies. What is clear from the data is that the October liquidation did more than unwind overleveraged positions. It reshaped the structure of the crypto market in a way that has yet to unwind.  Bitcoin and ether remain locked into a new, thinner liquidity regime. Altcoins, though faster to recover, are still far from the levels that characterized early October. As the year draws to a close, crypto is now in a far more fragile position than it was at the start of October.  Whether this liquidity void becomes a brief chapter or a defining feature of the market\u2019s next phase remains to be seen, but for now, that hole remains, and the market continues to find a way to work around it \u2014 with ample caution.

OPPO doesn\u2019t really want OnePlus to truly succeed \u2014 at least not at the expense of OPPO\u2019s own flagship phones. The OnePlus 13 is a fantastic phone, but it\u2019s clear that the OnePlus 15 is a step back in a few ways. The most notable downgrade is the rear camera system, as the main, telephoto, and ultrawide sensors are replaced with smaller sensors. The main and periscope lenses also see narrower apertures. It\u2019s not all bad, as the 3.5x periscope camera offers slightly longer reach than the OnePlus 13\u2019s 3x shooter. However, you\u2019re still getting weaker camera specs in general, and that\u2019s disappointing in light of the OnePlus 13\u2019s excellent camera experience. This isn\u2019t the only polarizing move, as the OnePlus 15 has a 1.5K 165Hz OLED screen compared to the OnePlus 13\u2019s 120Hz QHD+ display. OnePlus claimed that this screen is actually more expensive than the OnePlus 13 display and that a 165Hz QHD+ screen isn\u2019t technically possible. But it\u2019s still a resolution downgrade after years of QHD+ displays. The company has also swapped out the alert slider for a shortcut button. I was never a fan of the alert slider and prefer a remappable shortcut button, but this will certainly draw the ire of some long-time OnePlus fans. Don\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority? It\u2019s not the first time OnePlus flagships have taken a step back, though. The OnePlus 11 was a confusing release following the OnePlus 10 Pro, as it lacked the Pro model\u2019s (admittedly carrier-exclusive) IP68 rating and wireless charging, while offering disappointing cameras. The OnePlus 12 was a much-improved phone, but still lacked proper water resistance and a top-tier camera experience. Even the OnePlus 10 Pro was a somewhat middling release compared to the OnePlus 9 Pro, owing to a downgraded ultrawide camera, lack of mmWave in the US (admittedly not a big deal in 2025), and carrier-exclusive IP rating. And who could forget the OnePlus 10T? This was perhaps the nadir of OnePlus flagship releases, as it lacked an alert slider and wireless charging. Furthermore, it offered a meager IP54 rating (and only in the US) and subpar cameras. Go back even further, and the OnePlus 8 series isn\u2019t as fondly remembered as the OnePlus 7 range and OnePlus 7 Pro in particular. That\u2019s largely due to OnePlus increasing prices after years of aggressively priced flagships, along with the OnePlus 8 Pro\u2019s gimmicky color filter camera. Back in 2023, I first wondered whether OPPO was intentionally trying to ruin OnePlus. I eventually came to the conclusion that OPPO was making several calculated gambles to ensure OnePlus gained mainstream adoption. Now? I have a new, somewhat crazy theory about OnePlus\u2019s inconsistent flagship releases. I don\u2019t think OPPO wants OnePlus flagship phones to outshine its most expensive Find X phones. After all, why buy the \u00a31,049 OPPO Find X8 Pro when you can get the \u00a3899 OnePlus 13 that does 95% of the job? So, whenever OnePlus delivers a genuinely excellent all-rounder flagship that threatens the Find X Pro phones, OPPO tries to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again. At least not for a few generations as OnePlus picks itself back up again. That\u2019s the only way I can explain why brilliant phones like the OnePlus 7T series, OnePlus 9 Pro, and OnePlus 13 are interspersed with the OnePlus 10T, OnePlus 11, and OnePlus 15. The Hasselblad deal seems to be somewhat compelling evidence. OnePlus scored this deal first, with OPPO following one year later. Now, OnePlus lacks Hasselblad branding, while the OPPO Find X9 series retains this partnership, to the detriment of the OnePlus 15\u2019s image quality, as noted in\u00a0our review. I thought OnePlus\u2019s deal may have simply elapsed first, as it signed the deal first, and that OPPO\u2019s agreement could expire in a year\u2019s time. However, OPPO and Hasselblad actually signed an extension earlier this year. So it certainly feels like OPPO is stealing a key OnePlus selling point. Another piece of evidence is that OnePlus flagships haven\u2019t been available via major carriers for a while now. It\u2019s possible that this is because OnePlus and OPPO want to fly under the radar amid ongoing US\/China political tensions. Or maybe OnePlus and OPPO simply refuse to spend resources on US carrier testing and other related activities because they don\u2019t think the sales justify the expenditure. This failure to achieve significant carrier support means OnePlus flagships have little hope of carving out a decent slice of the pie in the US, even though OPPO is more focused on global market. It makes you wonder about the brand\u2019s long-term viability in a market where carrier sales are king. This theory isn\u2019t based on any concrete facts, but if one thing is clear, it\u2019s that OnePlus is following up its first truly excellent all-round flagship in years with a downgraded release in some ways. Having this happen once would be a shame, but it\u2019s not unheard of. However, it seems like OnePlus has a cycle of good-to-great flagships followed by disappointing follow-ups. Maybe it\u2019s a deliberate attempt by OPPO to keep OnePlus in check. Maybe OnePlus doesn\u2019t know how to build two great phones in a row, much like Nintendo and its rough cycle of successful and not-so-successful home consoles. It\u2019s also entirely possible (and perhaps more likely) that we see this pattern of great and disappointing phones because OnePlus is caught in an awkward middle ground. The company\u2019s recent high-end phones aren\u2019t Ultra devices with price tags to match, nor are they aggressively priced releases to undercut Samsung and Apple\u2019s $800 phones. So the company might have to follow an awkward balancing act as it tries to outperform base flagships while avoiding Ultra prices. The OnePlus 15 could be a by-product of this approach, as OnePlus makes compromises in some places to avoid price hikes. But I\u2019m not sure this theory holds water when the OnePlus 15 is actually cheaper in China than the OnePlus 13. In any event, it\u2019s disappointing to see OnePlus release a strong contender for 2025\u2019s phone of the year, only to release the OnePlus 15. OnePlus has long struggled to deliver a world-class camera experience, so why sacrifice the cameras just when you\u2019ve finally shown you can deliver a fantastic camera phone?

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"The US is moving to push Russian energy out of the European Union market and position itself to fill the gap, the Financial Times reported Friday. Washington has also deliberately blocked a bid by Sweden-based Gunvor Group to acquire the foreign assets of Russian oil major Lukoil, according to the outlet. Gunvor withdrew its $22 billion proposal after US officials accused the company of acting as \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s puppet.\u201d Earlier in November, the US Treasury warned in a post on X that the company would \u201cnever get a license to operate and profit\u201d if it pursued the deal. The potential acquisition surfaced after President Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on Lukoil and another Russian oil giant, Rosneft, prompting the former to seek buyers for its overseas holdings. The bid was announced as \u201cUS officials toured Europe as part of efforts to sell American energy and eliminate \u2018every last molecule\u2019 of Russian gas from the continent,\u201d the FT wrote. The decision to block the deal came from \u201chigh up in the Treasury,\u201d the paper reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. Afterward, Washington issued a general license enabling other bidders to pursue Lukoil\u2019s international assets, the FT said. A US private equity firm, Carlyle, expressed interest this week, according to the report. Lukoil on Friday confirmed only that it is in \u201congoing negotiations on the sale of its international assets with several potential buyers,\u201d without naming them. US officials have openly stated their intention to replace Russia in the EU energy market. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in September that the United States was prepared \u201cto displace all of the Russian gas that goes into Europe and all of the Russian refined products from oil as well.\u201d The Kremlin has condemned the sanctions as an \u201cunfriendly step\u201d but maintained it is still seeking \u201cgood relations with all countries, including the US.\u201d The restrictions on Lukoil are already affecting Europe. Earlier in November, Bulgaria curbed fuel exports to its fellow EU states amid supply concerns. Lukoil owns the country\u2019s largest refinery, more than 200 gas stations and a major fuel transport network.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":" Crypto sentiment platform Santiment warned that when many people start calling a crypto market bottom, it\u2019s wise to stay skeptical.  Crypto market lows are unlikely to form at moments when many analysts and traders are calling for one, according to crypto sentiment platform Santiment. \u201cBe cautious when you see a widespread consensus forming about a specific price bottom,\u201d Santiment said in a report on Saturday, adding that \u201ctrue bottoms often form when the majority expects prices to fall further.\u201d Santiment said that this has recently emerged as a trending topic on social media after Bitcoin (BTC) briefly fell below $95,000 on Friday amid a wider technology stock decline. \u201cThis suggests many traders believe the worst is over,\u201d Santiment said, arguing that historically such sentiment is often followed by further downside. Crypto market participants often make calls that the market has bottomed when psychological price levels are breached, such as Bitcoin falling below $100,000.\u00a0 Despite the bottom-calling, prominent figures such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine chair Tom Lee have recently reiterated their forecasts that Bitcoin could still rally to $200,000 or higher by the end of the year. Santiment also pointed out that the ratio of positive to negative comments about Bitcoin is at its lowest point in over a month.  \u201cAs Bitcoin's price fell, its social dominance soared to over 40%, showing it is the main topic of a very fearful conversation,\u201d Santiment said. The sentiment platform added that many traders pinned the recent Bitcoin price drop on Strategy chairman Michael Saylor selling off Bitcoin, with social media mentions of \u201cSaylor\u201d surging sharply as Bitcoin fell. During an interview with CNBC on Friday, Saylor denied reports that the company was offloading some of its Bitcoin amid a flash crash in the asset\u2019s price. Related: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $866M in second-worst day on record, but some analysts still bullish Meanwhile, Santiment said that the significant spot Bitcoin ETF outflows in recent times may be a positive sign for Bitcoin\u2019s spot price. \u201cLarge ETF inflows have often marked local price tops, while significant outflows have coincided with market bottoms, suggesting retail panic,\u201d Santiment said. Over the past three trading days, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.17 billion in outflows, according to Farside. On Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $866 million in net outflows, marking their second-worst day on record after the $1.14 billion daily outflows on Feb. 25.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":" While I love traveling with friends and family, I also enjoy traveling alone. My time is my own and I can do whatever I want. But let\u2019s be honest: solo travel also comes with its own unique challenges. Getting lost in translation at a local market, struggling to take a decent photo of yourself without looking like you\u2019re holding a selfie stick, or standing paralyzed at a subway station trying to decode which train goes where. We\u2019ve all been there. Designer Siwoo Kim clearly understands these moments because Comes, their latest design concept, feels like it was born from real solo travel experiences. This isn\u2019t just another gadget trying to solve problems that don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a thoughtful response to the growing culture of solo exploration that\u2019s taken over social media feeds and reshaped how we think about travel. Designer: Siwoo Kim        The rise of solo travel isn\u2019t just a trend anymore. It\u2019s become a full-blown cultural movement. YouTube channels dedicated to solo journeys rack up millions of views, not just because people want travel tips, but because there\u2019s something deeply relatable about watching someone navigate a foreign city alone. These videos lower the psychological barrier that once made eating alone at a restaurant feel awkward or booking a solo trip seem lonely. Now? It\u2019s empowering.         Comes taps into this shift with an approach that\u2019s refreshingly human-centered. It\u2019s a small AI-powered companion device equipped with a high-performance camera that can observe your surroundings and offer assistance exactly when you need it. But here\u2019s where the design gets interesting: Comes features a modular, detachable structure that adapts to different travel situations. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for the modern solo traveler, but way more elegant.    Picture this scenario. You arrive in a new city, step off the train, and immediately feel that familiar flutter of \u201cokay, now what?\u201d Just tell Comes where you want to go, and it becomes your personal guide, helping you take those first uncertain steps into unfamiliar territory. The device walks you through navigation in a way that feels supportive rather than intrusive.   The real genius shows up in how Comes splits apart. The head can attach to a necklace module around your neck, capturing your point of view while recording your journey. Meanwhile, the body remains accessible in your hand or pocket, ready to provide information about whatever you\u2019re looking at. It\u2019s like having a curious travel companion who can answer questions on the fly without you having to pull out your phone and break the moment.   For those who love zipping around cities on shared bikes or scooters (because who doesn\u2019t anymore?), Comes includes a strap module that securely mounts the device onto various mobility options. It guides your route while documenting your ride, turning practical navigation into visual storytelling.    But perhaps the most valuable feature addresses every solo traveler\u2019s occasional nightmare: the language barrier. Standing in front of a menu board, making awkward gestures at a shopkeeper, desperately trying to communicate something simple. Comes looks at both faces in a conversation and translates in real time. You speak naturally in your language, they respond in theirs, and Comes bridges the gap. No fumbling with translation apps or pointing desperately at pictures.   And then there\u2019s the social aspect. You find the perfect spot for a photo, but you\u2019re alone. Asking strangers for help can feel awkward, but Comes makes it easier. Because the device detaches, you can hand someone the camera module while keeping the main body with you to check the frame in real time. Composition slightly off? Comes relays your feedback instantly, even from across the plaza. It transforms what could be a frustrating experience into an opportunity for genuine human connection. Who knows, you might even learn about a hidden local gem in the process.   What makes Comes compelling isn\u2019t just its functionality but its underlying philosophy. Solo travel has always involved embracing uncertainty and turning unexpected moments into memorable experiences. This design doesn\u2019t eliminate those variables. Instead, it provides just enough support to help travelers feel confident facing them. It\u2019s the difference between removing adventure and enabling it. Comes offers something different: a tool designed to help solo travelers engage more deeply with the world around them, not retreat from it.   Most of our favorite memories live on tiny screens, buried in albums we never open anymore, or lost in endless camera rolls and grids we\u2026 If you\u2019ve ever watched your dog or cat leap onto the bed or sofa with reckless abandon, you know the mix of pride and worry\u2026 Your friend walks into your home.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. 16 hours ago After debuting in China last month, the OnePlus 15 is now officially making its way to the US and the rest of the world ahead of its usual schedule. It\u2019s not just the timing that\u2019s different, as the phone has a brand new look and several other changes that make it a notable departure from the OnePlus 13. Although many of our staff members have lamented some of the changes, on paper, the OnePlus 15 is actually a power user\u2019s dream and, in many ways, upstages the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. All that said, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is just around the corner. Don\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority? So, should you wait for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, or are you better off buying the OnePlus 15? While we don\u2019t have any official details about the Galaxy S26 Ultra just yet, there are numerous leaks that help paint a fairly clear picture. The answer to the question will depend on what you\u2019re looking for, but for me, the OnePlus 15 is the more exciting of the two. I\u2019ll admit it, at first I was torn about which phone I\u2019d recommend. The OnePlus 15 packs the impressive Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, though Samsung\u2019s flagship will likely get a \u201cFor Galaxy\u201d edition that might offer slightly better speeds on paper. The OnePlus 15 comes with either 12GB or 16GB of RAM, but rumors suggest Samsung may match that, and it might even offer LPDDR5X RAM. Both phones have plenty of power, so I had to dig deeper to decide which is the better fit. When I listed out the pros and cons, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra technically had a few more positives, but this isn\u2019t about quantity. The OnePlus 15 stands out in several big ways that outweigh its downsides. As someone who streams a lot of video in the background while doing chores, I value great battery life. OnePlus 15 should deliver in spades here as we\u2019ve already seen in our early OnePlus 15 battery tests, thanks to its massive 7,300mAh dual-cell silicon-carbon battery, expected to retain 80% health after four years. Even if you do manage to drain it, the phone supports up to 80W wired and 50W wireless charging. That\u2019s a big leap from the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s 45W and even tops the S26 Ultra\u2019s rumored 60W. The OnePlus 15 also includes an IR blaster, a feature missing from most flagships today. It might not matter to everyone, but I\u2019ve always liked controlling my TV and other IR devices from my phone, and I was disappointed when the feature fell out of fashion. Personally, I find it more useful than Samsung\u2019s toned-down S Pen experience. It also includes its 80W charger in the box, at a time when most phones don\u2019t. With three kids who constantly lose or break chargers, this matters to me more than you might think. It saves me from buying replacements and guarantees top charging speeds without guessing which cable to use. My third-party charger shows wattage on my Galaxy S24, and I often see speeds vary between 12 and 23W. These speeds are well below the 25W standard, but that\u2019s what can happen when you don\u2019t use official cables. If all that doesn\u2019t sway you, the price just might. The OnePlus 15 starts at $899.99. We don\u2019t know the Galaxy S26 Ultra\u2019s price yet, but the S25 Ultra launched at $1,299.99, and it\u2019s unlikely the new one will be cheaper. You\u2019ll save around $400 with the OnePlus 15, which easily makes up for the few weaknesses the OnePlus 15 might have. Of course, you might not feel the same. Let\u2019s dive into where the Galaxy S26 Ultra still shines above the new OnePlus flagship. The OnePlus 15 is surprisingly affordable for everything it offers, but there are a few areas where the Galaxy S26 Ultra might feel like the better choice. Let\u2019s start with the software. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not in love with OxygenOS. It feels too similar to iOS, and I miss when OnePlus leaned closer to stock Android. Samsung\u2019s One UI also strays from Google\u2019s minimalist vision, but many of its extras are genuinely useful. I don\u2019t love everything about it, yet I still prefer its layout to what OnePlus offers. Samsung will also likely continue its seven-year update policy, while the OnePlus 15 offers four years of OS updates and six years of security updates. That could be a deal breaker for some. Personally, I\u2019ve never kept a phone longer than five years, so I\u2019d still be covered by security patches when it\u2019s time to upgrade. On the hardware side, the Galaxy S26 Ultra should at least match the Quad HD resolution of its predecessor, but the same can\u2019t be said for the OnePlus 15. While the display is still quite nice, the company wanted to focus on upgrading its refresh rate to 165Hz, and that meant dropping down to a 1.5K resolution. Whether this display is actually worse or not will likely come down to preference, but it\u2019s worth noting. The Galaxy S26 Ultra will also likely deliver a better camera experience. The OnePlus 15 drops the Hasselblad branding from earlier models and uses a Sony 50MP main sensor, a 50MP 3.5x periscope (f\/2.8), and a 50MP ultrawide. It\u2019s more of a sidegrade from the OnePlus 13, possibly even a slight downgrade. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S26 Ultra\u2019s setup should remain close to its predecessor\u2019s, with a 200MP primary, 50MP ultrawide, and 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom. That package already edged out the OnePlus 13, so it\u2019s reasonable to expect it will outperform the OnePlus 15 as well. Design is another area where Samsung stands out. Whether you love it or not, Samsung\u2019s look is instantly recognizable. The Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to refine its familiar design rather than reinvent it. In contrast, the OnePlus 15 has frustrated longtime fans by abandoning its distinctive style for something more generic. The circular camera cutout is gone, replaced with a layout that feels slightly more iPhone-like. Even the signature alert slider has been removed for a programmable button that can summon AI or act as a shortcut key. The new design isn\u2019t bad; it just doesn\u2019t feel like the OnePlus we knew. For those who care about brand identity, Samsung\u2019s consistency wins out. All of these are solid reasons to consider the Galaxy S26 Ultra, though they\u2019re not enough to sway someone with my priorities. Still, what matters most depends on what you value in a phone. It\u2019s true that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely have better software, longer support, an improved camera package, and a few other standouts you won\u2019t find with the OnePlus 15. If you value those things above battery life and fast charging, and don\u2019t mind paying $400 more to get it? Then yes,\u00a0you might want to wait for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. At the very least, waiting a few more months will let you know what the Galaxy S26 Ultra offers with certainty. Waiting could also prove wise if you prefer Samsung\u2019s approach but want to pay less, as remaining Galaxy S25 Ultra stock will likely go on deep discount as soon as the Galaxy S26 Ultra becomes official. If you are simply looking for a powerful flagship that offers a great experience in almost every box you check without breaking the bank, then there\u2019s really no reason to wait for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The OnePlus 15 is cheaper, has a bigger battery, faster charging, and makes it easier to get the fastest speeds possible by actually giving you its fastest charger in the box.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tElizabeth Yuko   \tWhile the dangers of fentanyl have been dominating headlines for years, the death toll from another class of extremely potent synthetic opioids called \u201cnitazenes\u201d has been climbing steadily. For decades, knowledge of nitazenes \u2014 also called benzimidazole opioids \u2014 was limited to those researching opioid pharmacology, but that all changed in 2019, when the drugs emerged on the illicit street drug market \u2014 first in Europe, then in the United States. While it started out in eight countries, it had spread to 19 by 2022. According to the United Nation Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s World Drug Report 2025, nitazenes\u2019 presence on the illegal drugs market have been increasing for the past five years, and represents a growing threat to public health. But it\u2019s unclear how nitazenes entered the world\u2019s drug supply to begin with, as there has never been public demand for the drugs.\u00a0  \tThe major concern is with nitazene overdose deaths. This is, in part, because isotonitazene \u2014 the most common nitazene, also known as \u201cISO\u201d \u2014 is five to nine times stronger than fentanyl, which itself is generally 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin, which is about twice as strong as morphine. All that is to say that less than 2mg of ISO \u2014 the equivalent of the tip of a pencil or a few grains of sand \u2014 can kill you, says Brian Townsend, a retired supervisory special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and founder and president of Only 2mg Inc., a nonprofit addressing the use of fentanyl and other emerging illicit substances.\u00a0  \t           \tAt this point, there are limited data on the number of nitazene deaths in the United States. The closest thing we have are the findings of two studies, though neither could provide detailed estimates of the scope of nitazene deaths globally, and are likely undercounts of the extent of nitazene overdose in the Americas. The first found that nitazenes played a role in at least 200 overdose deaths in Europe and North America from 2020 to 2021. The second found 93 fatalities in 2022 from eight case reports primarily from the United States.  \t            \t \t\tEditor\u2019s picks \t \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\t\t \t         \tHere\u2019s what to know about nitazenes, why they\u2019re taking off, and their implications on public health.\u00a0  \tNitazenes are a class of potent synthetic opioid created in the 1950s as an alternative to morphine, but never approved for medical use because of their potential for overdose, Townsend tells Rolling Stone. Fentanyl was created during the same period, he adds.\u00a0  \t\u201cThey are unrelated to opioids derived from morphine or fentanyl, but function similarly by acting on opioid receptors to cause effects like analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, and even overdose and death,\u201d says Ryan Marino, MD, a toxicologist and expert in addiction medicine at University Hospitals in Cleveland.  \tNitazenes come in many forms, including pills, powders, and sprays \u2014 both in \u201cpure\u201d form and mixed with other drugs like heroin, fentanyl, and benzodiazepines. Nitazenes can be ingested intravenously, intranasally, orally, sublingually, and by inhalation (vaping).  \tNitazenes work by binding to the opioid receptors to stop or reduce the intensity of pain, just like heroin, fentanyl, or other opioids, Townsend explains. \u201cThe problem is they are super strong, and they slow down the part of your brain that tells you to breathe,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis is what causes respiratory depression. We sometimes refer to this as the \u2018sleepy death.'\u201d  \tIn the U.S., clonitazene and etonitazene \u2014 two types of nitazenes \u2014 were included in the original Controlled Substances Act of 1971 as Schedule 1 drugs, which have a high potential for abuse, and don\u2019t currently have an accepted medical use. In 2020, the DEA classified isotonitazene as a Schedule 1 substance, and since then, seven other nitazenes have been similarly scheduled.      \t \t\tRelated Content \t \t       \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t\u2018It\u2019s Always Somehow Our Fault\u2019: Moms of Autistic Kids Push Back on Trump\u2019s Tylenol Claims\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tHe Infiltrated a Colombian Cartel.

For example, a study conducted in 2022 and 2023 found nitazenes in wastewater samples from Washington and Illinois. The Ohio Department of Health reported seven nitazene-related overdose deaths in the state in 2020, followed by an average of 57 deaths in 2021 and 2022, and 77 in the first six months of 2023.  \tWhile there weren\u2019t any nitazene-related deaths in Tennessee in 2019, there were 92 between 2020 and 2023. Most of the overdoses also involved fentanyl. Additionally, the Pennsylvania health department has reported at least 50 fatal overdoses associated with nitazenes since 2020, with a record 29 deaths in 2024.  \tSimilar to other opioids, naloxone can reverse a nitazene overdose. However, because of the potency of nitazenes, multiple doses of naloxone may be needed.  \tAccording to Justin Gurland, a licensed master social worker specializing in addiction, there isn\u2019t a particular demographic that\u2019s intentionally seeking out nitazenes. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what makes them so dangerous,\u201d he tells Rolling Stone. \u201cMost people taking them don\u2019t even know they\u2019re taking them. Nitazenes are being mixed into heroin, counterfeit pain pills, and even non-opioid drugs, so they\u2019re reaching people who never set out to use an opioid in the first place.\u201d   \tNitazenes are becoming increasingly popular because they\u2019re inexpensive, strong, and addictive, Townsend says. \u201cThey\u2019re cheap, so drug traffickers \u2018cut\u2019 their drug supply and make more money,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey are powerful, enhancing or intensifying the drug high. I\u2019ve had a lot of people who struggle with substance abuse tell me they seek this out [for] the stronger highs. Finally, they\u2019re addictive, which means repeat customers and more money for the drug traffickers adding these poisons to their supply.\u201d And because of nitazenes\u2019 potency, \u201cdoses can be very small, which makes them easy to hide or transport from place to place,\u201d Steinman tells Rolling Stone.\u00a0  \t           \tMany experts believe that nitazene analogues may have entered the recreational drug markets to replace fentanyl analogues after the enactment of class-wide fentanyl analogue bans in China and the United States, says Marthe M. Vandeputte, a researcher in the laboratory of toxicology at Ghent University in Belgium.\u00a0  \tOn July 1, 2025, China implemented a generic ban targeting nitazene analogues. \u201cThis means that, with one scheduling order, the large majority of nitazenes known to date has been made illegal in China, which is known to be the main production country,\u201d Vandeputte tells Rolling Stone. \u201cGiven China\u2019s important role in the production of nitazenes, we expect that this may have a significant impact on the new synthetic opioid market in the upcoming year, as fewer new nitazene analogues may enter the markets.\u201d But she says that we may see the appearance of other classes of synthetic opioids instead.\u00a0  \t\u201cIn addition, the 2022 Taliban-imposed ban on opium poppy cultivation may impact the heroin supply in Europe and elsewhere, which may further fuel the rise of synthetic opioids such as nitazenes,\u201d she says.\u00a0  \tMore than 20 different nitazene variants have emerged since 2019, and new ones keep appearing. \u201cAs soon as one compound gets scheduled, manufacturers tweak the molecule slightly and produce something that\u2019s technically not illegal yet,\u201d Bernstein says. \u201cWhat started in heroin has now spread to stimulants, depressants and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. If you\u2019re buying any street drug right now you\u2019re potentially at risk.\u201d  \tFor Luke Archibald, MD, section chief of addiction psychiatry at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, all the unknowns surrounding nitazenes are concerning \u2014 especially because they\u2019re made up of a group of chemicals with potentially different properties, like varying potencies and responses to naloxone. \u201cIt is worrisome to not know what may be contained in any given supply, and there are reports of nitazenes contained in counterfeit pills that may be marketed as other substances and ingested by opioid-na\u00efve individuals,\u201d he tells Rolling Stone.  \tNitazenes\u2019 potency is also troubling. \u201cEven a trace amount \u2014 a dose small enough to fit on the tip of a pin \u2014 can slow or stop breathing,\u201d Gurland says. \u201cAnd the difference between a \u2018dose\u2019 and a fatal overdose can be microscopic.\u201d      \t \t\tTrending Stories \t \t       \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tTodd Snider, Rambling Troubadour Who Helped Shape Alt-Country and Americana, Dead at 59\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t\u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019 Bandleader Cleto Escobedo III's Cause of Death Revealed\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tJimmy Kimmel Launches Fundraisers in Honor of Friend and Bandleader Cleto Escobedo III\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tHow Lady Gaga Found Herself Again: \u2018I Feel Lucky to Be Alive\u2019\t\t \t         \tAccording to Gurland, the biggest concern is that most people using them don\u2019t know they\u2019re using them, because nitazenes are showing up in counterfeit pills and powders, mixed into what looks like oxycodone, heroin, or even non-opioid drugs. \u201cFor people already living with addiction, that unpredictability makes every use potentially lethal. It\u2019s not just about potency \u2014 it\u2019s about invisibility,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to detect, and labs often don\u2019t test for them. That\u2019s why they\u2019re being called the next wave in the synthetic opioid crisis.\u201d  \t           \tLike fentanyl, nitazenes are quickly becoming a public health issue. \u201cThat combination of strength and stealth is what makes them so dangerous,\u201d Gurland says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what they\u2019re taking, first responders don\u2019t always know what they\u2019re dealing with, and standard drug tests can even miss them. So you have this invisible risk spreading through communities that are already stretched thin by the opioid crisis.\u201d We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

{"date":"2025-11-15","content":"MLB Trade Rumors  By Anthony Franco | November 15, 2025 at 10:35am CDT  The Phillies have gotten trade calls on left-handed relievers\u00c2\u00a0Matt Strahm,\u00c2\u00a0Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Alvarado and\u00c2\u00a0Tanner Banks, reports Matt Gelb of The Athletic. Philadelphia could leverage their bullpen depth for help in a different area of the roster. All three pitchers are affordable and above-average performers. Alvarado, who\u2019ll make $9MM next season, is the most talented of the group. He\u2019s the hardest-throwing lefty reliever in the game, averaging more than 99 MPH on his fastball. The 30-year-old dominated early in the season and took over the closer role until MLB suspended him for 80 games because of a failed performance-enhancing drug test. That made him ineligible for postseason play, but the Phillies welcomed Alvarado back for the end of the regular season and were confident enough in his ability to exercise a 2026 club option. Jhoan Duran is locked into the ninth inning now. Alvarado projects as Philly\u2019s top lefty setup arm. He\u2019ll be eligible for the playoffs in future seasons, so it\u2019s unlikely the Phillies are putting much stock in the PED suspension moving forward. Alvarado also finished the year on the injured list with a forearm strain but is expected to be fine going into Spring Training. An Alvarado trade would be relatively surprising. It\u2019s easier to see the Phils swapping one of Strahm or Banks for someone at a position of greater need. Strahm, who turned 34 on Wednesday, vested a $7.5MM salary for the upcoming season. He\u2019s coming off a 2.74 ERA with an above-average 27.3% strikeout rate across 66 appearances. Strahm owns a 2.71 mark over three seasons in Philadelphia and led the team with 22 holds this year. While Strahm remains a quality leverage option, the Phillies could have some concern about his trend lines. His strikeout rate dropped six percentage points relative to 2024, when he fanned a third of opponents. He averaged a career-low 92.3 MPH on his fastball and has seen his swinging strike rate dip in consecutive years. Banks, also 34, is the least well known of the Phils\u2019 lefty trio. He didn\u2019t reach the big leagues until his age-30 season and spent his first couple seasons on a rebuilding White Sox team. Banks was an under-the-radar deadline pickup in 2024 and has turned in a 3.24 ERA with a league average 22.5% strikeout rate over 91 2\/3 innings in Philadelphia. His fastball sits in the low-90s, but he attacks the strike zone with a pair of breaking pitches and held lefty batters to a putrid .172\/.213\/.243 slash line this year. Banks has held his own against right-handed hitters as well, but he\u2019s the kind of pitcher whom teams generally prefer in a middle relief\/specialist role rather than as a true high-leverage arm. MLBTR contributor Matt Swartz projects him for a $1.2MM salary in his first of three seasons of arbitration eligibility. Teams seeking lefty relief help don\u2019t have many free agent options. Gregory Soto is probably in line for the largest contract. He\u2019s a power arm but has inconsistent command and has allowed more than four earned runs per nine in each of the past three seasons. Drew Pomeranz,\u00c2\u00a0Caleb Thielbar, Hoby Milner, Justin Wilson, Taylor Rogers\u00c2\u00a0and Danny Coulombe should be limited to one-year deals based on their age.\u00c2\u00a0Sean Newcomb or\u00c2\u00a0Caleb Ferguson could command a cheap two-year deal but aren\u2019t ideal high-leverage options.\u00c2\u00a0Steven Matz, Ryan Yarbrough\u00c2\u00a0and NPB returnees Anthony Kay and\u00c2\u00a0Foster Griffin are swing types. It\u2019s a weak group, which could lead teams to turn to the trade market. The Cardinals are likely to move former Phillie JoJo Romero, who is going into his final season of arbitration. The rebuilding Nationals could hear teams out on grounder specialist\u00c2\u00a0Jose A. Ferrer. The Rays are down to two years of control on Garrett Cleavinger and would surely entertain offers, but they\u2019re going to have a huge asking price. Every contender could evaluate the bullpen market. The Blue Jays, Giants, Mariners, Diamondbacks and Cubs are among the teams that could use another left-handed arm in particular. While the Phillies have a good group of southpaws, they could use a more reliable right-handed setup arm than\u00c2\u00a0Orion Kerkering in front of Duran. They\u2019re also in the market for outfield help and potentially a depth starter\/swingman with Harrison Bader and\u00c2\u00a0Ranger Su\u00c3\u00a1rez hitting free agency. They\u2019re prioritizing re-signing\u00c2\u00a0Kyle Schwarber and\u00c2\u00a0J.T. Realmuto. They\u2019d need to go outside the organization for a catcher if Realmuto signs elsewhere, as a\u00c2\u00a0Rafael March\u00c3\u00a1n\/Garrett Stubbs pairing would be one of the worst offensive duos in the game. President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski acknowledged at the GM Meetings that they\u2019re evaluating an otherwise weak catching market as a backup plan in case Realmuto doesn\u2019t return (link via Scott Lauber of The Philadelphia Inquirer).

I have far more faith in Strahm, and the numbers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lie.  Pete Rose Remains  7 hours ago Alvarado is a chunkeroo. Both of them will blow up as some point during the playoffs this year or next.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want to market Alvarado as a relatively cheaper $ closer candidate  before I move Banks.  Therealeman  7 hours ago If the Phils create payroll for Tucker or Bellinger, plus Schwarber, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d definitely swap Alvarado or Strahm.  Marc L  6 hours ago I would not have a problem, trading strahm as long as you get value for him. I never thought teams needed more than two lefty relievers.  Plus, I think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the downside.   I would not trade Alvarado or banks.  DadsInDaniaBeach  6 hours ago It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so hard to get quality arms, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be reluctant trading unless the return was special. Maybe an old fashioned multi player deal.  KrukHimOut  5 hours ago Personally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see them move Alverado \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially if he can get them the most in return. Package him with someone else as well if it gets them a more productive player in return. Alverado has been solid, but I still find myself worried about his control whenever he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the mound. More than that though, the drug suspension bothers me. How long has he used performance enhancers? And how much have they helped his performance? Without using them now I wonder if his performance will drop off some. Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m overly concerned about it. But he used them for a reason. The Phillies need to make some notable changes in my opinion if they want to really have a shot at winning the World Series. Bring back Bader, move on from Schwarber (spend that money elsewhere), trade Bohm for whatever you can and bring in a better 3rd baseman.  This crew just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have \u00e2\u0080\u009cit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nothing personal against any of the players. But it seems they need to change up the clubhouse and bring some new life into it.  Baltimore_44  3 hours ago An Alvarado trade has O\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written all over it. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have lined up twice on a reliever deal with the Phils. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need a real lefty reliever and Alvarado has similarities to Soto.  suddendepth  2 hours ago I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get rid of Strahm first if we are ranking possibles. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a regular season beast, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the deception-based style over velo in the playoffs. Banks I would keep. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got the best balance of stuff and mental makeup. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m indifferent on the cheater Alvarado because he will remain cost effective and is the lone power guy of the three. But his risk is obviously higher if he steps out of line again in 2026. He is also prone to bouts of command problems. Please login to leave a reply.
