If you\u2019ve been waiting for car prices to drop before buying, you\u2019re not wrong to think patience might finally pay off. After two years of inflated sticker prices and inventory shortages, dealerships are flooded with new models and older stock. That\u2019s exactly why prices on many mainstream crossovers are expected to tumble this winter. Trending Now: Auto Experts Say Stop Buying These 4 Hybrid Cars Immediately Read More: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster Data from Kelley Blue Book shows dealer inventories reached their highest levels since 2019, forcing manufacturers to offer deeper incentives. And with new electric options rolling in, gas-powered models are losing some of their shine. So, if you\u2019re eyeing reliability, fuel economy or resale value, these six crossovers are the ones to watch. Let\u2019s start small. The Hyundai Venue might not be flashy, but it\u2019s pegged for some of the sharpest price drops this winter. According to Car and Driver, the Venue\u2019s affordability and features make it attractive, yet oversupply has pushed dealerships to move them fast. Dealers are already offering up to $2,000 in purchase incentives, especially on leftover 2025 trims. Edmunds data also shows increasing discounts on subcompact SUVs as inventories peak. Despite its small engine, the Venue\u2019s excellent fuel efficiency and city-friendly size still make it a sensible choice for budget buyers. This winter, keep an eye out for promotional financing or cashback offers that could bring the starting price well below the usual $20,000 mark. Check Out: The 10 Most Reliable SUVs of 2025 The Ford Escape is quietly becoming one of the best winter deals in its class. Automakers like Ford are offering larger incentives to clear older inventory as hybrid competition intensifies. Reports from Kelley Blue Book suggest discounts in the 8% to 12% range through year-end. With 2026 versions around the corner, dealerships are under pressure to sell current models, meaning more room to negotiate. The Escape\u2019s hybrid trims \u2014 once commanding premium prices, will feel some of the biggest markdowns. Edmunds lists the Escape among compact SUVs worth watching for holiday discounts. Between factory rebates, strong fuel economy and bundled low-interest financing, the Escape is poised to be a buyer\u2019s sweet spot this winter. The Chevrolet Equinox is another volume seller feeling pricing pressure, and that\u2019s good news for shoppers. Car and Driver notes that with the 2026 redesign expected soon, current models will come with heavy markdowns. Fleet sales and overproduction added to used inventory levels, which helps drive down retail pricing. Kelley Blue Book data shows discounts between $2,000 and $3,000 on remaining 2025 stock, especially on LT and RS trims. While it may not top the performance charts, the Equinox\u2019s roomy interior and straightforward tech make it appealing. Expect end-of-year clearance deals on both gas and hybrid models as automakers reset pricing before spring incentives roll out. The Toyota RAV4 might surprise some buyers by showing up on a discount list; it\u2019s usually one of the most stable SUVs in resale value. However, Edmunds reports that hybrid inventories have risen sharply as buyers shift attention toward newer electric SUVs. That means more competitive pricing on 2025 models, both hybrid and gas variants. Kelley Blue Book data shows rebates nearing $2,500 in some markets. The RAV4\u2019s reputation for reliability still stands, but dealers are offering more incentives, especially on all-wheel-drive trims, to clear excess stock. So, if you\u2019ve been waiting for this crowd favorite to drop below MSRP, winter might finally bring that rare opportunity to the table. Subaru owners swear by the Crosstrek for winter driving \u2014 and for good reason. Its all-wheel-drive system gives it an edge in snow, but pricing fatigue among buyers is forcing adjustments. U.S. News Cars calls it one of the safest and most capable small SUVs for tricky weather conditions. Still, Car and Driver predicts markdowns as newer trims arrive with only modest changes. Expect $1,500 to $2,000 in dealer incentives across northern regions by late December. Beyond that, loyalty programs could sweeten deals further. For buyers who want adventure and practicality, this winter is an ideal time to take advantage of Subaru\u2019s limited seasonal discounts. The Kia Sportage stands out for combining value and tech, but recent hybrid overproduction means good things for bargain hunters. Kelley Blue Book notes that hybrid and plug-in hybrids now sit longer on lots, driving higher discounts this winter. According to Car and Driver, strong build quality keeps it competitive, but retail pricing pressure will rise as Kia preps the next model year. Expect $2,000 to $3,500 discounts on certain trims and possibly additional cashback on leftover inventory. Buyers wanting modern design and generous warranties will find real value as Sportage prices dip across regions.

Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and they\u2019re already discounted on Amazon. That\u2019s unusual for brand-new Apple products which typically hold their full price for months after launch. Apple isn\u2019t offering any discount on their website or in Apple Stores so Amazon is clearly absorbing the cost to drive Black Friday traffic: You\u2019re saving $30 on earbuds that haven\u2019t even been on shelves for a full month, and at $219 down from $249, this is the lowest price we\u2019ve seen and likely the best deal you\u2019ll find on these new earbuds. See at Amazon Active noise cancellation on AirPods Pro 3 removes up to twice as much unwanted noise as the previous generation. And airplane engines, office chatter, and city traffic just fade away so you can focus on your music or podcast. The new acoustic architecture delivers transformed bass response with detailed clarity across all frequencies. Vocals sound stunningly vivid, and you can pick out individual instruments in complex recordings. Spatial audio immerses you in a three-dimensional soundstage where movies and music feel more real than ever. When you turn your head, the sound shifts around you, placing you in the heart of the action. Of course, this only works with compatible content on Apple Music, Apple TV+, and select other streaming services. It also extends to gaming, providing you with better spatial awareness so you know exactly where sounds are coming from. These health features are genuinely groundbreaking for a product of this size. Integrated heart rate sensing keeps track of your pulse and calories burned across 50 different workout types. You get access to your Move ring, step count, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The hearing health suite includes a home hearing test and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost. Live Translation is one of those features that sounds like science fiction until you try it. Firing on all cylinders thanks to Apple Intelligence, the feature translates conversations in real-time directly through your earbuds. You can communicate across language barriers during travel or international business meetings and the translation is local on your device for privacy and speed. Battery life is significantly better compared to previous generations: You get up to 8 hours of listening time with active noise cancellation enabled or up to 10 hours in Transparency mode using the Hearing Aid feature. The USB-C charging case provides additional charges when you\u2019re on the go. A quick charge gives you hours of listening from just minutes in the case. The new ear tips come in five sizes, up from the previous three, to provide a much more personalized and secure fit. A better seal means improved noise isolation and bass response sans cranking the volume up. The buds stay put during workouts, runs, and active daily use. Apple\u2019s fit test in the Settings app will help you find the perfect size for your ears. Comfort matters when you are wearing earbuds for hours at a time. At $219, the AirPods Pro 3 offer fantastic value on brand new Apple hardware. Amazon\u2019s taking the hit on margins that Apple won\u2019t match in their own stores. If you want the latest AirPods Pro at a price below retail, this record-low Black Friday deal is the opportunity to grab them.

Heat styling tools force you to choose between damaged hair and skipping the styles you actually want. In revolutionizing hair styling, the Dyson Airwrap harnessed aerodynamics instead of extreme heat to create curls, waves, and smooth blowouts. Dyson pioneered this technology and while dozens of brands have attempted knockoffs, none match the engineering or results of the original. Amazon just dropped the Airwrap Origin to an all-time low of $399 for Black Friday, down from the usual $549 price tag. You get the iconic 1.2-inch barrel, round brush, and flyaway attachment that style your hair via controlled airflow rather than scorching temperatures. See at Amazon The Airwrap uses the Coanda effect, an aerodynamic phenomenon whereby high-velocity air creates a low-pressure zone which attracts and wraps hair onto the barrel automatically. You merely hold a section of damp hair near the barrel, and airflow draws it into a spiral without twisting or manually wrapping. Hands-free curling eliminates the technique barrier that makes traditional curling irons frustrating for beginners. The hair wraps around the barrel evenly in consistent layers to create uniform curls without hot spots or uneven heating. The styling occurs when your hair is wet, and the style gets set with airflow as it dries. Traditional heat tools are applied to completely dry hair; reshaping requires very high temperatures over 400\u00c2\u00b0F. The Airwrap works at a lot lower temperature, drying and styling with fast-moving air. This key difference saves your hair from such high heat exposure that, after some time, causes damage, breakage, and dullness. The 1.2-inch barrel produces voluminous curls and waves suitable for medium to long hair lengths. This larger size in the barrel makes for a looser outcome rather than tight ringlets that would result from using smaller barrels. You can control how tight each curl is with how you hold each section and how tight the hair wraps around the barrel. The direction of the barrel changes with the simple press of a button, which means you can achieve curls flowing away from your face on both sides without changing any attachments. The round brush smooths and adds volume during blowouts, and replaces both your hair dryer and round brush routine. The bristles grasp the hair while airflow dries and shapes it for a salon-quality finish in one step. You can lift hair at the roots for added volume or smooth it flat for sleek styles. This prevents the frizz that comes from just blasting your hair with traditional dryers, leaving finishes smooth and polished. The flyaway attachment conquers those annoying baby hairs and frizzy strands that just don\u2019t want to behave. It works by using focused airflow to lay flyaways down flat against your finished style without disrupting the curls or waves you just set. It is this finishing touch that will take your whole look from homemade to professional quality. It keeps the learning curve well within reach, even for people who struggle with traditional styling tools. You hold damp sections of hair near the appropriate attachment and let the Coanda effect do the work. The airflow guides your technique rather than requiring perfect manual dexterity with hot barrels. Most users figure out basic styling within a few attempts, and results improve quickly with practice. For $399, this Airwrap Origin becomes the first to bring Dyson\u2019s pioneering heat protection technology for $150 less than usual.

Pictures taking minutes to download? Social media feed doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t refresh as much as it should? Struggling to send messages? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just frustrating, but can also affect your productivity when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to work or study at home. Heck, it even makes relaxing while watching some fun reels hard. If you have been facing all this and more while paying for speedy internet, the issue might not be with your internet service provider, but something at home \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the router. This is especially common in bigger homes, where everyone is trying to enjoy a fast, stable connection (as they should). The solution is simple. A WiFi extender can provide the boost you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for, and these devices aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really on the expensive side, either. Most standard options sit around or under $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less. Thanks to an early Black Friday sale, the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender has dropped by 37%. It normally retails for $30, but after the discount, you can snap it up for just $19. But as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect, the deal is selling out fast, which also shows how common the slow internet issue is. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to grab it as soon as you can, since we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect it to drop any further during the main event. In fact, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good chance the stock will run out by then. See at Amazon One thing to note before proceeding is that WiFi extenders are made to improve\/increase the WiFi coverage around your house, so they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an effect on the internet speed directly. In most cases, getting stronger signals gives you the performance you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying for, but if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a speed issue on your internet provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fix that. This extender offers coverage up to 1600 sq. ft., which makes it great for apartments, condos, and even homes. There are two adjustable external antennas that offer a reliable connection and fast speeds to up to 32 devices at the same time. You can connect your smartphone, laptop, tablet, computer, gaming consoles, and more, and still enjoy an impressive, strong connection on each. Dual-band support gets you speeds of up to 300 Mbps on 2.4GHz and 867 Mbps on 5GHz, which means a combined 1.2 Gbps of total bandwidth. That translates into much faster browsing, lag-free streaming, better video calls, and more efficient gaming. Want an even stronger connection on one of your devices? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fast Ethernet port for an improved wireless connection. This comes in handy for when you want to play a game or hop on an important video call and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to leave anything to chance. Access Point Mode support lets you convert a wired internet line into a WiFi hotspot, while EasyMesh compatibility lets you expand the network by connecting the extender to any EasyMesh-compatible router for a bigger setup. Setting things up is quite straightforward. TP-Link\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intelligent signal indicator helps you find the ideal place to position your extender for maximum coverage. Once you have installed it into place, head over to the TP-Link Tether app on your phone and follow the on-screen instructions to get started. It shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take more than a few minutes to get everything going, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your first time doing this! It was already quite affordable at $30, but this deal lets you grab it for $19. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practically nothing, considering the features and peace of mind it gets you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to get your orders in quickly, as the price can shoot back up anytime. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

There\u2019s no reason gamers need to spend big bucks on a Logitech MX Master for office productivity when all they want is pure gaming performance. The G305 Lightspeed mouse delivers everything competitive players actually need without the ergonomic bells and whistles you\u2019d use for spreadsheets. Right now it\u2019s hit an all-time low at $27 on Amazon, down from its usual $49 price tag for Black Friday. This wireless gaming mouse packs Logitech\u2019s Hero 12K sensor, Lightspeed wireless technology with 1ms response time and runs for 250 hours on a single AA battery. See at Amazon Lightspeed wireless technology eliminates the lag that plagued older wireless mice. The 1ms report rate matches what you\u2019d get from a wired connection which means your cursor moves exactly when you move the mouse. You won\u2019t notice any delay during flick shots or quick building edits in competitive games. The wireless receiver stores inside the mouse body when you\u2019re traveling, so you won\u2019t lose that tiny USB dongle in your bag. The Hero 12K sensor tracks up to 400 IPS and offers adjustable sensitivity up to 12,000 DPI. High IPS ratings come in handy when one is making fast swipes across the mousepad in the heat of an intense firefight. It retains its accuracy even when you\u2019re making those swift moves that would confuse cheaper optical sensors. You\u2019ll be able to dial in your preferred DPI settings and save them to the mouse\u2019s onboard memory. The weight of 99 grams keeps the mouse agile without feeling cheap or flimsy. Lightweight mice reduce fatigue during marathon gaming sessions and allow for easier and quicker adjustments. Pro players who want to shave off even more remove the AA battery cover and install much lighter AAA batteries with foil adapters to do so. The shape works well for different grip styles from palm to claw down to fingertip, though smaller hands might find it more comfortable than larger ones. Six programmable buttons are enough to provide options for most games without overcomplicating the design. You can use Logitech\u2019s G Hub software to map things like abilities, building modes, or weapon swaps to the side buttons. Your button configurations are stored in the onboard memory, so you don\u2019t need to install software on every computer you\u2019re using it with. Battery life extends to 250 hours of continuous use on a single AA battery. You can game for months before needing to swap batteries, and the mouse warns you when power runs low. Using standard AA batteries means you can grab replacements anywhere instead of hunting for proprietary charging cables. This extended battery life is possible without sacrificing tracking performance thanks to the efficient Hero sensor. At $27, this mouse delivers professional-level wireless performance for less than half its normal price. You\u2019re getting the same sensor and wireless tech that Logitech puts in its $150 flagship mice. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Veteran investor Tom Russo says children need to build resilience, debt can be devastating, and older people have some advantages when it comes to beating the market. Russo is the managing member of Gardner Russo & Quinn, an investment firm with a $9.3 billion US stock portfolio as of September 30, per its latest 13F filing. The father of two told Business Insider that teaching resilience to kids starts with letting them fall on the playground, so they can learn to get back up and keep going. They have to experience pain and discomfort as \"those moments happen all the time in life,\" he said. \"The greatest lessons are learned when trying to work yourself out of something that doesn't go well. And the worst thing to do is to avoid those from happening when they naturally would.\" Asked how young people can get ahead at a time when AI threatens to take jobs and many feel priced out of the lives they want, Russo cited Warren Buffett's warnings about credit-card debt as a \"chain across your back\" that gets tighter and tighter until it chokes you. Russo added that \"buy now, pay later\" options pose a fresh threat, as they tempt people into spending money they don't have. Russo also cautioned against gambling too much, saying it's a \"loser's game to begin with\" and \"probably isn't going to develop your thinking and wisdom and reason.\" The market veteran, who turned 70 this year, ruled out retiring anytime soon. While young investors might have more time and energy to travel and dig deeper into prospective investments, older ones \"develop judgment, and you're a little less impetuous, and a little more patient, and probably a little bit more asleep,\" he quipped. Russo is far from the first investor to continue working past retirement age. Buffett, 95, will step down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO before the new year, but intends to continue writing Thanksgiving letters to his shareholders and remain involved in the company as its chairman.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"When describing the health of the US economy, there is a temptation among economists, market analysts, and politicians to argue that the only true picture of our current situation is a sweeping portrait \u2014 only by looking at the broadest of aggregate statistics can you determine the state of play, they argue. But the wide view can ignore important developments unfolding under the surface. Sometimes, even the healthiest-looking person might have high cholesterol. Right now, the economy seems OK on the surface. GDP growth has been running north of 3% for the last two quarters. In the labor market, the boilerplate appears to be that conditions are gradually cooling, but nothing more, nothing less. For example, despite the slowdown in new hiring, the unemployment rate of 4.4% is still low by historical standards. But there are serious dangers lurking beneath the surface of our economy, and it is better to clearly identify them than to ignore them in favor of broad aggregate measures. Major employers in industries like homebuilding and restaurants are looking shaky, and they offer ominous signs about the direction of the overall economy. By getting a sense of what sectors and industries are struggling, you can get a forward-looking sense of the economy's trajectory and a clearer-eyed view of the possibility of recession. The problem with relying on broad bundles of data is that things typically appear placid on an aggregate level right up until things go wrong. Take the turning of the job market tide. In a genuine downturn, the consensus typically assumes a gradual, linear increase in unemployment, similar to the slow, steady grind we are currently experiencing. In reality, however, the risk is nonlinear. When things truly turn south, it usually comes as an abrupt shift that results in a negative self-reinforcing feedback loop. Instead of a slow increase in the unemployment rate of 0.1 percentage points a month, you begin to see a jump of 0.2 points one month and another 0.3 points the next. The ranks of the jobless swell at an ever-increasing pace. There is no real way of knowing when labor market conditions will transition from linear to nonlinear. Historically, the consensus never sees the shift until well after it has arrived. That things seem to be evolving in a stable fashion now doesn't negate the possibility of an unstable move later. This is why, when making predictions about the future path of the economy, it is essential to get under the hood. And right now, the closer you look, the more worrying things become. Don't just take my word for it, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently acknowledged that sectors of the economy are already in serious downturn territory. \"I think we are in good shape, but I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,\" Bessent told CNN in an early November interview. While Bessent didn't go into much detail about the parts of the American economy that concern him, a close read reveals the most worrying signals are coming from four major sources of employment: Residential housing: There are several signs that employment in home construction is about to hit the skids. The elevated stock of unsold homes means homebuilders will need to throttle back on breaking new ground and focus on selling the inventory they have on hand. Building permits also indicate a potential weakness in future construction activity. Add this up, and it's clear that the industry is likely holding onto too many workers relative to its current activity levels. Restaurants: We've seen major casual dining establishments, such as Chipotle and Sweetgreen, post weaker sales growth in recent quarters, largely due to weakness in certain consumer cohorts, including 25-34 year olds. Despite this, many chains have said they plan to absorb higher food input prices caused by supply shocks, thereby squeezing their margins. Slower sales and slimmer profits are not a recipe for more hiring. In fact, declining measures of productivity per worker in food services & drinking places suggest that many of these restaurants are overstaffed and may be a signal that layoffs are on the horizon. Beyond these big four, there are industries with a smaller employment footprint that also appear to be softening: It's taken a while to unfold, but the labor slowdown has played out in a standard way: job openings have declined, hiring rates have cooled as companies have slowed their pace of recruiting, and we're now beginning to see an increase in layoffs from historically low levels. The workers at the margins \u2014 like younger people and Black Americans \u2014 have felt it more than those in more secure positions, which is also not unusual. Recession-like dynamics across several different industries increase the risk of additional layoffs in those same key sectors in the quarters ahead. Because the hiring rate is low, a small increase in layoffs may have a disproportionately large effect on unemployment. Just because conditions seem to be gradually cooling today does not close the door on a more abrupt shift in labor market conditions later. The labor market remains a source of downside risk for the broader economy. Because consumption has been a source of support for the economy, a deeper slowdown in the jobs market would create a nasty downward spiral: People cut back on their spending as they lose their jobs, which dries up sources of revenue for businesses that then lay off more workers in response, which further shrinks the amount of household spending, and so on. Where all this ends up is still up for debate. But while America's economic ocean appears placid at 30,000 feet, beneath the surface, several riptides are brewing.

While you will be able to snag good deals during those sales events, the best time of year to buy a new iPad is just after Apple has released a new version. When a new model hits the market, the value of older models falls, and the price drops. For example, in October 2025, Apple dropped the iPad Pro M5 model. The M4 models are still available with savings up to $120. Earlier that year, Apple also updated the standard model, with the new 11th-generation model boasting the new A16 chip. You can still get your hands on a 10th-generation model, with a price cut of $100. If you want to buy a previous-generation model just after a new model drops, you'll want to keep an eye out for Apple's official announcements. The tech giant tends to drop new iPad models twice a year, with different models launching at different times. So if you want a specific model, you may be in for a wait. Luckily, if you're ready to buy, you can still save with other options. Of course, the aforementioned Black Friday and Cyber Monday are good times to look for iPad deals, even on the newest models, with possible savings of $50 or more. These deals are typically announced in advance, allowing you to plan ahead of time for that big purchase. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Prime Day events are also a good time to shop for a new iPad. The e-commerce giant typically holds two of these events every year, one in the summer and one in the fall, and it usually offers discounted iPad models during the sale. In 2025, those sales even included the newest models. Your kids may hate those back-to-school sales, but this can be another time when you may be able to score a good discount on iPads. Apple typically discounts select models in August, aware that many students use them for school. Additionally, students and teachers are eligible for additional discounts with a current school ID. These back-to-school events also sometimes offer free products with the purchase of certain Apple products. Finally, if you're not too exhausted after all the holiday celebrations, you can sometimes find good deals on excess Apple inventory at the beginning of the new year. This is not an official sales event with any retailers, but some stores may offer discounts on older generation models if they have leftover stock. In the end, you should be able to score a good deal on an iPad, especially if you're patient and wait for the right time of year.","label":0}

Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital and early investor in several of Elon Musk's companies, says people aren't focusing on niche chemicals enough. On an episode of the \"Relentless\" podcast that aired on November 17, Maguire said that he might invest in the chemicals industry if he had $10 billion to start a business. \"The chemicals industry is one of the most underrated industries in the world for many reasons,\" Maguire said. He added that most people don't think about the industry, which supports production for nearly all commercial and household goods, according to a 2022 report from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. And those who do know about the industry don't fully understand it, thinking of it as strictly a commodity industry, Maguire said. \"But a large fraction of the industry, I'd say at least 25%, is hardcore specialty chemicals that are actually very rare. A lot of times, there's only one company in the world that will make some specialty chemical,\" he said. (Specialty chemicals accounted for about 23% of the industry, according to CISA's report). Maguire said that those chemicals can be crucial for another company's production, as he said is true of one of Musk's businesses, and that losing access to a key chemical can severely delay or upend projects. Specialty chemicals include \"adhesives, sealants, flavors and fragrances, food additives, and explosives,\" according to CISA. The chemical industry is in a downcycle, and production volumes are expected to contract by 0.2% next year, according to Deloitte's 2026 Chemical Industry Outlook. Though the report predicts continued overcapacity in basic chemicals, it found that specialty chemicals are earning higher margins. \"Specialty chemicals tend to be less commoditized and avoid the hyper-competitiveness of the commodity chemicals markets,\" the report reads. Although chemical demand in the construction, automotive, and consumer goods industries is likely to continue suffering, the semiconductor market may offer a bright spot, according to Deloitte's report. The boom in AI data centers is helping to fuel growth, per Deloitte. So far in 2025, the chemical industry has badly lagged the overall market. The S&P 500 Chemical Industry index was down 5% for the year through Thursday, while the S&P 500 was up more than 11%. Jump to","label":0}

As mortgage rates stay stubbornly high, President Donald Trump and his administration have floated a few ideas to help buyers afford a mortgage. Most notably, the president said he's considering 50-year mortgages. Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his team is also exploring ways buyers can lock in low interest rates from older mortgages. There are a slew of creative financing options out there that could make buying a home cheaper. But they can be risky. Some could backfire and lead to higher prices amid an ongoing housing shortage. All of the discussion about more affordable mortgages is a function of politicians attempting to come up with short-term solutions to a complicated problem that can't be fixed overnight because \"they're under pressure from their constituents who can't afford to buy,\" said Lance Lambert, co-founder of real estate media and research group ResiClub. The cost of the typical mortgage more than doubled between December 2019 and December 2024 because of skyrocketing home prices and elevated mortgage interest rates. Here are four alternative financing approaches, along with their strengths and weaknesses. Trump and Pulte made headlines when they proposed their unusual plan for half-century-long home loans. The idea of stretching debt would be to make monthly payments more affordable for borrowers and put homeownership within reach for more Americans. However, the idea has been widely criticized by housing economists, who argue that a 50-year loan would significantly increase a buyer's debt burden, resulting in a higher total interest payment over the life of the loan.  For example, the monthly payment on a 30-year fixed mortgage with a 6% interest rate for a typical home would be about $2,000, Business Insider previously reported. The same terms for a 50-year loan would shrink that monthly payment to around $1,800. But over the life of the half-century loan, the borrower would pay about $750,000 in interest, rather than about $400,000 in interest for the three-decade loan. In addition to the increased interest paid over the lifetime of the mortgage, lenders typically view longer-term loans as riskier, so they'll likely charge higher rates on a 50-year mortgage. It would also take much longer for the borrower to build equity in their home, which is key to building wealth. If the federal government were to back these longer loans, it could also backfire by boosting demand for homes, as more buyers qualify, and thus driving up prices. Crucially, cheaper mortgages don't address the fundamental reason Americans are struggling to buy homes: a shortage of between one and almost five million homes. \"Financing is not the solution,\" said Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow. \"We're in this affordability crisis because there's a housing shortage, so changing the loan terms, having different financing products \u2014 it doesn't change the fact there aren't enough homes to go around.\" Amid the backlash to the 50-year mortgage idea, Pulte posted on X that Fannie and Freddie were \"evaluating how to do assumable or portable mortgages, in a safe and sound manner.\" A few days later, he again posted that the administration is \"actively evaluating\" portable mortgages. Portable and assumable mortgages are different things. Both involve locking in older mortgages with below-market rates. Portable mortgages enable homeowners to take their mortgage interest rate with them to a new property, and assumable mortgages allow buyers to take over the seller's mortgage, including its below-market rate. The US already has many assumable mortgages, though sellers and buyers alike may not know they have that option. Home loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Agriculture are all automatically assumable. Almost a quarter of existing mortgages can be passed from seller to buyer, and a bit less than half of those loans have an interest rate of 4% or below, Business Insider reporter James Rodriguez\u00a0reported earlier this year. If you can obtain one, assumable mortgages can be a great option for buyers. They not only save on interest, they also save on closing costs, as they're exempted from paying for an appraisal or for title insurance, and they aren't on the hook for a mortgage origination fee. \"The best way to help people move regardless of the macro environment is give them access to those low rates,\" said Raunaq Singh, founder and CEO of Roam, a company that facilitates sales with assumable mortgages. But there are drawbacks to assumables. The buyer has to qualify for the loan and pay the loan servicer the difference between the home sale price and the remaining mortgage. If the down payment is more than the buyer can afford, they may need a second mortgage, which can be challenging to obtain and would likely come with a higher interest rate. Portable mortgages, on the other hand, do not yet exist in the US. Housing economists warn that legalizing portable loans could give homeowners who are lucky enough to have an existing mortgage with a low rate an even bigger advantage over first-time homebuyers and others. The dynamic could also drive home prices up further by empowering repeat buyers to spend more. \"That could juice up demand and create more turnover in the market at a time when we're trying to recalibrate,\" Lambert said. Aside from the options Pulte says he's exploring, there are other ways buyers are finding deals on mortgages. It's increasingly common to find a below-market interest rate on a newly built home. Over the past few years, homebuilders have increasingly offered incentives to buyers, including mortgage rate buydowns and adjustable-rate mortgages. This reduces monthly payments for buyers while allowing builders to avoid lowering their home prices. But these rate buydowns could be inflating home prices, a recent Wall Street Journal report found, since they provide a way for builders to offer incentives to buyers while protecting the sticker price on a new home. Large builders, which use rate buydowns more often, saw prices on the first sale of their newly-built homes rise 6% more than existing homes and those built by smaller companies between 2019 and 2024, the American Enterprise Institute recently found. Another creative financing option \u2014 seller financing \u2014 involves cutting the bank out of the transaction entirely. In these cases, the seller holds onto the home's deed as the buyer pays them for the property in multiyear installments, in addition to agreed-upon interest. The option appeals to buyers who want a below-market interest rate or who don't qualify for a traditional mortgage, and sellers who are willing to be paid back over time in exchange for also earning interest. But the practice can be risky. Seller financing often operates as a short-term bridge loan to the buyer. So, if interest rates don't fall during the life of the loan, the buyer could face a significantly higher payment if they opt for a traditional mortgage after a few years of making payments to the seller. The practice was long more common in poor neighborhoods and has been criticized by federal regulators for exploiting low-income buyers with high interest rates on low-quality homes. While seller financing has grown in popularity because of high rates in recent years, it's still a niche practice. Just about 1% of home listings mention private financing, according to Realtor.com. But in recent years, the practice has become more popular in higher-end home sales. \"This used to be kind of a sketchy thing that happened with really cheap properties and really under-qualified buyers, and now the median price is on par with what's on the market as a whole,\" said Joel Berner, a senior economist at Realtor.com. \"So it's moving upmarket, becoming more widespread, happening on higher dollar properties.\" Ryan Leahy and Eric Bennett founded a company based in Austin, Texas, called MORE, that specializes in facilitating seller financing. They deal with higher-end homes \u2014 typically valued between $800,000 and $3 million, they said. Their sellers normally have a fair amount of cash and equity in their property, while their buyers are often self-employed with income that's more difficult to account for, making it harder to qualify for a mortgage. \"There's so many people out there self-employed or have income that doesn't qualify for a traditional mortgage, meaning you have influencer income, crypto income, side hustle income,\" Leahy said. Mel Dorman bought her first home \u2014 an investment property \u2014 with seller financing. Since then, she's built a real estate portfolio in Portland, Oregon, and become an advocate for the practice, advising others on how to buy and sell without a bank. Dorman argues that the practice can help keep wealth within a community, rather than having it extracted by a bank. \"When somebody does a seller finance transaction, their payment is literally going to a person who lives nearby, who's probably local, and it's funding their ability to downsize, to retire, to sell their rental property, to stop being a landlord, whatever is their need for selling,\" she said. \"Likewise, it creates a pathway to ownership to Americans who are increasingly locked out because of bank criteria and the cost of capital, interest rates, and prices.\" Jump to","label":0}

Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast.    $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series.

This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch.

It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item.    $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024.   $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022.  $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game.    $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games.    $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.   ","label":0}
{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"While Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government lives on edge under a military threat from US President Donald Trump, ordinary Venezuelans spend their time trying to figure out what to eat each day. It's Wednesday morning at Quinta Crespo, a popular market in downtown Caracas. Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay. \"There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,\" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive. In the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship. On Saturday, at least four international airlines cancelled flights into or out of the country after a Friday notice from US aviation authorities warned of \"heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\". This comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific killed more than 80 people. It's part of a broader effort the administration says is necessary to stem the flow of narcotics into the US, but Maduro insists the sabre-rattling is designed to push him out of office. Alejandro downplays the rhetoric between Washington and Caracas. He's been selling vegetables in this market for five years. \"Look, look how empty this is,\" he insists, pointing to a long, lonely aisle full of fresh fruits and vegetables. A Christmas carol plays, but the festive atmosphere feels overshadowed. The common enemy of the people is here: the sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. In part, this is due to the rapid depreciation of the bol\u00edvar, which will have lost 80% of its value this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures. A kilo of chicken, for example, costs about four times the official monthly minimum wage. And although the government offers bonuses to retirees and public workers, the money is still not enough to cover the basic food basket. Consuelo, 74, is sceptical about an armed conflict with the US and says Venezuelans cannot afford to stock food in preparation for a war. \"Let whatever happens happen! And that's it!\" she tells the BBC, adding that worrying about the spectre of war doesn't help much. \"Is it true? Is it false? That just makes you sick, walking around nervous, it's better to stay calm. Emotions can also affect your health,\" continues this retired university professor who still works. \"I haven't done any panic buying; you need a lot of money to do that.\" Two economists living in Venezuela consulted by the BBC for this report preferred not to comment for fear of government reprisals. \"Inflation has reached levels of around 20% monthly,\" another expert who requested anonymity pointed out. The IMF projects a 548% price increase this year and says it will be worse in 2026, when it could soar to 629% - the highest figure on the continent. Others see a potential US intervention as an opportunity for regime change but are afraid to speak openly about it. \"We're scared, silent, afraid they'll throw us in jail. I used to post things, but not anymore - I shouldn't - because I don't know who might turn me in,\" a merchant from Ciudad Bol\u00edvar (in Bol\u00edvar state, south) tells the BBC by phone. \"There's hope, faith, but people are quiet out of fear. You don't hear anyone talking about it; it's just at home, with your family, but there's a hint of joy,\" says the woman anonymously. Much of society avoids speaking openly about issues that could be sensitive for Maduro's government, after a wave of arrests followed anti-government protests over the disputed 2024 presidential elections, which have been widely rejected by the international community.  The opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the legitimate president-elect. After the elections, more than 2,000 people were arrested, official figures show. At present, 884 individuals remain in prison for political reasons, according to the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal. Barbara Marrero, a 40-year-old pastry chef, says: \"We're all waiting for something to happen because it's fair and necessary. We've been living in absolute misery for years. \"Venezuelans live day by day waiting for something to happen, but everyone is afraid [to speak] and nobody says anything.\" Esther Guevara, 53, who works in a medical lab, doesn't hide her concern amid tensions over the US naval fleet deployment. \"I'm worried because I don't really know what's happening - they might invade, strike\u2026 people think it will be ok, but this is serious,\" she says. \"A lot of innocent people could die.\" \"I feel like something's cooking out there, but I'm waiting,\" she adds. It's now midday. Everything goes on as usual along a busy boulevard in eastern Caracas. Street vendors pushing sales. Pedestrians coming and going. There's Javier Jaramillo, 57, looking for goods to resell at Christmas. He's curious about the USS Gerald R Ford, the aircraft carrier Washington moved to the Caribbean. \"I don't think that attack will happen. I think there could be dialogue, an agreement, or a deal.\" Still, he says that when there are power cuts, he thinks: \"'They've come in,' 'They're going to come in.'\" Trump has suggested he is open to a diplomatic dialogue with Maduro, but also said he would not rule out military action. Either way, Javier repeats: \"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio says more work is needed to finalise a US-Ukraine deal that will then need Russia's agreement. According to the United States Geological Survey, this is the 37th eruption episode since December 2024. Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, says she was diagnosed shortly after giving birth in 2024 and has less than a year to live. US President Donald Trump says the plan is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, and security officials are set to meet in Geneva on Sunday.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"The Pixel Buds 2a offer a budget price tag without compromising on audio quality.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Earbud deals are already landing across retailers for Black Friday, including some budget-friendly pairs that have gotten even cheaper. For example, Amazon's Black Friday sale this year includes 23% off the already affordable Google Pixel Buds 2a, making them just $100 for the time being. Google launched the Pixel Buds 2a as its first economy-level earbud option, though they still include features such as active noise cancellation, transparency mode, and decently high-quality audio in general. These earbuds can get up to 20 hours of playback time when charging intermittently with the charging case, or up to 7 hours per charge even with ANC toggled on. They also come with the Google Gemini AI assistant for intuitive voice commands and an IP54 ingress protection rating. Google Pixel Buds 2a: $129.00 $99 for Amazon's Black Friday sale \u2705Recommended if: you're looking for a pair of wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for around $100 that doesn't compromise on audio quality or battery life; you've liked other Google devices and you want access to Clear Calling, Find Hub, and other features included with Pixel phones, watches, and tablets; you'd prefer something with water and dust resistance for exercise or for use in inclement weather conditions. \u274cSkip this deal if: you're looking for a pair of the best wireless earbuds on the market and are willing to upgrade from Google's budget earbuds; you'd rather forego features like ANC and Transparency Mode for an even cheaper pair of earbuds; you'd prefer a pair of over-ear headphones to a pair of earbuds. The Google Pixel Buds 2a have quite a wide offering for being the manufacturer's budget option. Most of all, they offer a decent audio quality with user-friendly customization options, as well as ANC, and the ambient listening mode dubbed \"Transparency Mode,\" which lets users tune into their surroundings. According to Google, the Pixel Buds 2a earbuds support up to 7 hours of listening time per individual charge, or up to 20 hours total with the use of the charging case. The company also says that a 5-minute charge can yield about an hour of added listening time. The earbuds also have microphones and the Gemini AI assistant built in, letting users verbally sift through emails, generate walking directions, or capture notes, in addition to just using the mics to make phone calls. Other Google features include those found across many Pixel devices, such as Clear Calling, Find Hub, and more. All in all, if you were looking to spend around $100 on earbuds and you own other Pixel devices, these might be a Black Friday deal worth considering.

Reading time 7 minutes        Google is betting that AI can justify the high price of its smart home security camera subscriptions. The idea is that with AI, your notifications would read more like a human looked outside and told you what they saw. And instead of you scrolling through endless video footage to see what happened, AI can summarize the day for you. Sounds good, right? Sounds great to me. If you already read my Nest Cam Outdoor (wired, 2nd gen) review, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know the reality, as I experienced it, is underwhelming. Notifications, generated by Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gemini AI chatbot, constantly misidentified my pets and gave weird and wrong descriptions of events taking place in triggered recordings. Daily summaries of my family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comings and goings made it sound like my house was being mobbed with people and animals. None of it helped justify the pricey cloud storage service that the Google Home Premium (formerly Nest Aware) subscriptions otherwise are. And without those subscriptions, the Nest Cam Outdoor just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do enough to make it worth buying over some of the more capable, less cloud-reliant alternatives out there. Does the Google Nest Doorbell (wired, 3rd gen) fare any better? Well, the AI features are still broken the same way, but it may still be a better purchase, depending on how deep your roots are within the walled garden of the Google Home ecosystem. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not a big Google Home user, though, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to look elsewhere. Google Nest Doorbell (wired, 3rd gen) Janky AI summaries and spendy subscription aside, the Nest Doorbell is good enough if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re deep in the Google Home ecosystem. Pros Cons The Nest Doorbell might be the nicest-looking video doorbell on the market. Its slender, bar-shaped housing is rounded on both ends, curving tightly around the camera and the LED ring-lit doorbell button. The whole thing has the same gentle, pleasingly symmetrical vibe that characterizes the other Google Nest cameras. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot nicer to look at than chunky, blocky video doorbells from the likes of Ring or Eufy. Beyond the pretty design, Google\u2019s third-gen wired doorbell has solid specs like a 2K resolution camera sensor with a generous 166-degree diagonal field of view that spreads out over a square aspect ratio. It captures HDR video at 30 frames per second; clips come in vibrant color during the day and, using infrared LEDs, black and white at night. The Nest Doorbell also has a microphone and speaker that enables two-way audio. Connectivity-wise, the camera uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy. Thanks to that fast Wi-Fi and its always-on nature, its live feed loads almost instantly in the Google Home app. Installation is straightforward, assuming you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the requisite doorbell wiring by your door. The Nest Doorbell comes with a mounting plate and a second angled adapter\u00c2\u00a0that you can use if you want to have the camera pointing more toward people at your door. Google includes wire extenders if you need them, and the Google Home app, which you use for setup, guides you through installation. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to connect the Nest Doorbell to the Google Home app\u00e2\u0080\u0094the only place you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever use it, since this is exclusively a Google Home-compatible product\u00e2\u0080\u0094but a word of advice: Setup requires a QR code included in the box. Lose it and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to undo all of your physical installation work to get at the same QR code on the back of the doorbell itself. Once set up, it works like most other video doorbells. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get notifications when someone presses its button, or when the Nest Doorbell detects the sorts of objects\u00e2\u0080\u0094people, pets, and vehicles\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve set it to notify you about. Unfortunately, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a subscription if you want those notifications to feature a zoomed-in preview of whatever triggered the recording, as well as for package detection. Seems stingy, but I guess thumbnail images and machine-learning cardboard box recognition don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow on trees? See Nest Doorbell (wired, 3rd gen) at Amazon Despite those omissions, Google is more generous with free features for the Nest Doorbell than the Nest Cam Outdoor. It works with existing mechanical and digital chimes, for instance, and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a functioning chime (like me) then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also got the option to use Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smart speakers or displays. They can be configured to announce when someone has rang your doorbell and\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the case of the Google Nest Hub or Hub Max\u00e2\u0080\u0094start streaming the camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s live feed. Through the display you can also chat with the person who rang your doorbell or, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not into chatting, pick an automated response such as one telling a delivery person to leave the payload there. In testing, my second-generation Nest Hub was fairly quick to announce that someone had pressed the button, and chatting back and forth with them was easy enough. The only problem was that I had to deal with the Nest Hub itself, which has an interface that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely sluggish in 2025. Still, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cool integration. Now, if only I could get it to do this on the Google TV-equipped OLED TV in my basement. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it for the Nest Doorbell, sans subscription. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no local recording, although Google did bump the amount of time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep a recorded event on its servers from a scant three hours in the previous Nest Doorbell to a still-meager six hours. Either way, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paltry compared to the free local storage offered for video doorbells from the likes of Eufy, Reolink, Blink, and Aqara. If you want more out of the Nest Doorbell, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to pay for a $10 or $20 per month Google Home Premium subscription. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you more cloud video storage history\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the tune of 30 days or 60 days, respectively, with the latter also adding 10 days of 24\/7 recording that you can search using Gemini. The lower Standard tier also gets you facial recognition, package detection, and alerts if one of your Google Home devices hears glass breaking or smoke alarms. Those features, as well as local storage, are all things the Reolink Elite I recently reviewed offers for free. In fact, the only thing this subscription nets you that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get with a lot of other cameras is a feature called \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp me create,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which lets you create automations by describing them in a text box in the Google Home app. It worked well for creating simple automations, although one thing that bothers me is that if you ask it to do something that Google Home\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automations aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t capable of, Gemini won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just deliver a non-functioning automation. Eventually, the Standard plan will also include a wide rollout of Gemini to\u00c2\u00a0smart speakers. That includes features like Gemini Live, Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s LLM-powered assistant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back-and-forth voice chatting feature. As of this review, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to hold off on the subscription if you want access to Gemini on your speakers, as that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only available to some in early access. You have to subscribe to the $20\/month Google Home Premium Advanced plan to get the headlining AI camera features like daily summaries and AI-created notifications for events. You can read a lot more about my issues with these features over in my review of the Nest Cam Outdoor, but to summarize: Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI system has a tendency to misinterpret what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in front of it, confidently misidentifies animals, and its summaries often describe a person coming and going in a way that makes it seem like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m having a house party every day. That said, the system seems more accurate in the context of a video doorbell, perhaps because the camera is closer to the ground and can see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in front of it more clearly. Or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just because what happens in front of my house is a lot more routine than in the backyard\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not trying to make sense of dogs going in and out or people doing yardwork or taking out the trash. Gemini still called my cat a dog sometimes, but it accurately called out when most packages were delivered and even noted that one was from Amazon. These features are slick when they work, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094again\u00e2\u0080\u0094like I said in my Nest Cam Outdoor review, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a clear technological leap forward for home security cameras. But Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI descriptions are still wrong often enough that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like paying $20 a month to beta test, and that just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel good to me. Heck, even when they aren\u2019t flat wrong, they\u2019re not much more useful than the generic, non-AI descriptors of \u201cPerson,\u201d \u201cPerson with Package,\u201d or \u201cActivity or animal\u201d of the subscription-free experience. Also, AI video search might be very cool, but as the Reolink Elite shows, you can get similar AI search from an on-device AI model. Like with local video storage, it feels like Google could make a camera with on-device AI search for free, and just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it because, well, more money via subscriptions is better than less money without them. The Google Nest Doorbell (wired, 3rd gen) serves a pretty specific niche\u00e2\u0080\u0094people heavily invested in the Google Home ecosystem\u00e2\u0080\u0094very well. If you have a home full of Google Nest speakers and smart displays and you love using Google Gemini for things, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably like the Nest Doorbell. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already paying for a spendy Google Home Premium plan and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a Nest Doorbell or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only got the first-generation model, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a no-brainer. But for anyone else, the Nest Doorbell isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meaningfully useful on its own, and the Google Home Premium subscription is a raw deal at a time when your weary dollar won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go as far as it used to. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to feel good about paying $20 a month for useless AI summaries, or for AI-written notifications that can be slightly more helpful than generic \u00e2\u0080\u009cperson spotted\u00e2\u0080\u009d alerts when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m canceling streaming services to save money. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d much rather buy one of the many cheaper alternative video doorbells that offer local video storage and reactivate my Netflix account for a couple more months with the money I saved.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture believes it\u2019s changing the world for the better. But in reality its culture is deeply unethical since it institutionalises theft on a global scale. Silicon Valley\u2019s startup culture believes it\u2019s changing the world for the better. But in reality its culture is deeply unethical since it institutionalises theft on a global scale.  Google, the Silicon Valley company par excellence, proclaimed to \u201corganise the world\u2019s information\u201d and adopted \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d as its corporate motto. And what could possibly be wrong with such aspirations? Indeed, most company leaders and high-tech workers, in the Valley, genuinely believe they are \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d while also making money. Silicon Valley is the progressive face of capitalism. We\u2019ve experienced it, intimately. Billions of people, across the globe, enjoy real benefits from searching the world\u2019s information, connecting with people across time and space, and carrying a supercomputers in their pockets. Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t obviously throw workers into factories and mines for endless hours on low pay; such images are hidden, rendered distant by the supply chain . Instead, the Valley, in our imaginations, is populated by knowledge workers, a diverse and smart workforce that designs, solves, and codes in humane office spaces, with above average wages, ping pong, cafeterias, flexible working hours, sleeping cubicles. What\u2019s not to like? We could consider the Valley\u2019s hidden workers, those who clean, wait tables, wash cars, nanny, deliver packages, tend gardens, fix infrastructure for poverty wages; we could explore the trailer parks down the road from Google HQ, or document the shootings in the streets, the homeless that push shopping trolleys up and down the El Camino, their world a bundle of rags; or the gun shops that sell semi-automatics, the out-of-control, over-staffed police, armed with military-grade cast-me-downs, that regularly gun down the poor; the families crowded into small apartments, the father who spends his days scouring trash bins for recyclable bottles to trade for cash, the human trafficking of women, the prostitution, coerced to serve a predominately male workforce; or the disciplining and harassment of the undocumented, the deportations, the splitting up and destruction of families; or the local charities that collect food for kids, during seasonal holidays, since outside of school time their families cannot provide; or the extraordinarily high incarceration rates that control the surplus labour force, the armed guards on campuses and in schools, office complexes and shop interiors; or the poverty, the child who cannot concentrate in class since their teeth are rotting in their mouth, the extreme and devastating inequalities in wealth and income, the untreated illnesses and injuries, for lack of medical access, the widespread use of antidepressants, the addictions, the dispossessed, the broken dreams and the crying \u2026  Yet these symptoms of a broken and decaying society are studiously ignored, repressed, unmentioned by Silicon Valley\u2019s middle and upper classes. Psychological repression is widespread amongst the highly paid of the Valley. It\u2019s a defence: it\u2019s just too damn painful to contemplate the full horror of social reality. And life can be organised to avoid it, or deny it. So many don\u2019t even notice. I could mention all the evil business models, where vast computing power and fancy algorithms trawl our digital footprints to track and surveil, to sell and manipulate, to intensify our addictions; and we might reflect on the Valley\u2019s enormous and continuing contributions to building military  machines that rain down death and destruction.  Instead, here, in this article, I want to point to the root problem, the ultimate source of evil, and explain why Silicon Valley is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Valley\u2019s movers and shakers believe they are progressive, that entrepreneurial capitalism is the road to utopia. But it\u2019s not. In fact, the opposite is the case: the Valley is a cause of this horror, of the social ills, and the social breakdown that it must repress: it is both responsible and culpable for creating a dystopia. I want all the talented, hopeful, optimistic high-tech workers, who genuinely want to make the world a better place, who are about to found a new and exciting startup, to just take a short pause, to stop, look around, think, reflect and reconsider: the kind of firm you incorporate, the institutional rules you adopt, is precisely the choice point between doing evil and doing good. I will try to explain. My apologies if it takes a little while, since if the following facts were readily understood and generally accepted, then Silicon Valley would already be good, not evil, and I wouldn\u2019t need to explain. Silicon Valley: midwife of the capitalist firm The Valley is all about startups. They spring up all the time. New exciting and hopeful adventures. It\u2019s like forming a band, but better. In huge, mature corporations the social relations of production are obscured by layers of hierarchy and absentee ownership. But in a startup the power relations are direct and visible, and often share an office with you. You can observe the basic unit of production in capitalism\u2014the capitalist firm\u2014as if under a microscope. Let\u2019s lay out the property relations of a (slightly simplified) typical startup.  The startup has owner(s), usually \u201chigh net worth\u201d individuals, either directly present or indirectly in the form of venture capital firms. Venture capital provides the initial funds for the new venture. The actual founders, the ones with the ideas and talent, but no money, also part own the firm. The divvying up of the initial share issue between founders and early investors is a detail. The founders, armed with a new injection of capital, then recruit workers by convincing them of \u201cthe vision\u201d. These are the first employees. And off we go.  The owner(s) of the startup are in complete control, and their decisions are final. Owners can promote, demote, hire and fire anyone, at any time. Owners set wage levels, which are kept secret (and the workers, being earnest and highly disciplined, avoid this subject with each other\u2014that would break a taboo). Startups are definitely not run on democratic lines: workers don\u2019t get to appoint managers, set strategy, or distribute profits. Instead, the startup is a mini dictatorship: sure, there\u2019s plenty of technical debate, and back-and-forth, and head scratching, but ultimately it\u2019s a dictatorship. The owners pays all input costs\u2014such as office rental, computers, electricity and heating, labour etc. They own all outputs, such as new software or hardware, and any inventions (which, in the Valley, are aggressively patented). The owners are liable for any profits and losses of the company. The startup\u2019s bank accounts are hidden from the workers, and out of their control. This basic social relation\u2014between profit-taking capitalist owners and wage-earning workers\u2014is constitutive of capitalism. For example, today you can travel to Shropshire, England, and visit Ironbridge village, one of the birthplaces of the industrial revolution and \u201cthe silicon valley of the 1800s\u201d. You can tour an early ironworks and see the great furnaces where workers toiled, the tiny administrative office (to dole out wages, and keep accounts), and nearby, on a large hill overlooking the site, the capitalists\u2019 large and imposing mansions. The form may have changed, but not the content. In this sense, Silicon Valley is deeply conservative. It proclaims to disrupt everything, and make all fresh, new and shiny\u2014except this basic social relationship. Almost all Silicon Valley workers accept these social relations as entirely natural, acceptable, and pretty much fair and equitable. The owners fund the company. They therefore \u201cown the firm\u201d. The owners risk a lot of capital, and the workers receive a good wage, based on supply and demand in the marketplace, plus some ramp-up time to try and invent new stuff, which is fun. What\u2019s not to like? What\u2019s the problem? Silicon Valley: it\u2019s theft all the way down Startups reproduce, in embryo form, the wage system, where the capitalist owner hires-in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. In a capitalist firm, labour is just an another ex ante cost of production. The workers mix their labour with inputs and produce an output for sale. Normally, firms sell at prices that exceed their costs of production, which includes the cost of used-up inputs, rent, interest on capital loans, and wage costs etc. Any residual income then gets distributed as profit to the owner, or owners, of the firm. Imagine that you and I agree to exchange something in the marketplace, say a second-hand iPhone on Ebay. You get the money, I get an iPhone. You may get a good deal, or I may get a good deal, depending on our \u201chiggling and haggling\u201d in the marketplace. Whether a fair price is struck, or not, there\u2019s an exchange of something for something: some goods for some money. This social transaction satisfies a \u201cprinciple of exchange\u201d. We\u2019ve swapped stuff, and no-one forced us to. But let\u2019s say I just took the iPhone from you. And you received no money at all. This violates the principle of exchange. I got something for nothing: some goods, some resources, for free. That\u2019s theft. Obviously so. All startups in Silicon Valley violate the principle of exchange and institute a system of theft. They are theft-based institutions. If the startup is successful and grows, so does the theft, since theft is baked into the institutional structure of the firm, right from the get go. If the startup goes global, like an Apple, Facebook, or Google, then the cancer spreads and the theft takes place on a global scale. But the theft is hidden. We need some reflection to really see it. The workers in a startup are the actual cause of any profits it makes. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment: imagine the workers stopped working. Would the firm have any possibility of making a profit, or if already profitable, continue to make that profit? But we don\u2019t need to imagine. This is called a strike. And owners hate it, since it kills their profit. So, in any company, including a startup, the workers create the value.  What, then, do the owners contribute or create? The owners, or venture capitalists, contribute capital. They advance money to fund the startup until it (hopefully) starts making money. And then they expect a return. Since they\u2019ve given something they should definitely get something back, otherwise we violate the principle of exchange. In fact, they should expect repayment of the sums advanced and\u2014let\u2019s be generous here\u2014also a risk premium (since most startups fail without making profit) and, also\u2014in order to be really straight and fair about this\u2014some collateral as security (such as first dibs on any outstanding assets if the venture fails). This seems like a fair exchange. It is. So far so good.  But if early investors merely did this\u2014that is, simply advance some loan capital\u2014they would not become the owners of the firm. Once the startup made money, the loan would be repaid (by the firm), and the early investors would have no further claims on the fruits of others\u2019 labour (that is the value created by the workers). The important point is this: loan capital does not violate the principle of exchange. But Silicon Valley startups are not funded by loan capital. Venture capitalists want, and get, much more than this. They advance capital to a firm, but in addition to being repaid, they demand ownership of the firm, i.e. equity capital, and receive stock (shares in the firm). And so they \u201cown the firm\u201d. In consequence, once their initial loan and risk premium is repaid, they get even more: they retain a claim on the firm\u2019s future income, that is the fruits of others\u2019 labour in perpetuity (or until the firm dissolves, or they sell their shares etc.) And the mere legal ownership of a firm is sufficient to lay claim on its profit. And, right here, is precisely the moment when the principle of exchange is violated. Once the firm repays its debt then the early investors are now made whole. Beyond this point, we have workers creating profits, and owners appropriating that profit without needing to contribute an hour of their time, or a dime from their pockets. The owners are getting something for nothing. The owners can, as John Stuart Mill put it: \u201cgrow richer, as it were in their sleep\u201d. There\u2019s no exchange. Just appropriation. And that is what\u2019s commonly, and accurately, called economic exploitation. The important point is this: equity capital violates the principle of exchange.  Sometimes the meaning of a social situation can suddenly flip. You notice something new, like an object in the wrong place, or a small inconsistency that points to a secret, or a lie. This is one of those occasions. There\u2019s an enormous difference between advancing capital to a firm, and owning a firm. This vital distinction is conspicuously absent from all the upbeat, world-changing, and progressive chit-chat in the coffee shops, restaurants, offices and homes of Silicon Valley. So let\u2019s pretend they might be listening, that all their chatter stops, just for a moment, and we whisper into each and every individual ear: equity capital is theft.  When you take profits, but contribute nothing to the output of a firm, other than holding a paper claim, you are stealing. Yet this is how startups in Silicon Valley are organised. Cohort after cohort of \u201csmart\u201d groups of highly educated workers are quite happy to sign up to their own exploitation, and cede control over how they organise their working day, and what they produce. The most effective prison is the one you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re in. But hold on. Look, we\u2019ve woken the libertarian consciousness of Silicon Valley, and its rationality is strong and terrible: those that were whispered to have been stirred, and they reply, in unison: No-one forces workers to accept these terms, and the wage contract is voluntary, and therefore perfectly OK! Go away, annoying socialist, and stop spoiling our fun! Silicon Valley: forcing people to sell their labour Do workers freely enter into the wage contract? Do founders, with great ideas, have the freedom to start new commercial ventures that aren\u2019t based on theft? To answer, let\u2019s first define non-exploitative social relations of production. In principle, Silicon Valley startups could be incorporated as profit-sharing worker cooperatives. In this type of institution, all working members share the profit, which is democratically distributed. So if you join the co-op, you get a say, and you get profit shares. If you leave, you don\u2019t anymore. The firm is collectively owned by its current working members. Worker co-ops don\u2019t hire in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. They do the opposite. They hire-in capital at a pre-agreed rental price (i.e., raise loan capital not equity capital). So capital, not labour, is merely another ex ante cost of production with no claim on the residual income of the firm.1 In a democratic worker co-op, the principle of exchange is not violated, and no-one systematically exploits others and steals the value they (jointly) created. Clearly, this is a more lucrative deal for workers: profit-sharing is better than a wage. So why doesn\u2019t this happen in the Valley? Why don\u2019t lots of workers incorporate worker co-ops?  There are some carrots and a stick. The carrot: join us, join us! High-tech workers, especially those with in-demand skills, get more than wages, they get stock options. A stock option bestows the right to purchase company shares at a (very low) predefined price. You have to work, normally for many years, before you can exercise that right. The aim is worker retention, and align incentives so workers are motivated to create profits \u201cfor the company\u201d. Stock options, in a sense, automatically bestow the material benefits of trade unionism without the need to organise. Any worker is, of course, glad of this potential source of additional income. But stock options, when exercised, are equity capital and confer (part) ownership of the firm: and, as we\u2019ve seen, that fundamentally means participating in theft. Stock options, therefore, invite a section of the working class to join the elevated ranks of the capitalist class, and start exploiting others\u2019 labour. (In practice, most stock options turn out worthless, since most new ventures fail. But it\u2019s the hope that motivates). In a small startup, as is common in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s especially clear that the workers create all the added value. But the owner(s) appropriate it. So even the best educated minds start to notice. And this doesn\u2019t seem entirely fair. So stock options function to muddy the waters, and paper over the inconvenient truth of exploitation. So that\u2019s one carrot, which pushes high-tech workers to sign-up to a capitalist firm. But there are more. If a group of workers decide to incorporate a new venture then, unless they are highly politically conscious and especially moral creatures, they will incorporate a capitalist firm, not a worker co-op. Why? Because you\u2019ll definitely make more money by owning a firm, paying others wages, and keeping the profit to yourself. Many startup founders in Silicon Valley know they\u2019re ripping off the workers they employ. They might soothe their guilt by pointing out they offer stock options, or throw themselves into libertarianism, which conveniently coincides with their material interests. But it\u2019s a fact that stock is normally heavily concentrated amongst a few early founders and venture capitalists. As time goes on, the founders contributions are eclipsed by the hired workers, and then it\u2019s just exploitation all down the line. The company is bought-out, the founders get their initial advances and more, and therefore cash in, and make their millions. But, in almost all cases, they did not contribute to the creation of that value\u2014they stole it from the workers they hired. So the wage contract is sweetened by stock options. That works. But the contract is only voluntary if the workers have other options, if they have a choice. Do they? The stick: reproduce capitalism or wither and die But there are sticks too, which remove all choice, and prevent founders from incorporating worker co-operatives, even if they were sufficiently politically conscious to want to.  Silicon Valley is famous for its vibrant and extensive venture capital community. Plenty of capital swills around, continually searching, like Sauron\u2019s great eye, for the latest hit company to fund, and therefore own and exploit the efforts and creativity of hundreds and thousands of workers. Any venture capitalist, quite naturally, wants to maximise their returns. So, if faced with a choice between funding two companies, A and B, where A is a capitalist firm, and therefore offers equity in return for capital, whereas B is a worker co-op, and only offers interest repayments in return for capital, then the venture capitalist will always opt to fund A. No contest. Equity capital is strictly a better deal than loan capital. (And it\u2019s not just more money, but also top-down dictatorial control of the company\u2019s direction, and the working conditions and wage levels of employees. And being powerful is much more fun than being powerless. It\u2019s great for the ego.) Hence worker co-ops don\u2019t get funded in Silicon Valley, and never will. So all those talented and creative workers, with good ideas for making things that people want, have no choice but to incorporate a capitalist firm, and begin sorting people into a class of owners, and a class of workers. I witnessed an especially ugly example at an Silicon Valley business conference. An \u201cAngel Investor\u201d (someone who provides early seed capital) presented a talk about the criteria they apply when deciding which new ventures to invest in, and therefore what aspiring founders should do in order to maximise their chances of raising capital. A big factor, for the Angel, was that founders also raise money from friends and family, since \u201cthe desire to not disappoint loved ones is a great stimulant to hard work\u201d. The Angel gave examples of \u201cgreat stories\u201d about teams they\u2019d funded and the great returns made \u201cby everybody\u201d. At the close the Angel invited any founders in the audience to come and pitch their ideas to him\u2014right there and then. A line of about twenty or so young people formed in front of the Angel, desperate to get funding for their cherished ideas. And there it was, like a frozen scene from a perverted nativity: an anointed minority of one, with the monopoly on capital, and an unwashed majority, full of aspirations and creativity, lining up, cap-in-hand, to proffer the sacrifice of equity in their newborn, and surrender themselves to exploitation. There was no choice, there is no choice: either submit to capital or watch your ideas wither and die. There are no other practical ways to raise significant capital. Real Angels don\u2019t exist: those that ask only for their loan to be repaid, and not ownership of the firm; who reject the social relationship of equity capital, and therefore only invest in new ventures that incorporate as democratic worker-owned co-ops, so that all profit is shared, according to actual merit and contribution. If such fabled beings were present, the line before them would have been much, much longer. There is no choice. Founders must incorporate capitalist firms, and must rent-in labour. And workers, who need income, don\u2019t have the option to join a worker co-op. They must sign the wage contract. This isn\u2019t voluntary, it\u2019s coerced\u2014by those with the monopoly on capital. Silicon Valley culture celebrates venture capital, the Schumpeterian heroic entrepreneur, the dynamism of capitalism, and the gee-whiz technical and creative ideas of startup founders. But Silicon Valley repeatedly and continually reproduces exploitation, where some members of the firm own it, and others simply rent their labour to it. There\u2019s zero innovation or disruption in this sphere. The Valley is a great engine, churning out new companies, day after day, which reproduce the division between an economic class that wins, and an economic class that loses. Silicon Valley: arch promoter of extreme economic inequality Economic inequality has always been around. But notably, in the last 30 years or so, economic inequality, in the rich countries, has significantly increased. So we find people at the bottom struggling for food and shelter, while those at the top earn many years worth of the average salary while they sleep. The majority in the middle work hard yet lack savings, living their entire lives a few paychecks from destitution. Things have got so bad that even mainstream discourse has shifted to reflect the new reality. We\u2019re routinely told that millennials face low wages, poor quality jobs, high debt, and worse economic outcomes compared to their parents. People now accept that the political system is rigged by a rich elite who\u2019ve captured the institutions of the nation state. And even the arch conservative world of academic economics talks about inequality. And that simply didn\u2019t happen as recently as ten years ago. Bourgeois thinkers struggle to explain the major cause of economic inequality, because to do requires thinking deeply about property relations and the issue of systematic exploitation. Instead, they prefer to think about unequal human capital endowments, taxation policies, interest and growth rates, the saving habits of workers, rising costs in child and health care, or the impact of automation. They\u2019ll think about anything and everything except the actual reason for inequality. Capitalist firms, in an important sense, are social machines, institutions that operate within the context of a market economy to \u201csort\u201d individuals into different classes by means of the wage system. This sorting produces a very specific income and wealth distribution, which is peculiar to capitalism. Empirically, capitalist societies exhibit two distinct regimes: a lognormal distribution of wage income, and a Pareto distribution of profit income.2 In any dynamic society, with a continual reallocation of the division of labour as new skills are demanded and other skills are automated or changed, we should expect some level of wage inequality due to mismatches between supply and demand in the labour market. Also, some jobs are terrible and dangerous, and people should get more for risking more. And some people really do contribute more within the workplace, and its OK if they get additional awards from their peers, if only to make sure they stick around. And some people actually need more, perhaps due to illness or disabilities or additional domestic responsibilities. All this is fine. But, empirically, we see more than wage inequality. We see two distinct regimes. We see a majority earning wages, at the bottom of the scale, and a minority taking profits, at the top of the scale. Capitalist societies produce extreme inequalities where the top 10% or so take a big and disproportionate slice of the social pie. And the reason is obvious, for those willing to look: the major cause of economic inequality is the wage system itself. The more workers a capitalist exploits the more profit they make. The more profit they make the more workers they can exploit. And capitalists in the super-rich bracket enjoy positive feedback effects. They can hardly lose. The economic game is entirely rigged in their favour. And, in this elevated state, they fall asleep, wake up the next morning, having earned more than workers do in their entire lifetimes. In fact, the inequality between capitalists far exceeds the inequality between workers. The super-rich become astronomically rich as we bounce along the power-law tail of the Pareto distribution. The astronomically rich capture ostensibly democratic institutions, a phenomenon that is particularly clear in the USA, so that even mild social reforms are off the table. We\u2019ve seen a collection of post-war policies, that once mitigated economic inequality, ditched in the last thirty years or so. This is why things have got even worse. Economic exploitation has increased. Extreme economic inequality causes untold misery. At the top we see excessive and wasteful hyper-consumption. At the bottom, countless everyday struggles to live a dignified life. All the social ills of Silicon Valley, many of which are hidden in plain sight, are suffered mostly by the poorly paid, those with the least money. But inequality affects everyone. Societies with high Gini coefficients do worse on almost all measures of social well-being. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Let\u2019s imagine an impossible event, just for the sake of illustrating a point. Imagine that all the people we whispered to\u2014in the cafes, the offices and homes of Silicon Valley\u2014actually listened, and decided, right there and then, to abolish exploitation, and resolved, with great determination, to only ever incorporate worker co-ops, and only lend capital, and never demand equity, then\u2014with one decisive and unlikely step\u2014Silicon Valley would actually begin to do good. Because it\u2019s at this precise pivotal moment\u2014the birth of a new productive unit\u2014that a society\u2019s social relations of production either get reproduced, or changed. For once you start to abolish the wage contract, and the renting of human beings, you start to abolish economic classes and extreme income inequality. Wealth would then start to be shared more equitably, and fairly, upon the principle of exchange, according to actual contributions to production, and not specious paper claims. The Pareto upper-regime would lose its material basis, would totter and fall, and therewith all the power that goes with it, the ability to capture and corrupt democracies and run them for the benefit of a privileged and undeserving few. The majority of the population would have more, enjoy more, and live better. You know, perhaps some really gifted entrepreneurs could figure out a way to export this culture, and good social outcomes, to the rest of the world.  Silicon Valley: bullshit progressivism But sadly, as of today, that is a dream. And it\u2019s not even a dream that\u2019s widely shared. Silicon Valley does not see the connection between the kinds of firms it funds and creates, and the kinds of social ills that surround it. But why single out Silicon Valley? What I\u2019ve just described applies to capitalism in general. Silicon Valley deserves especial opprobrium because the contradiction between its self-image and its reality is particularly stark. Silicon Valley desperately, desperately wants to view itself, and be seen as, socially progressive, enlightened, cutting-edge and, yes, utopian. But despite the explosion of ideas and firms, and the progressive rhetoric, the core propositions of capitalism are completely untouched, inviolate. The coupling of radical technical experimentation, with extreme conservation of capitalist property relations, has been a very successful recipe for the Valley\u2019s elite. But the very startups that want to \u201cchange the world for the better\u201d immediately reproduce economic exploitation: they separate human beings into a class that must rent their labour, and a class that appropriates the fruits of that labour; a class that is disciplined and must do as they are told in the workplace, and a class that disciplines and commands without democratic control. Every time an optimistic and earnest group of workers, with some great ideas, incorporate a startup and issue equity, any progressive content of those ideas are irreparably harmed. Yet this is the specific evil that Silicon Valley does: it funnels the progressive content of technical utopianism (the increase in the forces of production) into institutions that exploit workers on a global scale, and contribute to extreme economic inequality (the existing social relations of production). Silicon Valley helps produce the dystopia we live in. It doesn\u2019t change the world for the better. It makes it worse, every single day. The narcissistic self-image of Valley culture contributes to its political backwardness. Some workers celebrate a victory when corporate HR departments commit to diversity in the workplace, or promise to address the gender pay gap. But these are easy concessions for capitalism, softballs, and the owners of your firm will happily accommodate you. Just don\u2019t ask for bottom-up democracy in the workplace, or profit-sharing. Try it. You\u2019ll get a very different response. But that\u2019s what I do wish for. And I\u2019m talking to you now, fellow workers of the Valley! If you really want to do no evil, to be good, disrupt the status quo and make the world a better place, then don\u2019t create a capitalist firm: it\u2019s a top-down dictatorship, where the dictators steal the money. There\u2019s nothing progressive about this kind of social institution. Founding such a startup is deeply unethical, represents institutionalised theft, and is a prime cause of diverse social ills.  Instead, use your talents to create democratic worker-owned cooperatives, based on equality among its working members; or help think of creative ways to solve the political problem of capitalists\u2019 monopoly on capital.3 Abolishing economic exploitation genuinely makes the world a better place. Reproducing it in your startup does not.

And what could possibly be wrong with such aspirations? Indeed, most company leaders and high-tech workers, in the Valley, genuinely believe they are \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d while also making money. Silicon Valley is the progressive face of capitalism. We\u2019ve experienced it, intimately. Billions of people, across the globe, enjoy real benefits from searching the world\u2019s information, connecting with people across time and space, and carrying a supercomputers in their pockets. Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t obviously throw workers into factories and mines for endless hours on low pay; such images are hidden, rendered distant by the supply chain . Instead, the Valley, in our imaginations, is populated by knowledge workers, a diverse and smart workforce that designs, solves, and codes in humane office spaces, with above average wages, ping pong, cafeterias, flexible working hours, sleeping cubicles. What\u2019s not to like? We could consider the Valley\u2019s hidden workers, those who clean, wait tables, wash cars, nanny, deliver packages, tend gardens, fix infrastructure for poverty wages; we could explore the trailer parks down the road from Google HQ, or document the shootings in the streets, the homeless that push shopping trolleys up and down the El Camino, their world a bundle of rags; or the gun shops that sell semi-automatics, the out-of-control, over-staffed police, armed with military-grade cast-me-downs, that regularly gun down the poor; the families crowded into small apartments, the father who spends his days scouring trash bins for recyclable bottles to trade for cash, the human trafficking of women, the prostitution, coerced to serve a predominately male workforce; or the disciplining and harassment of the undocumented, the deportations, the splitting up and destruction of families; or the local charities that collect food for kids, during seasonal holidays, since outside of school time their families cannot provide; or the extraordinarily high incarceration rates that control the surplus labour force, the armed guards on campuses and in schools, office complexes and shop interiors; or the poverty, the child who cannot concentrate in class since their teeth are rotting in their mouth, the extreme and devastating inequalities in wealth and income, the untreated illnesses and injuries, for lack of medical access, the widespread use of antidepressants, the addictions, the dispossessed, the broken dreams and the crying \u2026  Yet these symptoms of a broken and decaying society are studiously ignored, repressed, unmentioned by Silicon Valley\u2019s middle and upper classes. Psychological repression is widespread amongst the highly paid of the Valley. It\u2019s a defence: it\u2019s just too damn painful to contemplate the full horror of social reality. And life can be organised to avoid it, or deny it. So many don\u2019t even notice. I could mention all the evil business models, where vast computing power and fancy algorithms trawl our digital footprints to track and surveil, to sell and manipulate, to intensify our addictions; and we might reflect on the Valley\u2019s enormous and continuing contributions to building military  machines that rain down death and destruction.  Instead, here, in this article, I want to point to the root problem, the ultimate source of evil, and explain why Silicon Valley is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Valley\u2019s movers and shakers believe they are progressive, that entrepreneurial capitalism is the road to utopia. But it\u2019s not. In fact, the opposite is the case: the Valley is a cause of this horror, of the social ills, and the social breakdown that it must repress: it is both responsible and culpable for creating a dystopia. I want all the talented, hopeful, optimistic high-tech workers, who genuinely want to make the world a better place, who are about to found a new and exciting startup, to just take a short pause, to stop, look around, think, reflect and reconsider: the kind of firm you incorporate, the institutional rules you adopt, is precisely the choice point between doing evil and doing good. I will try to explain. My apologies if it takes a little while, since if the following facts were readily understood and generally accepted, then Silicon Valley would already be good, not evil, and I wouldn\u2019t need to explain. The Valley is all about startups. They spring up all the time. New exciting and hopeful adventures. It\u2019s like forming a band, but better. In huge, mature corporations the social relations of production are obscured by layers of hierarchy and absentee ownership. But in a startup the power relations are direct and visible, and often share an office with you. You can observe the basic unit of production in capitalism\u2014the capitalist firm\u2014as if under a microscope. Let\u2019s lay out the property relations of a (slightly simplified) typical startup.  The startup has owner(s), usually \u201chigh net worth\u201d individuals, either directly present or indirectly in the form of venture capital firms. Venture capital provides the initial funds for the new venture. The actual founders, the ones with the ideas and talent, but no money, also part own the firm. The divvying up of the initial share issue between founders and early investors is a detail. The founders, armed with a new injection of capital, then recruit workers by convincing them of \u201cthe vision\u201d. These are the first employees. And off we go.  The owner(s) of the startup are in complete control, and their decisions are final. Owners can promote, demote, hire and fire anyone, at any time. Owners set wage levels, which are kept secret (and the workers, being earnest and highly disciplined, avoid this subject with each other\u2014that would break a taboo). Startups are definitely not run on democratic lines: workers don\u2019t get to appoint managers, set strategy, or distribute profits. Instead, the startup is a mini dictatorship: sure, there\u2019s plenty of technical debate, and back-and-forth, and head scratching, but ultimately it\u2019s a dictatorship. The owners pays all input costs\u2014such as office rental, computers, electricity and heating, labour etc. They own all outputs, such as new software or hardware, and any inventions (which, in the Valley, are aggressively patented). The owners are liable for any profits and losses of the company. The startup\u2019s bank accounts are hidden from the workers, and out of their control. This basic social relation\u2014between profit-taking capitalist owners and wage-earning workers\u2014is constitutive of capitalism. For example, today you can travel to Shropshire, England, and visit Ironbridge village, one of the birthplaces of the industrial revolution and \u201cthe silicon valley of the 1800s\u201d. You can tour an early ironworks and see the great furnaces where workers toiled, the tiny administrative office (to dole out wages, and keep accounts), and nearby, on a large hill overlooking the site, the capitalists\u2019 large and imposing mansions. The form may have changed, but not the content. In this sense, Silicon Valley is deeply conservative. It proclaims to disrupt everything, and make all fresh, new and shiny\u2014except this basic social relationship. Almost all Silicon Valley workers accept these social relations as entirely natural, acceptable, and pretty much fair and equitable. The owners fund the company. They therefore \u201cown the firm\u201d. The owners risk a lot of capital, and the workers receive a good wage, based on supply and demand in the marketplace, plus some ramp-up time to try and invent new stuff, which is fun. What\u2019s not to like? What\u2019s the problem? Startups reproduce, in embryo form, the wage system, where the capitalist owner hires-in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. In a capitalist firm, labour is just an another ex ante cost of production. The workers mix their labour with inputs and produce an output for sale. Normally, firms sell at prices that exceed their costs of production, which includes the cost of used-up inputs, rent, interest on capital loans, and wage costs etc. Any residual income then gets distributed as profit to the owner, or owners, of the firm. Imagine that you and I agree to exchange something in the marketplace, say a second-hand iPhone on Ebay. You get the money, I get an iPhone. You may get a good deal, or I may get a good deal, depending on our \u201chiggling and haggling\u201d in the marketplace. Whether a fair price is struck, or not, there\u2019s an exchange of something for something: some goods for some money. This social transaction satisfies a \u201cprinciple of exchange\u201d. We\u2019ve swapped stuff, and no-one forced us to. But let\u2019s say I just took the iPhone from you. And you received no money at all. This violates the principle of exchange. I got something for nothing: some goods, some resources, for free. That\u2019s theft. Obviously so. All startups in Silicon Valley violate the principle of exchange and institute a system of theft. They are theft-based institutions. If the startup is successful and grows, so does the theft, since theft is baked into the institutional structure of the firm, right from the get go. If the startup goes global, like an Apple, Facebook, or Google, then the cancer spreads and the theft takes place on a global scale. But the theft is hidden. We need some reflection to really see it. The workers in a startup are the actual cause of any profits it makes. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment: imagine the workers stopped working. Would the firm have any possibility of making a profit, or if already profitable, continue to make that profit? But we don\u2019t need to imagine. This is called a strike. And owners hate it, since it kills their profit. So, in any company, including a startup, the workers create the value.  What, then, do the owners contribute or create? The owners, or venture capitalists, contribute capital. They advance money to fund the startup until it (hopefully) starts making money. And then they expect a return. Since they\u2019ve given something they should definitely get something back, otherwise we violate the principle of exchange. In fact, they should expect repayment of the sums advanced and\u2014let\u2019s be generous here\u2014also a risk premium (since most startups fail without making profit) and, also\u2014in order to be really straight and fair about this\u2014some collateral as security (such as first dibs on any outstanding assets if the venture fails). This seems like a fair exchange. It is. So far so good.  But if early investors merely did this\u2014that is, simply advance some loan capital\u2014they would not become the owners of the firm. Once the startup made money, the loan would be repaid (by the firm), and the early investors would have no further claims on the fruits of others\u2019 labour (that is the value created by the workers). The important point is this: loan capital does not violate the principle of exchange. But Silicon Valley startups are not funded by loan capital. Venture capitalists want, and get, much more than this. They advance capital to a firm, but in addition to being repaid, they demand ownership of the firm, i.e. equity capital, and receive stock (shares in the firm). And so they \u201cown the firm\u201d. In consequence, once their initial loan and risk premium is repaid, they get even more: they retain a claim on the firm\u2019s future income, that is the fruits of others\u2019 labour in perpetuity (or until the firm dissolves, or they sell their shares etc.) And the mere legal ownership of a firm is sufficient to lay claim on its profit. And, right here, is precisely the moment when the principle of exchange is violated. Once the firm repays its debt then the early investors are now made whole. Beyond this point, we have workers creating profits, and owners appropriating that profit without needing to contribute an hour of their time, or a dime from their pockets. The owners are getting something for nothing. The owners can, as John Stuart Mill put it: \u201cgrow richer, as it were in their sleep\u201d. There\u2019s no exchange. Just appropriation. And that is what\u2019s commonly, and accurately, called economic exploitation. The important point is this: equity capital violates the principle of exchange.  Sometimes the meaning of a social situation can suddenly flip. You notice something new, like an object in the wrong place, or a small inconsistency that points to a secret, or a lie. This is one of those occasions. There\u2019s an enormous difference between advancing capital to a firm, and owning a firm. This vital distinction is conspicuously absent from all the upbeat, world-changing, and progressive chit-chat in the coffee shops, restaurants, offices and homes of Silicon Valley. So let\u2019s pretend they might be listening, that all their chatter stops, just for a moment, and we whisper into each and every individual ear: equity capital is theft.  When you take profits, but contribute nothing to the output of a firm, other than holding a paper claim, you are stealing. Yet this is how startups in Silicon Valley are organised. Cohort after cohort of \u201csmart\u201d groups of highly educated workers are quite happy to sign up to their own exploitation, and cede control over how they organise their working day, and what they produce. The most effective prison is the one you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re in. But hold on. Look, we\u2019ve woken the libertarian consciousness of Silicon Valley, and its rationality is strong and terrible: those that were whispered to have been stirred, and they reply, in unison: No-one forces workers to accept these terms, and the wage contract is voluntary, and therefore perfectly OK! Go away, annoying socialist, and stop spoiling our fun! Do workers freely enter into the wage contract? Do founders, with great ideas, have the freedom to start new commercial ventures that aren\u2019t based on theft? To answer, let\u2019s first define non-exploitative social relations of production. In principle, Silicon Valley startups could be incorporated as profit-sharing worker cooperatives. In this type of institution, all working members share the profit, which is democratically distributed. So if you join the co-op, you get a say, and you get profit shares. If you leave, you don\u2019t anymore. The firm is collectively owned by its current working members. Worker co-ops don\u2019t hire in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. They do the opposite. They hire-in capital at a pre-agreed rental price (i.e., raise loan capital not equity capital). So capital, not labour, is merely another ex ante cost of production with no claim on the residual income of the firm.1 In a democratic worker co-op, the principle of exchange is not violated, and no-one systematically exploits others and steals the value they (jointly) created. Clearly, this is a more lucrative deal for workers: profit-sharing is better than a wage. So why doesn\u2019t this happen in the Valley? Why don\u2019t lots of workers incorporate worker co-ops?  There are some carrots and a stick. High-tech workers, especially those with in-demand skills, get more than wages, they get stock options. A stock option bestows the right to purchase company shares at a (very low) predefined price. You have to work, normally for many years, before you can exercise that right. The aim is worker retention, and align incentives so workers are motivated to create profits \u201cfor the company\u201d. Stock options, in a sense, automatically bestow the material benefits of trade unionism without the need to organise. Any worker is, of course, glad of this potential source of additional income. But stock options, when exercised, are equity capital and confer (part) ownership of the firm: and, as we\u2019ve seen, that fundamentally means participating in theft. Stock options, therefore, invite a section of the working class to join the elevated ranks of the capitalist class, and start exploiting others\u2019 labour. (In practice, most stock options turn out worthless, since most new ventures fail. But it\u2019s the hope that motivates). In a small startup, as is common in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s especially clear that the workers create all the added value. But the owner(s) appropriate it. So even the best educated minds start to notice. And this doesn\u2019t seem entirely fair. So stock options function to muddy the waters, and paper over the inconvenient truth of exploitation. So that\u2019s one carrot, which pushes high-tech workers to sign-up to a capitalist firm. But there are more. If a group of workers decide to incorporate a new venture then, unless they are highly politically conscious and especially moral creatures, they will incorporate a capitalist firm, not a worker co-op. Why? Because you\u2019ll definitely make more money by owning a firm, paying others wages, and keeping the profit to yourself. Many startup founders in Silicon Valley know they\u2019re ripping off the workers they employ. They might soothe their guilt by pointing out they offer stock options, or throw themselves into libertarianism, which conveniently coincides with their material interests. But it\u2019s a fact that stock is normally heavily concentrated amongst a few early founders and venture capitalists. As time goes on, the founders contributions are eclipsed by the hired workers, and then it\u2019s just exploitation all down the line. The company is bought-out, the founders get their initial advances and more, and therefore cash in, and make their millions. But, in almost all cases, they did not contribute to the creation of that value\u2014they stole it from the workers they hired. So the wage contract is sweetened by stock options. That works. But the contract is only voluntary if the workers have other options, if they have a choice. Do they? But there are sticks too, which remove all choice, and prevent founders from incorporating worker co-operatives, even if they were sufficiently politically conscious to want to.  Silicon Valley is famous for its vibrant and extensive venture capital community. Plenty of capital swills around, continually searching, like Sauron\u2019s great eye, for the latest hit company to fund, and therefore own and exploit the efforts and creativity of hundreds and thousands of workers. Any venture capitalist, quite naturally, wants to maximise their returns. So, if faced with a choice between funding two companies, A and B, where A is a capitalist firm, and therefore offers equity in return for capital, whereas B is a worker co-op, and only offers interest repayments in return for capital, then the venture capitalist will always opt to fund A. No contest. Equity capital is strictly a better deal than loan capital. (And it\u2019s not just more money, but also top-down dictatorial control of the company\u2019s direction, and the working conditions and wage levels of employees. And being powerful is much more fun than being powerless. It\u2019s great for the ego.) Hence worker co-ops don\u2019t get funded in Silicon Valley, and never will. So all those talented and creative workers, with good ideas for making things that people want, have no choice but to incorporate a capitalist firm, and begin sorting people into a class of owners, and a class of workers. I witnessed an especially ugly example at an Silicon Valley business conference. An \u201cAngel Investor\u201d (someone who provides early seed capital) presented a talk about the criteria they apply when deciding which new ventures to invest in, and therefore what aspiring founders should do in order to maximise their chances of raising capital. A big factor, for the Angel, was that founders also raise money from friends and family, since \u201cthe desire to not disappoint loved ones is a great stimulant to hard work\u201d. The Angel gave examples of \u201cgreat stories\u201d about teams they\u2019d funded and the great returns made \u201cby everybody\u201d. At the close the Angel invited any founders in the audience to come and pitch their ideas to him\u2014right there and then. A line of about twenty or so young people formed in front of the Angel, desperate to get funding for their cherished ideas. And there it was, like a frozen scene from a perverted nativity: an anointed minority of one, with the monopoly on capital, and an unwashed majority, full of aspirations and creativity, lining up, cap-in-hand, to proffer the sacrifice of equity in their newborn, and surrender themselves to exploitation. There was no choice, there is no choice: either submit to capital or watch your ideas wither and die. There are no other practical ways to raise significant capital. Real Angels don\u2019t exist: those that ask only for their loan to be repaid, and not ownership of the firm; who reject the social relationship of equity capital, and therefore only invest in new ventures that incorporate as democratic worker-owned co-ops, so that all profit is shared, according to actual merit and contribution. If such fabled beings were present, the line before them would have been much, much longer. There is no choice. Founders must incorporate capitalist firms, and must rent-in labour. And workers, who need income, don\u2019t have the option to join a worker co-op. They must sign the wage contract. This isn\u2019t voluntary, it\u2019s coerced\u2014by those with the monopoly on capital. Silicon Valley culture celebrates venture capital, the Schumpeterian heroic entrepreneur, the dynamism of capitalism, and the gee-whiz technical and creative ideas of startup founders. But Silicon Valley repeatedly and continually reproduces exploitation, where some members of the firm own it, and others simply rent their labour to it. There\u2019s zero innovation or disruption in this sphere. The Valley is a great engine, churning out new companies, day after day, which reproduce the division between an economic class that wins, and an economic class that loses. Economic inequality has always been around. But notably, in the last 30 years or so, economic inequality, in the rich countries, has significantly increased. So we find people at the bottom struggling for food and shelter, while those at the top earn many years worth of the average salary while they sleep. The majority in the middle work hard yet lack savings, living their entire lives a few paychecks from destitution. Things have got so bad that even mainstream discourse has shifted to reflect the new reality. We\u2019re routinely told that millennials face low wages, poor quality jobs, high debt, and worse economic outcomes compared to their parents. People now accept that the political system is rigged by a rich elite who\u2019ve captured the institutions of the nation state. And even the arch conservative world of academic economics talks about inequality. And that simply didn\u2019t happen as recently as ten years ago. Bourgeois thinkers struggle to explain the major cause of economic inequality, because to do requires thinking deeply about property relations and the issue of systematic exploitation. Instead, they prefer to think about unequal human capital endowments, taxation policies, interest and growth rates, the saving habits of workers, rising costs in child and health care, or the impact of automation. They\u2019ll think about anything and everything except the actual reason for inequality. Capitalist firms, in an important sense, are social machines, institutions that operate within the context of a market economy to \u201csort\u201d individuals into different classes by means of the wage system. This sorting produces a very specific income and wealth distribution, which is peculiar to capitalism. Empirically, capitalist societies exhibit two distinct regimes: a lognormal distribution of wage income, and a Pareto distribution of profit income.2 In any dynamic society, with a continual reallocation of the division of labour as new skills are demanded and other skills are automated or changed, we should expect some level of wage inequality due to mismatches between supply and demand in the labour market. Also, some jobs are terrible and dangerous, and people should get more for risking more. And some people really do contribute more within the workplace, and its OK if they get additional awards from their peers, if only to make sure they stick around. And some people actually need more, perhaps due to illness or disabilities or additional domestic responsibilities. All this is fine. But, empirically, we see more than wage inequality. We see two distinct regimes. We see a majority earning wages, at the bottom of the scale, and a minority taking profits, at the top of the scale. Capitalist societies produce extreme inequalities where the top 10% or so take a big and disproportionate slice of the social pie. And the reason is obvious, for those willing to look: the major cause of economic inequality is the wage system itself. The more workers a capitalist exploits the more profit they make. The more profit they make the more workers they can exploit. And capitalists in the super-rich bracket enjoy positive feedback effects. They can hardly lose. The economic game is entirely rigged in their favour. And, in this elevated state, they fall asleep, wake up the next morning, having earned more than workers do in their entire lifetimes. In fact, the inequality between capitalists far exceeds the inequality between workers. The super-rich become astronomically rich as we bounce along the power-law tail of the Pareto distribution. The astronomically rich capture ostensibly democratic institutions, a phenomenon that is particularly clear in the USA, so that even mild social reforms are off the table. We\u2019ve seen a collection of post-war policies, that once mitigated economic inequality, ditched in the last thirty years or so. This is why things have got even worse. Economic exploitation has increased. Extreme economic inequality causes untold misery. At the top we see excessive and wasteful hyper-consumption. At the bottom, countless everyday struggles to live a dignified life. All the social ills of Silicon Valley, many of which are hidden in plain sight, are suffered mostly by the poorly paid, those with the least money. But inequality affects everyone. Societies with high Gini coefficients do worse on almost all measures of social well-being. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Let\u2019s imagine an impossible event, just for the sake of illustrating a point. Imagine that all the people we whispered to\u2014in the cafes, the offices and homes of Silicon Valley\u2014actually listened, and decided, right there and then, to abolish exploitation, and resolved, with great determination, to only ever incorporate worker co-ops, and only lend capital, and never demand equity, then\u2014with one decisive and unlikely step\u2014Silicon Valley would actually begin to do good. Because it\u2019s at this precise pivotal moment\u2014the birth of a new productive unit\u2014that a society\u2019s social relations of production either get reproduced, or changed. For once you start to abolish the wage contract, and the renting of human beings, you start to abolish economic classes and extreme income inequality. Wealth would then start to be shared more equitably, and fairly, upon the principle of exchange, according to actual contributions to production, and not specious paper claims. The Pareto upper-regime would lose its material basis, would totter and fall, and therewith all the power that goes with it, the ability to capture and corrupt democracies and run them for the benefit of a privileged and undeserving few. The majority of the population would have more, enjoy more, and live better. You know, perhaps some really gifted entrepreneurs could figure out a way to export this culture, and good social outcomes, to the rest of the world.  But sadly, as of today, that is a dream. And it\u2019s not even a dream that\u2019s widely shared. Silicon Valley does not see the connection between the kinds of firms it funds and creates, and the kinds of social ills that surround it. But why single out Silicon Valley? What I\u2019ve just described applies to capitalism in general. Silicon Valley deserves especial opprobrium because the contradiction between its self-image and its reality is particularly stark. Silicon Valley desperately, desperately wants to view itself, and be seen as, socially progressive, enlightened, cutting-edge and, yes, utopian. But despite the explosion of ideas and firms, and the progressive rhetoric, the core propositions of capitalism are completely untouched, inviolate. The coupling of radical technical experimentation, with extreme conservation of capitalist property relations, has been a very successful recipe for the Valley\u2019s elite. But the very startups that want to \u201cchange the world for the better\u201d immediately reproduce economic exploitation: they separate human beings into a class that must rent their labour, and a class that appropriates the fruits of that labour; a class that is disciplined and must do as they are told in the workplace, and a class that disciplines and commands without democratic control. Every time an optimistic and earnest group of workers, with some great ideas, incorporate a startup and issue equity, any progressive content of those ideas are irreparably harmed. Yet this is the specific evil that Silicon Valley does: it funnels the progressive content of technical utopianism (the increase in the forces of production) into institutions that exploit workers on a global scale, and contribute to extreme economic inequality (the existing social relations of production). Silicon Valley helps produce the dystopia we live in. It doesn\u2019t change the world for the better. It makes it worse, every single day. The narcissistic self-image of Valley culture contributes to its political backwardness. Some workers celebrate a victory when corporate HR departments commit to diversity in the workplace, or promise to address the gender pay gap. But these are easy concessions for capitalism, softballs, and the owners of your firm will happily accommodate you. Just don\u2019t ask for bottom-up democracy in the workplace, or profit-sharing. Try it. You\u2019ll get a very different response. But that\u2019s what I do wish for. And I\u2019m talking to you now, fellow workers of the Valley! If you really want to do no evil, to be good, disrupt the status quo and make the world a better place, then don\u2019t create a capitalist firm: it\u2019s a top-down dictatorship, where the dictators steal the money. There\u2019s nothing progressive about this kind of social institution. Founding such a startup is deeply unethical, represents institutionalised theft, and is a prime cause of diverse social ills.  Instead, use your talents to create democratic worker-owned cooperatives, based on equality among its working members; or help think of creative ways to solve the political problem of capitalists\u2019 monopoly on capital.3 Abolishing economic exploitation genuinely makes the world a better place. Reproducing it in your startup does not.

Space (or the universe as a whole) never ceases to amaze me, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same for everyone who likes looking up at the sky and wondering about all that could be out there. Well, a couple of us (humans) have actually been to the moon, and while the rest can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly visit it as of now, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a way to celebrate one of our biggest celestial achievements by bringing the iconic rover from the Apollo 17 mission home. Lego\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Technic NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV building set lets you build a detailed replica of the rover, plus includes a wealth of accessories to pay the mission a tribute. On a regular day, this set would run you around $220, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly budget-friendly, but that changes today. Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, you can grab it for $154, after a whopping 30% off its retail price. The discount is available to all shoppers, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a Prime member or not. There are no long coupons to worry about, and no complicated procedures to follow. The catch? The deal is selling out fast, which means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely going to wrap up soon. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a space freak, now is the time to build your very own collection of NASA-themed builds. Have an enthusiast in your life who just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop talking about all the cool possibilities out there? Gift it to them for holidays; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to make their entire year! See at Amazon At this point, I am convinced there is a Lego set for every cool thing that exists out there; which is a good thing. This set, in particular, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a small one. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting 1,913 pieces in total, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that overwhelm you. Building it is going to be fun, and you can even invite friends over to join the project! The model, once made, measures over 5.5 in. (14 cm) high, 15 in. (38 cm) long, and 10 in. (25 cm) wide, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be display-worthy. You will be building the main rover with its seats, steering, suspension, and scientific tools, plus three detailed equipment attachments. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a battery pack with heating and cooling elements, a dedicated communications unit, and even tools to collect the samples. You can attach all of these to the rover, or place them nearby; whichever you prefer. Lego even includes a model interpretation of the famous rock sample in the set! The attention to detail is truly impressive, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re literally getting everything that played a part in the mission. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite detailed on its own, but you can also pair it with the Lego Creator 31152 Space Astronaut set to create a bigger, more detailed display to appreciate our heroes. Like most Lego sets, this one comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If the book feels hard to follow, you can also install the Lego Builder app. This platform offers 3D instructions where you can zoom in from every angle, track your progress, save sets, and more. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more to like about this set, especially now that you can bring it home without paying the full price. The current Black Friday deal drops it to $154, which is quite affordable considering all that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last forever, though, which is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best to act fast to grab it.

Over-ear and noise-canceling headphones are not for everyone. Sure, these block all external noise for a more immersive experience, but if you prefer a more minimal design and like to stay aware of your surroundings, in-ear headphones can be a better fit for you. Best of all, now is a great time to treat yourself to a top-rated option without shelling out big bucks. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a week away, but you don\u2019t have to wait till then to start saving. Almost all big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart are offering plenty of early deals already, and we\u2019re spotting deep discounts on some of the best earbuds out there. Amazon, in particular, is being the most generous right now and has dropped the price of Shokz OpenFit 2 to just $125. That\u2019s after a nice 31% discount on the usual price of $180, and the deal applies to the black option. It\u2019s open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their orders, as well. If you\u2019re planning to grab yourself a pair, it\u2019s best to do it as soon as you can, as early deals tend to disappear fast. We\u2019re not expecting this one to last more than a couple of days. See at Amazon This pair is super lightweight and comfortable to wear. Each earbud weighs just 9.4g, and is designed using Shokz Ultra-Soft Silicon 2.0 for a natural fit.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"I\u2019m not saying this will definitely happen, but I think we could be on the cusp of a significant shift in Windows market share for consumer computers. It is not going to drop to 2% in a year or anything, but I feel like a few pieces are coming together that could move the needle in a way we have not seen in several decades. There are three things on my mind . Number one is that Microsoft just does not feel like a consumer tech company at all anymore. Yes, they have always been much more corporate than the likes of Apple or Google, but it really shows in the last few years as they seem to only have energy for AI and web services. If you are not a customer who is a major business or a developer creating the next AI-powered app, Microsoft does not seem to care about you. I just do not see excitement there. The only thing of note they have added to Windows in the last five years is Copilot, and I have yet to meet a normal human being who enjoys using it. And all the Windows 11 changes seem to have just gone over about as well as a lead balloon. I just do not think they care at all about Windows with consumers. The second thing is the affordable MacBook rumored to be coming out in 2026. This will be a meaningfully cheaper MacBook that people can purchase at price points that many Windows computers have been hovering around for many years. Considering Apple\u2019s focus on consumers first and a price point that can get more people in the door, it seems like that could move the needle. The third thing is gamers. Gamers use Windows largely because they have to, not because they are passionate about it. Maybe they were passionate about it in the 90s, but any passion has gone away. Now it is just the operating system they use to launch Steam. In early 2026, Valve is going to release the Steam Machine after a few years of success with the Steam Deck. We will see how they do there, but what they are doing is releasing a machine that runs Windows games on Linux. And it runs them really well. The Steam Deck has proven that over the last few years. If someone can package up a version of Linux that is optimized for gamers, then I think there is a meaningful number of PC gamers who would happily run that on their computer instead. I do not know if this is going to happen. It is always easy to be cynical and suggest everything will stay the same, and I understand that markets of this size take a long time to change. However, it just feels like there are some things happening right now that are going to move the needle, and I am excited to see what happens.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. It's easy to find nearly any type of battery in a store, but the numerous brands that you can encounter can make it feel overwhelming to know which one to choose. After all, the battery world is expanding, with new types that don't degrade with use and fungus batteries that need feedings. It can all be a little complicated to keep up with.\u00a0 Every time you step into the electronics section of a store or browse the online market, you'll find the same battery packs with different brands on them. Although these battery packages may all have the same type of batteries available, the quality varies. Some battery brands are better at providing you with more power, meaning your\u00a0controllers for the Meta Quest 3\u00a0will be ready when you need them. Others are better suited for your clocks or smaller devices, as they consume less power.\u00a0 We've selected 12 distinct brands and ranked them from worst to best to highlight which brands you should typically reach depending on what you need. As we go up the list, these are the ones that ranked well for power and garnered more positive reviews and test reports. We also examined a brand's overall performance with the battery, and we will offer our details about our methodology at the end.\u00a0 Fuji\u00a0makes more than pretty cameras\u00a0makes more than pretty cameras, but its batteries are a choice best used in\u00a0low-performance devices, such as a clock or a television remote. Even then, there are better options available. The Fuji batteries offer mid-range performance and endurance when used in these low-performance items, but their overall drain means you'll likely need to replace them sooner than you'd like. Customers who have purchased these batteries reported that Fuji batteries have a short shelf life, with them\u00a0becoming unusable within a few years. The advertised amount claims a decade, which is nowhere near what several reviewers have shared. Some have even had experiences where these batteries corroded while in devices or still in the packaging after a few months, and others dealt with the battery chemicals leaking out. Given these reviews and the overall quality of these products while in low-performance devices, it'd be better to find an alternative product, despite being on a budget. If you still wish to stock up, they're currently available on Amazon for $43.05 for a 48-pack. As far as rechargeable batteries go, Deleepow ranks among one of the lesser recommended choices.\u00a0The Deleepow AA rechargeable batteries supposedly contain 3,300 mAh, but the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0tested them at closer to 2,000 mAh, which means your devices will power down much more quickly.\u00a0You could still consider them for low-performance devices. You can get an 8-count with a charger on Amazon for $16.99. Reviews for Deleepow's AA rechargeable batteries detail that they take a long time to charge, and when they're ready to go, they don't last long. Others report the batteries completely stop functioning several months after using them, and they would stop holding a charge. The custom charger is also a frustrating caveat for several users, as it requires a USB-C cable, and when you get it, there's no outlet plug. You'll have to get that yourself. The low battery quality and slow recharging place this on the lower end of useful batteries. You may only want to use it for low-performance devices you infrequently use, such as your television remote. When you're on a budget, the PKCell battery is an affordable option for nearly everyone. You can get a 24-pack of 12 AA and 12 AAA batteries for $9.99 on Amazon. The same affordable pricing extends to PKCells'\u00a0AG3 packs for $3.99. Although promoted to have a 10-year shelf life, one customers found that this is not always the case, as the batteries received did not hold a charge. When you do use them, the overall drain from high-performance devices might leave you swapping them out faster than you expect. There are more generally positive reviews when it comes to PKCell's AG3 battery, which is what you use for small clocks, calculators, watches, and even toys. However, when you examine the customer reviews for the AA, things take a turn. Several reviews note that the batteries don't last long, or even a good chunk of them won't work out of the box. Although given the price PKCell is asking for these batteries, customers say they expect this type of low quality and quick turnaround from this product. You'll want to stick with low-performance devices if you're using this product, and even then, the quality of the battery from the pack can vary as the brand has low reliability. The EBL battery brand could be a decent choice, and it does rank higher on the lower section of our list. There are a few drawbacks to these batteries that pull them away from being closer to the middle. Their overall power capacity likely won't hit the mark, as it's under the advertised 2,800 mAh amount. There are reviews detailing that the EBL rechargeable battery products don't lose too much power after consistent use, but some customers have experienced otherwise. You can pick a 16-pack on Amazon for $23.29, and the specialized charger for eight rechargeable EBL batteries costs $13.99. Customers who use EBL report that they work effectively on their devices and appreciate the value they get for their money. However, there are numerous mixed reviews regarding the product's charge retention. Some say they charge well and work well for multiple days, while others say that they don't hold a charge, even if they haven't been used for several years. It comes down to long-term degradation, but one intriguing complaint from a customer is about the size of these batteries, as they seem a hair too large for their device slots.\u00a0 GP batteries are the brand you reach for when you want a decent battery, regardless of what device you plan to use with them. They can go into nearly any type of gadget, although devices with a heavy draw might drain them exceptionally quickly. These are advertised as having 1,500 mAh.Where these batteries suffer is when demanding a significant amount of energy in a short amount of time. You can pick up a pack of 40 for $39.88 on Amazon. Consumer reviews\u00a0find these batteries exceptionally useful for low-performance devices. These can operate in stronger devices, but for a short time. You're better off going with a different brand for high-drain devices. However, you could choose to upgrade to a more powerful version of the GP battery, such as the GP Ultra, which has a higher claimed energy capacity of 2,500 mAh. One tester discovered the GP Ultra AAs provided over 1,600 total mAh through a cycle. The cost does go up significantly, though, and it might not be worth it as the standard AA from GP is available at more competitive pricing. We have Panasonic Eneloop batteries on the lower end of the medium scale. These have decent capacity and usually charge to the advertised 2,000 mAh, with a tested capacity of 1,926 mAh. These marks are still slightly below some brands when you're looking for batteries with larger capacities. Still, these are a reliable option when putting them in your devices. The real downside for many consumers is that they'll have to look at these batteries as an investment, especially with the rechargeable version. For the best quality, go with the Panasonic Eneloop Pro. You can pick up an eight-pack for $39.49, and chargers range from $19 to $40, depending on how many batteries you want to recharge at once. When it comes to customer reviews, many praise the overall quality. There are reviews highlighting the life of these batteries and how well they work in a range of products. There are customer-reported issues with these rechargeable batteries steadily losing quality as time goes on. Overall, Panasonic Eneloop can be a good option, but many feel like it's an investment that has a high overhead cost, which other batteries can do better at a lower price. There's more consistency with the batteries made by\u00a0Tenergy if you're looking for a reliable brand. The mAh is close to what's advertised on the packaging, and the drain does not dip too much if you're using the rechargeable ones, as shared by Wirecutter. It comes down to what type of battery you'd like to use, as the company offers several options for everyday low-performance, professional, and high-performance devices. Tenergy has rechargeable and single-use batteries for sale, but they have a better reputation for their rechargeable products.\u00a0A pack of 24 with 12 AA and 12 AAA is available for $38.49. Customers who pick the Tenergy Premium Pro Rechargeable batteries find that they last for a long time.\u00a0Some reviews say they last longer than standard batteries. After recharging them, the batteries don't significantly decline in quality and continue to run on similarly high charges, at least for the initial charges. Customer reviews after a few months indicated the quality in these batteries drops at a steady rate,\u00a0even with inconsistent use. Select customers who also encountered a handful of batteries in the pack that were defective.\u00a0It doesn't happen often, but it has happened enough times to warrant caution when buying larger packs. Some reviews also warn about the size of these batteries, claiming they are slightly too large for standard AA battery slots.\u00a0 When you're on the lookout for a battery that you want to leave in devices that are low-performance, the Varta brand is a reliable and solid mid-range choice. There are better battery choices when you want to use a device consistently with a significant energy draw. However, if you know you're using it on a clock, a television remote, or have small toys for your children, the Varta AA battery performs exceptionally well with these devices. You can leave it in there and expect to continue running for several months before changing it again. You can grab a fairly large pack at a low price, available on Amazon for $14.25 for a pack of 48. Customer reviews back up the reliability of the Varta battery. Those who have purchased them highlight that they have good power capacity, and it's a reasonable\u00a0deal for what they pay for based on how many they get in a pack. It's cheaper than the other, larger brands. The downside is that there are mixed reviews on a Varta battery's overall lifespan. These poor reviews seem to correlate with the use of these batteries in high-performance devices, such as MP3 players or trail cameras. It's a significant drawback that leaves them at fifth on our list.\u00a0 The Rayovac battery brand is a competitive choice when you're looking for a cost-effective option for your devices, and you want moderate quality and performance. These batteries do not rank at the top of the charts in terms of overall power, but they don't drain too quickly\u00a0on your demanding devices. Still, there's considerable power drain, and that may mean you have to keep multiples of this battery near your devices to replace them often. You can get these on Amazon in a 36-pack for $15.49. The reviews for the Rayovac are generally positive, as they center around how much value customers get with these batteries. Given the price of a 36-pack, reviews say it's great that they get so many for how much they pay for it. There are mixed reviews regarding how long these batteries last, but some customers agree that they last longer than some of the smaller brands that offer as much power.\u00a0However, a problem with Rayovac is the chance of leakage, which is a significant issue for all alkaline batteries. The leakage issue is reported in customer reviews, and others claim that these batteries have poor\u00a0shelf life.\u00a0 When it comes to achieving a balance between price and performance, the Amazon Basics battery does surprisingly well. Even if they are on the cheaper side, they do rather well as a consistent battery. These batteries have reliable performance that brings them ahead of other brands. Plus, if you're looking to purchase them in bulk, there's little chance you can find a more affordable and quality option on the market. However, these do have a\u00a0high power drain, which means using them on high-performance devices may force you to swap them out sooner than other options. You can pick up the Amazon Basics AA battery 40 pack for $15.49, or you can go well beyond that to get up to a 450-count for $62.79. You can potentially get them for cheaper if you catch them available during a Prime Day, along with some electronics to power them with. The customer reviews for the Amazon Basics battery praise the product's quality, given the price. Others detail the quality of these batteries, while there are mixed reviews for how much power these batteries give to specific high-performance devices. There are customer reviews indicating that these batteries may not have the same capacity as those of other brands, as some devices consume them quickly, necessitating\u00a0frequent replacement. Overall, customers rate Amazon Basic's batteries at 4.6 out of five stars.\u00a0 When it comes to choosing between the top choices for the best battery brand, we're left with Duracell and Energizer. When you stack up everything, these two are close, but Duracell lands slightly lower when it comes down to overall performance and market price. You'll typically find Duracll higher on the price range, bringing them down a notch when you compare them to Energizer. You can get a pack of 20 AA batteries on Amazon for $17.24\u00a0at the time of writing.\u00a0\u00a0 The reviews and overall customer satisfaction are high across almost all Duracell batteries, as they all range above a 4.7-star rating, with tens of thousands of customer reviews. A majority of these reviews praise Duracell's overall quality, its longevity, and how well it functions\u00a0in various devices. There are a handful of negative reviews that question the shelf life of these batteries, but the majority of customer feedback is positive. You can't go wrong with picking Duracell batteries, but these are not budget-friendly choices if you need to buy large quantities frequently. What gives Energizer the edge over Duracell is the overall performance of these batteries, and they are a slightly more wallet-friendly option. You can pick an AA pack with 16 batteries for $11.39. They earn\u00a0good scores in reliability, power, and superb shelf life. The price does go up with the lithium option, as a 24-pack costs $44.99, but so does the battery quality. On Amazon, Energizer Max AA batteries have earned 4.8 stars based on over 125,000 reviews. The overwhelmingly positive reviews praise the value customers get for how many batteries they receive, the overall battery quality to power devices, and how long they last. Energizer is one of the most recognizable battery brands for a reason, and testing and customer reviews report high satisfaction and competitive performance.\u00a0These are the types of batteries you'd want in energy-hungry devices, such as some of the\u00a0powerful flashlights we've found on Amazon\u00a0that you rely on to work when you need them most.\u00a0 When selecting battery brands to place on our list, we focused on the ones that had at least an average 4.0-star ranking on Amazon. These were products that had a reputation and could be used by anyone looking to utilize AA batteries, the most common type that appears in standard household gadgets and appliances. Once we had selected the 12 battery brands to feature, we focused on consumer reviews and test reports shared by those who had extensively used these batteries. We examined a brand's overall performance with the battery, including whether they offered rechargeable options, the battery's power capacity, how that energy was drained to devices, reliability, and the frequency of battery leaks. All batteries have a chance to leak chemicals, but some brands have a reputation for their batteries to leak frequently, even while in the package","label":0}

It made for an irresistible narrative. The large, slow incumbent \u2014 in this case, Google \u2014 was caught flat-footed by a more nimble upstart by the name of OpenAI. It was the type of story Silicon Valley built its legend on. In Sundar Pichai's first letter to shareholders in 2016 after becoming CEO, he said Google would shift to an \"AI-first world.\" Yet, in late 2022, a relatively unknown company suddenly pulled the rug from under Google's feet. ChatGPT was an overnight sensation, and Google, which had long seen itself as the leader in AI, appeared to be lagging behind. In the years since, the search giant has acted fast to turn things around. It quickly reshaped key parts of its business internally and made an aggressive push to inject generative AI into its core products. Its latest AI model, Gemini 3, launched this month to dazzling reviews. Crucially, Gemini 3 launched within Search \u2014 Google's most prized business \u2014 on day one, a strong signal that after three years the company had gotten its ducks in a row. However, there are big questions that Google is still grappling with as it rebuilds its image in the age of AI. OpenAI's first-mover advantage meant that ChatGPT has become the \"Kleenex\" of AI \u2014 the name that everyone associates with it \u2014 and it will be tough for Google to change that. This story is part of a series exploring the changing online search landscape and its impact on consumers, media companies, advertisers, and tech platforms. Stay tuned for: There are also more existential questions. Chiefly, how can Google preserve a healthy web ecosystem once AI has eaten the internet? To keep pace with rivals, Google is reimagining search not as a directory, but a conversation that removes the hassle of scrolling and clicking. What that means for the future of the internet is a lingering question. Still, Google's business may not only survive its self-disruption, but thrive. \"It has the users, and as long as it continues to rush out new products, no one can match its distribution tentacles,\" a former Google executive said. \"They will come out as winners no matter the scenario.\" Google told Business Insider in a statement, \"We've been through platform shifts before, and every time it's been an expansionary moment for Google and for Search. We move quickly, innovate, and create new opportunities for our products, partners, and users \u2014 and that's what we're doing with AI.\" Did Google see it coming? That depends on who you ask. When OpenAI's ChatGPT rolled out, Googlers experienced a mix of frustration and relief. Some employees had worked on similar projects that had never made it outside Google's walls, and seeing a much smaller competitor take the glory was frustrating. Others saw it as the starting pistol in the AI race and the green light for Google to finally unleash its own AI on the world. Google has never lacked brains or technology. Employees at DeepMind, an AI research lab within Google's parent company, had been toying with large language models by the time ChatGPT appeared, but leaders worried that releasing a chatbot prone to bias or errors would spark backlash. \"It was not intended as a public thing yet,\" a former DeepMind employee who worked on Google's own LLM technology said. \"We saw shortcomings and saw it start to be interesting, but it was unclear how to get it to be completely useful.\" What surprised some leaders inside the company \u2014 and where Google ultimately miscalculated, insiders say \u2014 was that users largely didn't seem to care about ChatGPT's shortcomings. Inside DeepMind, teams scrambled to launch their answer to ChatGPT, a chatbot named Sparrow, which would have had more safety guardrails than ChatGPT, according to people who worked on it. That project soon died once Google merged DeepMind with its internal AI lab Brain, and the company then put all its focus on Gemini. At the same time, Google made an internal push to infuse generative AI into all its most crucial products, including Search, YouTube, and Android. It launched multiple iterations of the Gemini chatbot, the latest of which is Gemini 3. Over the past three years, Google has made disrupting itself look fairly easy. The company just reported its first $100 billion quarter. Its cloud business, which has long been second-fiddle to Amazon's and Microsoft's, is whirring into overdrive. Its specialized AI chips, for years an internal and slow-moving effort, are suddenly seeing blockbuster demand from companies vying for more computing power. Current and former employees say Google's greatest advantage is that it owns the full technology stack needed to meet the AI boom. It offers numerous products, including Gemini, Search, and Maps, which are already used by billions of people. It has a fleet of researchers building frontier AI models. And it has a cloud infrastructure that is not just powering all these internal efforts, but that its biggest competitors are paying to use. Search, however, remains Google's core business and the boat it spent decades trying not to rock. When cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started Google, it had no clear business model beyond building a world-beating search engine, but the founders were eventually swayed into putting ads into search results. It became one of the most scalable businesses ever imagined in the digital era, and to this day, it continues to provide the largest chunk of Google's revenue. Now, Google must figure out whether AI Overviews \u2014 its generated summaries that give users instant answers to their questions \u2014 and the more dramatic reimagining of search in AI Mode have as much juice when it comes to search advertising. Google can't afford to stand still. Industry analysts at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company, predict Google's share of the search ads market will drop below 50% for the first time next year (a revision to their earlier prediction that it would happen in 2025). By the end of 2026, EMARKETER predicts Google will have a 48.9% share. EMARKETER senior forecast analyst Oscar Orozco said that the sustained high performance of Google's search business suggests advertiser caution around AI Overviews has been \"overblown\" by the market. \"However, this does remain a long-term threat for their search business, and we believe as LLMs monetize their search capabilities, Google will continue to lose share, albeit at a slower rate than we had expected at this same time last year,\" he said. Google, at least publicly, doesn't appear to be worried. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Google Search boss Liz Reid said that while changes to search resulted in reduced traffic to some websites, the overall number of search queries was increasing because Google made it easier for people to get to answers, either through AI Overviews or tools like Lens. \"The increase in searches sort of compensates for the impact on ads clicks such that we end up roughly at the same point,\" Reid said. She also made a point that chatbots can't replace products users are looking to buy, hinting at a top priority for Google: transactional searches that are more likely to produce ad revenue for the platform. Even that is changing for Google. The search funnel \u2014 the time between someone beginning to research a product to hitting \"buy\" \u2014 is shrinking, as generative AI gets people to what they want sooner. Google has begun to show the world how it's adapting to protect its core moneymaker. However, it's unclear what the generative AI boom means for the long-term health of the web, and how it will impact websites that supply information as opposed to products. Google says that its new AI search features can help users find more relevant content, and that queries continue to grow year-over-year. Yet many publishers already see search traffic declining, and there are growing anxieties that even if overall searches go up with AI summaries, they will not translate into website clicks. A recent Pew Research study based on the search history of 900 users concluded that when an AI Overview appeared, users clicked a traditional link 8% of the time, compared to 15% when an AI summary didn't appear. Google said the research was flawed and not representative of overall search traffic. Lily Ray, vice president of SEO research firm Amsive, said that a shift to an AI-first Google would make it harder for publishers and content creators who build much of the web to make money. If people stop publishing, where will Google get the information it needs to construct its AI Overviews? \"I'm not sure how they plan to solve that; their current excuses are not cutting it,\" she said. One idea she suggested is that Google and other AI companies that build large language models pay commissions to the sites they train on or reference, as an incentive for them to keep creating. She's not alone in feeling something needs to shift. \"The business model of the web can't survive unless there's some change,\" Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this year. Prince, whose business acts as a gateway between websites and the internet, has called AI answerbots an \"existential threat\" to the internet. \"If content creators can't derive value from what they're doing, then they're not going to create original content,\" Prince said.

One of America's favorite cookies has gotten a makeover \u2014\u00a0and it's aimed squarely at Gen Z. Chips Ahoy has released one of its largest cross-brand collaborations in partnership with Netflix's \"Stranger Things,\" which returns for its final season on November 26. The inky black soft chew cookies evoke the show's dark aesthetic, with an '80s-themed package that would fit perfectly in Winona Ryder's kitchen. \"Stranger Things,\" a cultural touchstone since its 2016 debut, has been a particular hit with Gen Z viewers, despite many of them having been born long after the era of hair metal and satanic panic. Chris Park, Mondelez International's Director of Savory Revenue Growth Management, was the project lead on the \"Stranger Things\" collaboration in his former role as Director of Chips Ahoy Innovation. \"From our brand point of view, we really want new ways to connect with our consumers, especially that Gen Z audience, and what better way to do that than with \"Stranger Things\"?\" Park told Business Insider. \"Partnerships, I think, are one of the biggest things that we can do to be part of the cultural conversation.\" Branding experts told Business Insider in September that good cross-brand partnerships can be hard to pull off \u2014\u00a0especially when targeting Gen Z customers, because of their demand for well-integrated authenticity from marketing campaigns \u2014\u00a0but, when done well, can offer both brands a chance at viral sales, to shape the social conversation around their products, and potentially expand their audience. That's what Chips Ahoy, and its parent company Mondel\u0113z, are after, as the snack giant aims to capture consumers' attention at a time when they're snacking less, cutting down on processed foods, and have more options than ever. The \"Stranger Things\" cookie features a strawberry center in a nod to the color scheme in the \"upside down\" parallel dimension, where much of the show takes place. It's also the first time Chips Ahoy has experimented with a fruit flavor \u2014\u00a0itself an intentional nod toward Gen Z. \"Some of the trends that we see are that, especially with Gen Z, they love to try snacks with new flavors, whether that's something trending or that they've tried at restaurants,\" Park said. \"Certain combinations are a very appealing flavor package to them. The cinnamon bun cookie we launched this year is a good example of that strategy \u2014 so is the strawberry and chocolate.\" Chips Ahoy debuted in 1963 under the Nabisco brand, which was acquired by Mondel\u0113z in 2000. In the years since, the company has experimented with flavors like red velvet, s'mores, and confetti cake. Going forward, Park said they aim to be bolder with their flavor combinations, hoping to capitalize on viral trends like Dubai chocolate, or black sesame and matcha, which Yelp on November 18 identified as increasingly popular in its 2026 trend forecast. And Chips Ahoy isn't the only snack brand leaning hard into Gen Z's tastes. Oreo, which is also owned by Mondel\u0113z, launched its Reese's-Oreo product line in September, targeting the younger demographic after the flavor combination gained popularity on TikTok, according to Michelle Deignan, the brand's VP of Marketing, who spoke to Business Insider at the time. However, expanding the variety of flavors available comes with operational challenges for a company the size of Chips Ahoy, as it needs to scale up the millions, or even billions, of cookies for any given flavor launch. As a result, Park said the company is actively working to streamline its innovation process for future product line-ups, even if that means limited-time runs or regional drops. \"As a company, we want to look at ways to be faster and to really meet those trends quickly, whether and even if it's more on a smaller scale that gives consumers and our fans a chance to experience our product with those fast-moving trends,\" Park said. \"That's something we're really, really looking at.\" Park said Chips Ahoy has to balance staying true to its iconic legacy while modernizing its offerings to keep up with changing tastes in the snack industry. It could be an uphill battle \u2014 Business Insider reported in July that Mondel\u0113z's sales volume in the US fell during the company's second quarter due to changes in consumer snacking behavior \u2014 but Park said it's one the brand is going all-in on. \"Whether it's new flavors, other innovations that will come next year, new partners, new limited editions that will eventually make their way into the market \u2014 we as a brand are really diving into becoming even more relevant with our audience,\" Park said.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Samuel Adams is one of those beers that is familiar, dependable and award-winning, making it one of the\u00a0most popular beers in America. Because of how generally adored it truly is, shoppers have been unable to ignore that its price has been slowly creeping up over the past few years. A report by FinanceBuzz documented a 71% increase in Samuel Adams prices from 2015 to 2025, outpacing the 41% average increase in beer prices and the general rate of inflation across all categories. Fortunately, the explanation for this doesn't require any guesswork. The Consumer Price Index's \"Beer at home\" category has faced annual increases\u00a0since 2020, in part due to rising costs of ingredients, cans, bottles, and transportation. The Boston Beer Company, which produces Samuel Adams, has confirmed the same upward trend in its public earnings reports.\u00a0Samuel Adams' brewing style has its roots in European inspiration\u00a0(an interesting point to note when looking at\u00a0the differences between American and German beers) by using\u00a0German noble hops, which the company notes are\u00a0rarer and more expensive than most other varieties. Once those higher ingredient and packaging costs meet state taxes and regional pricing, it becomes very easy to see why the same six-pack is pricier today than it was five or 10 years ago. The inflation of our food and drink has become one of the most visible trends in everyday life, and so beer prices are moving right along with it. Everything from weekly grocery staples to the cost of restaurant meals is rising \u2014 even fast food has become more expensive.\u00a0Beer has been swept up in the same current, shaped by the general rise in operating expenses that affects basically every aisle of the supermarket. Regional price differences add another layer to what we see as shoppers because beer taxes vary dramatically from state to state, and these taxes directly influence how much a beer ends up costing at the register. All of this creates a pretty straightforward picture. Yes, Samuel Adams beer prices have risen \u2014 in fact, all beer prices have risen, but they\u00a0aren't growing in isolation. This is part of a larger, well-recorded climb in food and beverage costs across the country. It isn't necessarily that Samuel Adams beer itself has shifted categories or changed some core part of its identity that makes it more upmarket \u2014 it's that the market around it shifted. And as long as everything involved in getting food and drink onto shelves continues to grow more expensive, the price of that bottle of beer is only going to move with it.","label":0}

Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold7 faces virtually no competition in the premium foldable space, and Apple still hasn\u2019t officially announced any plans to enter the foldable phone market. These Samsung devices typically launch at eye-watering prices that make flagship phones look affordable by comparison. But Amazon just dropped both configurations to all-time lows for Black Friday: the 256GB model sits at $1,599 down from $1,999, while the 512GB version hits $1,657 instead of $2,119. These prices put the Z Fold7 in the same territory as a base iPhone 17 Pro which make tablet-sized screen real estate suddenly feel accessible. See at Amazon The 6.3-inch cover screen allows you to handle minor tasks without unfolding the device, and when you\u2019re on the go, it\u2019s just like using a regular smartphone. This external AMOLED display runs at 120Hz with HDR10+ support and makes scrolling smooth and content vivid. You can respond to messages, view notifications, control music, and snap photos using only the cover screen. Meanwhile, the inner 7.6-inch main display unfolds to show tablet-level real estate that revolutionizes how you work and play. This huge Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel also refreshes at 120Hz and provides great color accuracy due to its broad color gamut coverage. Over seven generations, the folding mechanism has been refined to include a hinge that feels robust and that operates smoothly through thousands of opening cycles. Samsung has also engineered the display crease to be less noticeable than it was before. In fact, the layer of Ultra Thin Glass protection does feel more natural under your fingers than the plastic screens on earlier foldables. Samsung gave the Galaxy Z Fold7 the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, which was built specifically for Galaxy devices. This processor brings desktop-class performance, handling resource-intensive multitasking, 3D gaming or video editing without any thermal throttling. The 12GB of RAM keeps multiple apps running simultaneously without reloading-a feature which matters a lot more on this device because you actually will use split-screen mode regularly. The 256GB model has plenty of storage for most users, but the 512GB version gives room for extensive photo libraries and big apps without having to constantly manage space. A 4,400mAh dual-cell battery system means battery life extends through a full day of mixed use. Samsung splits the battery between both halves for optimal weight distribution in the phone. It supports 25W fast charging via USB-C, and reaches 50% capacity in about 30 minutes. The device also features wireless charging at 15W and reverse wireless charging at 4.5W and allows users to top up Galaxy Buds or other Qi-compatible devices using the back panel of the phone. The rear camera array boasts a primary 50MP sensor with optical image stabilization, capturing high-definition pictures in different light conditions. A 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens extends your framing for landscapes and group shots. A 10MP telephoto camera offers 3x optical zoom to get closer without losing quality. The cover screen features a 10MP selfie camera for quick snaps, while the inner screen houses a 4MP under-display camera that remains nearly invisible when inactive. AI-powered photo editing automatically enhances images, removes unwanted objects, and suggests further adjustments, thanks to scene analysis. Android 15 runs underneath Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 interface which is optimized for foldables. Apps automatically resize and reformat when you unfold the phone, smoothly expanding from the cover screen to fill the main display. Multi-Active Window allows running three apps simultaneously on the main screen, with windows that are resizable and can be moved around however users want. Drag and drop between apps makes intuitive tasks like moving photos into documents or sharing links between browsers. App Continuity ensures whatever you\u2019re doing on the cover screen picks up exactly where you left off when unfolding to the main display. The Galaxy Z Fold7 includes tablet and phone capabilities in one device for hundreds less than its launch price, with 256GB costing $1,599 and 512GB costing $1,657. For the first time, foldable technology finally feels like a practical upgrade rather than an expensive experiment. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"As real-world asset (RWA) tokenization surges, the crypto industry is entering unfamiliar territory, bringing traditional equities, private credit, and commercial paper onchain and uncovering potential critical risks along the way. Marcin Ka\u017amierczak, co-founder of oracle provider RedStone, says a risk is potentially being overlooked: the weekend gap, where crypto trades 24\/7, while Wall Street does not.  In traditional finance, if disaster strikes a company over the weekend, the market is closed and then the stock \"gaps down\" when the opening bell rings on Monday. Meanwhile, in the crypto market, trading never stops. As more stocks are brought onchain, the gap in weekend trading on the blockchain for traditional equities versus when the market opens on Monday could pose a risk, according to Ka\u017amierczak.  For example, a tokenized version of Tesla stock that is traded on a decentralized exchange allows traders to buy and sell it at 3:00 a.m. on a Sunday, while the TradFi market remains closed. \u201cImagine if a Tesla factory explodes over the weekend\u2014traditional markets are closed, but on-chain markets are open,\u201d Ka\u017amierczak said in an interview with CoinDesk at Devconnect Buenos Aires. \u201cWe might see a dislocation of the tokenized stock versus the real value on Nasdaq.\" This mismatch, he argues, could create what he calls a \"price dislocation,\"\u00a0where an on-chain asset appears stable, but only because the oracles, which send data from the outside world to a blockchain, have stopped updating prices. Major providers typically freeze equity price feeds when U.S. markets close at 4 p.m. ET Friday, resuming only Monday morning. In that window, on-chain versions of Tesla, or any other stock, could keep trading, even if their real-world price should have changed dramatically. Most tokenized stock trading activity is currently focused on centralized exchanges, where trading of these products is often limited during the weekend. But the goal of the industry is to make these tokenized stocks permissionless and available in DeFi protocols. That means 24\/7 activity. If the oracle doesn't update until markets reopen, on-chain protocols could be trading on \"ghost\" prices, creating massive arbitrage opportunities or leaving lending protocols under-collateralized. The problem intensifies with complexity.  While stablecoins are relatively safe, Ka\u017amierczak pointed out that the market is shifting toward more complex products, such as tokenized portfolios of credit, commercial paper, and equities. \u201cEssentially, we are seeing launching a hedge fund on-chain,\u201d Ka\u017amierczak noted, describing future portfolios that might be \"50% allocated into T-Bills, 20% into private credit, 20% into commercial paper, and 10% actively managed.\" If oracles lag during real-world volatility, structured DeFi protocols could be left mispricing assets. RedStone advocates for a modular oracle architecture and supports both \u201cPush\u201d and \u201cPull\u201d models. In the \"Pull\" model, users get data delivered on-chain when they interact with a protocol, meaning \"the data is always fresh,\" according to Ka\u017amierczak. However, he conceded that most protocols still rely on the older model because it is easier to integrate. \u201cRight now, it's probably like 90% of solutions using the Push Oracle,\u201d he said, noting that while \"Pull\" was an innovation for scaling, the majority of the market still adapts the legacy standard. Until oracles and protocols evolve to account for these timing mismatches, Ka\u017amierczak suggested that the premise of 24\/7 tokenized finance carries inherent risks. As more RWAs go live, the challenge will be managing the gap between open protocols and closed traditional markets. \u201cWe still need to see how they behave on the weekend,\u201d Ka\u017amierczak warned.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Buying your first home with your hubby or wife is one of the biggest and most exciting milestones in any couple's life. It's the beginning of a new chapter. One that will hopefully last forever: filled with countless memories, first steps, and a whole lot of laughter! It's a huge decision that takes time to make, typically involving numerous showings, debates, and a long list of pros and cons. But when you finally unlock the door of your dream home, it will all feel worth it. Because you thought the phrase, 'When you know, you know' was referring to your forever partner, but now you finally understand that it was actually referring to your forever home\u2026 This couple had their exact dream home in mind. A little, modern single-story new build. So when their friend suggested (well, actually it was more of a demand) that the couple purchase his parents' 1950s double-story house, they politely declined. Unnecessarily feeling the need to justify their 'no, thank you' to him. But he didn't take their refusal in the best way\u2026accusing them of being the exact reason their innocent parents' home has been on the market for 90 days!

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Next year, Apple will be introducing an even more affordable MacBook model to better compete with Chromebooks. It\u2019s expected to come in around $699, offer an A18 Pro chip, and a 13-inch LCD display. While that\u2019s likely going to be an excellent offering, there\u2019s the simple fact that a lot of people buying Chromebooks are targeting even cheaper price points than that. Luckily, Apple already has an excellent solution for some of these potential: the iPad, in pairing with a keyboard setup of your choosing. This holiday season, I\u2019m sure many parents and relatives around the world will buy their kids new laptops for school, and many of said laptops will probably be sub-$500 Chromebooks. While yes, Chromebooks certainly have their place in the market \u2013 a lot of kids already love iPads, and many people don\u2019t realize the capabilities iPads can offer \u2013 especially in recent years. Apple\u2019s cheapest iPad is the iPad (A16). Priced at $349, it offers an A16 chip, an 11-inch high resolution display, 128GB of storage, 6GB of RAM, an aluminum enclosure, and solid stereo speakers. It\u2019s paired with the Logitech Combo Touch, an affordable keyboard and trackpad accessory for the iPad that utilizes Apple\u2019s smart connector, meaning there\u2019ll be no need to worry about charging the keyboard \u2013 unlike most options on the market. Currently, iPad (A16) can be bought for $279 on Amazon with Black Friday week deals, and the Logitech Combo Touch for iPad (A16) can be bought for $128. All together, that\u2019s slightly over $400 for what\u2019s already a great budget laptop combo. That said, you can also throw in an Apple Pencil for $69, and you\u2019ll still be below $500 for a fully decked iPad setup. iPadOS 26 brings a key feature to Apple\u2019s cheapest iPad for the first time: Windowed apps. Apple had always offered windowing to some capacity, particularly in the form of Stage Manager. However, that was limited to only select iPads, including the A12X\/Z iPad Pros, as well as any iPad with an M1 chip or later. This meant that it was never available on Apple\u2019s cheapest iPad, until now\u2026 So, if you want to easily open up multiple windows of Safari, or have a Google Docs window next to Mail, for instance, you can now. Finally, iPadOS\u2019 limited multi-tasking abilities are starting to be unlocked in recent years. iPads support the incredibly versatile Apple Pencil, as well as third party options like the Logitech Crayon. This means you can easily take notes, sketch something, annotate a document, or more. While many Chromebooks offer touchscreens, it\u2019s quite rare that they have premium stylus offerings. This can be a game changer for students. There\u2019s another simple advantage to using an iPad as a Chromebook alternative: you probably already like using an iPad. Especially if you happen to be reading this article. It\u2019s familiar, and you can use all of the iPhone and iPad apps you already love, versus a Chromebook that\u2019s largely web based. Granted, some Chromebooks support running Android apps, but that isn\u2019t a fantastic experience. Also, the Logitech Combo Touch offers a neat feature: the ability to simply detach the keyboard. So, when you\u2019re not working or typing up a document, you can just use the iPad as a tablet, and take advantage of the Combo Touch\u2019s great kickstand \u2013 all with the keyboard out of the way. Lastly, iPads just have better hardware. The A16 Bionic chip will be miles faster than any chipset you\u2019ll be getting in a budget Chromebook. Additionally, many Chromebooks will only offer 4GB of RAM, versus 6GB in the iPad. Lastly, Apple\u2019s internal storage will be a lot faster than the eMMC storage offered in budget Chromebooks. In short, the iPad will feel more responsive, and last a longer time before feeling sluggish. All that said, if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s gifting someone in your life a budget Chromebook, maybe consider giving them an iPad and Logitech Combo Touch instead. It\u2019s more versatile, and it makes for a much nicer experience than a sub-$500 Chromebook would, in all likelihood. Buy this iPad setup on Amazon ($442 total): Additionally, you can save an extra 10% on the Logitech Combo Touch (and other Black Friday deals) by using the Amazon Prime Visa.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Bitcoin\u2019s slide to $84,000 is being driven less by mood and more by mechanics, according to Greg Cipolaro,\u00a0Global Head of Research at NYDIG. In a report, Cipolaro said the core engines of the 2024\u201325 rally have shifted into reverse. Spot bitcoin ETFs, once the primary source of demand for the cycle, now exhibit persistent redemptions. Those vehicles funneled billions into bitcoin during the first half of the year, the report points out, but trailing five-day flows have turned negative. Data from SoSoValue shows that these ETFs are on track to register their highest monthly outflow since launch, having bled out $3.55 billion so far in November, just shy of the $3.56 billion record outflow seen in February. Read more: Bitcoin ETFs Have Bled a Record $3.79B in November Stablecoins are flashing a similar signal. The total supply has dipped for the first time in months, and the algorithmic USDE token has lost nearly half of its outstanding supply since the Oct. 10 liquidation shock. NYDIG\u2019s Cipolaro said this drop points to money leaving the market rather than moving to the sidelines. \u201cGiven its role in the selloff, where it fell to $0.65 on Binance, its rapid contraction underscores how aggressively capital has been pulled from the system,\u201d he wrote. The report suggests that other factors point to capital outflows. Corporate treasury trades built around DAT share premiums relative to net asset value have also broken down. As those premiums flipped to discounts, firms that once issued stock to buy bitcoin are now selling assets or buying back shares. Sequans, for example, has earlier this month unloaded BTC to cut debt. \u201cImportantly, while these reversals mark a clear shift from a once-strong demand engine to a potential headwind, no DAT has yet shown signs of financial distress,\u201d Cipolaro pointed out. \u201cLeverage remains modest, interest obligations are manageable, and many DAT structures allow issuers to suspend dividend or coupon payments if needed.\u201d Large bitcoin purchases during the dip, including those from Strategy and the country of El Salvador, failed to stop the price drop. To Cipolaro, the \u201cfact that these sizable purchases didn\u2019t even slow the decline is telling.\u201d He argued that these reversals form a feedback loop set off by the $19 billion liquidation event on Oct. 10. The mechanisms that once pushed prices higher are now reinforcing the decline. In his view, investors should \u201chope for the best, but prepare for the worst,\" noting that \u201cthe long-term thesis is still alive, but the near-term environment may be shaped by well-worn cyclical mechanics.\"  \u201cHistory suggests the next stretch could be bumpy, but\u00a0secular conviction remains an important asset for long-term investors,\u201d Cipolaro added.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":" Every week, Yanko Design\u2019s podcast Design Mindset powered by KeyShot brings you conversations with design leaders who are shaping how products, brands, and experiences connect with people around the world. Hosted by Radhika, the show explores the intersection of design thinking, strategic communication, and the human stories behind successful brands. Whether you\u2019re a designer, entrepreneur, or simply curious about how intentional design shapes our world, this weekly series offers insights you won\u2019t find anywhere else. In episode 12, Radhika sits down with Chris Pereira, founder and CEO of iMpact, a China-Western communications and go-to-market firm based in Shenzhen. With nearly two decades in China, fluency in Mandarin, and a notable stint as a Huawei PR leader, Chris brings a rare perspective to the table. Named one of Forbes India\u2019s Top 30 Globalization Innovators, he\u2019s spent his career helping brands navigate the treacherous waters between cultural intention and reception. What emerges from this conversation is a masterclass in how design decisions carry meaning, whether you intend them to or not. Download your Free Trial of KeyShot Here  Chris opens with a stark reality check: \u201cDesign isn\u2019t neutral, especially across cultures. A font, a color, a slogan that wins in New York can really backfire in Nanshan in Shenzhen, China.\u201d The challenge isn\u2019t just about translation in the linguistic sense, it\u2019s about making intention travel across borders intact. Every design choice tells a story about your values, and Chris emphasizes this with a striking insight: \u201cThe question isn\u2019t if your design will tell a story, but what story you\u2019re telling. So it\u2019s whether you\u2019ll own that narrative or let it own you.\u201d When brands think they\u2019re \u201con brand\u201d with a global strategy, that\u2019s often exactly when things break down in local markets. Chris shares a personal anecdote that illustrates the stakes: \u201cI had a friend a few years ago in China and he always liked to wear a green hat\u2026 But in China, there\u2019s a specific phrase. If you\u2019re wearing a green hat, it means your partner is cheating on you in the relationship.\u201d What\u2019s an innocuous fashion choice elsewhere becomes a cultural faux pas in China. For brands, this translates directly to sales, green hats simply don\u2019t sell in Chinese markets, regardless of how well they perform globally. Cultural landmines extend far beyond color choices. Chris recounts a dinner meeting where cultural respect signals completely misfired: \u201cThe Chinese host used chopsticks and before he ate he put food onto my client\u2019s plate\u2026 But my business partner, my client, he got very angry all of a sudden. He said, I know how to use chopsticks. I\u2019m not a kid.\u201d The Chinese host was showing respect; the Western guest felt insulted. Both sides wanted to build trust, but the trust was actually eroded by the interaction. These seemingly small details matter enormously for visual communication too. Sticking chopsticks upright in rice is a cultural taboo in China associated with funeral rites, an advertising image showing this would be deeply inappropriate, yet a Western creative team might not know to avoid it. Chris\u2019s firm uses a systematic 10-item pre-mortem checklist that expands into roughly 100 specific considerations, covering everything from brand names and color schemes to who appears in imagery and what scenarios are shown. The goal should be consistent across markets, Chris explains, but the methods must adapt: \u201cThe result or what we want to convey in every country is the same. We care about the local community\u2026 How we get there is very different.\u201d  Perhaps the most critical insight Chris offers is about trust-building through third-party endorsement. \u201cIf I sit here and tell you, Radhika, I\u2019m really great. I\u2019m amazing\u2026 Honestly, that\u2019s not a good way to convince the other person. The better way is to say, this professor has given me a letter of introduction. I was on TV last week on that media.\u201d From a brand perspective, advertising says \u201cI\u2019m great,\u201d while third-party endorsement says \u201che\u2019s great\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s really trustworthy.\u201d Chris\u2019s advice is direct: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the third-party endorsement, you shouldn\u2019t do advertising.\u201d He encourages brands to \u201cstand on the shoulders of giants,\u201d pointing to the \u201cIntel Inside\u201d label on laptops as a perfect example. Industry awards, professional association endorsements (like dental associations for toothpaste), and partnerships with established entities all build the trust foundation necessary before spending on advertising. For product launches, Chris advocates showcasing customer success stories: \u201cMaybe we can donate some of our products while we\u2019re doing our announcement. And they can come and say how much that means to them for their community.\u201d This provides powerful, authentic validation that no amount of paid advertising can replicate. Chris\u2019s time at Huawei during one of the most challenging periods in the company\u2019s history taught him invaluable lessons about resilience and messaging. When he joined in 2016, the message was all about dominance: \u201cWe\u2019re number one in this industry. We\u2019re number two in this industry. We have a huge end to end supply chain.\u201d That message made employees proud but scared competitors. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the United States at your Apple or Google, you\u2019re like, oh, crap, this is kind of scary. Right. And they\u2019re going to take our business,\u201d Chris recalls. The lesson? \u201cThe importance of win win or finding ways to work together in a way that\u2019s good for everyone in the community is important.\u201d Huawei eventually shifted its messaging toward building an open ecosystem, helping everyone in the supply chain succeed together. Chris also learned about the long-term mindset necessary for trust-building. When the Meng Wanzhou crisis hit in 2018-2019, many questioned whether Huawei would survive. Yet the company had a record year recently, expanding into new sectors like automotive. This taught Chris the importance of resilience and \u201cthick skin\u201d for both brands and individuals, and that trust requires time and consistency to build properly.  The concept of \u201cShenzhen Speed\u201d came up multiple times, but Chris is careful to define it properly. It\u2019s not about rushing business relationships or pushing for quick deals. Rather, \u201cwhen we say Shenzhen speed, we\u2019re not talking about the speed of your business development\u2026 the speed is response. So if you send me a message and I respond quickly, we close the loop quickly.\u201d Trust, conversely, needs time. As Chris puts it, quoting a German friend: \u201cGoing in the wrong direction very quickly is not efficient. So in other words, if you\u2019re going in the right direction slowly, that\u2019s actually maybe better than going super fast and going in circles.\u201d This is especially true for Chinese companies going overseas. Chris identifies cross-cultural communication as the primary challenge: \u201cThey all have great products, but they still lack a ability to communicate in a cross-cultural setting.\u201d And crucially, human connection matters more than technology: \u201cGet on an airplane and be on site at a trade event, visit your clients in person, have coffee with them. So none of that can be done by AI, interestingly.\u201d When asked about his non-negotiables, Chris identifies three foundational principles. First, compliance, \u201cYou need to follow the law anywhere you go,\u201d he states simply. Second, authenticity: \u201cIf you\u2019re not authentic, you will lose the trust of the local market.\u201d Chris shares what he calls the 20-60-20 rule: 20% of people will always love you, 60% don\u2019t really care either way, and 20% will actively dislike you. \u201cWhen we\u2019re doing our design work and business work, it\u2019s important to bring your true self to the table because then you\u2019ll attract the consumers, your customers, your partners, your friends who are like minded.\u201d Third, purpose beyond profit. \u201cWe\u2019re not just doing business and doing design work and doing PR for money. I think we want to make the world a better place,\u201d Chris reflects. For him, this is personal: \u201cI have a nine year old son who\u2019s half Chinese. So what we\u2019re doing is helping Chinese companies and helping China tell their story in a more effective way overseas and building more trust and friendship.\u201d In the rapid-fire segment, Chris crystallizes several key insights. His quickest litmus test for international success? \u201cThe team, the team behind the product.\u201d The most underused asset in cross-border launches? \u201cThe actual relationships\u2026 in the local market.\u201d And what beats beautiful design every time? \u201cA brand mission. So a mission, a worthwhile cause to do something.\u201d  What emerges from this conversation is a fundamental truth: design is never neutral. Every choice, from fonts to colors to the people you feature in your imagery, communicates values. The challenge is ensuring those values translate as intended across cultural boundaries. Chris\u2019s approach is both systematic and deeply human: use checklists and structured processes, but never forget that trust is built person to person, through authentic relationships and genuine commitment to local communities. For designers and brand strategists working in an increasingly global marketplace, the message is clear: you can\u2019t afford to be culturally naive. What \u201cworks\u201d in your home market may actively harm you elsewhere. But with the right approach, thoughtful localization, authentic partnership, and patience, brands can successfully make their intention travel across borders.

The Samsung HW-Q800F is everything you could possibly want from a soundbar-sub combo. It supplies deep, room-swallowing bass, phenomenal dialogue clarity, and expansive Dolby Atmos effects. The new sub is much sleeker and compact, there are tons of features to unearth, and it's regularly available at a more-than reasonable price. It really doesn't get much better than that, does it? Phenomenally impactful audio Very good Dolby Atmos performance Sleeker sub than predecessor Incredible feature-set No surround speakers for true surround sound HDMI passthrough is 4K, but only 60Hz Some may wish for a splash of style  Why you can trust TechRadar     We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test.  The Samsung HW-Q800F is the 2025 edition of Samsung\u2019s yearly Dolby Atmos soundbar-sub combo, and it proves that the South Korean giant maintains a firm grip on the home theater throne. This 5.1.2 channel soundbar shakes things up a bit by bundling in a far more compact and sleek-looking subwoofer, which is far easier to integrate into your TV setup. Good news though \u2013 there\u2019s been no sacrifice on power, with 400W and 11 speakers powering this combo. And I really felt every ounce of power the Samsung HW-Q800F had to offer. I experienced truly imposing, yet agile and clean bass, which made grandiose movie scores that touch more immersive and booming sound effects even more impactful. This is also one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars I\u2019ve tested, with precise mapping of on-screen action and expansive imaging, taking my favorite movies to the next level. Of course, you won't get the full surround sound experience that something like the Samsung HW-Q990F will provide, solely due to that model's inclusion of rear speakers. But the Q800F comes in at a far cheaper price-point, and the option is there to add rears if you'd like. Also, the sound you do get out of the box is already highly impactful, expansive, and engrossing. Anyway, it's not only movies the Q800F excels with. This soundbar is also fairly gifted in the music department, and supports streaming over Wi-Fi, so you\u2019ll be able to enjoy your favorite tracks via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect and the like. Bluetooth 5.3 is also available, alongside the regular connectivity methods like HDMI eARC and digital optical. You\u2019ll find an HDMI input port on the soundbar, which supports passthrough at 4K at 60Hz. As a gamer, I was hoping for this to be raised to 120Hz for 2025, though this is a fairly minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. Beyond connectivity, there are so many excellent features to uncover on the Q800F. You\u2019ve got some returning characters like Q-Symphony, which can integrate a compatible TV into your soundbar system, as well as SpaceFit Surround Pro for room calibration, and Active Voice Amplification for enhancing dialogue in movies or TV shows. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This time out, Samsung\u2019s added Moderate Bass, though, which disables the sub and lets the main soundbar pick up those low frequency sounds. That\u2019s pretty handy if you\u2019re temporarily short on space, for example. Combine that with an excellent array of sound modes, a nifty companion app, and support for a range of formats \u2013 of course including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X \u2013 and the Q800F offers just about everything you could want from a mid-range soundbar. Design-wise, the real highlight is that new, compact subwoofer, but you\u2019re also getting that typical Samsung quality, with a durable main bar that uses a classy metallic grille and LED display. Sure, the overall package isn\u2019t as flashy as some models, but the smaller sub makes for an upgrade over 2024\u2019s Samsung HW-Q800D (I'm not sure why Samsung skipped over E, but it did). Set-up is sensationally straightforward \u2013 it's plug and play, with no pesky in-app requirements, no awkward pairing issues, and very few wires. The sub instantly connected to the soundbar the moment I hooked it up to the power, I didn\u2019t even have to do anything. And there\u2019s a physical remote included here that is as sleek and easy-to-use as ever. At the end of it all, the Samsung HW-Q800F is a stellar soundbar that hits just about all of the right notes. It offers wonderful performance for Atmos movies and music, its new sub is a considerable upgrade design-wise and still packs phenomenal low-end output, and there are tons of features to take advantage of. It\u2019s also regularly available at a modest price (more on that below), making it a top value option. As a result, its easily up there with some of the best soundbars around. The Samsung HW-Q800F is the 2025 edition of Samsung\u2019s mid-range combination of a full-length soundbar and an accompanying sub, coming one year after the HW-Q800D, which I also reviewed. It sits a level below the Samsung HW-Q990F, which comes bundled with rear speakers, but as a result, will set you back a bit more. Initially, the Samsung HW-Q800F launched with a list price of $1,099 \/ \u00a3799 \/ AU$1,099. That\u2019s $100 \/ \u00a350 more than last year\u2019s model in the US and UK respectively, but no different in Australia. Having said that, you\u2019re unlikely to pay anywhere near that much now, even though this is a very recent release. I\u2019m seeing it sell for less than $750 \/ \u00a3600 \/ AU$800 with various reputable online retailers.      Dimensions Main soundbar: 43.7 x 2.4 x 4.7 inches \/ 1110.7 x 60.4 x 120mm; subwoofer: 9.8 x 9.9 x 9.8 inches \/ 249 x 251.8 x 249mm Speaker channels 5.1.2 Connections 1x HDMI input, 1x HDMI eARC, digital optical, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.3 Dolby Atmos \/ DTS:X Yes \/ Yes Sub included Yes Rear speakers included No There\u2019s a truly exhaustive set of features to uncover on the Samsung HW-Q800F, which builds nicely on what its predecessor had to offer. It again takes up a 5.1.2 speaker configuration, but this time offers 400W of power, as opposed to the Q800D\u2019s 360W. There\u2019s a new, compact sub too, but I\u2019ll speak more about that later. Of course, there\u2019s full support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, alongside the usual Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby 5.1 and DTS: HD-Master Audio. You can also connect to the soundbar in a whole host of ways \u2013 through the typical HDMI eARC method, but also via digital optical, Bluetooth, or over Wi-Fi. You\u2019ll discover an HDMI in port on the soundbar as well, which supports 4K passthrough, but as we saw last year, only at 60Hz. Some gamers will be frustrated by the lack of 120Hz support, which can be used for silky 120fps gameplay in titles like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch 2. I hope Samsung upgrades this in 2026, but until then, gamers will have to access 120Hz via a compatible TV\u2019s own HDMI ports. Admittedly, that\u2019s a pretty small con given the wide range of options available with the Q800F. SpaceFit Surround Pro can effectively calibrate the soundbar and sub combo based on your room\u2019s acoustics, there\u2019s a voice enhancement mode, EQ and sub level adjustments, and a bass enhancement option. All of last year\u2019s sound modes are back and all work brilliantly too. These include: Standard; Adaptive; Surround; and Game. If you were wondering, adaptive harnesses AI in order to assess on-screen content and deliver tailored audio \u2013 I mainly stuck with this throughout my testing time. Something new for this generation of Samsung soundbars is Moderate Bass, which deactivates the sub and leaves the soundbar to handle lower frequencies on its own. That's useful if you\u2019re short on space. If you\u2019ve got a compatible Samsung TV from 2022 or later, you\u2019ll be able to access some features a little easier via your TV menu. But you\u2019ll also get access to Q-Symphony, which makes use of your TV\u2019s built-in speakers, and combines them with your soundbar and sub for an even more powerful and expansive listening experience.      Much like its predecessor, the Samsung HW-Q800F is a standout performer in the sound quality department. It harnesses the might of 11 speakers and has a high maximum power output of 400W spread across the soundbar and new compact sub. And that high-power performance was incredibly evident to me, with Samsung\u2019s combo delivering impactful, sometimes even room-shaking sound. When I threw on The Boy and the Heron, I flicked to a scene in which a horde of fish and frogs shout \u201cJOIN US\u201d at the protagonist, Mahito. Throughout this encounter, there\u2019s meant to be incredibly deep, all-encompassing bass, and the HW-Q800F replicated this to great effect, with a low-end rumble rippling through our testing space. It was a similar story with a 4K UHD Blu-Ray of Top Gun: Maverick. The sound of jet engines firing up was truly seismic \u2013 the bass response was almost sizable enough to make me feel as if I was in the cinema. This movie is also a great test for Atmos, so I continued watching until Tom Cruise flew the jet up and overhead, and the impression of height genuinely impressed me. Sure, the verticality you\u2019ll get from genuine overhead speakers will take things to another level, but the up-firing speakers onboard undoubtedly performed their role to a high standard. We recently called in one of my favorite movies of all time, The Mask, in 4K UHD, so naturally I tested that with the HW-Q800F as well. And this soundbar seamlessly nailed every task this chaotic film threw at it. The roar of thunder at the beginning came through with ferocious force, the high-pitched shatter of windows had a real bite to it, but never sounded tinny or uncontrolled, and dialogue between Stanley and Tina was unbelievably clear. Atmos performance was again impeccable, and the general positioning of speech and other sounds was top-class. When Tina sits down at the back of Stanley\u2019s bank to \u2018open an account\u2019, her voice is placed with pin-point precision. When some mob B-rate gangsters play air hockey in the background of a scene, the smack of the puck sounded distant yet well-defined, just as it should be. So, when it comes to movies, you\u2019re getting awesome performance here, but I was wondering if the same case would apply for music. I started with a couple of tracks using the Atmos format, and was not disappointed. In Dream of Arrakis by Hans Zimmer, the attack of percussion in the intro was full of intent, and swept right across the soundbar. Deep bass, which is reminiscent of an increasingly racing heartbeat, had some real punch to it, and deeply immersed me into the track. Meanwhile, haunting artifacts weren\u2019t lost at all, and felt well positioned in the backdrop of the track. Percussion was also incredibly well positioned, and distorted vocals had phenomenal width, demonstrating the seriously expansive sound of the HW-Q800F. Even with basic stereo format music, the soundbar performed very well indeed. 12 O.C Riddim by M-High demonstrated the new subwoofer\u2019s talents in the deep bass department, with agile, low-reaching performance. Even All Along the Watchtower by Jimi Hendrix, I was struck by subtle percussion, tonally accurate and energized electric guitars, and clean, defined vocals. Sure, channel separation won\u2019t compete with some of the best stereo speakers, but I still got a very enjoyable listen here. Whatever content you\u2019re consuming, the Q800F is well-equipped to deliver optimum quality. The SpaceFit Surround Pro feature optimized the soundbar\u2019s sound for the acoustics of our testing space, while the various sound modes all had a clearly differentiated approach, with Adaptive my general go-to. I was partial to Surround, too, which whips up an even wider soundstage. Of course, you won\u2019t get the ultimate surround sound experience due to the lack of rear speakers, which would create genuine wrap-around sound. If you want those, you\u2019ll have to splash out a fair amount more on the Samsung HW-Q990F, or separately purchase SWA-9500S speakers. Even without these, though, the Q800F plates up the expansive, deep, and well-rounded performance we\u2019ve come to expect from Samsung\u2019s home theater technology.      The Samsung HW-Q800D was almost indistinguishable from its predecessor, but this time around, Samsung has endeavoured to make the generational change a lot more apparent. It's done this by bundling a new, compact subwoofer, which is so much easier to fit into your setup than the previous tall block that was included. You still get that great low-end performance too, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice substance for style. The main bar itself has remained the same, and it's fairly standard stuff. It's got a nice metallic grille with an easy-to-read display on the front, but you\u2019re getting the traditional black bar. If you want something with a little more style, the retro-style Marshall Heston 120 or sleeker Sonos Arc Ultra might be better options. Still, you\u2019re getting strong build quality from this soundbar and sub combo \u2013 both units have a sturdy feel and don\u2019t look cheap or plasticky. I\u2019m also a fan of the straightforward physical controls on the soundbar and the slim remote, which is packaged in.      I was delighted with how easy the Samsung HW-Q800F was to set up and use. I simply plugged the soundbar and sub into the power, and connected the main bar to the Samsung S95F via its HDMI eARC port. There was no complex pairing process to complete, the sub was pre-paired with the soundbar, and the two worked in tandem right out of the box. I\u2019d had some minor trouble with the Q800D, so it was satisfying to get a hassle-free setup this time out. Unlike some rivals, Samsung is still packing a physical remote with its soundbars, and the one I received with the Q800F worked as expected, allowing easy control over volume, sound modes, sub level, and more. I did also use the SmartThings app, though, which grants control over all of that, as well as EQ adjustment, voice amplification, and room calibration, among other things. The app was simply laid out and navigating the various menus never caused me any confusion. Its also worth flagging that the Q800F has an inbuilt mic that can be used with Amazon Alexa or Google voice assistants \u2013 there\u2019s even a handy button to activate or deactivate this on top of the bar.      Even though the Samsung HW-Q800F has a $100 \/ \u00a350 (no change in Australia) over its predecessor, I really don\u2019t think it matters very much. Firstly, you\u2019re getting more power in a more compact, sleek overall package. And crucially, you\u2019re almost certainly not going to meet the list price of $1,099 \/ \u00a3799 \/ AU$1,099. Yes, even months after release, I\u2019m already seeing the Q800F sell for less than $750 \/ \u00a3600 \/ AU$800, with plenty of availability too. And when you consider the fact that you\u2019re getting a fantastic soundbar and sub combo, which packs awesome Atmos, brilliant bass, and a broad feature-set, I think you\u2019re getting a lot of bang for your buck. Realistically, the HW-Q990F is still going to cost hundreds of dollars and pounds (etc.) more than the Q800F for some time \u2013 and although that system is the superior package for surround sound, those seeking a cheaper option will surely be satisfied with the capabilities of the Q800F. Attributes Notes Rating Features Exhaustive sound enhancement options, Atmos and DTS:X support, HDMI passthrough only at 60Hz. 4.5\/5 Sound quality Fantastic clarity across all frequencies, epic Atmos for movies and music. 5\/5 Design Soundbar itself doesn\u2019t quite ooze style, but the new compact sub is a hit, with a neat remote and physical controls. 4.5\/5 Setup & usability Plug and play setup, seamless soundbar and sub pairing, easy to control. 5\/5 Value Regularly on sale for a very modest price considering the overall quality available here. 4.5\/5 You\u2019re looking for the ultimate value packageConsidering this soundbar-sub combo is regularly on sale for a lot less than its official price, I think it's a fantastic value package. You\u2019ll struggle to find a Dolby Atmos soundbar with this much power, this much quality, and this many features for less than $750 \/ \u00a3600 \/ AU$800. You want awesome Atmos for movies and musicI was very impressed with the Dolby Atmos effects available through the HW-Q800F. It mapped on-screen action with incredible accuracy, made instruments sound as if they were playing in the corners of our testing room, and generally whipped up pleasingly expansive sound. You want the ultimate surround sound experienceDue to the lack of rear speakers \u2013 at least out of the box \u2013 the Samsung HW-Q800F won\u2019t give you the most full surround sound experience out there. If you want the best of the best in this regard, I\u2019d consider spending more on the spectacular Samsung HW-Q990F or purchasing rear speakers separately. You\u2019re after something with styleAlthough you get great build quality from the Samsung HW-Q800F, alongside a new compact sub, I\u2019d be lying if I said this bundle was the prettiest thing I\u2019ve seen. The Marshall soundbar below, and even the Sonos Arc Ultra have more going for themselves in the looks department.

It packs in good sound quality, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, an easy setup process, and a brilliant companion app. Considering I\u2019ve seen it on sale for less than $500 \/ \u00a3350 \/ AU$600, that\u2019s a whole lot of bang for your buck. Read our full Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 review. Marshall Heston 120Here\u2019s something different in just about every sense. Marshall\u2019s debut soundbar is an all-in-one model, meaning it doesn\u2019t come with a separate sub, but it sure doesn\u2019t skimp on bass. It puts up a deep, immersive, and expansive audio performance that seriously impressed me, hence the award of a five-star rating. It offers great Dolby Atmos for movies and music, and comes with all the connectivity options you could want. It's quite pricey, especially if you want to add the Heston Sub 200 for additional low-end power, but for the premium look and audio on offer, I think it's still a top option. Read our full Marshall Heston 120 review. To test the Samsung HW-Q800F, I spent hours watching movies, listening to music, and exhausting all of its available features at the Future Labs TV testing space. During this time, I had the soundbar hooked up to the sensational Samsung S95F OLED TV, which opened up a bunch of exclusive options, such as Q-Symphony. I used the various sound modes on offer while watching movies \u2013 predominantly in Dolby Atmos via 4K UHD Blu-rays on the Panasonic DP-UB820 \u2013 but I did also watch some non-Atmos content to assess quality across the board. On top of that, I made use of Tidal Connect to assess the soundbar\u2019s capabilities with Dolby Atmos and stereo mixes of some tunes I\u2019m deeply familiar with after regularly testing with them. More generally, I've tested tons of soundbars here at TechRadar \u2013 everything from ultra-cheap options like the Hisense HS214 through to pricier models like the Marshall Heston 120. Crucially, I also reviewed and lived with last year\u2019s Samsung HW-Q800D soundbar, so I\u2019ve personally experienced the difference made by upgrading to the 2025 edition of Samsung\u2019s soundbar and sub combo.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"The critically-acclaimed Razer Wolverine V3 Pro and Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition just received massive early Black Friday discounts  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Razer is my personal go-to company for third-party Xbox controllers. They rarely, if ever, miss the mark for achieving solid controls with zero latency and comfy ergonomics so I can play for hours without damaging my wrists. Two of Razer's best Xbox controllers from its current V3 series that live up to this high standard are currently enjoying discounts, a week ahead of Black Friday. These include the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro wireless controller, which is off by 20% for $159.99 at Amazon, and the Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition, which is on sale with a whopping 40% discount for $59.99 at Amazon. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro takes the strengths of past controllers to create the ultimate wireless Xbox controller, thanks to its Hall Effect sticks, Razer mouse switch tech, and insane 1000Hz polling rate on PC. The Tournament Edition features all the advanced tech of its premium V3 Pro counterpart, like Hall Effect sticks and Razer Mouse switches, while trading wireless connectivity for a wired-only connection to achieve a more affordable price.      Now personally, my favorite Razer controller will always be the Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma, but I can't deny my colleague, Richard Devine's, enthusiasm for the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, as he gave it a near-perfect review score of 4.5\/5, for good reason. It's an astonishingly well-made Xbox controller with a smooth and comfy ergonomic design and super-responsive controls that don't suffer any latency thanks to Razer's unique HyperSpeed wireless connectivity tech, and high polling rates of 220Hz on Xbox Series X|S, and 1000Hz on PC. It also features triggers and additional backpedals and bumpers with Razer Mouse tech, and Hall Effect analog sticks increase the controller's input accuracy and performance. These features can be really useful in fast-paced, first-person shooters like Call of Duty Black Ops 7 as they'll help you achieve mouse+keyboard levels of precision when aiming and firing your guns.      So, if you need a wireless controller with pinpoint accurate controls to help beat your foes in competitive PvP games like Call of Duty or Arc Raiders, then the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is a fine choice. However, if you can't afford the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro at its discounted price of $159.99 at Amazon, or you don't care about wireless connectivity, then I recommend its wired-only sibling, the Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition. It features all the technological advancements of the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, while sacrificing wireless connectivity for a much more affordable MSRP, which has dropped even further from $99.99 to $59.99 at Amazon. Hall Effect sticks are analog sticks equipped with magnetic sensors to detect thumb movement with increased precision, while making them more durable and safeguarded from \"stick drift\". The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro and Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition are compatible with Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is having alternative discounts for $169.99 at Walmart and $169.99 at Best Buy. Meanwhile, the Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition is also on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy. Black Friday is scheduled for November 28, 2025, but we recommend not waiting until then for big discount deals, as retailers have already jumped the gun to cut prices down.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Olga Pankova \/ Getty Images  When you hit your 60s and retirement is right around the corner, you might find yourself thinking a lot about your 401(k). How does what you have saved compare to other people your age? And how much do you really need for retirement?   While it can be tempting to compare your savings to your peers, how much you need to have saved will depend on when you plan to retire and what you want that retirement to look like.   According to Empower, the average 401(k) balance for someone in their 60s was $568,040 as of June 2025. This balance was slightly lower than the $607,055 average 401(k) balance for those in their 50s, presumably because some people in their 60s have already retired and begun taking distributions from their 401(k).   Keep in mind that averages can be easily skewed: just a few 401(k)s with very high (or very low) balances can drastically impact the average. That's why you might want to pay more attention to the median, or the middle-of-the-road number. The median amount that those in their 60s had saved as of June 2025 was $188,792.   If you\u2019re looking at these numbers and worrying about how your own retirement savings compare, you\u2019re not alone. According to a survey by Western & Southern Financial Group, 47% of Baby Boomers (who make up the majority of those in their 60s, as the oldest members of Generation X turn 60 in 2025) are not confident in their ability to retire comfortably. Another 11% of Baby Boomers are unsure whether they'll be able to retire comfortably.   The same survey clearly identified why: Baby boomers believe they need an average of $760,000 saved to retire comfortably. Gen X expects to need even more: $1.18 million. Average and median 401(k) savings for those in their 60s are far below these amounts.   However, how much you need to retire depends on a variety of factors, particularly your lifestyle and your health. Rather than looking solely at averages, it\u2019s helpful to look at your personal situation to determine how much you need to save.   One retirement savings rule suggests having eight times your preretirement annual income saved by age 60. So if you make $75,000 per year, you would need $600,000 saved by age 60.   Another calculation is based on the 4% rule, which suggests that retirees withdraw 4% of their 401(k) in their first year of retirement, then adjust this for inflation in each following year. Following this rule would mean you need to have 25 times your annual expenses saved. So if you expect to spend $36,000 a year in retirement, you will need to have $900,000 saved.   Keep in mind that most retirees don\u2019t live on their 401(k) alone. Most retirees in the United States receive Social Security benefits. You may also have investments, an individual retirement account (IRA), or even a side hustle that you plan to continue in retirement to supplement your 401(k) savings.   The Western & Southern survey found that 90% of Baby Boomers and 71% of Gen X expect to rely on Social Security as their primary retirement income, whereas only about half of Millennials and Gen Z (55% and 51%, respectively) do.   If you're in your 60s and your 401(k) isn\u2019t where you want it to be, here's how to boost your 401(k) savings in the last few years before you retire.   In 2025, the annual limit for 401(k) contributions for many people is $23,500. If you\u2019re in your early 60s, though, you can put away even more. If you are age 60, 61, 62, or 63, you can make additional catch-up contributions of $11,250, for a total of $34,750. If you are age 64 or older, your catch-up contribution level is $7,500 for a total of $31,000 in 2025.   Alexa Kane, CFP, CDFA, a financial planner at Pearl Planning, recommends that anyone approaching retirement get as much as they can out of their workplace retirement benefits.   \u201cIf your employer offers a match on retirement contributions, contribute enough to get the full match,\u201d she said, even if you\u2019ve never maxed out your employer match before.   Kane also suggested automating savings to take the guesswork out of retirement contributions.   \u201cMany retirement plans can be set up to automatically increase contributions by a percentage annually,\u201d she said.   In general, investors tend to hold more stocks in their 401(k)s when they are younger, taking on more risk in exchange for more growth. It\u2019s common to gradually shift to a more conservative balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets as you near retirement. If your 401(k) is invested in a target-date fund, then this shift happens automatically.   If you\u2019re in your 60s but feel like you aren\u2019t on track with your savings, don\u2019t immediately shift everything to conservative assets. Prioritizing growth for a few more years may help your 401(k) increase significantly in this decade. As you get closer to retirement, a gradual shift toward bonds and away from stocks will help protect your assets.  A financial planner can assess what asset allocation is best for you and advise you on when that allocation needs to change.  If you are part of the 51% who plan to downsize in retirement, consider downsizing your living situation now instead. Downsizing before you retire can significantly decrease your living expenses by reducing costs such as:   If you are strategic about where you move, you can even prioritize things like access to public transportation, which can further reduce your living expenses by allowing you to drive less or own fewer cars.   Decreasing your living expenses can allow you to put more into tax-advantaged retirement accounts now, giving the money time to grow. This can be especially helpful if you are trying to max out your catch-up contributions in your early 60s, when you can put even more into your 401(k) pretax.   Working with a financial advisor as you approach retirement can help you figure out not just how much money to save, but also what kind of retirement you want and how you can make that happen.   \u201cThere are many pictures of retirement,\u201d Kane said. \u201cAnd with any retirement plan, we say, \u2018You can do anything, but not everything.\u2019 There are pros and cons for every decision.\u201d   Working with an advisor can help you think through your options and what tradeoffs you might have to make for certain choices. For example, many retirees like the idea of living abroad to get access to a lower cost of living, including cheaper healthcare. But the choice isn\u2019t just between a more expensive life in one country and a more affordable life in another.   \u201cA large international move requires careful planning and an understanding of associated laws and regulations,\u201d Kane said. \u201cYou are still required to file U.S. taxes while living abroad. You also need to understand the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and the Foreign Tax Credit (FTC).\u201d   A financial advisor can walk you through all these considerations and help you decide what kind of retirement makes sense based on your resources and priorities.   It can be tempting to compare your retirement savings with your peers. While following certain benchmarks can help you judge whether your 401(k) is on track, the right amount to have saved for retirement will depend on a number of factors that are unique to your lifestyle and retirement plans.   Your early 60s, before you retire, are a great time to check in with a financial advisor and take stock of your retirement planning and savings. If you aren\u2019t on track, an advisor will be able to suggest various strategies, such as taking advantage of catch-up contributions, reducing expenses through downsizing, or rethinking the asset allocation in your 401(k).

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Joby Aviation's latest iteration of its autonomous all-electric S4 air taxi VTOL aircraft has made its maiden flight. The new variant aimed at the defense market boasts a turbine-electric hybrid powertrain for greater range and endurance. For years, Joby has been developing its air taxi technology with an eye on the civilian aviation market. The company's prototype has already accumulated 50,000 miles (80,467 km) of flight test miles and is well on its way to FAA certification. Now, in conjunction with L3Harris, the latest flight on November 7, 2026 at Joby's Marina, California, facility marks the latest modification of its S4 air taxi to meet the needs of military customers by upgrading the electric propulsion system with a turbine to generate electricity to keep the batteries topped up. The civilian version of the S4 has a range of 84 nautical miles (100 miles, 161 km), but if the rotorcraft is to become suitable for Loyal Wingman or low-altitude support missions, it will require much greater range and flight endurance \u2013 especially with the return of large land battles and geopolitics concentrating more on the Indo-Pacific region. The turbine is intended to increase range this by acting as a top-up generator, though exactly how big a boost it will provide hasn't yet been disclosed. However, a hydrogen-electric hybrid conversion of an S4 demonstrator in 2024 achieved a non-stop flight of 561 miles (903 km). In addition to the turbine, the new variant incorporates Joby's proprietary SuperPilot autonomous system, which handles complex flight functions, including mission management and navigation. The company seems to be going the whole hog with this because the image released of the prototype doesn't appear to have a cockpit, suggesting that the military version will be uncrewed and not a passenger carrier. According to Joby, the maiden flight of the prototype took place only three months after the public announcement of the concept and it is expected to begin mission demonstrations this year. \"It\u2019s imperative that we find ways to deliver new technology into the hands of American troops more quickly and cost-efficiently than we have in the past,\" said JoeBen Bevirt, CEO and Founder of Joby. \"Our vertical integration puts us in a unique position to deliver on this goal, moving from concept to demonstration \u2013 and from demonstration to deployment \u2013 at a pace that is unprecedented in today\u2019s aerospace and defense industry.\" Source: Joby Aviation","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":" Sweden\u2019s Vagabond Haven has crafted something special with the Nature Pod, a compact tiny house that proves you don\u2019t need a massive budget to embrace small-space living. Starting at just \u20ac14,380 (roughly US$16,600), this charming cabin-inspired dwelling delivers rustic aesthetics without the premium price tag typically attached to custom tiny homes. The Nature Pod feels like a breath of fresh air in a market where prices keep climbing, offering an accessible entry point for anyone curious about downsizing. Large windows flood the interior with natural light, creating an open atmosphere that makes the compact footprint feel intentional rather than restrictive. Measuring a modest 6 meters in length, the Nature Pod sits comfortably on a double-axle trailer, making it perfectly sized for European roads and regulations. What really sets this tiny house apart is its innovative construction method. Vagabond Haven eliminated traditional timber framing, replacing it with four inner-wall segments that support the outer walls built from 45-mm-thick ThermoWood. This streamlined approach reduces both material costs and assembly time while keeping the overall weight manageable. The engineered wood cladding and fiberglass roof shingles add durability without unnecessary expense, and buyers can even opt for an outdoor shower attachment for those warm summer evenings. Design: Vagabond Haven        Inside, the wood-finished interior radiates warmth and invites relaxation. The living room and bedroom occupy the rear section, anchored by a stunning floor-to-ceiling window that frames the outdoors like living artwork. A sofa bed provides sleeping space for two, with enough room for additional seating during waking hours. The layout feels intuitive, with the bedroom positioned to capture the best views while maintaining privacy from the rest of the home. Everything about this space encourages you to slow down and appreciate your surroundings. The kitchen occupies a central position and embraces minimalism out of necessity. A small fridge, sink, and two-burner propane cooktop handle essential meal preparation, while cabinetry provides storage for dishes and pantry items. Space remains for either a wardrobe or a wood-burning stove, letting owners customize based on their priorities and climate needs. The propane cooktop offers flexibility for off-grid living situations where electrical connections aren\u2019t available. At the front of the home, the bathroom keeps things simple and functional with a toilet, sink, and shower\u2014all the necessities without excess. The straightforward design makes cleaning easy and maintenance minimal.        Vagabond Haven includes ventilation and electrical installation in the base price, though the starting cost excludes furniture. The real customization potential emerges through the extensive options list. Buyers can choose between mounting the home on a trailer for mobility or placing it on simple foundations for a permanent installation. Off-grid enthusiasts can add solar panels and battery systems to achieve complete energy independence, though these upgrades will substantially increase the final price. The flexibility here means you can start basic and add features as your budget allows. The Nature Pod represents a refreshing approach to tiny house design. It strips away unnecessary complexity while preserving the essential elements that make small-space living appealing. The rustic aesthetic feels genuine rather than manufactured, and the Scandinavian influence brings a sense of calm simplicity to every detail. For those ready to downsize without compromising on style or comfort, this compact cabin offers a genuinely accessible way into the tiny house movement.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Bitcoin\u2019s long-term design came under renewed scrutiny on Friday after VanEck CEO Jan van Eck questioned whether the network provides sufficient encryption and privacy during an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cPower Lunch\u201d with anchor Brian Sullivan. Van Eck said the issues drawing attention inside the Bitcoin community go beyond short-term market swings. \u201cThere\u2019s something else going on within the Bitcoin community that non-crypto people need to know about,\u201d he said.  He added that VanEck evaluates Bitcoin\u2019s staying power the same way it assesses traditional assets. \u201cUltimately, VanEck has been around before Bitcoin. We will walk away from Bitcoin if we think the thesis is fundamentally broken. We don\u2019t right now, but you always have to look at the underlying technology and the crypto.\u201d He did not define what he meant by \u201cthe Bitcoin thesis,\u201d but his comments pointed toward the foundations that support Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability, including the strength of its cryptography, the network\u2019s readiness for advances in quantum computing and whether its privacy model aligns with user expectations. His remarks centered on whether Bitcoin has \u201cenough encryption\u201d and \u201cenough privacy,\u201d which he said were now central questions for parts of the Bitcoin community. Van Eck also said some longtime Bitcoin holders and self-described maxis have begun examining Zcash, calling it \u201csort of related to Bitcoin with a lot more privacy.\u201d He argued that Bitcoin\u2019s transparent ledger can clash with rising expectations around transaction confidentiality. \u201cWhen you move money around on the Bitcoin blockchain, you can see it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see it move from one wallet to another.\u201d Following the interview, van Eck posted a summary on X, asserting that the current Bitcoin bear market reflects \u201cthe onchain reality of the halving cycle (bearish for 2026), quantum-breaking-encryption concerns and the better privacy of Zcash.\u201d He also amplified VanEck portfolio manager Pranav Kanade\u2019s guidance to \u201cdollar cost average into bear markets.\u201d Bitcoin was trading around $84,643 during the CNBC interview. As of 9:15 a.m. UTC on Sunday, Nov. 23, the price was $86,204, up 2.4% in the past 24 hours but down 7.7% year to date and 31.6% below its all-time high of $126,080 on Oct. 6, 2025. Some voices in the broader crypto and research community echoed van Eck\u2019s concerns.  On Nov. 17, during a presentation on the Ethereum roadmap at the Devconnect conference in Argentina, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin warned that quantum computing could threaten elliptic curve cryptography, stating, \u201cElliptic curves are going to die.\u201d  Separately, in a Nov. 13 blog post, quantum computing researcher Scott Aaronson \u2014 the Schlumberger Centennial Chair of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin \u2014 wrote that \u201cgiven the current staggering rate of hardware progress,\u201d it is \u201ca live possibility\u201d that a fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of running Shor\u2019s algorithm could be built before the next U.S. presidential election in 2028. Others responded forcefully against van Eck\u2019s remarks. For example, Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3 and one of Bitcoin\u2019s earliest advocates, rejected the idea that Bitcoin maxis are turning to privacy alternatives. In a post on X, he wrote, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to point out a Bitcoin Maxi even if they were standing in front of you. You shouldn\u2019t be speaking on anything Bitcoin whatsoever. You\u2019re a crypto guy, stay in your lane and push the latest shitcoin narrative.\u201d Zcash\u2019s ZEC token has surged as privacy discussions intensify. ZEC is now the 13th-most valuable cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $9.43 billion and was recently trading at $578.35, up 17.3% in the past 24 hours, 121.3% over the past 30 days and 930% year to date. On Sept. 24, ZEC traded near $55.06.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"                  Pierre Koenig\u2019s Stahl House in Los Angeles\u2019 Hollywood Hills has been put up for sale. The modernist home, also known as Case Study House No. 22, was completed in 1960 as an exploration into new models of affordable, adaptable postwar housing. \u201cAfter 65 years, our family has made the heartfelt and very difficult decision to place the Stahl House on the market,\u201d the Stahl family noted in a message about the news. \u201cThis home has been the center of our lives for decades, but as we\u2019ve gotten older, it has become increasingly challenging to care for it with the attention and energy it so richly deserves.\u201d \u201cThe time has come to identify the next steward of Case Study House #22\u2014someone who not only appreciates its architectural significance but also understands its place in the cultural landscape of Los Angeles and beyond,\u201d the family added. \u201cIt is profoundly important to us that the new owner honor the legacy of our parents, Buck and Carlotta, respect Pierre Koenig\u2019s vision, and be committed to protecting the house today and far into the future.\u201d The house is constructed primarily of steel, glass, and concrete, reflecting Koenig\u2019s commitment to industrial materials and modernist principles. The home contains floor-to-ceiling glazing along the south and west elevations, creating uninterrupted views over Los Angeles, while a steel frame structure allows for large spans and minimal interior supports. The L-shaped plan arranges living spaces around a central terrace and pool, integrating indoor and outdoor environments. The site\u2019s steep hillside condition required significant engineering, including deep caissons and a cantilevered platform to support the structure. The home was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1999. Are you sure you want to block this user and hide all related comments throughout the site?

Please let us know Stateline Topic:Crime Authorities use various tools to recoup tobacco debts in their fight against the illicit industry. (ABC News) The apartments towering 40 stories over downtown Dubai are a world away from a street-level tobacco shop on a dull urban block of Queensland's Hervey Bay. The common thread is 36-year-old Mohammed Alfalahi. Mohammed Alfalahi was named in court documents as being behind five stores around Hervey Bay.\u00a0 (Supplied \/ ABC News: Peter Mullins) According to Queensland Health court documents, Dubai-based Alfalahi was allegedly operating a flagrant five-store illicit tobacco operation around the regional town and would just wear the cost of government fines. He used encrypted messages. He visited Australia intermittently for legal matters or business.\u00a0 And when raids on shops were finished and red Manchester or Marlboro cigarette packets seized, he would be slapped with a $3,000 or more fine, which would almost always be paid. \"The respondent seemingly considers the payment of the [fines] as just another cost of doing business, and the commercial benefit of continuing in the illicit trade appears to outweigh the intended deterrent impact of those penalties,\" Queensland Health said in a court submission this year. Health authorities and police seized more than 418,000 illicit cigarettes and 61.3 kilograms of loose tobacco in raids on Mr Mohammed Alfalahi's Hervey Bay stores. (Supplied: Wide Bay Hospital and Health Service) Mr Alfalahi was in October hit with a two-year court ban on selling tobacco. The order, meaning he risks a contempt finding if further dabbling in tobacco in Queensland, was among enforcement tools employed in an escalating conflict between governments and a ballooning black market tobacco trade. Those tools in Queensland include massively increasing fines since April this year. That rise was to counteract the perception that previous monetary penalties \u2014 like those against Mr Alfalahi \u2014 lacked sufficient sting against illegal operators. But data obtained in an ABC investigation also raises another dilemma: the bulk of tobacco fines \u2014 tens of millions of dollars \u2014 are not being repaid. Researchers believe it is too early to say if expanded powers, including higher fines and longer shutdowns, would effectively counter an illicit trade.\u00a0 But they said any increased powers needed to be backed up with adequate resourcing and coordination. Queensland's collections agency, the State Penalties Enforcement Register (SPER), argued it used various tools to recoup tobacco debts, including tapping bank accounts and long-term repayment plans.\u00a0 SPER once even impounded a $200,000 Mercedes AMG from a company director over a tobacco fine. Queensland Health, which issues the tobacco fines, added other enforcement tools including stock seizures or store closures. Its staffing levels this year for enforcement also increased by 43 officers, up 25 per cent. But it's a race against an illicit yet blatantly blossoming industry. And that's an industry frequented by a slab of the smoking public, some addicted, as federal levies jump on legal tobacco. A pack of 20 legal cigarettes now can cost almost $40 \u2014 more than $29 of that is from federal duties.\u00a0 Federal duties are a big chunk of the price of legal cigarettes. (ABC News: Peter Mullins) But the ABC just this month bought packs of illicit menthols and cigarettes for $10 or less from four stores across south-east Queensland within hours. The threat of fines is seemingly worth the risk.\u00a0 One store raided and temporarily shut down in September for suspected illicit sales was back up and this month selling cheap illegal Double Happiness cigarettes for $8. Customers were flowing into that store, Ya Habibi, in Oxley on Brisbane's west. Ya Habibi, in the Brisbane suburb of Oxley, was raided and temporarily shut down in September. (ABC News) Fines are issued to store owners, with major offences being for supplying illicit tobacco and vapes. For overall breaches of smoking laws, Queensland Health issued $73.3 million in fines between January 2024 and mid-October this year. Offenders paid off $3.6 million in the initial 28-day time frame, the department told the ABC. Some fines were withdrawn for factors including the penalty being contested, but the bulk of unpaid money has been sent to government debt collectors SPER. Of $54.9 million coming to SPER in that time, which includes an administrative fee, only $11.7 million in cash had been recovered. That $11.7 million equalled a collections rate of 21.2 per cent of tobacco fines sent to SPER. That is lower than recoveries across all fines, such as for speeding tickets, of 38.8 per cent. The bulk of tobacco fines in Queensland have not been paid yet. (ABC News: Peter Mullins) But SPER faces a tougher challenge from illegal tobacco.\u00a0 Debt-collection industry sources told the ABC a general rule of thumb was payment size influenced recoveries \u2014 smaller amounts were typically repaid at higher rates than larger amounts, plus criminals could simply be bad at repaying debts. Another potential problem is dummy owners.\u00a0 Court documents and sources with knowledge of the illicit trade say fake identities have been used in registering store owners or people have acted as patsy owners. It is unclear how big are some debtors; SPER refused to list top amounts owed, nor would it break down amounts owed before and after fines were lifted tenfold in April. An ABC investigation finds that among investments raking in the dollars for the Australian-founded Macquarie Group is the nation's billion-dollar illegal tobacco trade. That increase, to about $32,000 for individuals and $161,000 for companies behind stores, followed frustration that previous penalties were inadequate. That was demonstrated in court documents filed by Queensland Health against Mr Alfalahi. He was accused of being behind five shops around Hervey Bay \u2014 a town better known for attracting retirees to live and tourists to watch whales. The shops, with names including Su Casa Tobacconist and Main Street Tobacconist, were raided multiple times between 2023 and 2025.\u00a0 Almost 418,440 illicit cigarettes and 61.3 kilograms of illegal tobacco were seized from stores in June this year alone, according to court documents obtained by the ABC. Mohammed Alfalahi's store Main Street Tobacconist, in the Hervey Bay suburb of Pialba, was raided by Queensland Health and Queensland Police earlier this year. (ABC Wide Bay: James C Taylor) Items seized included a notebook where staff, in bubbly writing and doodles of love hearts, had jotted down inventory levels: \"Marlboro gold (will sell out tomorrow)\", or allegedly sales figures \u2014 one store's \"total\" for just one Monday was $22,950. Queensland Health said many fines issued against Mr Alfalahi under the old regime were paid. Those included personal fines such as $3,096 in November 2023, another $3,096 in January and again in April last year, two totalling $6,452 in October last year, another $3,226 in November last year, and a company fine of $15,480 in November 2023. \"The fact he has not contested payment \u2026 can be taken as an admission of past wrongdoing,\" Queensland Health alleged in court. \"The scale of his involvement and the period that he has persisted, despite the number of interactions he has had with the authorities, demonstrates an especially contemptuous attitude towards the regulatory scheme.\" Still, some larger fines totalling $30,960 \u2014 tied to a company he ran that owned one store \u2014 had been unpaid as of April this year. The ABC, via interviews, reviews of court records and attending dozens of illegal stores, can reveal new details and allegations about the trade. While Mr Alfalahi was listed in Queensland identification documents with a modest townhouse address in north Brisbane, in 2023 authorities also found a partially filled out international money order for him at one store. The address was a swanky two-tower complex near the Burj Khalifa Lake promenade in Dubai, boasting a New York Rockefeller Centre architectural feel. His lawyers, while not ultimately opposing Queensland Health's application, said Mr Alfalahi predominantly lived in Dubai while intermittently coming to Australia. Mr Alfalahi did not respond to requests for comment. Multiple sources with links to other illicit tobacco operators this month thought even with the increased fines, black market businesses remained large and might simply pay off fines to keep running. The sector is massive \u2014 an Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission paper this month estimated almost $3.3 billion in excise was lost to the illicit trade in the 2024 financial year alone. A myriad of agencies are involved in suppressing the sector, from Australian Border Force to the Australian Federal Police to Queensland Health and the Crime and Corruption Commission. Australian Border Force said it seized 435.46 tonnes of loose-leaf tobacco in the 2025 financial year. (ABC News: Peter Mullins) Samuel Brookfield, of the University of Queensland's School of Public Health, said a critical aspect in enforcement is coordinating work across agencies. Dr Brookfield, who is part of a research group looking to end what it calls a \"cigarette epidemic\", said the low level of Queensland fine repayments could indicate more staff were needed on the ground to enforce them. \"And also I think what that shows us is the scale of the problem as it's developed over the last five years,\u201d he told the ABC. He argued the massive range of illicit stores and owners created challenges for enforcers to establish how effectively to use those fines \"to have a systemic effect\". An Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission paper estimated almost $3.3 billion in excise was lost to the illicit trade in the 2024 financial year alone. (Supplied: Queensland Police Service) He said it was too early to say if increased fines \u2014 which he thought could be significant \u2014 and other penalties would be effective.\u00a0 But Dr Brookfield said the issue was complex and factors to consider included long-term examinations of enforcement results. He said society could avoid replicating some problems with the war on drugs, and positive steps now included not penalising users of illicit tobacco and allowing legal substance sales.\u00a0 He also said harm reduction measures, such as offering quitting programs, were essential. \"A big part of enforcement and a big part of why laws are respected as well is not just the iron hand of the law, forcing people to respect that law, but because people believe in it and think it is the right law,\" he said.

China Warns of Severe Consequences if Japan Fails To Retract Its Threats of Military Intervention Over Taiwan Scheerpost Apparently Japan used the same language that it used before invading China in WWII. Mercouris talks about it with smalltownvoice1. https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kq0uFa2nfPM Before the First Sino Japanese War, Japan claimed Qing China does not have real sovereignty over Taiwan after some Japanese sailors died in a fight with Taiwanese aborigines in whose affairs Chinese gov\u2019t did not interfere with.  (\u201cAborigines\u201d here are the \u201creal\u201d Taiwanese natives, a non Han people with many tribes who are related to SE Asians, not the \u201cwe are not Chinese\u201d Chinese who migrated to Taiwan over last half a dozen centuries.)  If the Chinese did not have real sovereignty over Taiwan, so the argument went, Japan was free to seize Taiwan.  So is the argument being reincarnated, with the non-native \u201cTaiwanese\u201d taking the place of the natives? farming is one of the last untapped markets for turning everything into a service:  everyone from John Deere to Elon is trying to make it happen. your farm will own nothing and you will be happy.

I wonder if that\u2019s down to the Neo Chinese punishment for that crime of a week\u2019s sequestration of the miscreants in the Sino Disney Bund? Graffiti = tragedy of the commons. Case study #81,292 on why America (and now W. Europe too) can\u2019t have nice public things. I am currently in Malta and there isn\u2019t a lot of graffiti here. About to head to Greece which has I think the most graffiti of any where I visit semi-regularly. I think how much graffiti a place has comes down to cultural factors (there are enough locals who consider it an art form) and intrinsic pride of place. Not sure how much effect negative stimulus like fines have until you get to Singapore style public caning. If you watch Alex Christoforou\u2019s walk & talk videos, people have noticed which countries have graffiti and which ones don\u2019t. So countries like Greece and Cyprus have graffiti everywhere while countries like Russia don\u2019t. Like you say, it mostly comes down to cultural factors. Personally I find most of it amateur rubbish. I\u2019ve noticed that almost every boxcar has graffiti on it-no doubt from students of the Krylon School of Art, while it\u2019s rare for an oil tanker car to have any\u2026 Why? Tank cars of oil and chemicals are loaded and unloaded in relatively secure locations. Oil is often in point-to-point unit trains with few stops. Most tank cars have nasty contents and probably are policed when standing in yards. The sides of tank cars are well off the ground and curved \u201ccanvas\u201d. Box cars and auto autoracks have the most graffiti. Autoracks must require tall ladders, gallons of paint and compressors. A spray can can\u2019t get you far on on 85 foot long autorack. My experience with chlorine (90,000 pounds of compressed chlorine gas per car), also.  I worked around them for large parts of two years.  They are inaccessible when loading and go straight through to their destination.  No sitting idle on sidings, ever.  I was 18 and still accustomed to running but I have never seen older men in their 40s and 50s run so fast while putting on their respirators (probably not much help under those circumstances) as the time a valve on a chlorine car failed!  Luckily the wind was from the east and the green cloud flowed toward the empty quarter of the plant and on out to the uninhabited surrounds, leaving a long path of dead vegetation in its wake.  The plant site is now the #1 SuperFund site in the State of Georgia.  Maybe #2,  Imagine that! Which reminds me, we haven\u2019t seen any media reports lately of Biden\u2019s trainbombs, although I assume that\u2019s still an occasional occurrence in America\u2019s honor. Trains are still crashing, we just don\u2019t talk about it anymore. We had a very significant derailment about 30 minutes east of where I live about 3 weeks ago. 53 coal cars derailed into a creek, damaging the bridge crossing and cancelling the Amtrack service that runs to the Tidewater of Virginia. Nothing explosive, but I doubt coal is harmless in sensitive wetlands. Cleanup is ongoing as far as I know. Reporting has ceased. https:\/\/www.wric.com\/news\/local-news\/new-kent-county\/amtrak-service-adjustments-repairs-derailment\/ Somewhere, an anonymous bureaucrat or two decided that East Palestine did not merit attention or respect, let alone a visit.

Actually, graffiti was invented in Austria, by Joseph Kyselak. Next time I\u2019m in the Alps, I\u2019ll bring along a spray can and mark my territory on some rockface. a la an aboriginal hand print from 10,000 BC Next time The Rev Kev is in the Austrian Alps, he\u2019ll bring along a Vermont snow plow. :-) Not only that those are screens, but the scenes of aquatic life are CGI.

This work documents a benchmark run, tying together different scales of simulation to match with different computing resources. That is, itself, an ambitious project: >> Storing those degrees of freedom alone requires 8 TiB of main memory in double precision, more than the biggest announced trillion-parameter AI models. Hopefully, this can pull in massive parallelism, and put to good use a new generation of programmers. Their adaptation of Fortran rang a particular bell, that\u2019s how we wrote our code at the groundwater modelling lab. But\u2026 a poorly understood input parameter can swamp the fineness of detail with noise. Clouds, for instance. Hopefully, this can help us understand the parameter better. But there\u2019s \u2018hopefully\u2019 again. I\u2019ve identified my bias, it\u2019s that this is proof-of-concept for massive administrative oversight. Reminds me of university staff:admin ratios, or the F-35. How is it to be tested before the ricebowls are all stacked up? Are the minds going to understanding the climate system; or understanding the technical computational system; or the funding system? \u201cThe world lost its climate gamble\u201d Here is the money, The missed opportunities between 1997 and 2015 are the failures of the Kyoto protocol to bend the global emissions curve. There then followed a missed decade since the Paris agreement. We didn\u2019t do so well bending the Covid curve either. Maybe we will do better on the time travel solution. I don\u2019t think so, if Art Bell was actually interviewing a time traveler from 2063, as he claimed. He was sent back to find heat-tolerant land race grain seed so that he could sequence them to transmit the data to the future so the varieties could be recreated and feed the remnants of civilization.  I used to love tuning in for that stuff late night in the 80s and 90s. I\u2019d have to think the X Files writers got some ideas from Coast to Coast. I want to believe. \u2018Maybe we will do better on the time travel solution.\u2019 It might be like that original Star Trek Episode where the inhabitants of a doomed planet built themselves a time machine. The inhabitants then individually chose a time period from their civilization\u2019s past that they could travel to and where they could live out their lives. Christopher Nolan\u2019s movie TENET is actually a riff on this, as its rationale is that the Future is fighting a temporal cold war with us, sending artifacts back that will destroy our civilization and change history so climate change doesn\u2019t happen and their Earth isn\u2019t doomed. Nolan wrote the script and it was fairly clever stuff. The bad guys \u2014 us \u2014 won. But it went whoosh over most people\u2019s head and was his worst-performing film commercially.  (Granted, it was released at the Covid pandemics height.) So I suspect that he won\u2019t do anything that clever again. Same plot as Terminator? As one of the characters says in Tenet while explaining the premise: \u2018don\u2019t try to understand it.\u2019 Indeed. Speaking of explaining the premise of a time travel movie, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aVfpUBtdGLs Noting says clever script like an African American 007 going undercover as a cop and fireman in former Soviet Union. I thought the movie was based on a stand-up comedy bit by Trevor Noah. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LdJ67285W0 Nature is sorting it out.

And if Maduro holds firm, then Trump may have to take up that deal that Maduro offered weeks ago. With his belligerent style he is probably inclined to just bomb and invade the place except for one thing. All year long he has believed Zelenski, Kellogg and Lyndsay Graham how the Ukraine was holding their own and Russians have been suffering horrific casualties. But now reality has slapped him in the face and even he can see that the Russians are rapidly snapping up territory and are winning. Trump\u2019s reaction was that 28 point \u201cpeace\u201d plan which is nothing more that a freeze in place while Trump profits off of it but the Russians won\u2019t buy it. So maybe now he is wondering if all those stories told by Rubio that if he invades Venezuela, then the people will be throwing flowers in front of advancing US troops and not IEDs may also be the same sort of bs. Maybe too he has to consider that as he goes into next year\u2019s midterms, he could be stuck in two quagmires \u2013 the one in the Ukraine and one in Venezuela if he invades. And both would be blamed on Trump even if he does try to throw Rubio under a bus. The subtitle to Market Watch\u2019s article is, imo, more interesting for reasons that the current stock market valuations and activity have been likened to a bubble, the 1929 crash, and the dot-com crash. According to MW, \u201dFriday\u2019s market rebound was \u2018not built on anything solid but something very ephemeral,\u2019\u201d says strategist. In 1929, it\u2019s worth noting, the stock market peaked on 9\/3\/1929 and then crashed on Black Thursday 10\/24\/1929 and again on Black Tuesday 10\/29\/29 but that was just the beginning. There were a number of opportunities to buy the dip and the market rose but it declined even more and did not reach bottom until 7\/8\/1932. The dot-com bubble peaked on 3\/10\/2000 and again there were multiple opportunities to buy the dip but the market finally hit bottom on 10\/9\/2002. The current market tanked in the first week of April when Trump announced \u201cLiberation Day\u201d and which should have been a warning sign. There are now, as there were in 1929 and 2000, speculators convinced buying the dip is a smart move. Like 1929 and 2000 the market today is basically leverage and speculation hoping whatever they buy on Monday can be sold on Tuesday at a higher price. This movie will not have a happy ending. I had a young investor the other day tell me all you have to do it not sell. Keep putting your money in. Timing doesn\u2019t matter. Good luck dude. I\u2019m in cash and happy as a pig in the mud. Well there are different investing strategies and being young the investor can assume big losses without much problem. Supposed there is some kind of future of course. I\u2019m guessing this guy is young enough he didn\u2019t live through the dot-com bust or GFC of 2008-9 and watch is 401k take a tumble. I think those of us who lived through those two events are still a little shell-shocked. There is nothing like watching your balance get pummeled on a daily basis and can\u2019t do anything about it (some can I\u2019m sure) over the course of a few months. Yea, this guy is young enough if this market takes a large leg down he can recover his losses, but how long will that take? Nobody knows. That\u2019s the problem. He might get it all back, and he might not. But he thinks timing doesn\u2019t matter. Well, IMO, it kinda does. Bitcoin going from nothing to $56k and then down to $14k on its way to $123k i\u2019m sure shaped more than a few young \u2018investors\u2019 opinions. No doubt, but I\u2019m not sure I would call them \u201cinvestors.\u201d :-) A day before this an analyst in the same outlet was saying that now was good time to buy. It is indeed always the same. Yeah, buy the dip! works until it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve had an amazing run up since the April lows though, to be sure. I think 10\/10 was the first flashing red light. We ran up into ATH, but haven\u2019t gotten back there yet. Friday was probably in the top 8 highest volume spikes on ES futures in 12 months. Only managed a close mid body into the prior day\u2019s down bar. We had a better close on less volume on 10\/13. It\u2019s going to get pretty interesting in the coming months, I think, but I\u2019m a perma-bear and NC feeds me daily; it has been a very bad year to be a perma-bear so far! That big candle you are talking about on 10\/10 is quite interesting (looking at the S&P index). Since that trading day, the market has traded inside that candle since then, except for a run-up a few days before the last Fed interest rate cut to all time highs (or close) and then right back into the candle. It made one more attempt upward, but reversed and sank back down to the bottom of that candle, even closing a bit below. Friday\u2019s action brought it back inside that candle where it sits as we speak. IOW, it looks like that candle has become some support and resistance and might be something to watch for people who get into that stuff. Regarding the US \u201cshelving\u201d the $20B loan to Argentina, There were to be two twenty billion dollar loans. One in the form of a currency swap. The second as a bank issued credit line. I seem to remember Trump pitching this second loan directly to Argentinians, \u201cVote for Milei, win twenty billion\u201d, to parse. Straight faced election interference, and then no payout.  The private-sector loan didn\u2019t get off the ground as banks awaited guidance from the Treasury Department on what collateral and guarantees they could use to shield them from losses, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Now, bankers are saying it is no longer under serious consideration, according to people familiar with the conversations. I know I\u2019m a broken record, but imo the 20 billion rumour allowed the banksters to cash out and the glibertarians to live to fleece another day. Now Argentina will be dropped like a hot rock. But don\u2019t take only my word on it\u2026. https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/10\/09\/us\/politics\/argentina-bailout-investors.html FTA\u2026Those efforts have been complicated by the fact that major hedge funds, including those led by friends of Mr. Bessent, stand to benefit financially from an Argentina economic lifeline. Funds at investment firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco are heavily invested in Argentina, as are investors such as Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both of whom worked with Mr. Bessent when he was an investor for George Soros.

I don\u2019t know if they were introduced here by humans or somehow managed to disperse on their own through cities and suburbs from more rural areas, where they had been previously introduced for recreational hunting. In any event, they have become quite numerous with several good sized flocks wandering here and there keeping the human soul from care.   Alameda\u2019s Gone to the Turkeys  Alameda Post We have upwards of a few dozen wild turkeys that effectively rule the roost around the all cats and no cattle ranch. too big and dinosaur\u2019y for the hair\u2019m to handle, better stick with lizards, voles and gophers. About a month ago, fairly early, I look out the window to see Buster the Big White Cat sitting amongst a group of a dozen or so turkeys. Now, when turkeys are feeding they look like a group of litter pickers moving slowly and deliberately, and Buster is sitting right in their midst. At one point a turkey actually brushed against him. He raised his paw up for a second, but then put it back down and waited for them to pass. \u2013 \u2018The Math Shows Jackson Pollock Painted Like a Child Would\u2019 \u2013 Nautilus There is a conspiracy theory that the CIA covertly supported abstract expressionism in the postwar West for the same reason it supported anti-Soviet critical theory: as a means of convincing the \u201cleft-leaning\u201d intelligensia of the dangers of Stalinism, in this case the threat to individual artistic \u201cexpression\u201d by an imposed Soviet collectivist \u201crealism.\u201d  I make no claim to any sort of artistic expertise, and I actually like the Pollock paintings I have seen in person; they do have a certain emotional appeal. But I admit that when I have read some analyses by art \u201cexperts\u201d of Pollock\u2019s work over the years I have imagined some CIA psy-operator laughing his ass off in his office somewhere. In this article we have added a layer of \u201cexpertise.\u201d An \u201cinternational team of scientists\u201d have utilized \u201cfractal analysis and lacunarity\u201d to uncover the secret of Pollock\u2019s genius. It turns out it is that he painted like a child. The \u201cmath\u201d proves it. Who am I to argue with the experts? Still, I keep hearing that laughter coming from somewhere. It\u2019s a well-documented conspiracy theory; Frances Stonor Saunders \u201cWho Paid the Piper?\u201d is a good starting point. I think in the US it was published as \u201cThe Cultural Cold War.\u201d For a conspiracy theory there is a lot of evidence that it\u2019s what happened. During the WW2 Museum of Modern Art and the State Department were completely intermingled, and in the post-war world, were Soviet Union was claiming that capitalism created \u201ca cultural wasteland\u201d, these people figured pushing for America avant-garde was the best defense. Unfortunately most of the US government detested the art and the artists (\u201cIf this is art, I\u2019m a Hottentot\u201d, as Harry Truman said). So, freshly formed CIA came to help. Former MoMA executive secretary Thomas Braden became CIA\u2019s \u201csupervisor of cultural activities\u201d. IN 1954 Venice Biennale the US pavillion was arranged by US government, but by MoMA (funded trough CIA), so it could go all modern without \u201cusing taxpayers money\u201d. The same year, without any cynicism, in MoMA\u2019s 25th anniversary, president Eisenhower states that \u201cWhen artists are made the slaves and tools of the state; when artists become the chief propagandists of a cause, progress is arrested and creation and genius are destroyed.\u201d CIA founded the Congress of Cultural Freedom in Paris and put Braden in charge. They also funded Partisan Review and made it to collaborate with MoMA to establish both as a major presence in the European cultural life. My father showed at the the 1956 Biennale. He made the last page, in black and white. Shame the CIA didn\u2019t fund him, we could have used the money\u2026 I will inform the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Germany that they are spreading a conspiracy theory with their  information boards. I cling to the hope that it was all a double-fake; that the artists, writers, remote viewers etc were taking the dotty rich uncles of the CIA for a ride rather than being influenced by it\u2026 In this case I would think the artists (and their estates) would thank the CIA for providing them with the means to milk the *real* \u201crich uncles\u201d who just had to have a \u201cPollock\u201d for their home or museum. https:\/\/www.myartbroker.com\/artist-jackson-pollock\/record-prices\/jackson-pollock-record-price Contemporary painting and capitalism, posted 8 hours ago: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TuxxH2oH1oI (8:00) The Price of Everything trailer, 6 years ago, trailer: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2mbqcY9g5CM (1:48) Another conspiracy theory is that Pollock was advised on what to paint by influential critics of that time.

That is one circle that cannot be squared. And if it went against Trump, then he could be open to having his forces commit international war crimes. Treason is to \u201clevy war against the United states or to give aid and comfort to its enemies.\u201d I believe that is the exact wording in the constitution.  Sedition is this case would be speech designed to promoter rebellion. The congress critters did not such thing. They reminded members of the armed forces that it is legal and proper for them to resist unlawful orders. As I see it, ordering the destruction of boats and their passengers on the pretext that they are carrying drugs is performative. Are we to believe that the US navy is incapable of stopping  those boats, determining what they are carrying, arresting the crew if they believe they are in violation of some law, holding them for legal proceedings. That is what the Coast Guard would do. It is what the Navy should do. But no, we must have explosions, sinkings, deaths to show how tough and dangerous we are \u2026 how tough and dangerous and uncompromising our Donnie is. After all who cares about those inconsequential people who  are declared to be drug smugglers with no evidence, not Donnie, that\u2019s for sure.  Meanwhile the navy idles about off the coast of Venezuela occasionally blocking passage to ships heading for Venezuelan Ports. Blockade? Isn\u2019t that an act of war? Then again we are in a brave new world in which such fussy niceties are so, so pass\u00e9.  Might makes right, right? Or does it. Let\u2019s see what happens. Looking forward to scouring the email trove for Epstein\u2019s tax and financial advice. As someone who is very much prone to hurtling down steep frozen embankments on purpose repeatedly, I genuinely enjoy watching snowboarders doing manic stuff from the safe confines of a lift chair. At a resort you\u2019ll almost never see skiers doing crazy shit, and perhaps the main reason is the 30\/30 rule, in that nearly all boarders are under 30 and almost all skiers are over 30. Heading to Mammoth soon for my first ever November skiing (sheltered life, I know) with much of the mountain open. My family had a property at Breckenridge and I spent most of my adolescence through early 30s skiing and snowboarding. I always assumed the reason you don\u2019t see skiers doing crazy stuff is it\u2019s a lot easier to break more bones and joints with both legs moving separately (not to mention the much longer lever of the skis themselves) than a snowboard, where both feet are strapped and stationary. Even though I learned on skis first, and really young (so I retained a sort of automatic sense of balance and comfort as I aged), after I switched to snowboarding and then went back to skiing I felt like my knees (torquing injuries in a fall) especially were at risk. I lived in Tahoe in the embryonic days of snowboards in the 1980\u2019s, and oh how we hated the squeegee men (hardly any women boarders back then) who only seemed to excel in ruining perfectly good ski slopes, but they got a lot better as time went on, and might\u2019ve saved skiing from being another activity nobody does anymore (I\u2019m looking at you, tennis) by being different in their approach. Kind of standard clothing for a boarder has the same look as the duds you\u2019d wear for your job in the meat locker, and as far as doing jumps and spins and whatnot, skiers are facing down all the time, whereas a boarder has a sideways view of goings on, and perhaps easier to pull off. Boarders are encouraged by other boarders to do tricks, whereas skiers don\u2019t feel the same pressure from other parallel planked ones. \u201c13 dizzying and dazzling images from 2025 Drone Photo Awards\u201d  The image to look for is the one called \u201cThe Lone Horseman\u201d and is from the Cappadocia region in Turkiye. Incredible that such a geological formation like that exists. Sad! Hegseth and Air National Guard \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine seemingly can\u2019t tell Trump that US commissioned officers have a different oath than enlisted servicemembers.  Ichecked the oath has not changed since 1972. There is no \u201cobey orders\u201d (as in enlisted oath) in the officers\u2019 oath an officer first duty is to the constitution not Trump! \u2018Caine enabled\u2019 There\u2019s a presumptive requirement on military personnel in any country to obey a \u201clawful order.\u201d Such an order has to be legal as regards criminal law generally, legal as regards military law (eg you cannot order a soldier to desert) and consistent with military ethics (you shouldn\u2019t order a soldier to exercise your dog.). Such an order has to be obeyed. By extension, an order that violates one or more of these criteria does not have to be obeyed, and indeed it could be a crime to give such an order. In real life, an order is assumed to be legal unless it is self-evidently illegal (\u201con its face\u201d), because you can\u2019t stop military operations to have seminars about legality. However, this argument is very circumscribed: it\u2019s no part of an officer\u2019s duty, for example, to go hunting through legal textbooks to see whether this or that order could be  inconsistent with the Constitution of their country. That\u2019s an entirely different issue, handled at a completely different level;. Great missing historical oversight in this article.A major reason for our British decline was the Japanese \u2018 world class manufacturing model\u2019 Kanban,JIT,Zero changeover time etc.This decimated our native industries as well as those in the USA as it turned over our many of our preconceptions.e.g associating huge quantities of WIP with an organisations good health. One early example of this, in 1977 we bought our first CNC machine.Tbe Japanese were able to guarantee to fly over an engineer from Paris to the UK within 24 hrs while Herbert and Ward \u2013 a world famous Birmingham M\/C tool company only 60 miles up the road took 2 weeks to send us an engineer!. A specialist in Japanese manufacturing techniques I undertook a prestigious MBA in 1994 hoping to learn the latest Japanese manufacturing techniques in for Ops Management part.I ended up giving (paid) lectures in them,as it was palpably obvious the segment was way out of date.Go figure!Just a couple of small examples from over a wonderful 30 years making things from 1970.The last example,in 1970 approximately 10m were employed in making things when I left in 2000 around 2 m were left When Japanese auto engineers toured the Jaguar plant in the 60s, they were shocked to see a test facility in which every engine was run to reveal defects. This indicated the absence of statistical quality control of sub-components. The British manufacturing sector became noncompetitive because of cultural inertia. Now it is the turn of the USA to decline, as it attempts to set industrial policy through a government run by squabbling billionaires. In the early industrial era, entrepreneurial innovation could proceed in parallel in multiple sectors, without elaborate coordination. Those days are gone. Coherent national industrial policy is propelling China into the lead, and the U.S. can\u2019t shake its deep-seated fractious social characteristics in order to catch up. Apropos of not much, but why did DT Barnum dress like Potsie from Happy Days yesterday, it\u2019s not even remotely his style? But will he show up at a beach with water skis and a leather jacket?

Software as a Medical Practitioner\u2014Is It Time to License Artificial Intelligence? From the abstract: \u201cThe Healthy Technology Act of 2025, a bill being considered by Congress, would permit artificial intelligence (AI) systems to prescribe medications without human sign-off. While allowing AI to practice independently may still be a stretch, large language models are already being used to support diagnosis and treatment.1 These applications challenge the current regulatory framework for clinical AI, which has focused on software as a medical device (SaMD). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared more than 1000 AI tools using this framework, mostly for narrow, well-defined tasks. However, generative models can be applied across domains, straining the SaMD framework. In this Viewpoint, we explore the application of a licensure paradigm to clinical AI systems, arguing that this offers a more reliable regulatory framework.\u201d https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/2840933?guestAccessKey=243dfbf1-6018-44c3-8c63-969f2c02cee3&utm_medium=email&utm_source=postup_jn&utm_campaign=article_alert-jamainternalmedicine&utm_content=olf-tfl_&utm_term=111725#google_ Paintings are by far the largest bubble (you could buy Van Gogh\u2019s Mlle.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Written byOluwapelumi Adejumo Edited byMohammad Shahid BitMine is intensifying its aggressive accumulation of Ethereum, looking past a 47% collapse in its stock price and billions in unrealized losses. On November 23, blockchain platform Lookonchain reported that a wallet linked to the corporate giant received 21,537 ETH. The transfer, valued at approximately $60 million, came from institutional prime broker FalconX. This new purchase would bring BitMine\u2019s total hoard to over 3.5 million ETH, representing nearly 3% of the token\u2019s circulating supply. Tom Lee(@fundstrat)'s #Bitmine is still buying $ETH.A new wallet 0x5664 \u2014 likely linked to #Bitmine \u2014 just received 21,537 $ETH($59.17M) from the #FalconX 8 hours ago.https:\/\/t.co\/8kg77vYddh pic.twitter.com\/FKivNNe0jM The move signals a defiant commitment to its \u201cStrategic ETH Reserve\u201d strategy despite the asset\u2019s recent price struggles. Indeed, Ethereum is trading near $2,808, down roughly 29% over the past month. Notably, BitMine\u2019s Thomas Lee had attributed ETH\u2019s recent weakness to broader market mechanics rather than fundamental flaws.  According to him, the October 10 \u201cliquidity shock,\u201d which wiped nearly $20 billion in leveraged positions from the crypto market, was the primary driver of the drawdown. \u201cIn 2022, the post-FTX liquidity shock took 8 weeks to clear, but similar to prior drawdowns,\u00a0crypto\u00a0prices quickly recovered. History shows\u00a0crypto\u00a0prices stage V-shaped recoveries after a lingering and drawn out decline, and we expect this to again be the case in this current drawdown,\u201d He added. As a result, the downturn has significantly impacted BitMine\u2019s ETH holdings, leaving the firm with an estimated $4 billion in paper losses. This divergence has weighed heavily on BitMine\u2019s stock, which has shed nearly half its value over the past 30 days. To offset the sting of declining asset prices, BitMine is effectively rebranding itself from a passive ETH holding company to an active yield generator.  On November 21, the firm announced the launch of the \u201cMade in America Validator Network\u201d (MAVAN). The proprietary staking infrastructure is set to go live in early 2026. Meanwhile, the firm confirmed that it has selected three pilot partners to test its staking operations. \u201cWe plan to partner with one or more of these pilot partners plus world-class infrastructure providers to scale our own \u201cMade in America Validator Network\u201d (MAVAN) over the coming quarter\u2026we believe in building the premier destination for our natively staked Ether and are proud to build with the best partners. At scale, we believe our strategy will best serve the long-term best interests of our shareholders,\u201d Lee stated. By staking its 3.5 million ETH, BitMine could theoretically generate substantial annual revenue from network rewards. This would create a cash-flow floor that pure holding strategies lack. Additionally, the firm declared an annual dividend of $0.01 per share, positioning itself as the first large-cap crypto treasury to return capital to investors directly.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Over the course of last week, and even before that, the Bitcoin price recorded a concerning pattern. The US trading sessions drove Bitcoin losses, while Asian markets consistently bought the dip, indicating sharp regional divergence. New reports allege that the government may have orchestrated the sell-off seen during the US sessions as part of its broader investment strategy. Bitcoin\u2019s recent price decline revealed a sharp split in trading, with US sessions driving sell-offs while Asian traders steadily buy the dip. BeInCrypto reported that American sessions have become the weakest period for Bitcoin prices. According to Max Keiser, a Bitcoin pioneer, the US government may be eyeing MicroStrategy ($MSTR) and Coinbase ($COIN), potentially capitalizing on Bitcoin\u2019s steep sell-off in November. RUMOR: The U.S. is contemplating a multibillion investment in $MSTR & $COIN pic.twitter.com\/Fd1S4LQFRl While no evidence confirms the claims, the speculation has spread. Some suggest that this interest drove the government to orchestrate the recent Bitcoin sell-off to the sub-$90,000 range. Allegedly, US government officials wanted MicroStrategy\u2019s market value to net asset value (mNAV) near 1.0 and therefore manufactured a crash on Bitcoin to compress the premium. \u201cThe US is contemplating a multi-billion-dollar investment in MSTR, and they needed the mNAV to be 1 before it made sense for them to invest, so they manufactured a crash on bitcoin,\u201d wrote Teddy, a popular user on X (Twitter). Mike Alfred names officials such as President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and allies, citing a multi-step plan to bolster Bitcoin, MSTR, and stablecoins while simultaneously defunding JP Morgan, the Fed, and the US banking cabal to protect US citizens. Again, there are no official statements or regulatory filings backing these claims. No representatives from the US Treasury, White House, or regulatory agencies have addressed or confirmed the rumors.\u00a0 \u201cThe administration views it as a defining battle,\u201d Alfred noted. Several factors have factually influenced recent price\u00a0volatility. Strategy Inc. faces the potential impact of\u00a0MSCI\u2019s proposed index exclusion\u00a0for companies with more than 50% of their assets in Bitcoin or similar cryptocurrencies. If adopted, this policy could trigger as much as $8.8 billion in passive fund outflows from the stock. At the same time, shifting outlooks on Fed rate cuts and volatility in bond markets have pressured riskier investments, leading to increased market declines. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, rejects attempts to reclassify his company as a fund or trust, emphasizing its ongoing software and active treasury operations. With MSCI\u2019s January 2026 decision approaching, the company continues to face real business hurdles unrelated to online conspiracy theories. Speculation on X ties Bitcoin\u2019s crash to imagined government accumulation plans, including: Blockchain data indicates that the US government holds more than 326,000 BTC from prior forfeitures, fueling continued speculation. MicroStrategy, whose balance sheet is dominated by Bitcoin, dropped more than 60% from its highs, pushing its mNAV to levels below 1 as of November 23. Even without evidence of a government bid, the rumors highlight several key realities: While these remain speculation from some of the industry\u2019s loudest voices, the timing of these posts, amidst one of Bitcoin\u2019s sharpest weekly declines of 2025, may be exacerbating the spread.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":" The tension erupted following news that Strategy and other crypto treasury companies would likely be excluded from major market indexes.  The backlash against financial services company JP Morgan from the Bitcoin (BTC) community and supporters of BTC treasury company Strategy continued to swell on Sunday as calls to \u201cboycott\u201d JP Morgan grew. The anger from the Bitcoin community followed news that the MSCI, formerly Morgan Stanley Capital International, an index company that sets criteria for index inclusion, is likely to exclude crypto treasury companies from its indexes in January 2026.  JP Morgan shared the MSCI news in a research note. \u201cI just pulled $20 million from Chase and suing them for credit card malfeasance,\u201d real estate investor and Bitcoin advocate Grant Cardone said in response to a call to boycott the financial services giant. \u201cCrash JP Morgan and buy Strategy and BTC,\u201d Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser said, as the online boycott movement gained steam. The exclusion of crypto treasury companies from stock indexes could trigger an automatic sell-off of their shares from funds and asset managers that are mandated to buy specific types of financial instruments, and could negatively impact crypto markets. Related: Saylor shrugs off suggestion Wall Street \u2018hurt\u2019 Bitcoin amid latest crash Strategy entered the Nasdaq 100, a stock market index of the 100 largest companies by market capitalization on the tech-focused stock exchange, in December 2024 This allowed Strategy to reap the benefits of passive capital flows from funds and investors holding the Nasdaq 100.\u00a0 Strategy founder Michael Saylor responded to the proposed MSCI policy change on Friday, saying, \u201cStrategy is not a fund, not a trust, and not a holding company.\u201d\u201cFunds and trusts passively hold assets. Holding companies sit on investments. We create, structure, issue, and operate,\u201d Saylor said, adding that Strategy is a \u201cBitcoin-backed structured finance company.\u201d The proposed MSCI listing criteria change would force any treasury company with 50% or more of its balance sheet in crypto to lose its index status.These companies would then face one of two choices: reduce crypto holdings to be below the threshold to qualify for index inclusion, or lose the passive capital flows from the market indexes.A sudden sell-off from crypto treasury companies impacted by the proposed MSCI change could force digital asset prices down, according to analysts.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":" There\u2019s something refreshing about a gadget that looks this good while solving real problems. Germain Verbrackel\u2019s MIDI controller concept doesn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel, but it does ask an interesting question: what if our music-making tools were designed with the same care we give to the objects we use every day? At first glance, this looks like a minimalist\u2019s dream. The all-white palette and clean lines give it that \u201cI belong on a designer\u2019s desk\u201d vibe. But look closer, and you\u2019ll notice that every curve and angle here has a job to do. The chamfered base isn\u2019t just there to look pretty. It creates a sense of groundedness, like the controller is planted firmly on your desk, ready to work. There\u2019s a subtle confidence to it, the kind that comes from knowing exactly what it is and what it\u2019s supposed to do. Designer: Germain Verbrackel Create your own Aesthetic Render: Download KeyShot Studio Right Now!       The keys tell an even better story. Each one features a chamfered edge that guides your fingers into position. It\u2019s a small detail, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that makes a huge difference when you\u2019re actually using the device. Think about how many times you\u2019ve fumbled with flat, generic buttons that all feel the same. These keys practically tell your fingertips where to go. That\u2019s not just good design, that\u2019s thoughtful design. What really sets this controller apart, though, is the magnetic speaker attachment. This is where the concept shifts from \u201cnice MIDI controller\u201d to \u201coh, that\u2019s clever.\u201d Most MIDI controllers are tethered to computers or external speakers. They\u2019re input devices, not standalone instruments. But snap that speaker module into place, and suddenly you\u2019ve got a self-contained music-making tool. No laptop required. No cables snaking across your workspace. Just you and the music. The magnetic connection is particularly smart because it maintains the device\u2019s sleek profile when you don\u2019t need the speaker, but transforms it into something more complete when you do. It\u2019s modular design done right, not as a gimmick but as a genuine enhancement to functionality. The speaker itself has a textured grille that provides visual and tactile contrast to the smooth keys, giving the whole setup a more dynamic look when assembled.  There\u2019s also something to be said for how portable this design appears. The compact form factor suggests this is meant to travel with you, to be the controller you throw in your bag when inspiration might strike at a coffee shop or a friend\u2019s place. The chamfered base helps here too, because that angled edge makes it easier to pick up off a flat surface. Again, it\u2019s a small thing, but these small things add up to create an object that feels like it was designed by someone who actually uses these tools. The aesthetic choices matter here as well. In a market full of MIDI controllers that either try too hard to look \u201cprofessional\u201d with all-black industrial designs or go the opposite direction with RGB lighting and gaming-inspired looks, this one takes a different path. It\u2019s contemporary without being trendy. It\u2019s minimal without being cold. It could sit next to your laptop, your coffee maker, or your favorite design book and look equally at home.       What Verbrackel has created here is a case study in how industrial design can elevate everyday tools. This isn\u2019t about adding features for the sake of features or making something look futuristic just because you can. It\u2019s about understanding how people actually use these devices and designing accordingly. The chamfered edges, the magnetic speaker, the clean color palette, they all serve the same goal: making music creation more intuitive and more enjoyable. The controller represents a broader shift we\u2019re seeing in tech design, where the focus moves from pure functionality to thoughtful integration of form and function. It\u2019s the same philosophy that\u2019s made smartphones beautiful and kitchen appliances worthy of counter space. Why shouldn\u2019t our creative tools receive the same level of design attention? Whether this concept makes it to production or remains a stunning portfolio piece, it\u2019s already done its job. It\u2019s made us think differently about what a MIDI controller can be. And that\u2019s worth celebrating.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"For most of the past decade, consumer electronics have marched toward ever-smarter, ever-more-personal roles in our daily lives. We followed the trends for many years, but the latest shift is more surprising than any step counter or sleep tracker: everyday gadgets are starting to behave like medical devices. The idea that a pair of mass-market earbuds can assist with mild hearing loss, or that a wristwatch can detect atrial fibrillation, would have sounded vaguely sci-fi a few years ago. Now it is normal. Apple\u2019s FDA-cleared Hearing Aid Feature is simply the most visible\u2014and perhaps the most symbolic\u2014example of this new era. AirPods, which once existed to pump playlists and silence background noise, can now run software that meets regulatory standards for over-the-counter hearing aids. While the AirPods Pro 3 are the latest hardware platform that supports it, the story is not really about the earbuds at all. It is about the collapsing boundary between consumer electronics and assistive health tech, and how that collision could reshape the economics and expectations of care. What makes this shift fascinating is how \u201cunmedical\u201d the hardware looks. Instead of beige plastic and tiny zinc-air batteries, we are talking about glossy earbuds you see on every subway commute. The Hearing Aid Feature itself is software, guided by a self-administered hearing test that lives inside an iPhone. As sensors get better, processors get smaller, and machine learning moves closer to the body, the gadgets we buy for convenience start acquiring capabilities once reserved for specialized equipment with specialized prices. Independent reviewers have shown that this consumer-first approach can work surprisingly well. A Guardian journalist with documented hearing loss found that Apple\u2019s self-guided test produced amplification that closely matched his clinical audiogram. He still preferred traditional hearing aids in the noisiest, most chaotic environments, but the point is not parity. It is accessibility. Devices that people already own, understand, and feel comfortable wearing are becoming credible entry points into a world that once required clinical appointments and four-figure invoices. The trend extends far beyond Apple. In recent years, we have seen consumer headsets experiment with neurofeedback, smart rings track recovery metrics once reserved for elite athletes, and smartphones approach the sensitivity of dedicated low-vision aids. At Ubergizmo, we covered LibrePods, a community-driven project that reverse-engineers AirPods to unlock advanced features, including rudimentary hearing-aid functionality\u2014on Android and Linux. That experiment signals something broader: hearing support, wellness tracking, and environmental sensing are becoming software categories rather than hardware silos. Tens of millions of people live with untreated hearing loss, yet only a sliver use hearing aids. Similar gaps exist for sleep disorders, cardiovascular irregularities, and early cognitive decline. Part of the problem is cost; part is stigma; part is logistics. Consumer tech, with its fashion-forward design and ubiquity, chips away at those barriers. It does not replace medical care, but it lowers the threshold to begin it, much like blood-oxygen tracking nudged people to discuss sleep apnea, or fall detection nudged families into conversations about aging-in-place long before clinical intervention. The same forces that turned cameras into computational imaging tools and watches into miniature health labs are now turning earbuds, rings, glasses, and even apps into gateways for early detection, assistive support, and personalized care. The deeper story is that consumer electronics are stepping into a role that medical devices alone cannot fill: making care feel natural, approachable, and part of everyday life. In a sense, the gadgets around us are becoming a low-friction bridge between our daily routines and our long-term well-being. Filed in Medical.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"If you're shopping for Xbox gifts, gadgets, and gizmos for the holiday season, this article should be your first point of call.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  It's that time of year again, Black Friday! Where we're all encouraged to spend, spend, and SPEND SOME MORE. I'm not here to do that, though. This article is entirely designed to help you find deals for Xbox accessories you were likely planning to purchase anyway. There's no knock-off Temu junk here. These are all Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S compatible products that I've personally tested and personally endorsed. I'm so confident in them that I'll also pledge tech support should you have any issues in the comments below. Whether you're looking for Xbox headsets, Xbox controllers, or other Xbox addons, these are the best Xbox Black Friday deals we've been able to find for this year's 2025 holiday season. The first gaming headset I ever reviewed was a Turtle Beach headset, and it has been fun watching the firm chase perfection over the years. The Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3) is arguably the closest the firm has ever come to that, delivering a headset that feels premium while sitting in a far more affordable price range. This is the headset I recommend to anyone looking to step above the entry level. My Stealth 700 (Gen 3) review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 The notoriously pricy Xbox Seagate Storage Expansion cards are all currently on sale, ranging from 1TB all the way up to a huge $120 saving on the 4TB model. These storage cards are essentially plug and play, just stick them in the back of your Xbox Series X|S and you'll immediately have additional storage. It also makes moving game content between devices easy, too. I've had mine since launch and have never had any issues whatsoever.  I've tried a lot of \"gaming earbuds\" and found that they usually came up short, either with connectivity issues, software quirks, or degraded audio. The SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Xbox\/PC\/Bluetooth) changed all that. With great audio quality, a supremely comfortable fit, and great battery life, the Gamebuds might even replace your Samsung or Apple earbuds. They sure as heck replaced mine.  The Backbone Pro is arguably the best and most ergonomic smartphone gamepad, compatible with almost any USB-C capable phone. In addition, this also supports Bluetooth, so you can use it as a regular controller on top. It's ideal for Xbox remote play, NVIDIA GFN, and Xbox Cloud Gaming, and it's got a decent saving for Black Friday.My Backbone Pro review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro was my go-to headset for years and years, owing to its versatility. You can connect two USB-C devices with this, and feed another Bluetooth device on top. The retractable mic makes it an option for lifestyle use, and the handy DAC is a great tool for desk-based gamers. Hot swappable batteries seal the deal.  Need a player two? The standard Xbox Wireless Controller is currently on sale for 38% off, netting you a tidy saving on a variety of standard colors. The Xbox Wireless Controller supports Bluetooth, making it compatible with devices like the Amazon Fire Stick, phones, and TVs, and lets you bring your own batteries on top.  While I was searching for deals, I couldn't help but notice this absolutely excellent limited edition controller was not only still in stock, but actually on sale at Best Buy. The DOOM: The Dark Ages Xbox controller is one of the best custom designs in a long line of custom controllers from Microsoft, and well worth considering if you missed it the first time around.  When the first version of the official Xbox Wireless Headset launched, I wasn't particularly impressed with it. The audio quality wasn't fantastic, and the headset had some software bugs to boot. The latest version is a big improvement, however, offering solid entry-level wireless audio for casual use, with good connectivity and build quality. It won't blow you away, but neither will its affordable price point.  Need an even cheaper player two and don't mind a cable? \"Cheap\" controllers are usually trash, but GameSir actually made one that fits the bill, and in a couple of ways it's even better than the official Xbox controller. For player two, you don't want to be screwing around with batteries and the like (or maybe even player one). The long cable ensures you're never without power. It has Hall Effect sticks and triggers too, eliminating drift. It's lightweight, ergonomic, and has a high-quality feel despite the price. Definitely consider this. I use it mainly when docking my Xbox Ally.  Wait, isn't this the same as the above controller? Well, not quite. This \"G7\" controller takes the experience a step further by adding back buttons, as well as improved materials. Back buttons are a boon for competitive play, allowing you to do things like jump and activate abilities without having to take your fingers off the joysticks. In games like Overwatch and Call of Duty, it can save your life. It's up to you whether or not you think you need that, of course.  I'm lucky enough to have a variety of headsets to choose from thanks to my job, but if I was looking for a $100~ range option, this Black Friday deal would be really tough to beat. This is a mid-ranger kind of headset with broad compatibility for a variety of devices, focused mainly on Xbox. The audio is decent albeit not spectacular, but it arguably becomes killer at this price point.  The Razer Kishi Ultra really is the \"Ultra\"-mode option for those seeking an Xbox \/ NVIDIA cloud-capable mobile controller. This large option gives you full ergonomic tilt over other more \"travel\"-sized options, complete with support for even small tablets like the iPad Mini. If you want to move away from smaller screens for your remote play set up, look no further. My Razer Kishi Ultra review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd While this deal seems to be for Prime members only, it is the best dock I've been able to find for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X thus far. Most of the docks aren't designed with the Xbox Ally grips in mind (including this one honestly), but its raised profile makes it compatible by default. Support for 100w throughput and a variety of ports makes it a great and affordable option to put your Xbox Ally on a larger monitor.  I've been using Elgato capture cards for years and years at this point and have reviewed virtually every model. This is the the culmination of everything Elgato has learned over the years, delivering something that has required virtually zero tweaks to perfect at the user's end. If you want to capture Xbox gameplay for streaming or YouTube, look no further than this great deal. My Elgato 4K S review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50      A lot of my favorite Xbox accessories ironically aren't really on sale (at least not yet). The most essential ones are obviously the Seagate Xbox Series X|S Storage Expansion card, particularly if you don't have the 2TB Xbox Series X|S models. The Xbox Seagate Storage Card 4TB model being on sale nets you the biggest saving here, which is nice if you want to store a mammoth amount of games. Indeed, the Xbox consoles themselves aren't on sale for Black Friday either, since Microsoft doesn't really sit on stock these days. Microsoft essentially makes Xbox Series X|S consoles to order, and all floating investment is going towards things like Xbox Cloud Gaming and the next-gen Xbox console. \ud83d\udc49 More best Xbox accessoriesI'd love to be pointing you at the Xbox Ally or Logitech G Cloud, or even the Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 \u2014 alas, none of these are on sale for Black Friday, although that could change as we get closer to Black Friday proper or even Cyber Monday. I'm a rare video game content creator who actually uses Xbox as his primary platform, rather than one to dabble with. I've tested all of the above accessories personally. I'm also not paid per click, take no commission, and own no shares. I just want to help the community that has ultimately helped me \u2014 you guys.  Headsets are usually a good shout for Black Friday. The best up there are the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 (Gen 3) (for most use-case scenarios), and the SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (if you want to throw in lifestyle daily use too). If you're a content creator or play across multiple devices at a desk, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro is a great option too, giving you a desktop DAC with instant controls and simultaneous connectivity. The Gamebuds are far more comfortable than standard offerings from Apple and Samsung both, and offer comparable audio while being simultaneously cheaper. I really think SteelSeries should double down on that form factor, because they're honestly one of the best earbud sets I've used and it's almost like they made it on a whim. \ud83d\udc49 More best Xbox headsets The Gamebuds come with a USB-C dongle for PC or Xbox Series X|S connectivity (with an included USB-A adapter). They also support Bluetooth for mobile device connectivity. You can't mix two signals simultaneously sadly, but swapping between your Xbox at home and smartphone when commuting is a good shout. The mic array isn't bad either for basic comms. At this price, they're all the more impressive, too.      While stuff like the IVANKY dock is pretty niche and only relevant if you actually have an Xbox Ally handheld, one accessory I would recommend to anyone is the GameSir T7 or G7 controller. The G7 is a bit more expensive, but all you get really is back buttons which are only really necessary if you want to get particularly competitive in games like Overwatch. The T7 and G7 are both wired controllers, but they beat the official Xbox controller in a variety of key ways. The long included braided cable is hard-wearing, and eliminates added cost of maintaining batteries. Even the official Xbox battery packs die pretty quick, and I'm loathe to recommend third-party rechargeable batteries since they have a tendency to, well, explode at times. The Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 is by far and away the best controller you can get on Xbox, even with its wear and tear issues \u2014 but the G7 and T7 eliminates the need for an expensive high-quality battery this way. They also have full Hall Effect magnetic sticks, which eliminates the drift that appears on regular Xbox controllers as materials age and warp. I use the G7 primarily when testing handhelds and with my IVANKY dock with my Xbox Ally, so I don't have to bother fiddling around with Bluetooth connectivity and the like. Be sure to check back across the rest of the week as we update, tweak, and add new deals as they appear between now and Black Friday and Cyber Monday proper, and let me know if you have any questions in the comments below. Black Friday actually starts on November 28, 2025. However, in more recent years, Amazon and other U.S. retailers have expanded Black Friday to incorporate what feels like the entire month of November. The deals should linger all the way through to December.  Cyber Monday always follows Black Friday, and this year hits on December 1, 2025. Cyber Monday typically focuses on tech and online shopping, although that's started to change too as other retailers try to cash in. We should see some strong and unique tech deals throughout the weekend.  There's no real definitive answer to this, as deals typically revolve around availability and manufacturer planning. Sometimes we've seen \"flash\" deals appear and sell out almost immediately on Black Friday as well as Cyber Monday. This is why we make articles like this in the first place, to help inform you of the best deals as and when they happen. So, check back frequently, as we'll be updating this article almost daily through to Cyber Monday week!

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. 14 hours ago Inflation has become a fact of life these days. Smartphone prices have steadily risen over the past few years and the same is true for most other electronics, from headphones to consoles. Still, there are a few product categories like televisions that have managed to buck this trend. And over the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve found out that robot vacuums are another exception. Sure, you could spend thousands on a cutting-edge robot vacuum that can physically lift socks and other debris, but most people don\u2019t need that. Even as someone who lives on the bleeding edge of tech, I\u2019m perfectly content with a vacuum that just keeps my floors clean. And the good news is that robot vacuums have become shockingly accessible. But shopping for one is confusing: you\u2019ll find a myriad of brands, some of which you might\u2019ve never seen before, and model names that don\u2019t make much sense. I found out about all of this the hard way after I moved into a new rental last month and started shopping for a new robot vacuum. It took hours to sift through the available options on Amazon ranging from budget to mid-range, so here\u2019s everything I learned. The last time I shopped for a robot vacuum was in 2019, when only a handful of models existed from brands like Xiaomi and Roborock. American brands like iRobot have technically been around for longer, and Roomba is indeed a household name, but the company\u2019s models lacked features like LIDAR mapping and mopping at the time. You needed two different robots to vacuum and mop your floors separately, while Roborock offered that functionality in a single model. Fast forward to today, and it\u2019s not surprising that Roborock\u2019s vacuums occupy some of the top spots on Amazon. Scroll a bit, though, and you\u2019ll discover a sea of different models from other brands like Dreame, MOVA, Narwal, and eufy. And unlike half a decade ago, all of these robot vacuums from different manufacturers have competitive specs. The only problem? They don\u2019t really communicate what separates a $200 model from a $600 one or even beyond. For instance, I wanted a vacuum with advanced mopping features like pads that can spin for thorough cleaning and lift to avoid carpets. But simultaneously, I didn\u2019t want a bulky docking station that would take up a lot of space in my apartment. This is an odd feature mix, but the sheer choice on the market in 2025 means that I could find what I wanted with relative ease. I ended up buying the Dreame L10s Pro Gen 2, which was on sale for $260. I could rattle a list of numbers and specs describing it, but that\u2019s not the point. I\u2019ve found that robot vacuum specs don\u2019t matter as long as you get the features you need, but more on that in the next section. That\u2019s not to say the vacuum I picked doesn\u2019t have great specs. For the price I paid, it\u2019s hard to argue with the sheer value on offer. Sure, I had to forego some convenience features like auto-emptying, but I got a compact footprint and saved hundreds of dollars in return. The cleaning performance is nearly identical to more expensive models that use the exact same mop mechanism. The only downside is that I have to manually empty the dustbin and rinse the mop pads \u2014 but that\u2019s infrequent for my small apartment. The takeaway? Robot vacuums have reached commodity status, similar to televisions, and every home could use one. After all, even the most basic model will clean more thoroughly and frequently than an average person would. I only wish brands did a better job of naming their products \u2013 Dreame has the L10s Pro Ultra, L10s Ultra, and L10s Pro that all have little in common with each other and that\u2019s only a fraction of their full device lineup. So if model names don\u2019t work, how should you pick which robot vacuum to buy from the sea of options? After hours of research, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found.  Don\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Before I talk about specific recommendations, here are the robot vacuum specs that you\u2019ll see most frequently and whether they should impact your purchasing decision. Finally, there\u2019s the price. My favorite part about the current market is that there\u2019s a model for everyone. You\u2019ll find a model at every $50 to $100 interval starting as low as $150. And while the cheapest ones may seem barebones with a simple charging-only dock, it will still keep your floors cleaner than most humans. You might notice some vacuums from different brands look similar to each other. That\u2019s because Dreame, Roborock, and MOVA have distinct names and even apps, but they\u2019re technically all the culmination of Xiaomi\u2019s massive investment into robot vacuum tech. Dreame and MOVA are still operated independently, for example, but just like we see with OPPO and OnePlus in the smartphone space, you\u2019re benefiting from shared innovation. Knowing this shared heritage, I had no qualms switching from Roborock to Dreame for my latest purchase. And upon opening the Dreame app, I found a familiar interface not too dissimilar from my Roborock. This isn\u2019t surprising, though, as some Roborock and Dreame robot vacuums can even be linked directly to the Xiaomi Home app. That said, you cannot go wrong with other brands like Narwal too that don\u2019t sharethe same roots. If you don\u2019t want to stick to a budget model like I did, you could go with something like the Roborock Qrevo S5V ($500 at Amazon) that automates everything and the kitchen sink for around $500 when it\u2019s on sale. Or you could get a budget $200 model from Narwal that sacrifices some mopping performance but impressively still delivers great vacuuming performance and an auto-emptying dock. Whatever your needs, there\u2019s likely a model for you and at a price point you\u2019re comfortable with. The tech almost feels modular at this point, but you do have to hunt around to find the right model for your needs. All of this is to say, robot vacuums have come a long way in recent years and even cheap ones are well worth your attention. I used to dismiss new features like Roborock\u2019s foldable arm as gimmicks \u2014 those halo models cost thousands of dollars, after all. But genuinely useful tech like spinning mop pads and camera-based obstacle avoidance has trickled down to cheaper models right under our noses. You can spend about $300 like I did and get a very good experience or you can spend double and get a near-flagship model. There\u2019s little reason to spend a thousand dollars or more, and that\u2019s a good thing for the tech\u2019s accessibility. So if you\u2019re on the fence about buying a robot vacuum, I can wholeheartedly recommend making the jump. With Black Friday on the horizon, I\u2019ve noticed that most popular models have already shed hundreds of dollars off their regular prices. Just a word of caution: with iRobot allegedly on the brink of bankruptcy, you might want to consider one of the other popular brands I mentioned above. Thank you for being part of our community.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Grayscale is positioning Chainlink as critical infrastructure for the growing market of tokenized assets, according to a new research report.  The asset manager's research arm argues that Chainlink\u2019s suite of services, spanning real-world data feeds, compliance tooling, and blockchain interoperability, solves many of the real-world frictions that block wider adoption of blockchain-based finance. Chainlink is best known for powering \u201coracles,\u201d which feed off-chain data like asset prices to smart contracts. But its newer offerings go much further. The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), for instance, allows tokens and messages to move between chains, something that came into focus during a test with J.P. Morgan\u2019s Kinexys and Ondo Finance. Grayscale sees Chainlink\u2019s LINK token as offering diversified exposure to crypto\u2019s infrastructure layer, per the report. \u201cChainlink is the critical connective tissue between crypto and traditional finance,\u201d the report rsaid. \u201cIt can already be considered essential infrastructure in blockchain-based finance.\u201d The report pegs the tokenization market at $35 billion today, still a fraction of the global asset base, but notes that Chainlink\u2019s integration with firms like S&P Global and FTSE Russell puts it in a strong position as traditional markets explore on-chain solutions. Currently, Grayscale added, the total market for tokenized assets represents just 0.01% of the total value of global fixed income and equity securities. The growth of the tokenized assets market, the firm added, could \u201cimply growth\u201d in demand for Chainlink\u2019s offerings. While still small relative to global capital markets, the firm expects the figure to grow as banks, asset managers, and data providers explore blockchain rails. It\u2019s already grown from around $5 billion in early 2023 to its current figure. The report comes at a time when Grayscale has filed to convert its $29 million Chainlink Trust into an exchange-traded fund that would trade under the ticker GLNK on NYSE Arca. If approved, it would be the first U.S.-listed Chainlink ETF and one of the first with a staking component.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Do not expect $500 price tags.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The next-gen Steam Machine was unveiled a couple of weeks ago, teasing what a console-esque PC gaming experience could look like. With powerful, semi-custom hardware from AMD, Valve is aiming to match PS5 levels of power, but will it be able to match it on price? That's the million-dollar question on everyone's minds, and we finally have an answer from Valve itself, as a Valve engineer has noted that the hardware won't be subsidized like we see with gaming consoles, thus implying the device will have higher relative pricing to consoles, and will instead compete directly with desktop PCs. Speaking to SkillUp, software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed that the Steam Machine won't be subsidized when asked about the company's pricing strategy. Griffais followed that up with an explanation on all the hard work Valve has put into making the Steam Machine similar to a console, offering a seamless experience that would still be competitive in its class. \"No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is. But also some integration features like HDMI CEC. The Bluetooth and wireless work that we've done, the four antennas, the very deliberate design so that you can have a great experience with four Bluetooth controllers,\" he said. Moreover, Lawrence Yang further explained that their goal is to match the PC landscape specifically, so that if you were to build a similarly spec'd custom gaming PC, it would cost the same. A rig you assembled, though, would likely run Windows, whereas the Steam Machine has the benefit of SteamOS (based on Linux), which will outperform Microsoft's OS in most scenarios.      Valve is not willing to eat costs upfront in order to make back profits with software sales later. This is the model console manufacturers have followed for a long time, since they all have their own closed-off marketplaces for purchasing games, where they earn a percentage of each sale. On top of that, services and subscriptions like PlayStation Plus further help ease the margins since you're locked into that particular ecosystem. Steam, the most popular games store on PC, is owned by Valve, and the company also takes a 30% cut on all sales, putting it on the same level as console makers. Therefore, it would be sensible to assume that Steam can be the key to subsidizing the device, but instead it's being positioned to act as the safety net for Valve, even if the Steam Machine flops in a worst-case scenario. It's an interesting strategy that reveals how Valve is thinking about the Steam Machine in its current lineup: it's not another Steam Deck \u2014 it is designed for the big screen. With rising memory and storage prices, it's understandable why the company hasn't announced the price yet, and the release\/production window of this device means the worsening DRAM shortages and resultant price hikes will hit Valve as well. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Right now, community speculation is pegging the Steam Machine at around $700. This price can very well go up by the time it's ready for launch since the industry is expected to be navigating a significant component crisis in 2026. Even if everything was fine and dandy, we would possibly be looking at a ~$550-600 price tag at best. For context, you can get a PS5 Pro on Black Friday for just $650.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Bill Ackman lit the fire and Bill Pulte supercharged it. Their influence helped drive retail traders to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose shares have soared more than 500% since Donald Trump\u2019s election a year ago. But now, as equity markets are gripped by volatility and crypto assets suffer their worst rout in years, those same investors are fleeing. Thursday\u2019s wild selloffs, and further losses Friday, were a reminder that the fervor of retail traders \u2014\u00a0whipped up\u00a0in part by Federal Housing Finance Agency head Pulte \u2014 can quickly turn sour. Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager, sent out a social media post this week blaming forced liquidations and margin calls in the cryptocurrency market for the sagging prices on the mortgage giants. \u201cI underestimated how much exposure Fannie and Freddie (\u2018F2\u2019) have to crypto, not on balance sheet, but in their shareholder bases,\u201d Ackman said on X. Ackman\u2019s theory for the pullback \u2014 that leveraged cryptocurrency investors facing margin calls had to sell other assets to raise cash \u2014 was echoed by some on Wall Street who saw the stocks drop by more than 10% on Thursday. It happened as Bitcoin was on track for its worst monthly performance since a string of corporate collapses rocked the sector in 2022.\u00a0 Read:\u00a0Ackman Fannie-Freddie Plan Boosts Shares After White House Pitch \u201cThere was clearly a lot more leverage to take out in crypto and the recent high-flyer equities themes,\u201d Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura, wrote in a note to clients Friday. Shares of the pair are up six-fold since just before Trump\u2019s election on bets Pulte will help oversee a process to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after almost two decades of government control. The Trump administration has said it\u2019s a priority, though has been mum on specifics and timing. Pulte has frequently promoted the idea, with stock traders studying his social media posts for clues about what\u2019s likely coming next. It all has echoes of the first meme-stock phenomenon that emerged during the pandemic, when bored young people stuck at home and flush with stimulus checks started speculating in the stock market, driving wild runs in shares of GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. among others.

The volatility is also driven in part by the fact that the stocks have traded over the counter since they were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2010, limiting the potential investor pool and stock liquidity.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Login  Peter  23 November 2025   Weekly poll Realme  Realme\u2019s GT series has emerged as one of the best value-for-money flagships in recent years \u2013 challenging even OnePlus, which held that title for a long time. The GT 7 Pro had a good run as one of the more affordable Snapdragon 8 Elite phones out there. Now, its successor promises even more value. The Realme GT 8 Pro uses the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and that is not the only upgrade over the GT 7 Pro. The screen is sharper (6.79\u201d 1440p+, 144Hz vs. 6.78\u201d 1264p+, 120Hz), the battery is bigger (7,000mAh vs. 6,500mAh) and the camera is better.      Realme GT 8 Pro The 3x\/65mm telephoto camera now has a large 1\/1.56\u201d 200MP sensor (Samsung HP5). This is quite the departure from the medium-sized 1\/1.95\u201d 50MP sensor inside the 3.5x\/73mm periscope of last year\u2019s model. The ultra-wide also got a major bump to a 50MP sensor (up from a lowly 8MP sensor). The Ricoh GR mode is cool for fans of street photography, though we found it a bit limiting. The replaceable camera island is a gimmick, which some might find fun (and others can just ignore). The important thing is that the camera hardware produced excellent results with only minor complaints \u2013 this is excellent for something that costs a lot less than an all-out flagship like the Oppo Find X9 Pro.     Realme GT 8 Pro's camera islands The Realme GT 8 Pro has a fast chipset (the GPU needs more cooling), the display is great and the battery is one of the best we\u2019ve tested (not as good as the Oppo or OnePlus 15, though). The Oppo Find X9 Pro is a \u20ac1,300 phone and the vivo X300 Pro is even pricier at \u20ac1,400. Only the OnePlus 15 is in the same ballpark as the Realme at \u20ac1,000 (these prices are for 512GB units).

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Recently, I bought my first-ever MacBook. I\u2019ve spent some time with it, and I gotta say - despite all that hot garbage that is thrown at GNOME for being an OSX clone, GNOME does the job better than I\u2019ve expected, and certainly better than Apple. In some areas, that is. A bit of a backstory. I\u2019ve been using GNUplusSlashLinux for more than fifteen years. Most of the time, I used GNOME, starting from GNOME2, moving to Unity maybe for two years, then GNOME Shell, then KDE Plasma 5 for another two years, and switched back to GNOME Shell again. I\u2019m not mentioning some of my at most month-long endeavors to other DEs, like XFCE, or tiling WMs, because they never stuck with me. So I\u2019ve been there for most releases of GNOME Shell, followed them closely, even used to run Ubuntu GNOME when GNOME Shell became a thing, until it became the default in Ubuntu once again. Though by that time, I had already moved from Ubuntu to a different distribution for a variety of reasons. I wasn\u2019t always satisfied by GNOME, and was a fair bit vocal about it in the past - even got myself banned from r\/gnome subreddit, for shitting on it too much. That\u2019s why I experimented with other desktop environments, particularly Unity and KDE. Unity felt like a breath of fresh air after GNOME2, mostly because Canonical took years of people trying to make GNOME2 more OSX-like, and made decent steps in that direction. A global menu, HUD, blur, buttons on the left - you name it, it was there. Granted, it wasn\u2019t an OSX clone - rather, it was its own thing, and I still remember Unity days fondly. I switched to GNOME Shell almost instantly as it was released as Ubuntu GNOME spin, and while it was a bit janky, Unity started to lose steam, and GNOME looked like a hot new thing. Figure 1: Anyone else remember that wallpaper? GNOME sure has come a long way I did, however, run Unity on my older PCs, as it was far less taxing on resources than early versions of GNOME3, but then it was discontinued, and long-awaited Unity 8 with Mir never became a thing. So, when I was fed up with GNOME being a resource hog, often crashing, and moving towards Wayland, which didn\u2019t work as good as it was advertised, I decided to try KDE somewhere around 2018. And boy, how wrong was I, thinking that KDE is a buggy mess that would drain my resources even worse than GNOME. KDE Plasma 5 was nothing like I imagined - it was fast, lightweight, and slick. As a fan of old Unity design and OSX looks, I\u2019ve configured my plasma, but it wasn\u2019t a full clone, as other people often did. Instead, I tried to keep Plasma look like Plasma, but feel like a mix between Unity and OSX: Figure 2: To this day, I still think this was beautiful. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time fiddling with icon spacings in the top panel, combining widgets, writing my own in QML, just to throw it all away, a few years later I\u2019ve run Plasma 5 for about two years, and while I was enjoying it, there still were a lot of jank, bugs, occasional crashes (although Plasma recovered from them beautifully), but GNOME also became a lot better. So I switched back to GNOME, and I\u2019m still running it on my old laptop, where I\u2019m writing this part of the text right now: Figure 3: GNOME 42 (Note, I have a 2K display and use GNOME without scaling with enlarged fonts. Helps a lot with too big GNOME UI elements taking up space) As you can see, there are no fancy extensions - everything is the same as in a stock Fedora Workstation, because it is a stock Fedora Workstation. And I love it. Over the years, I had a love-hate relationship with GNOME, but after a while, I came to accept it as it is, and now it feels like a perfect desktop environment for me personally. That, of course, is thanks to GNOME developers actually trying to make GNOME better, and me buying into their vision of what an OS should look and feel like. There is still some jankiness to it, but I\u2019m willing to overlook it at this point, because after years of searching, I couldn\u2019t find anything that suits my workflow better. And I\u2019m fine with that. Before I go crazy on bashing macOS, I need to make a disclosure - I AM BIASED. I\u2019ve been using GNOME for a lot of time, and a lot of things that feel logical to me may not feel logical at all to others. Especially for macOS users. I\u2019m fully aware of that. Now, with that outta the way, let\u2019s begin. As I mentioned, I\u2019ve just got myself a MacBook. I did it because today\u2019s laptop market is a bit odd. It\u2019s hard to find a decent non-gaming laptop with good specs. I mean, there are Lenovo ThinkPads, ThinkBooks, and even IdeaPads that are decent, but I already owned an IdeaPad, and while it served me for six years and I liked it, I don\u2019t know if I want another one. Other brands may offer similar hardware, but I didn\u2019t investigate much. One of the reasons is OS choices. You see, I have run Linux as my main OS since around 2008. But I still have to use Windows from time to time. During university years, most of the non-programming software was Windows-only. After university, I had to use Windows to do media stuff, like music recording and video production, or design. Design is probably the only task Linux can handle without much of a hassle, given that there are decent programs for that. For instance, I don\u2019t mind GIMP, Krita, or Inkscape for most of my image-related tasks. I can even do video editing in Blender (and I do), but for some reason, it just works better under Windows. Audio production - not a chance. You\u2019ll find me dead in the ground before I figure out how to set up a realtime kernel and configure Jack. Not to mention, VSTs just don\u2019t work because many are relying on Windows APIs, and patching them through Wine is not a path I would like to walk. So I had to use Windows, constantly rebooting from Linux to it every time I wanted to record myself, or work on some video for my channel. And I also had to use the one that came with my laptop - 6 years ago, it was Windows 10. My parents recently got a new laptop with Windows 11 on it, and my god, it is horrible. After using Linux for more than fifteen years, I can\u2019t even imagine how Microsoft is still able to get away with it. Ads are everywhere - on the lockscreen, in the start menu, in notifications, etc. You can\u2019t even activate it without connecting to the network and signing into a Microsoft account. Oh, and updates. Fucking updates are being forced, while I\u2019m waiting for the next 5 hours until my video finishes rendering, because my laptop is too old to render in 4K. Yes, it\u2019s possible to \u201cdebloat\u201d Windows, remove most of the jank they added, disable automatic updates, and have a decent, clean experience. I just don\u2019t want to do that. The whole point of an operating system, to me, is to stay out of the way while managing resources, processes, and making sure my shit is done without major hiccups. Now, when Windows 10 support is ending, all we\u2019re left with is Windows 11, and god knows what bullshit awaits us in Windows 12. So I thought to myself: \u201cOk, I like Linux, but I want to be able to do my media-related stuff, and I don\u2019t want to invest in making Linux be able to do so. What options do I have other than that?\u201d I just applied to a new job, and almost everyone there uses a Mac, and many of them are musicians, either hobbyists like myself or even professionals. After asking around, it appeared to me that switching to macOS could be the solution I\u2019m looking for. It\u2019s a Unix, so I guess my Linux habits won\u2019t have to go through WSL hoops, and it has world-class support for media tasks. I think macOS can even be considered media-first when it comes to production, unlike Linux or Windows. So I saved some money and got myself a new MacBook Pro, with M4, and decent specs. While the laptop itself is nice - I like the aluminium body, keyboard is nice (although I had an opportunity of using their butterfly one, and liked it better), the screen is gorgeous, and even the laptop speakers are great, but\u2026 \u2026but the OS\u2026 This is the most counter-intuitive, user-unfriendly, confusing piece of software that I\u2019ve used in my life. And I worked as a consultant in a cellphone store and used software for cashiers, yet it still was not as horrid. I\u2019m sure nothing I will write here will be new, and I\u2019m committing an \u201cinternet crime\u201d of \u201cbeating a dead horse\u201d here, while it\u2019s probably already reduced to vapors, but I still want to get it out of my system. My laptop came with macOS 15 Sequoia preinstalled, so I haven\u2019t used previous versions much, although I had used a Mac a bunch of times in the past when I was at the university ten plus years ago. However, I decided to immediately upgrade to the 26.1 Tahoe, so I wouldn\u2019t get too used to the good-looking interface, and instead learn to get comfortable with this liquid glass crap. So I didn\u2019t touch macOS for some years, and some things have changed, but the majority of annoyances I remember are still here. As an ex-GNOME user, I like my virtual desktops. MacOS has had virtual desktops for a long time, but I think GNOME handled those better. First of all, switching with the touchpad gesture feels a lot slower. In GNOME, it wasn\u2019t an animation - the speed was tied directly to how fast you move your fingers, with easing after you release them. I got used to switching between desktops with a lot of speed, and on macOS, it\u2019s not like that. It seems it is also tied to the speed of the gesture, but it feels like there\u2019s a cap on the maximum possible speed:  Your browser does not support the video tag. An additional feature of GNOME is that it will automatically create additional virtual desktops once you\u2019ve filled all of them, and there\u2019s no limit to how many you can have. I usually have 4-5 desktops, but when I\u2019m not working on something, it\u2019s nice that I can only have one or two. In macOS, you can have as many desktops as you want, however, they\u2019re not added automatically. Or at least I couldn\u2019t find a setting for that. Because of that, even if I\u2019m not using all of them, sometimes a stray window is sitting on the last desktop, and I have to go through all of them to get to it. For some reason, the developers decided that the maximize button should instead act like a fullscreen button in macOS. When you maximize a window, it is moved to its own, dedicated virtual desktop - and I like it. I have used this pattern in GNOME for a long time by installing an extension that brings this feature into GNOME. However, and it is a big however, in GNOME, when I maximize a window, it creates a virtual desktop next to the one I\u2019m on. In macOS, it also creates a virtual desktop, but it moves it to the far right. So, imagine I\u2019m browsing the web, seeing something interesting, and I want to open Emacs to take a note. I open Emacs, maximize it, and on the desktop to the left of Emacs, I still have my browser, and I can switch between these back and forth. In macOS, if I do this, the window is moved to a desktop at the far end of the list of desktops. You can rearrange those manually, but it\u2019s clumsy. I would much prefer if the desktop were created to the right of the current one. Figure 4: Emacs was opend on Desktop 1, but after maximizing it is now essentially at Desktop 5 You can prevent this, in some form, by turning on the \u201cAutomatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\u201d in the settings. Then, a new fullscreen desktop is created to the right of the one you\u2019re currently on, which is nice, however, then the spaces get rearranged all the time. Like, when you\u2019re opening a link from the messenger, you switch to a desktop that has the browser open. The spaces get rearranged, such that the desktop with the messenger is next to the one with the browser, so you have to find the other one that previously was inbetween. It\u2019s so bizarre that we can\u2019t have fullscreen spaces created next to the current one without automatic rearrangement. And, because it is a fullscreen mode, it also makes things go a bit haywire for some applications. Emacs doesn\u2019t like this mode in particular. Right now, I\u2019m using four virtual desktops and manually organizing those, but maybe I need to adjust my usage pattern. Speaking of virtual desktops, let\u2019s look at the Mission Control thing. That\u2019s another pain point for me. You see, GNOME also has something akin to Mission Control - you swipe up with three fingers, and you see all your open windows: You can then move your windows between desktops or switch between them. MacOS also has this, with the exact same gesture: However, it is far less useful. In GNOME, I can close windows in the Overview: Figure 5: This close button is part of the Overview, not the window manager I can tweak the dock: Figure 6: Actually, the dock is only visible in Overview I can start typing, and the search appears: I can even swipe up again and bring up the applications menu: Figure 7: Not that I use it that much though There\u2019s a lot of control! Wanna know how much you can control in the Mission Control? You can move windows and desktops around. \u2026 That\u2019s it! What mission? What control? You can\u2019t do anything. Sure, one advantage macOS\u2019 mission control has is that you can move entire desktops around - in GNOME, you can\u2019t rearrange desktops themselves, only windows. And it plays nicely, with all this full-screen nonsense, but I still much prefer the GNOME approach here. Dock is a weird concept. It\u2019s cool to have it, and I remember in my early Linux days I wanted a macOS-like dock so badly that I tried to make it out of existing panels and custom widgets. I installed various dock plugins in my desktop environments just to have it zoom in on icons when I hover over them. These days are long past. Figure 8: remember Cairo dock? Figure 9: remember Plank? GNOME made a smart decision to only show the dock when you\u2019re in Overview - their \u201cMission Control\u201d variant. You don\u2019t need the dock constantly taking vertical space from your windows, and you don\u2019t have to deal with it showing up accidentally when you simply hover the mouse pointer at the bottom of the screen. Or at the side of the screen if it is your thing. When it is only inside the Overview\/Mission control, it makes sense as a favorites bar and a way of switching between applications. I haven\u2019t used Alt+Tab (or \u2318 command+\u2b7e Tab) in years because of that. I would much prefer for the dock to be only visible in Mission Control, but sadly, there\u2019s no way of doing it in macOS, as far as I can see. Moreover, Dock becomes useless in Mission Control specifically, so it won\u2019t work that well in macOS. What baffles me is that when you close an app, it stays in the dock, taking up space. Again, there seems to be no way of disabling it. Disabling the \u201cShow suggested and recent apps in Dock\u201d in system settings doesn\u2019t affect this behavior. You have to either use \u2318 Q, or right-click on the dock item and choose \u201cclose\u201d. What\u2019s the red button in the window for then? Usually, the app simply continues working in the background, as if minimized. Speaking of which, so far only the minimize button seems to work in a sane manner. Sure, there\u2019s little point in actually closing applications, given that this laptop has a lot of RAM and CPU power, but it always felt weird to me that apps want to stay open all the time. I\u2019m done with you - why do you think that you\u2019re so important that you shouldn\u2019t be closed? Do what you\u2019ve been told. Linux has always had weird file managers. To me, nothing beats Microsoft\u2019s Windows 7 file explorer - it was the least BS one in my opinion. GNOME\u2019s Nautilus, or Files, as it is called nowadays, had a few long-standing problems, some of which date back ten plus years. KDE\u2019s Dolphin was nice, but too had some weird quirks. However, it\u2019s nothing in comparison to macOS Finder. See the screenshot? A normal file view, right? Now, what should happen if I shrink the window?  Your browser does not support the video tag. The what? Who thought that this was a good idea? For those who didn\u2019t get it, the grid of items remains the same despite the size of the window! Like, seriously? The oddities don\u2019t end there. Where\u2019s the current path? For some reason, you can only see it when holding the \u2325 option, it appears at the bottom of the window. You can, in fact, toggle it in the settings so it is always shown, and while you can click on it to navigate, you can\u2019t edit it, as it seems. Another oddity is that when moving directories around, there\u2019s no option to merge directories with the same name by default. I mean, when I move a directory to a different place, where another directory exists with the same name, I expect them to be merged, but the pop-up only says this: When the \u2325 option key is pressed preemptively and held during the drag, the option to merge directories appears: Like, you need to know, before the hand, that the target location you\u2019ve chosen contains a folder with the same name you\u2019re moving right now. And if you didn\u2019t, you need to repeat the drag. Why not show it by default? For the record, when the same thing is done in the GNOME file manager, it asks you if you want to merge directories, but you can\u2019t replace them, so you can\u2019t ever lose data. And if it contains files with the same names, it asks for each file if you want to replace it, or keep both. Of course, you can choose to replace all files, so it wouldn\u2019t drag: Cutting files is also super weird. You first copy the file as normal, then proceed to the directory you want to move the file, and press \u2318 command+\u2325 option+v. Not only does the shortcut itself make your hand curl up as if you were a lobster, but also the semantics of this operation feel extremely weird - you copied the file, after all, why would it move afterwards? I guess, it\u2019 handy in cases when you thought you wanted to copy the file, but you actually decided to move it, so you don\u2019t need to input a whole new shortcut again, but it\u2019s a minor win in my book. Thankfully, I use graphical file managers rarely, so I can continue living in my comfort zone of Emacs\u2019 DIRED. But, while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s talk about files in general. I have some local music stored in the Music folder. Some videos and films are stored in the Videos folder. I also have pictures stored in the Pictures folder. Crazy, right? Imagine using the file system to store files systematically? I also try to keep things organized, so I manage all these with some directories, like band-name\/album-name\/track-name in case of music files, or year\/place-name\/photo in case of photos. I like it because if I want to listen to something, I can just drop the folder into the player, or open the image folder and relive those moments. Organizing these with folders is also handy for backing these things up - just drop the folder to the external drive and you\u2019re good to go. In macOS, as it seems, tags are the way the system wants to work with files. It\u2019s a different approach, and I\u2019m not entirely opposed to that, since filesystems are an illusion, after all. But every once in a while, I open the Music folder, and I see a second Music folder inside it. Apparently, it is created when opening the Music app. I can\u2019t use the Music app because it can\u2019t play FLAC, which is what the majority of my local library is encoded in. When I open the Videos folder, I often find a TV folder inside. I\u2019m not sure what app creates it, but it wasn\u2019t done by me, as I never launched the TV app. And it appears there far more regularly than the Music\/Music one. Other apps often create their own folders anywhere they want. The OrbStack app creates an OrbStack folder in $HOME. Some other app I installed created a folder in the Music folder for some reason, even though it didn\u2019t store music in it, just some audio files. It feels like that this is not my computer, but one I share with everyone else, and watch they do as they please with my filesystem. Never once was this a problem in Linux. Why can\u2019t apps keep their files to themselves? I\u2019m tempted to create things like Music\/My Music, or Pictures\/My Pictures, and use them specifically, forgetting about the default Music, Pictures, Videos thing, but it is such a cumbersome solution. It feels like, when you invite friends to a party, and they go to your bookshelf, and decide that they\u2019ll put some of their own stuff on it for the time being. And when they leave, they forget to take their stuff, but you don\u2019t want to touch it, as it is not exactly yours. And you can\u2019t throw it out, as your friends will be mad. I don\u2019t know. Oh, the image viewer. Let me ask you a question: You have a directory with some photos. You want to go through these photos in the order taken and view them. What do you do? In Linux, or Windows for that matter, the answer is simple: you double-click on the image you want to start with, the image viewer is opened, and you can use the arrow keys to go back and forth. Simple and effective! What happens when you do it in macOS Finder? Well, the image viewer still opens, but the arrow keys do nothing! No, in order to go through images, you need to select the items you want to view, hover over the File menu in the top bar, press the \u2325 option key, and select \u201cStart slideshow N items\u201d: HUH? Slideshow is cumbersome, as it is a slideshow - it\u2019s not meant for going through images manually. Alternatively, you can use a different viewer, called \u201cQuick Look\u201d, which supports arrow keys. Horray! But what is it? If you\u2019re in grid view, why are the arrow keys following the grid too?  Your browser does not support the video tag. HUUUUUH? Who thought that this was a good idea? Hopefully, I won\u2019t repeat this question all too many times. The only reasonable way of using it is by switching to the list view and using the up and down arrow keys. Which is still not great, because Quick View is meant to be viewed temporarily. Any accidental click outside of it will close it, and you\u2019ll have to find where you were and start from there. You can put it into fullscreen mode, but then the arrow keys stop working. This seems like such a basic feature for an image viewer, but somehow they\u2019ve managed to make it unusable. Not only that, but if this folder has any non-image files, like text files or PDFs, they\u2019ll be included in the quick view too. I understand that the purpose of Quick View is to view files quickly, and often it is a great thing to have, but at the same time, it\u2019s super weird in behavior. OK, I can go on and on about the software part of the os, but to be honest, all of this is covered by other people rather well. And, in truth, I couldn\u2019t be bothered to try all other preinstalled software, because it\u2019ll take a lot of time to put it into this already long article, but also because I don\u2019t want to. For instance, the Music app is also weird, and I already have an extensive post about how Linux music players are weird, so it goes without saying that I\u2019ll need to replace it with something else. Like, the Quick View can play FLAC without any issues, but the Music app (formerly iTunes, I believe) can\u2019t. Even GNOME\u2019s player could do that, and it kinda copies Apple\u2019s Music app in some aspects. Reencoding all my library into ALAC - Apple\u2019s equivalent of FLAC for lossless audio is not an option for me. I did it once before when I was a happy owner of an old 4th-gen iPod touch, but never again - it is pointless, there are better music players out there. So to me, the silver lining is that GNOME\u2019s inbuilt software is in a lot of ways better than one in macOS. And KDE has even better software than GNOME in a lot of cases. So instead, let\u2019s talk about hardware oddities and their operating system counterparts. So, while I do care about my privacy, I can\u2019t call myself a privacy maniac. However, one thing I like to have in my devices is the ability to mute the microphone. It\u2019s best when there\u2019s a hardware switch for that, but it\u2019s so rare that I\u2019ve only seen it once in my life on some Lenovo laptop. I mean, it\u2019s simply more convenient to do that than switch to a specific application that currently uses the microphone and toggle it there. So, on Linux, I used the microphone key found on my laptop\u2019s keyboard. It muted the microphone in the system settings. When I got my Mac, I examined the keyboard, and found almost all usual shortcuts - you can change screen brightness on F1 and F2, you can change volume on F11 and F12, and there\u2019s the microphone icon on F5. So I naturally assumed that this was a button to mute the microphone, after all, my old laptop had it too. I assumed wrong. There\u2019s no way to disable the microphone in macOS via inbuilt means. The only thing you can do is to manually set the volume input gain level to 0, effectively making the microphone deaf. Wanna know what the microphone button does then? I\u2019ll show you: Yup, it asks you if you want to use the speech-to-text feature. Cool, right? And you can\u2019t change what this button does. You can set a different shortcut for dictation in the settings, but look what happens when you press the microphone key:  Your browser does not support the video tag. It changes itself back to this button if you click \u201cdon\u2019t ask again\u201d! And then it asks you again once you press it! So what was the point of providing \u201cdon\u2019t ask again\u201d then? Though I\u2019ve managed to defeat this beast of a problem by writing some AppleScript. This script can be executed in the Shortcuts app, and by analyzing its output, we can rename the shortcut accordingly: After adding this shortcut to the \u201cControls\u201d menu, it acts as a mute button:  Your browser does not support the video tag. Works well so far, and even remembers the current input level value, so I can still adjust it if needed. Even more, it works better than it did on Linux, because it constantly forgot what level the mic was set to and chose a default value of 20%, which was too low. Here\u2019s a text version of the script, if anyone needs it: I can\u2019t share the whole script because no way I\u2019m making an iCloud account for that. Not strictly about the hardware part, since the keyboard itself is pretty good. It\u2019s a bit of a shame that Apple stopped using their Butterfly switches, as I did like them more than the current scissor ones, but the keyboard is still better than the one on my old laptop. One thing that bothers me, and which I got very accustomed to, is the fact that GNOME can remember keyboard layout per window: MacOS can\u2019t do that - and I don\u2019t know what is the reason for that. The settings page for layouts has a setting called \u201cAutomatically switch to a document\u2019s input source\u201d: However, I\u2019m not sure what it does. It seems to work sometimes, but other times it does the opposite of what I want to. I only have two layouts. Is it that hard to keep track of that amount of data per window? Though let\u2019s touch the keyboard one more time. I know that Apple has at least two keyboard layouts for different markets - one for the US and one for Europe. Figure 10: US layout Figure 11: European layout I specifically wanted the US layout, because all other laptops and standalone keyboards I had in my entire life had this kind of layout. Never once in my life have I seen the European layout on any device. But, for some unknown reason, Apple sells its laptops with a European layout in my area, and when my wife had a Mac, it had that. Every time I used it, I was fighting my muscle memory. Sure, it has more keys, and these contain some characters otherwise inaccessible without switching the layout, so it can look like Apple does a good thing. However, literally no one except Apple users had seen this layout, and it makes no sense to them. In my particular case, some already existing keys in the European layout are placed differently, like . and ?. So, since I didn\u2019t want to deal with that, I got myself a version with a US layout. Thankfully, there\u2019s a \u201cPC\u201d layout in the system settings, so I don\u2019t have to relearn anything. Using the \u201cPC\u201d layout on a European keyboard, however, is even more cumbersome. For some reason, there\u2019s no such thing as a middle-click on a touchpad. In Linux, it is usually mapped to clicking with three fingers at the same time. I\u2019ve been using it in Firefox a lot, and to paste stuff into the terminal once in a while. However, in macOS, my muscle memory is now against me. I click with three fingers in Firefox, and usually it brings up the right-click menu, which is fine at least. But sometimes it is registered as a left-click instead, and it is super annoying. Re-learning to use @@html:<kbd>\u2318 command<\/kbd> click will take some time, I guess Same as with the microphone, I\u2019d like to have a physical way of blocking the camera, but because Apple moved towards a custom-shaped display matrix, it can\u2019t be done as easily as before. It has a lot of sensors there, and blocking them with a huge plastic cover will make it impossible to close the laptop lid. Again, not strictly about the hardware side of things, but the display in general feels weird because of this notch - it\u2019s right in the middle of the screen, and I\u2019m used to having the clock there, after years of using GNOME. Some say it\u2019s more logical to have them at the far right side, as it is commonly done on phones, but phones have a much smaller and narrower screen. The same goes for notifications - having them in the middle feels more natural to me, because most of the content I\u2019m working with is somewhere in the middle. But your opinion may vary (as if anything else I said here can be universally agreed on). OK, enough bitching around, let\u2019s discuss some good parts. The screen itself is gorgeous, colors are vivid yet natural, and the 14-inch model is actually both a bit bigger and a bit taller than my old 13-inch laptop. I like the screen a lot. I didn\u2019t go for the nano-texture display, as I don\u2019t work in environments where reflections are problematic, so I can\u2019t say how it affects image quality. Maybe if I did, it\u2019d be in the bad section. The speakers are pretty good. And for a laptop, they\u2019re actually amazing. They have depth, the upmp, and are loud enough to watch films with comfort - can\u2019t say this about any other laptop I\u2019ve had before. Touchpad - oh, the touchpad. Simply put, the fact that it is a lot bigger (in fact, they had even bigger ones before), and I can press on it absolutely everywhere, is amazing. I was also surprised to learn that they aren\u2019t actually pressed in physically. Instead, it is a glass surface, which has haptic feedback that simulates the click. Purely amazing. I\u2019ve spent a long time trying to find anything remotely close to these touchpads on other laptops, but I never could find one. M4 Pro CPU is a beast. Recently, I forgot a passphrase to one of my GPG keys and tried to brute-force it. My old laptop had AMD Ryzen\u2122 7 3750H, which isn\u2019t fast by today\u2019s standards, but it wasn\u2019t a slow CPU either - it handled all of my tasks without major hiccups. I tried it first on the old laptop, and it could try about ~45 passphrases per second. The M4 could try ~750 passphrases per second. Everything is so fast I can\u2019t believe it. The macOS itself isn\u2019t all that bad. As a matter of fact, writing this post helped me find how to fix a lot of problems I initially had - this post was a lot longer before that, but I had to cut stuff from it, as it was no longer applicable. There are still some oddities - it constantly bothers me with asking permission to run apps for the first time, because I install them through brew, or downloaded from the official website (again, I\u2019m not making an Apple account, no, no). But I finally have a machine on which I can do both my programming tasks and media tasks without needing to keep two different operating systems to handle each task specifically. Finally, I can record my music with my right hand while writing code with the left - a dream. Even the liquid glass thing is not as bad as I thought it would be. Thankfully, Apple added a tinted style to it, so it is less transparent, which helps readability. And overall, I really like the device - it feels solid, and that it will last me another five years at minimum. Hopefully I didn\u2019t jinx myself here, though. Anyhow, thanks for reading, and please do share your experience with me, or if you know ways of solving the problems I\u2019ve listed, I would be glad to know about them!","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"Land of the Rise and Fall. The Xbox business today is pretty unrecognizable from that of 20 years past, which on this week all that time ago was launching the Xbox 360. There's all the changes to the business, a different suite of executives at the top, and an entirely different first-party portfolio, of course - but when I think of the changes, one absence comes to the forefront of my mind: Japan. It's difficult to know what the folks at Xbox were thinking 20 years ago. Did they know that they were about to break the deadlock that had been immovable in the PS2 and original Xbox era? Did they know the success that was coming, even in the face of hardware that'd begin to melt and error out on an industrial scale? The execs of the time would, I imagine, now say that they didn't know but they could sense they had something special. That old chestnut. They would say that, of course. But there are things that one could argue show that was definitely their thinking at the time - and one example that sticks out in my mind is Xbox's aggressive commitment to Japan at this time. The original Xbox was hardly a storming success in Japan, but despite that, Microsoft went big in the region with its follow-up. In this period, you had an aggressive Xbox making moves in the region. Developers were courted as they always are, but it's crucial that in this time period much of that courting came to consummation. Deals were inked, with Xbox ultimately signing a tranche of high-profile exclusives or timed exclusives for fans of Japanese games both in the homeland and abroad, and where true exclusive deals failed to materialise Xbox was able to successfully leverage the 360's head start over PS3 to secure optically valuable 'defacto' exclusives. Square Enix was approached, for instance, and while it took a while to cough up Final Fantasy it nevertheless spun up a suite of Xbox exclusives - Star Ocean 4, Infinite Undiscovery, and The Last Remnant. While Final Fantasy remained out of reach, Xbox also courted the franchise's father, now divorced from Square, resulting in Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon - still two of Xbox's most unique exclusives. A little company called FromSoftware, which had already fully supported the original Xbox with games like Otogi, signed up with the likes of Chromehounds and Enchanted Arms. Namco proffered Tales of Vesperia, the criminally underrated Eternal Sonata, and the earth-shakingly good Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.  The list goes on. Perhaps most consequential was Capcom, with that particular publisher offering up tentpole promotional exclusives like Dead Rising and Lost Planet, plus the promise of true multiplatform day-and-date releases in franchises like Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, and Street Fighter. There were the one million troops of Ninety-Nine Nights. Tecmo Koei had Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive. Oh, and Konami offered up Bomberman: Act Zero. That one sure made up for the lack of MGS4, yeah. It goes beyond those big names, though. With its PC-like development environment and a clearly thriving Japanese development relations department, the 360 also quietly became a default platform for stranger, more niche Japanese offerings that for a long time had largely been banished to PC. Xbox 360 became the non-arcade home of shump bullet hell titles, for instance, with the genre-dominating Japanese dev Cave ultimately putting over fifteen titles on 360 including the likes of Deathsmiles and DoDonPachi. In the same period of time, Cave only committed a single shmup to PlayStation 3. It wasn't just shooters, either. There were occasional trashy-but-exclusive action titles from developers like Cavia, and the 360 enjoyed a healthy slate of exclusive Japanese visual novels and life sim games. That included some porny ones, yes (the 360, to its shame, is key to GalGun's origin story), but beyond that too. The 360 was the initial console home of Namco's The Idolmaster, and was also the first place that Steins;Gate was released, years before it landed on PlayStation platforms. Not all of these games would even end up releasing in the West officially, but many had English language compatibility anyway, and lots of the shooters were simple enough that you could puzzle through. It was a golden age of importing niche Japanese games that, not that long ago, were often arcade-exclusive. I think of this era not just as Xbox bankrolling and securing a bunch of Japanese-made games, but also making an effort on their own part. I think of Crackdown - rebranded to 'RIOT ACT' in Japan and given sweet Japan-focused anime cover art - demonstrative of a mission to crack this market. This sort of bespoke thinking for Japan would quickly evaporate. Back to the Japan-made games, though. Steins;Gate ends up a fantastic poster-child for what went on to happen to Xbox's influence in Japan. Around a decade after its debut, that same first entry in the series was remade - but by that point skipped Xbox entirely, instead releasing on PC, PS4, Switch, Vita, and iOS. The shift had arrived. In the end, Microsoft sold over three times as many Xbox 360 consoles in Japan as it did the original Xbox. That still ended up a fraction of the business Sony and Nintendo were doing, but was still pretty decent generation-on-generation growth. But it wasn't enough, I suppose, for a continued commitment to these sorts of exclusivity deals and developer relations. Or maybe the Japanese market had simply had enough. Even as the Xbox One went on to secure the likes of Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, and Metal Gear with a big splash, the next generation proved brutal, with the Xbox One selling something like 90% less units in Japan. Even the niche it had carved out deserted, with many of those smaller games migrating to PlayStation Vita and burgeoning PC market. And that, as they say, was that. Needless to say, I miss this time. This perhaps shouldn't be a surprising opinion from someone who owns a website dedicated to the very Japan-biased role-playing genre. But I don't think anyone could argue against the idea that Game Pass could bloody well benefit from some cheap and cheerful Cave arcade ports. These niche things actually fare incredibly well in such services in terms of finding a new audience. And certainly a flagship Japanese RPG like Eternal Sonata or Lost Odyssey would be killer. Modern Xbox is aware of all of this, obviously. In recent years, we're seeing Microsoft make its most concerted effort since the Xbox 360 era in shoring up Japanese developer relationships. Over the last few months I've been trying to build up a picture of the moves being made, and though that heady 360 heyday doesn't appear to be returning any time soon, today's efforts are at least more notable and noticeable. The noises the Japanese development community is making about Xbox do appear to be trending positive again. \"The Japanese developer community is probably one of the oldest game development communities in the world, having built games for many decades, and many of the iconic game franchises and innovations in gaming have come from Japan,\" Mena Sato Kato, the current Head of Xbox Asia Partnerships, tells me. \"Their dedication to the creativity, the craftsmanship, and the attention to detail is what makes them so special and is why this community is so important to us.\" Kato's role at Xbox is key, and her joining was arguably a sign that the company is beginning to take Japanese development seriously again. Prior to being at Xbox, Kato had been the vice president of business development at Sony Interactive Entertainment for eight years. At the enemy, in other words. It's an appointment that suggests that even if the Japanese market for Xbox publishing is difficult, the importance of Japanese games right around the world is understood once more. From the outside, it feels like Xbox is now picking back up where some of these relationships left off in the midst of the Xbox One's struggles. Japan's development community has also shifted immeasurably - shaken up by the Switch and a new openness to the PC in particular. That must be difficult - but Kato paints a picture of a Japanese industry receptive to Microsoft's new and very different strategy. \"Over the years, we\u2019ve built very close relationships with our partners, had deep discussions over hardware generations and through initiatives like Game Pass and more recently Xbox Play Anywhere, and listened to a lot of feedback,\" continues Kato. \"The industry has changed in ways we never imagined, and our strategy of being where players are is starting to be more relative and is resonating more, and all of that combined have really flourished into the many more partnership moments you see today.\" It feels appropriate that Kato makes these comments to me right as Xbox releases an exclusive Ninja Gaiden title from Team Ninja. Given the 360 launched with Dead or Alive 4, it does feel like something of a full-circle moment. That does, I admit, give me a little sliver of hope for the future of Japanese games big and small in the Xbox ecosystem. But this week, as the 360 hits a milestone birthday, I can't help but look back and think: we really didn't know how good we had it, did we? The Xbox 360 turns 20 years old on 22nd November, so we've put together a week of coverage that looks back on Microsoft's most successful games console.

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"If you're someone who's finally switching from a mechanical hard drive to an SSD, that's great news. You're making one of the best upgrades you'll ever make to your PC. However, you might be confused between SATA and NVMe SSDs on the market. While virtually any SSD will be significantly faster than your old hard drive, buying an NVMe drive will be better for your PC in multiple ways. The newer storage interface not only leverages your other hardware a lot better, but the enhanced performance can actually benefit some real-world workloads. The price isn't a differentiator between SATA and NVMe SSDs anymore, so there's no reason to pick the older format over the newer one. Still stuck on slower SATA SSDs? Supercharge your system with NVMe storage. Let's talk numbers. SATA SSDs typically support speeds of around 500MB\/s, which is easily 3\u20134 times faster than a hard drive. These speeds pale in comparison to even a PCIe 3.0 (Gen3) NVMe SSD, which can reach 3,500 MB\/s of sequential speeds, 7 times faster than a SATA SSD. Gen4 and Gen5 NVMe drives have taken this to around 7,000 and 14,000MB\/s, respectively. Most people today are buying Gen4 NVMe SSDs as they fall in the performance and price sweet spot. A typical Gen4 drive will make your system feel more responsive than a SATA SSD, thanks to the much higher read\/write speeds and lower latency owing to the NVMe interface. While blazing-fast speeds alone don't mean that your PC will magically boot faster or that games will load instantaneously on a Gen5 SSD, the faster interface can have some tangible benefits in the real world. For instance, productivity users and professionals relying on video editing and rendering software will benefit from the cutting-edge speeds of Gen5 SSDs when rendering or exporting files. Even when transferring tons of data between drives, the higher sequential speeds of a Gen5 NVMe drive will matter. Gen5 SSDs haven't begun to help gaming workloads yet, but developers have started to optimize games for faster storage. Technologies like DirectStorage will soon be seen supporting more titles, finally leveraging Gen5 NVMe speeds. Right now, for most people, the difference in performance between different NVMe generations might mean very little, but any NVMe drive will be significantly faster than a SATA SSD in terms of the overall experience.  These small changes can make a big impact on your NVMe SSD\u2019s speed and lifespan A few years ago, when Gen4 SSDs were still new, SATA SSDs used to be much more affordable, offering consumers a real differentiator. Someone who didn't need the extra performance of an NVMe drive could buy a cheaper SATA SSD and call it a day. Today, however, if you compare the prices of SATA and Gen4 NVMe SSDs, you'll see the same $130 price tag for a 2TB drive. Even 4TB and 8TB models are following the same trend, converging around the $230 and $630 price points. The one advantage that SATA SSDs had over NVMe drives has disappeared, making the older technology obsolete in yet another way. Of course, you don't need to rush to replace every single SATA SSD already present on your PC, but buying a new one doesn't make sense \u2014 unless you're limited by your motherboard or specifically looking for a SATA SSD home lab setup. This M.2 4TB card from PNY features read speeds of\u00a07,500 MBps and write speeds of 6,850 MBps, making it a pretty snappy choice for your PC or PS5. With a\u00a096-layer 3D NAND structure, this flash memory also includes a\u00a01GB DDR4 DRAM cache. While it isn't as fast as newer PCIe 5.0 SSDs, it's still a pretty good buy. The Crucial MX500 offers fast SATA SSD performance, great reliability, and a stylish design at an affordable price, making it an ideal choice for gamers seeking cost-effective mass storage. I put my old SSD to good use by installing a secondary OS SATA is now considered a legacy bus that was created to replace older interfaces like PATA. It was a big jump when it became popular in the mid-2000s, but it's an aging standard now. Most of us first used an SSD on the SATA interface, but it was really suited to hard drives. The interface wasn't equipped to get the most out of high-performance flash storage, which is why NVMe was developed as a replacement. Using a direct PCIe link to the CPU instead of the indirect one that SATA does (via the motherboard's chipset), the NVMe interface was built for high-performance storage. It can use multiple PCIe lanes for high-speed data transfer, and has long eclipsed SATA as the most popular storage interface. Using SATA SSDs is still fine if you bought them years ago, but NVMe drives should be your go-to when expanding your storage in 2025. There are no cables to deal with, and installing an NVMe drive is uncomplicated. Besides, almost every motherboard launched in the last 9\u201310 years has an M.2 slot, so you can probably install at least one NVMe drive if you're shopping for storage. In terms of power consumption, NVMe SSDs are known to idle at a lower wattage compared to SATA SSDs. The difference won't matter to most people, but every bit counts when you're conscious about power usage. From CDs to SSHDs: The storage formats we left behind The NVMe standard is here to stay, thanks to development on PCIe 8.0 already underway in 2025. A post-NVMe world could utilize newer interfaces like CXL, a shared interconnect between multiple components, to supercharge transfer speeds beyond what we expect right now. For the near future, however, NVMe-over-PCIe SSDs are the gold standard for consumers.  We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved  For storing documents and photos and files that don't \"run\" a sata ssd is still easier to deal with; just two cables. An nvme requires roaming about on the motherboard, which means taking the rig apart and putting it back together.   For the big muscle movers and booting, the nvme is the way to go. The speed issue varies based on need because 600 MBs isn't slow. Even some games will blaze along at that speed. A 7000+ m.2 nvme isn't going to make fortnite that much faster.  But you don't need to open the case and install nvme everyday. \ud83e\udd17","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-23","content":"MLB Trade Rumors  By Nick Deeds | November 23, 2025 at 2:33pm CDT  Every year, MLB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-tender deadline sees clubs allow some of their players who remain under team control to test the open market early, whether it be due to an increasing price tag in arbitration or a need for additional space on the club\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 40-man roster. Previous seasons have seen a number of high-profile players wind up non-tendered, with Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, and Brandon Woodruff all having been non-tendered at one point or another in their careers only to this year appear on MLBTR\u2019s Top 50 Free Agents list. While players of that caliber who reach free agency by way of a non-tender are extremely rare, plenty of others find themselves cut loose early by their clubs only to make an impact elsewhere down the line. That could be as a regular in the lineup or rotation or simply as a solid contributor off the bench or out of the bullpen. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look at five hitters who hit free agency following last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-tender deadline and could be worth keeping an eye on throughout the coming offseason. Players are listed in alphabetical order, with their age for the 2026 season in parentheses. JJ Bleday (28) Bleday has quite the pedigree behind him, as he was drafted fourth overall by the Marlins back in 2019. A consensus top-50 prospect in the game prior to his MLB debut in 2022, Bleday struggled for the Marlins and A\u2019s across his first two seasons in the majors before enjoying what looked to be a breakout 2024 campaign. That year, he slashed .243\/.327\/.437 (120 wRC+), cut his strikeout rate to just 19.5% while maintaining a solid 10.4% walk rate, and showed enough pop in his bat to hit 20 homers and a whopping 43 doubles. He was a below average but not disastrous defender in center field, and that in combination with his strong offensive production allowed him to put together a 3.2 fWAR season. Unfortunately, Bleday\u2019s star fell back to Earth this year with a tough season where his strikeout rate ticked back up to 26.5% while his power dissipated, leaving with a .212\/.294\/.404 slash line and a wRC+ of just 90. Things got bleak enough that the A\u2019s actually optioned Bleday to the minors multiple times this season. Perhaps a change of scenery can help Bleday recapture the form he flashed in 2024, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine an outfield-needy team like the Royals or Guardians scooping him up. One sign of optimism regarding Bleday is his performance over the season\u2019s final two months, as he slashed .252\/.306\/.495 (115 wRC+) with six homers and seven doubles in 111 plate appearances after being recalled to the majors on August 2nd. Nathaniel Lowe (30) By far the most established hitter on this list, Lowe has a Gold Glove, a Silver Slugger award, and a World Series ring on his mantle for his work with the Rangers from 2021-24. Over that four-year stretch, he slashed a strong .274\/.359\/.432 with 78 home runs and a 124 wRC+. That\u2019s the performance of a quality regular and left him good for around three WAR per season at first base. Lowe was shipped from Texas to D.C. last offseason, however, and his time with the Nationals left much to be desired. He hit just .216\/.292\/.373 across 119 games before he was cut loose from the organization, and while his time with the Red Sox saw him rebound to a .280\/.370\/.420 slash line closer to what he\u2019s posted in the past, that 34-game stint in Boston only brought his season-long wRC+ back up to 91. While Lowe is hardly likely to get the sort of attention pieces like Pete Alonso or even Luis Arraez will garner this winter, he\u2019d still be an upgrade to a club in need of help at first base like the Padres, Diamondbacks, or Twins. Christopher Morel (27) The youngest player on this list by more than a year, Morel arguably has the highest upside of any player on this list but significant flaws that could hold him back from getting a starting job somewhere. The youngster\u2019s big league career started with a bang in 2022, and over his first two seasons with the Cubs Morel slashed .241\/.311\/.471 with 42 homers in 220 games and a wRC+ of 115. While he struck out at a massive 31.6% clip and was a below-average fielder everywhere he played on the diamond, his impressive power and ability to take walks were enough to make him a well above average hitter. The past two years have been brutal for the slugger, however, as his production has largely dissipated. Morel\u2019s first half with the Cubs in 2024 was unusual, as his numbers dipped (91 wRC+) despite most of his peripherals trending in the right direction, including a strikeout rate that dropped to 24.5% while his walk rate climbed to 11.1% with 18 home runs. While the usual above-average production wasn\u2019t quite there, the Rays were interested enough to make him a centerpiece of the return for Isaac Paredes at the trade deadline. Unfortunately, Morel\u2019s production completely collapsed during his time with the Rays as he hit just .208\/.277\/.355 (79 wRC+) in 495 plate appearances over the past two years. While it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see a team try and unlock the upside Morel flashed with the Cubs early in his career given his youth and three years of remaining team control, his lack of defensive ability could make him a tough fit for many teams. Mike Tauchman (35) Tauchman is the oldest player on the list, and returns after also being listed in last year\u2019s edition of this post. Non-tendered by the Cubs last winter, Tauchman stayed in Chicago by way of a deal with the White Sox and generally made good on his contract with the South Siders, hitting .263\/.356\/.400 (115 wRC+) across 385 plate appearances. Tauchman may not still be the capable center fielder defender he was earlier in his career, but a teams would be hard pressed to find a player who can more reliably provide on-base ability. That\u2019s especially true at his expected price tag, which could draw in suitors with tight budgets this winter. Among the 229 players to record at least 1000 plate appearances since the start of the 2023 season, Tauchman\u2019s .359 OBP ranks 21st, sandwiched between Rafael Devers and Kyle Schwarber. His production naturally falls well short of those star players thanks to a lack of power, as he\u2019s not hit even ten homers in a season since 2019. Even so, he\u2019d be a valuable addition to a team like the Royals, Astros, or Rays in either a bench or platoon role. Ramon Urias (32) Urias stands out among this group as being the most valuable defender of the bunch. Bleday and Tauchman are both restricted to the outfield and profile poorly in center, while Lowe is a first base-only defender. Morel has experience at valuable positions like center field and third base, but has graded out terribly at them by defensive metrics and profiles best as a DH. Urias, by contrast, is a Gold Glove winner at third base who has substantial experience at both second base and shortstop as well. His +5 Outs Above Average around the infield this year ranked in the 88th percentile among all fielders. Typically, Urias pairs that strong glove with a decent bat that makes him a solid second-division regular or high-quality part-time player. In parts of six seasons in the majors, Urias is a career .257\/.321\/.403 (104 wRC+) hitter who had consistently been at or above league average until this season. This year, however, Urias hit just .241\/.292\/.384 (87 wRC+). That performance is in part dragged down by a rough stint in Houston after being dealt to the Astros at the trade deadline, but even his mark with Baltimore was below league-average. Questionable as Urias\u2019s numbers were this year, his overall track record and ability to provide solid infield defense should make him an attractive addition for a team, particularly given a thin infield market with few everyday options. The Yankees, Brewers, Mariners, and Tigers are among the many teams Urias could make at least some sense for. 2025-26 MLB Free Agents MLBTR Originals Christopher Morel J.J. Bleday Mike Tauchman Nathaniel Lowe Ramon Urias  Citizen1  5 hours ago Tauchman and urias look promising of the bunch. Tauchman probably cut due to a salary slash by the white sox  King Floch  5 hours ago I\u2019d love an Orioles reunion with Urias. Solid player to with a good attitude, and great insurance for a long term injury at 2B or 3B.  You could even platoon him with Holliday if you really want to min\/max the offense in 2026.  stuart schlotterbeck  4 hours ago I agree. Urias makes perfect sense as a backup to Holliday and Westburg. Especially with Westburg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s injury history. And the Orioles currently don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a lot of options for backup infielders.  Rsox  4 hours ago The Angels make sense for Urias, especially if they lose Rengifo. Versatile to play 2B\/3B\/SS and could be an everyday player if need be. Bleday makes sense for a number of teams looking for cheap upside. His ability to play all three OF spots could aid his appeal to a number of teams. The Angels need a LH and Bleday could slot in CF. The Guardians and Royals were already mentioned in the article. The White Sox, Pirates, Astros, Rangers, Reds all could use offense in the Outfield  Morel, like Bleday offers cheap upside with even greater versatility as he can play on the Infield as well (arguably not well, but he can). Morel\u2019s offense cratered after being traded by the Cubs so he probably ends up with a minor league deal to one of the teams mentioned above for Bleday. Lowe is cheap enough that even teams like the Marlins and Twins could afford to take a chance for if nothing else a potential trade chip mid-season. Tauchman is used to coming off the bench and won\u2019t kill you if given regular playing time. Pirates, Royals, Guardians all come to mind here.  dirtbagbaseball427  4 hours ago Bleday could really end up being a steal for the right team. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a year removed from a really solid and promising season.  ASTROS27!  2 hours ago Astros? I\u2019ve seen rumors of the Astros getting JJ  HalosHeavenJJ  4 hours ago Urias first great here.  Bleday in LF wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a bad roll of the dice. Trade Adell for pitching, get Bader for CF?  ASTROS27!  2 hours ago Jo Adell to Pirates for Mitch Keller and Tony Blanco Jr Thoughts?  Troutahni  2 mins ago Jo Adell is gong nowhere. He has the potential to hit 50 home runs and his rate numbers have been steadily improving. At the least if you subtract his 37 HRs and Taylor Ward\u2019s 36, how do you replace them?Please don\u2019t answer with Jorge Soler. Jo provides cost certainty and you still need a right handed power bat in the lineup. The Jo Show is staying in Anaheim. He will be on one of the rafters hanging in front of the Big A. The fans are beginning to really rally around him and he\u2019s become a fan favorite.  Bob Sacamano 310  4 hours ago Would love to see my White Sox take a chance on Bleday in RF  Sabermetric Acolyte  4 hours ago I think Lowe showed he can be valuable to any team looking for cheap help. From the little I saw of him it seemed like he was someone who was better with something on the line and something to prove. If he goes to a team that stands a shot at the playoffs, I think you\u2019d see him being a valuable asset.  Oppo nacho  4 hours ago Bleday seems like the kinda of low risk player the reds go after, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fine with it if they make other improvements\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Bill M  4 hours ago 1\/5: Tauchman.  Old York  4 hours ago Christopher Morel appears to have the highest upside of the group by a mile.  Only thing holding him back is contact, and at 26 with 76+ mph bat speed, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the exact profile player-dev labs dream about.  NashvilleJeff  3 hours ago Like to see Atlanta go after Tauchman or Bleday. A quality 4th of\u2019er that could push Eli White to #5 and allow them to use Profar at DH some to get his glove out of LF.  southi  1 hour ago Tauchman could play outfield, DH, or be a steady bat off the bench if needed, all for a low price.  NashvilleJeff  36 mins ago Yep. Wanted him last year too. Maybe Santa will listen this year.  Homerunbunt  2 hours ago Urias to Royals could be nice, need a cheap right handed bat that can play OF and 2nd\/3rd. Tauchman also intriguing.  Hopefully they get someone better though, kinda blocks cags in RF.  Ardolis garcia is another option.  Flanster  1 hour ago Tauchman would be good to have as a semi-regular player  Pickle_Britches  1 hour ago Morel is garbage.  Salzilla  1 hour ago Bleday to me has the most upside on this list. Morel, too, but he\u2019s sort of lost that luster.  UKPhil  20 mins ago I like Nathaniel Lowe for the Marlins. Platoon with Wagaman? Please login to leave a reply.
