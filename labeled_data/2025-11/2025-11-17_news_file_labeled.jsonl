{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"                 Reading time 2 minutes        Peter Thiel is the latest investor to sell off Nvidia shares. According to regulatory filings, the billionaire\u2019s hedge fund, Thiel Macro, has offloaded its entire stake in Nvidia. The firm has sold 537,742 shares in its third quarter, which would have been worth around $100 million, according to Reuters estimates. There are many reasons why investors might decide to sell off their stake in a company, and not all of those reasons are worth giant alarm bells. But it does pique interest when those stakes belong to the world\u2019s most valuable company, and the decision comes mere days after another high-profile investor selloff. Just last week, prominent Japanese investor SoftBank shared that it sold its entire stake in the chipmaker. The firm said that it raked in $5.83 billion from the sale of 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October. The sale was apparently made to fund a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, on top of the billions the firm has already invested in the tech giant. SoftBank and OpenAI are also partners under the Trump-backed data center build-out plan known as Stargate. Nvidia is considered the ultimate AI darling. It\u2019s a company that hit $5 trillion market value by riding the AI wave, and it holds a central position in the industry as the primary global supplier of highly coveted AI chips. As a result, any perceived distrust in Nvidia\u2019s trajectory is taken as a negative sign for the AI industry overall. It\u2019s not entirely certain what Thiel and SoftBank\u2019s sell-offs confidently signal about overall investor sentiment regarding artificial intelligence, and whether or not there is indeed an AI bubble, but it sure is adding on top of readily existing worries, and making people feel queasy. Over the past few months, a growing chorus of experts, from the Bank of England to investor Michael Burry of The Big Short fame, have been warning against an AI bubble that could bring not just the market but possibly the entire American economy down with it if it bursts. Companies, like Nvidia, have hit record valuations as investors are delighted by the potential gains that AI represents. But some believe that investor appetite is FOMO-driven and could be artificially inflating the actual value of these companies. Even some top tech executives like Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos have admitted to overvaluation. So what happens when that investor appetite just stops? All eyes are now on Nvidia\u2019s earnings report later this week to shed more light on whether the news from the past week is part of a newly forming trend that warrants worry or just a fluke. The tech giant will be reporting third-quarter earnings results after the bell on Wednesday.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Turns out, Meta's AI glasses work just fine with high-strength prescription lenses.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Of all the emerging form factors for AI, smart glasses appear to be the most promising. Many of us already wear some form of glasses daily, whether those are prescription glasses, blue-light blocking glasses, or sunglasses. Embedding smart features and AI into a product that is already a huge part of our lives sounds like a recipe for success. There's just one problem \u2014 prescription glasses-wearers, despite being likely to benefit the most from having AI on their face, are usually left out. To me, Meta makes the best smart glasses on the market, and they're ready for primetime. So, I took a leap. I spent over $500 on third-party prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard. Here's what it was like customizing Oakley Meta smart glasses with unsupported prescription lenses.      I've worn prescription Oakley glasses and sunglasses for half a decade now, and I was excited when Meta announced it was bringing its smart glasses to Oakley frames. Unfortunately, the Oakley Meta HSTN didn't officially support my prescription, and the Oakley Meta Vanguard is not offered with prescription lenses. I wasn't about to give up, so I searched for third-party companies willing to make prescription lenses for Oakley Meta glasses. After months of research, I placed my first order with Lensology, a U.K. lens crafter that specializes in \"click and fit\" service for Meta glasses. I ordered a pretty specific lens configuration due to my prescription strength, and the color matched my Meta HSTN frames in the \"Warm Gray\" colorway.      The ordering process with Lensology was easy, and the company takes care of all import charges, so you aren't hit with a bill when they arrive. The wait, however, was a bit lengthy. It took approximately two weeks for Lensology to manufacture my lenses, as the configuration I chose was non-stock. Then, the U.S. FDA spot-checked my lenses during the import process, further delaying them. I was told this was Lensology's first-ever FDA spot check (what luck!), and the company's customer service was responsive and helpful. Really, the delay was out of Lensology's control, and my lenses arrived roughly within a month of placing my order despite the snag. To make things right, Lensology sent another set of lenses free of charge, which passed customs immediately, confirming that this was just a fluke.      I then searched for a way to wear prescription lenses with the Oakley Meta Vanguard and stumbled upon SVED Optical. The company manufactures prescription inserts for various types of sports glasses and goggles, and indeed, they have one for Vanguard. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The experience ordering from SVED was exceptional for a few reasons. The company is based in the U.S., which simply makes things easier for a stateside buyer. The Vanguard inserts were also significantly cheaper, costing only $164 (even less with an email discount). They slot in behind the Vanguard's built-in Oakley Prizm sunglass lenses, which makes them more affordable. SVED delivered my Oakley Meta Vanguard inserts 12 days after I placed my order. That turnaround time is good enough to rival official Meta\/Oakley handling speeds, if it sold Vanguard prescription lenses.      I try to order straight from LensCrafters, the EssilorLuxottica-owned company Meta partners with for smart glasses, whenever possible. It costs more, but the return policy and warranties are exceptional. I like being able to walk into a store and get my situation handled immediately, and not having that with Lensology or SVED was a risk. To their credit, both brands accept mail-in returns within 30 days. When each order arrived, the quality and insertion process left me with no complaints. Putting the SVED inserts into the Meta Vanguard is so simple that anyone can do it. You remove the stock Vanguard nose piece and slip the SVED inserts into place. The prescription lenses are attached to a new nosepiece, which secures them to the Vanguard frame. I was skeptical about the added weight and how my prescription Vanguard setup would feel on my face. Surely, the lenses would rattle and scratch against the stock sunglass lenses, right? Between daily use and a 5K run, I was pleased to find that none of these were noticeable issues.      The process was trickier for the Meta HSTN glasses, because you have to physically remove the stock lenses and push the prescription ones in their place. It'll be a harder process the thicker the prescription lenses. Lensology has a great instructional video on YouTube, though, and the company even records a test fit from their factory that validates the lenses fit in HSTN frames. If you have any experience changing out prescription lenses, the process is easy. Even if you don't, you'll get the hang of it quickly. The secret is to push really hard \u2014 you might think the glasses will break, but it's a necessary part of the process.      Meta's AI glasses are already pricey, but adding prescription lenses through a third-party company further increases the cost of entry. There's inherent risk, even with reputable companies. You might be left at a loss if you get buyer's remorse and need to pay to ship the custom lenses back through the return process. That's why, after months of indecision, I gave SVED and Lensology a shot so you don't have to take that risk. I recommend both SVED and Lensology, and I ordered lenses from each with my own cash. If you can only pick one, I'd go with the Vanguard inserts. The cheaper price means you won't be in trouble if your prescription changes and you need a new set. On the other hand, the SVED and Vanguard combo isn't feasible for use indoors or at night. If you need clear or Transitions lenses, the Lensology and HSTN setup is the way to go. Now that I've gone through the process of putting unsupported prescription lenses in Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard, I think anyone on the fence should do the same. It's worth it because Meta glasses are a game-changer, and everyone should get to experience them.       The best AI glasses Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses on the market with an IP67 durability rating, a louder speaker, and a central 3K video camera. Garmin and Strava integration are the icing on the cake for fitness buffs.  The standard retail versions of the Oakley Meta glasses are not typically sold with prescription lenses installed by default. While you can purchase prescription lenses for the Meta HSTN glasses, they only fall within a certain range. The Vanguard glasses do not officially support prescription lenses. The Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses support a prescription range of -6.00 to +4.00, which is the same range offered by the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. You'll first have to remove the original lenses by pushing them out from the back of the frame. You may have to push quite hard for them to pop out. Afterwards, you snap on the new lenses by pushing them into the from from the front. You must remove the nose piece from the Vanguard and replace it with the SVED nose piece insert with the lenses attached. The prescription lenses will be placed behind the Vanguard sunglass lenses.

If gold were less valued, its use in industry would be more widespread, because it doesn't oxidize.  Gold may be overvalued, but it has intrinsic worth. NVIDIA stock is ownership of a small part of the company.  The company has a tremendous amount of value.  NVIDIA stock may be overvalued, but it has intrinsic worth. The dollar is backed by the The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, which means it's backed by the American people.  That is a lot of value right there.  It may be overvalued, but not by all that much. Bit Coin?  It's just what people are willing to pay and nothing more.  Even if you value the law-skirting uses of crypto, there is no reason to have limited coins, unless that is you want to make a tulip craze and fuck people out of their money.  Zero intrinsic worth.  Zero. You sure use the word \"leftist\" a lot.  Might want to get your head checked. The repaying of debts is just one way that fiat currency is used.  It's not the only way, unless you want to redefine money as just paper showing debt. If you think of the cryptocurrency boom and then the AI boom as gold rushes, you'll notice that Nvidea was the one selling shovels. It's not a bad metaphor, but it's not a great one either.  I'd think of them as the train, brick, machinery, energy, and coal sellers of the industrial revolution, if I thought \"AI\" is all it is cracked up to be.  I take the technology seriously and see many business uses, but it's not going to be quite as revolutionary as the investors hope. Recommendation: check the left hemisphere first.  Nvidia stock? A little more difficult there, but it is a very large company that makes a bunch of chips. Some of which make games look really good on my computer. So, if I can get enough gold to give to the ladies to get laid, I'll lock myself in my mom's basent and play videos games which is a decent backup plan to hold.   Now for the big onr, USD. I can always pay someone for sex or if I have enough USD someone might be attracted to my ability to buy lots of gold.   To that end, never been asked how much BTC I own. YMMV. Trivialize it all you like. But that's just shortsighted pedantry. Gold has been considered valuable for longer than people have been writing it down. There's almost nothing with the unbroken track record of gold in being a store of wealth, and it'll still be wealth after we've all turned to dust. And why would aesthetic uses not be intrinsic value? Sure, if it were a case of unproven demand or a fad...  but that isn't the case. Interesting thing is that if you 2000 years ago had enough money to hire a soldier and you turned that money into gold. If you today would turn that gold into a money, you could hire a soldier with it. On the other hand. If you 5 years ago had enough money to hire a soldier and you bought NVidia stocks with that money. Today the stock would be worth of about 30 soldiers. That's the difference between a store of wealth and a speculation. Long after nVidia - or Bitcoin - have faded into history, gold will still be valued as wealth. Nice bunch of extreme lies you have there. Not any surprise. Here is the first one: In actual reality, the industrial value of gold is not far from its market price. Typically about 50% of it. Do you really think it would get used in industrial applications if it was 100x more expensive than the value using it provides? Jesus fucking Christ.  I didn't know every incel was going to get all philosophical. Jesus fucking Christ. I didn't know every incel was going to get all philosophical.It's easier than washing one's balls. Jesus fucking Christ. I didn't know every incel was going to get all philosophical. It's easier than washing one's balls. But my balls hang so low. Are you ok? Trust me.

Bose represents the premium tier of consumer audio gear and their Bluetooth speakers rank among the best available. The Soundlink Revolve+ delivers the kind of sound quality and build that justifies the brand\u2019s reputation, with 360-degree audio projection and real bass response that cheap speakers can\u2019t replicate. Amazon has dropped the price to $179 from the usual $299 for an early Black Friday deal which marks an all-time low for this model. With all of the competition flooding the market, no other speaker on sale right now can match this combination of performance and value at this price point (not even the budget-focused alternatives that typically cost half as much). See at Amazon Instead of emanating from a single front-facing speaker, the 360-degree sound design radiates audio uniformly in all directions. You get even volume and clarity, whether you\u2019re standing straight in front of the speaker or sideways to it in another part of the room. This omnidirectional approach works great for outdoor gatherings, poolside parties or when people are dispersed around the speaker rather than seated in front of it. The bass performance is surprising, considering how people generally perceive portable speakers to sound thin. Its dual passive radiators aid the main driver in providing low-end punch that you can literally feel when the track has heavy bass. In electronic music, hip-hop, and rock songs, this energy does not go away; rather, it doesn\u2019t sound tinny or hollow. It can handle very high volumes without distortion and pushes out clean sound loud enough for outdoor spaces without breaking up or rattling. One charge lasts up to 17 hours so you can cover full days of continuous playback without having to hunt for an outlet. That runtime is good for taking the speaker camping for a weekend, using it at all-day events or just keeping it going throughout super-long work sessions. You won\u2019t have to worry about it dying mid-song. There\u2019s an optional charging dock that\u2019s sold separately to keep the speaker topped off at home, if you like, but the included cable works fine as it is. The IP55-standard water and dust resistance protects against splashes, rain, and sandy environments without a need for a protective case. You can confidently use this speaker by the pool without panicking if someone has splashed water on it, and it survives an unexpected rain shower while using it out of doors. The rubberized exterior shrugs off bumps and drops that would shatter speakers with glossy plastic shells. It features an integrated handle and makes carrying between rooms or grabbing when heading outside both easy while its shape stays stable on uneven surfaces. The on-board microphone handles speakerphone calls with clear audio that picks up your voice without echoing or muffling. Conference calls sound natural and the person on the other end hears you properly even if you\u2019re standing several feet away from the speaker. Voice assistant integration includes Siri and Google Assistant, letting you control music, check the weather, set timers, or manage smart home devices with voice commands. The Bose Connect app opens up options for settings and updates and allows the user to tailor the behavior of the speaker and invoke party mode to connect several Bose speakers together. You can adjust EQ settings if you\u2019d like more or less bass, manage Bluetooth connections, and view battery status from your phone. Firmware updates keep the speaker current with new features and improvements. At $179, you\u2019re getting flagship audio quality at mid-range speaker pricing. The combination of 360-degree sound, substantial bass, 17-hour battery life, and weather resistance creates a package that budget speakers simply can\u2019t match even at their regular prices.

Millennial job seekers could be getting flashbacks to their postgrad job search after the Great Recession. The labor market is going through a Great Freeze, where employers and employees are staying put with few large-scale layoffs but little hiring. This is especially affecting new job seekers, like recent college graduates, and if you're looking for work, it's starting to feel like the sluggish recovery of the early 2010s \u2014 even if unemployment rates are still far below their post-financial-crisis highs. \"This is one of the worst times to really find a new job since the aftermath of the Great Recession,\" Sarah Foster, an economic analyst for Bankrate and the author of a new report analyzing the job market, told Business Insider.  What\u2019s your job search been like? Reach out to this reporter to share your story at mhoff@businessinsider.com. Back in 2021, the job market was still recovering from pandemic losses. People who still had a job had leverage to switch. Hiring slipped from 4.6% in November 2021 to 3.2% this past August, the most recent month available due to the government shutdown's impact on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' activities. Besides June 2024, Bankrate said that hiring hasn't been at this rate since 2013, when the economy was still in its slow, grinding recovery from the Great Recession. Unemployment has been fairly low \u2014 it has inched back up to just 4.3% in August. That's the highest since 2021 and far below the Great Recession recovery period. Still, Foster said it's harder to understand the job market with this rate because both supply and demand have dropped. \"Hiring is bound to cool when the job market slows, Bankrate's analysis found,\" the new report said. \"What's unusual, though, is how sharply hiring has fallen compared to the uptick in unemployment.\" The frozen hiring rates we're seeing now are typically only seen in much weaker job markets. Foster said this kind of hiring rate has historically corresponded to unemployment of 6.8%, suggesting that companies' hiring plans are \"akin to a labor market that's still recovering from a recession.\" Foster said the US is in a \"jobless boom, so to speak, where companies are expanding profits, the stock market is doing well, the economy is growing at the fastest pace in nearly two years, but growth is not happening because companies are expanding their payrolls.\" Instead, she said companies are investing in \"productivity-enhancing technologies,\" such as AI. Some job seekers have taken matters into their own hands and are pursuing entrepreneurship instead, while others send out their job applications, hoping something will stick. Parents are watching their college graduates face rejection, some older job seekers worry about ageism, and others are taking temporary work to get by. Entry-level hiring dropped 6% in October from a year ago, based on LinkedIn. A separate Indeed Hiring Lab report using three-month moving average data found that retail, loading and stocking, and sales had the highest shares of junior-level job postings in August, but the report said advancement opportunities can be tough in those sectors. Foster said getting a job in today's labor market boils down to being patient, being determined, showcasing what makes you different from other job candidates, and\u00a0leveraging personal connections. \"When you rely on that human factor and embrace the people that you meet throughout your career, that can hopefully help you break the noise-to-signal ratio a little bit,\"\u00a0she said. Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, previously told Business Insider that aspiring job switchers may need to look beyond their current sector for a new role because some are hiring more than others. She also suggested exploring part-time work or volunteer opportunities that you can add to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \"I thought a year ago the job market was difficult,\" one job seeker who was laid off in late 2023 told Business Insider. \"I think it's even more so now.\" What's your job search been like?

Professional salon blowouts cost $50-100 each visit and it adds up to thousands annually if you\u2019re trying to keep your hair healthy and styled properly. The Dyson Supersonic Origin hair dryer solves this by protecting your hair from heat damage while delivering salon results from the comfort of your home. The brand just launched its first major Black Friday deal, dropping the price to $299 on Amazon from the usual $419\u00c2\u00a0which is a new all-time low for this model. Dyson\u2019s unique heat control system prevents extreme heat damage that cheaper dryers cause through careless temperature spikes. You\u2019re investing in a tool that pays for itself after just a few avoided salon visits while keeping your hair healthier long-term. See at Amazon The intelligent heat control system detects air temperature 40 times per second to prevent extreme heat damage that fries hair over time. Most hair dryers just blast inconsistent heat that can spike to damaging temperatures without one realizing it until hair starts to feel brittle. The Dyson sensor detects temperature changes instantly and automatically adjusts heating elements to maintain safe, consistent heat levels. This digital motor runs at 110,000 rpm which is way faster than the conventional hair dryer motors that max out around 20,000-30,000 rpm. A high-velocity jet of controlled air is produced at this speed for quick hair drying without extreme heat. Faster drying time means less overall heat exposure, which in turn equates directly to healthier hair. The motor is located in the handle, not in the head, balancing its weight better and causing less arm fatigue throughout styling. Air multiplier technology amplifies airflow by three times and produces a high-pressure stream that\u2019s smooth and controlled rather than scattered. The focused airflow dries hair more efficiently than wide, dispersed air that wastes energy heating your bathroom instead of your hair. This precision lets you direct air exactly where you need it for styling purposes. The concentrated stream smooths hair cuticles as it dries, which reduces frizz and enhances natural shine. Magnetic attachments click onto the dryer instantly and stay secure during use without fumbling for clips or twisting mechanisms. The styling concentrator, smoothing nozzle, and diffuser all attach magnetically and rotate 360 degrees to adjust angles mid-styling. This means you can switch between attachments one-handed while holding sections of hair with your other hand. The build quality reflects Dyson\u2019s engineering standards: durable materials that survive daily use for years. The cord is reinforced and long enough to reach comfortably from typical bathroom outlets without feeling restrictive. The filter is easy to remove and clean, which maintains optimal airflow and motor performance over time. Cheaper dryers clog with dust and lint that reduces effectiveness and eventually kills the motor. This dryer treats hair care as serious engineering rather than a disposable appliance category. For $299, which is the usual price of $419 for a hair dryer, you get Dyson\u2019s professional-grade technology at a discount that hardly ever happens outside of major sales events. The investment in intelligent heat control, an engine with 110,000 rpm, and magnetic attachments justifies the regular styling of hair to avoid the cumulative effect of heat damage. Indeed, three saved salon visits pay for this purchase, while long-term hair health means avoiding pricey corrective treatments for damaged hair. This is the first big Black Friday deal from Dyson that has made its premium technology more approachable and not reserved for people who can pay full pricing for its luxury pieces.

Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zo\u00eb Schiffer. Today on the show, we're bringing you the top stories that you need to know about this week, including how the Democrats fared much better than anyone expected in this week's elections, and how some of those victories show the power of online fandom. I'm joined today by our senior politics editor, Leah Feiger. Leah Feiger: Hey, Zo\u00eb. Great to be here. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Leah, our first story this week is one that will really make your head spin, and it's about how Mark Zuckerberg opened an illegal school at his Palo Alto compound. Leah Feiger: Zo\u00eb, I am obsessed with this story. Before you continue, I think that it's really important to say that Caroline, the lovely reporter of this story on your business desk, obtained 1,665 pages of documents about the dispute about Zuckerberg's house. This story is canon now. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Caroline Haskins is a complete star. Our fact-checking team literally cried when I asked them. They were like, \"Wait, sorry, how many documents are we looking through?\" I was like, \"Yes.\" Leah Feiger: Shout out to the WIRED research team. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Absolutely. The school, I think we just have to say, is named after one of the Zuckerberg family chickens. It's called the Bicken Ben School. Leah Feiger: I mean, hearing you say this, it's, I know you're being serious, but again. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: So, the Crescent City neighborhood in Palo Alto, where the Zuckerbergs live, as you can imagine, is some of the best real estate in the entire country. It's filled with these gorgeous homes, a ton of greenery. Mark Zuckerberg has been expanding his presence throughout the years in this ultra fancy neighborhood. The plot of land that the Zuckerbergs live on has expanded to include 11 previously separate properties. This is so funny and just such a nightmare. If you're living on the street, you paid whatever, $5 million for your house, and suddenly all of your neighbors are Mark Zuckerberg. Leah Feiger: Important to note that not all of them are connecting either. I don't totally understand what that means. Do they walk through a neighbor's porch to get to their horse's pool? What does this entail? Zo\u00eb Schiffer: We have more questions. We have to Google Earth this. I think there's some holes in this story that we need to fill in. The expansion first became a concern for Mark Zuckerberg's neighbors, back in 2016, due to fears that his purchases were driving up the market pretty dramatically. But then, about five years later, neighbors started noticing that a school appeared to be operating out of the Zuckerberg compound. So, this is illegal to do without a permit, at least under the area's residential zoning code. And so, naturally, the neighbors started to alert the city. Caroline Haskins, the reporter on the story, obtained over a thousand documents, like you said, outlining the resulting fight between the neighbors and the city authorities, basically arguing that, it felt to them like the Zuckerbergs were getting special treatment. Leah Feiger: The existence of this school was known, but Caroline's reporting reveals two really key things. First, how long the school might've actually been operating, right? I mean, records by the California Department of Education directory claimed that the school opened in October 2022. However, as Caroline found, neighbors claimed that this is a year after they first saw it begin its operations. It's also two and a half years after the head of the school posted on her LinkedIn about this new role. There's so many confusing different things. And second, the other really key part, is that it shows a pattern, right? For almost a decade, Zuckerberg's neighbors have been complaining to the city about noisy construction work, this intrusive security presence, the hordes of staffers, business associates, I mean, it's Mark Zuckerberg, he has an entourage. They cause traffic, they take up parking, that sweet, sweet street parking in Crescent Park. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Right. I know. I was like, I really fail to imagine that anyone who has a house on the street needs street parking. But like ... Leah Feiger: I will say that did stick out to me, which just shows that I live in New York. I will literally be walking in a neighborhood that is not my neighborhood and go, Ooh, great parking spot. Hope someone really gets that too. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Absolutely. I mean, apparently the Palo Alto neighbors feel the same. The documents paint a picture of years of the neighbors actively complaining, and some of them claiming that city officials were giving preferential treatment to those Zuckerbergs, because their complaints weren't being addressed very quickly or very effectively in their view. There's instances of the neighbors reaching out directly to the Zuckerberg family office too, asking them to address the same issues. One of these messages to the family reads, to please, quote, \"Ideally, stop, or at a minimum, give us an extended break from the acquisition, demolition, and construction cycle, to let the neighborhood recover from the last eight years of disruption.\" Leah Feiger: Oh my God. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: I know. Leah Feiger: Unreal. All you wanted was to just live in Palo Alto and enjoy your life. And instead, you were Mark Zuckerberg's neighbor. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Moving on to our next story. Last month, news broke of President Trump pardoning CZ, the multi-billionaire founder of the Crypto Exchange, Binance. In 2023, CZ had pled guilty to willfully failing to implement measures against money laundering and violating US sanctions at his business. Back then, he'd agreed to forfeit his role as Binance's CEO and Binance agreed to leave the US and pay a record $4.3 billion penalty. But it seems that CZ's reputation is going through a bit of a makeover in Trump's second term in the White House. In last month's pardoning, the Trump administration claimed that CZ had been a victim of the Biden administration's war on crypto. His pardon was, as you can imagine, hotly debated on the merits, but our colleague, Joel Khalili says that, more than that, the pardoning carries conflicts of interests and potential long-term consequences for how the crypto industry goes about regulation. Leah, I'm honestly curious how you feel. I mean, we know how you feel about AI. How do you feel about crypto? Leah Feiger: Oh my God, no one's asked me this in at least two years. I love this question. WIRED has an unbelievable reporter on crypto. Like you mentioned Joel, everyone should really go back and look at his just archive of incredible crypto reporting and specifically his reporting on the many conflicts of interest between crypto, the crypto industry, and President Donald Trump. There's some key figures that pop up a lot. Obviously, CZ is a big one, but you also have the Winklevii, right? Who have appeared at many a Trump family event, donating money to the ballrooms and other endeavors, and are also the arguably original crypto bros. The conflicts of interest in this pardon are really, really wild between Binance and World Liberty Financial, the crypto business that's owned by Trump and his sons. Binance agreed in May to receive a $2 billion investment from a coin denominated in USD one, a coin issued by World Liberty Financial, which would earn tens of millions of dollars in this arrangement. So, clearly there are some messy, messy bits of this, but the thing that I keep coming back to, that I'm sure you do too, is that Trump gave this pardon without actually knowing who CZ is? But literally when he was asked by an interviewer ... And by interviewer, I mean, literally his 60 minutes interview that aired on November 2nd, he goes, \"Oh, OK. Are you ready? I don't know who he is. I can only tell you this. My sons are into Crypto.\" Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Yes. Leah Feiger: What? Zo\u00eb Schiffer: I know. Leah Feiger: Zo\u00eb, what? Zo\u00eb Schiffer: I mean, I think there's something kind of sweet that we're still getting shocked. Some people are getting enraged by what looks like obvious self-dealing, what looks like obvious conflict of interest. I mean, my view is, this is at least a large reason why Trump is back in the White House under the Biden administration. It was hard to pay to play, and the tech industry did not like that. They felt like, if you talked to a lot of tech CEOs, they were going out on a limb. They were giving money, resources, support to the Biden administration, and what did they get in return? They got a really hostile, in their view, FTC. They got slaps on the wrist. They got Biden coming out and saying, in some cases, implying that they had blood on their hands for various actions. They did not feel like there was anything to be gained from continuing to support Democrats. Whereas Republicans, it felt like, at least you know what you were going to get. If you support Trump, you can expect to get a little kickback in return. Leah Feiger: Absolutely. And on his end, Joel seemed to have changed his ex bio from ex-Binance to just Binance. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: And the crypto industry. For what it's worth, obviously, I think overall based on Joel's reporting, really appreciates Trump's support. At the same time, Binance not being in the United States was positive for a lot of their businesses. So, the fact that Binance could now be coming back, is kind of sending people into turmoil, trying to figure out what's the strategy. If this major crypto exchange relaunches, competition spikes, what do we do? And worth pointing out, Binance and CZ did not respond to WIRED's request for comment on this story. Our next story takes us all the way to Nepal. WIRED gave us the inside scoop on how Gen Z essentially toppled Nepal's leader and chose a new one through Discord. This is how it went down. This past summer, some young Nepalese social media users started seeing reels shining the light on the country's Nepo babies. These videos showed the luxury cars and designer clothes owned by the country's elite, which was quite a contrast to the life of most Nepalese citizens. As those flurry of videos kept growing, the tone behind them also shifted, from just showing the luxury goods to criticizing corruption and inequality in the country. At the beginning of September, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology ordered internet service providers to block access to 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube. Ostensibly because the companies had failed to register with the government, as required by a Supreme Court directive. But to many young people in the country, the timing was just a little too convenient. So, the reason rang completely hollow. VPN downloads surged and in the next few weeks, the digital defiance from these videos translated into street protests. This is where Discord servers became the main form of communication for protestors to coordinate and protect each other. Unfortunately, the protests would ultimately leave at least 72 people dead, and over 1000 people injured nationwide, making it the deadliest unrest in Nepal's recent history. The protests kept going though, and eventually 10 of the Gen Z activists who'd participated, were invited to sit down with members of Nepal's military to basically decide how to move forward. Leah Feiger: It's incredible. This entire story, which has been unfolding, as you said, Zo\u00eb, for quite some time, is just such a testament to the way that social media is not only utilized these days as communications around the world and various protest movements, but literally as this deciding force. This is real life right now. Like watching people on Discord actually vote in this way, is a pretty unbelievable part of this article. Quite literally, it was through Discord that young Nepalese decided on who would be the next leader. One quote from the article that I will never get out of my head is, \"Please decide on a representative right now. We do not have time.\" It was such an interesting look at where there are crackdowns on different ways to communicate, and obviously we've seen this over the last few decades. Twitter, pre-Elon Musk, was a very, very specific place for organizing and information. I'm thinking of Nigeria, I'm thinking of Egypt. This has been consistent. And this article, I think took that and threw it even further. And obviously there's a lot that's happening right now in this space, with young Gen Z activists utilizing socials in this way. We look at Kenya, we look at Mozambique, we look at Madagascar. This is really happening across the board. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: The parallels with the 2011 Arab Spring really stuck out to me. I remember Twitter's offices in those days, if you would walk in the front door, they would have papers spread out talking about the Twitter revolution. And that's really how social media saw itself. It saw itself as a tool for empowering democracy around the world, in a lot of places. That narrative has really died down, it feels like, but we could see in kind of this Discord story, that young people were saying, the tools available to us are not adequate, and so we're going to use these online tools to build our own. Coming up after the break, we'll dive into how this week's election results were a win for Democrats, not just electorally, but also online. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zo\u00eb Schiffer. And joined today by senior politics editor, Leah Feiger. OK, Leah, let's dive into our main story. Election day this week ended up delivering key wins for Democrats in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and California. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia. Zohran Mamdani skated his way to becoming mayor of New York City and California voters said yes to Proposition 50, which will allow state legislators to redistrict before the midterm elections, in an effort to counter GOP-led gerrymandering in other states. So, obviously, Leah, you have been paying very special attention to what's going on here. I know you've had an incredibly busy week. Just high level, what has been your main takeaway? Leah Feiger: As bad as some Democrats are at campaigning, the Republicans are worse. We're in a very particular moment right now. I think obviously the story of this election cycle is Mamdani. This was an absolutely unbelievable campaign from start to finish, that democratic institutions did not support, that Democratic leadership did not support, until, quote unquote, \"The very end\" and in a very lukewarm fashion. And yet, this was the campaign that won, that the people wanted. Makena Kelly had a fantastic article up about how Mamdani's campaign really figured out how to channel fandom, this idea that has been around for a while. You have your Taylor Swift fandom, you have your Beyonce fandom, and you have your Zohran fandom. The clips of him on social media that were in everyone's feeds were not just from his campaign. They were not very canned DNC responses featuring some kind of lame music and memes that already feel dated. These were fans that were recreating videos and making homages. This was something that we haven't actually seen in a very long time. Not to mention just the network of volunteers, and they brought together everyone in person. So, this was pretty incredible. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Right. OK. But I have a question for you because obviously this man is good at social media. I think we can just say that, but how much of being good at social media is also having an outsider campaign? Because I feel like that's the narrative that Democrats have lost as of late. They're the establishment now, they're the ones that have been in power, they're protecting and championing our institutions. And Republicans have felt like they're the outsiders. They're the ones trying to change things up. So, I guess I'm curious, how big a factor do you think that was in Mamdani's success? Leah Feiger: We can't count that out. This was someone who did not have the buy-in of the Democratic institution, which a lot of people looked at from within the institution as a serious negative. Democrats aren't polling well. This has been a pretty mind-bendingly difficult year for this party not in power. And so, to have someone that's an outsider, that's saying, I actually want to fix this, I want to do this better. I think that can only help in this situation. And to then pack that in with an incredible team of volunteers, a social plan and a very progressive platform, like a really, really progressive platform. There was an essay that I can't stop thinking about, that was written by a Breitbart author. And Breitbart has done many things, and I read them, but I am not, I would say, their number one fan or supporter, bluntly. But this article did an unbelievable job of capturing what, in some ways, a new left looks like. Is that it's not just college educated white people in Park Slope that are saying, yeah, support the underclass. The dynamic has shifted. It's that people no longer have the purchasing power that they were told they were going to. These are college educated people in Park Slope, who can't afford to buy a home. And in fact, what this article is saying is, Republicans have to be on the lookout for this. What so many people want right now, in his mind and in this essay, are actually very conservative values of like, I want to have a home and I want to have a yard and good school for my kids and safety and all these things. And obviously, I would argue that both parties to a certain extent try to pitch that sale to their constituents, but he does a very good job of saying, if we do not understand that that's actually how Mamdani helped build this groundswell in New York, by saying, yeah, prices are too high, and having your Bowdoin educated, Harvard educated graduates in Park Slope going, yeah, what did I do this all for? That they might not be in as bad of a position as a neighbor in a different borough, but they are still not where they want to be. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Right. Leah Feiger: So, in some ways, the Democrats lucked into that on messaging, but then you have other races like New Jersey was a bit of a shock. Dems were saying that Cheryl was running this terrible campaign and she crushed it. She really crushed it. It made me very eager to get into midterms coverage, Zo\u00eb. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: I'm happy to hear you say that, because we both know that midterms are going to be your entire life, very, very soon. I want to touch on one more aspect of this story, which is that, our colleague, David Gilbert, reported on how MAGA influencers, Republican lawmakers and conspiracy theorists, have all responded to Mamdani's mayoral victory in New York City, by pushing far right anti-immigration and Islamophobic rhetoric and claiming the city had essentially fallen. So, Tell us about that. This is rhetoric that had been coming for quite some time. I mean, this was the entire campaign, right? This was basically what Cuomo had been pushing as well. If you go with the other guy, you're screwed. New York is done. It's all over. So, I did anticipate, we all anticipated the absolute freak out that was going to come. It was so racist, so full of conspiracy theories, so full of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim sentiments. I mean, it really was just exactly what you thought it was going to be and worse, right wing podcaster. Matt Walsh is just saying, \"A third world communist won in New York, because New York is a third world city right now.\" I don't know. I live in New York, I think it's fine. We're going to see how everything plays out, and a new mayor and a new team is always a shakeup for a city. But Steve Bannon is going like, ugh, Jihadi, Marxist Bolshevik. Leah Feiger: Oh my God, they're so triggered. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: Yeah. Leah Feiger: They're so hysterical and they're so triggered. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: It was really interesting. And I mean, there were some threatening undertones, if I can say that. Look, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy Chief of Staff for policy, and also the architect of the Trump administration's hardline immigration policy, didn't add commentary right after Mamdani won, but did post a screenshot on X from a 2023 report pulled from the nyc.gov website that showed that around 50 percent of New York's households contain at least one immigrant. It was elucidating to see, and I really think that come January, February, March, we're going to be having some probably pretty serious conversations about some of this and how it plays out. Leah, I feel like that's a good place to end. Thank you so much for joining us today. Leah Feiger: Thanks so much for having me, Zo\u00eb. Zo\u00eb Schiffer: That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Stocks tumbled on Monday, extending a dayslong slide. Stocks tumbled on Monday, extending a dayslong slide that presents a dilemma: Should investors buy in at bargain prices or unload in fear of worse to come? The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3% last week, the index\u2019s largest weekly decline since the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% over that period, ending three consecutive weeks of gains. The trading marks a rare bout of turbulence on this year\u2019s glide path to higher returns. Even after the losses, the S&P 500 remains up 15% in 2025. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 11%, and the Nasdaq has soared 19%. Two major culprits are to blame for the downturn, analysts said: Growing skepticism about the artificial-intelligence technology at the heart of the market rally, as well as a realization the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates higher for longer than many investors had previously expected. Still, the analysts added, the decline is more likely to be a blip than a sustained downturn, even as they acknowledged uncertainty about the path forward for the U.S. economy. \u201cThe market is taking a more sober look,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at trading firm Interactive Brokers, told ABC News, noting Wall Street had breezed past previous hiccups on the way to further returns. \u201cMaybe the glass isn\u2019t always completely half-full.\u201d The recent market decline has coincided with fears about tech giants dependent on AI, which make up a disproportionately large share of the S&P 500. As big-tech names spend hundreds of billions to build data centers necessary to run the energy-intensive technology, the financial benefits remain uncertain. Market gains this year have been concentrated in a handful of tech giants, known as the magnificent seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia. Worries over artificial intelligence have thrown cold water on the stocks in recent days, causing their prices to waver, some analysts said. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that if they spend all this money on data centers, it will weigh on their earnings. And it\u2019s not clear at this point how profitable those investments will be,\u201d Ed Yardeni, the president of market advisory firm Yardeni Research and former chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank's U.S. equities division, told ABC News. Investors are also reckoning with the decreasing probability of an interest rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting next month. Traders peg the chances of a quarter-point rate cut next month about 41%, well below where the odds stood two weeks ago, according to CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment. The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate at a meeting last month, and policymakers projected an additional quarter-point cut in December. But stubborn inflation has prompted some Fed officials to voice caution about the further interest rate cuts. Prices rose 3% in September compared to a year ago, putting inflation a percentage point higher than the Fed\u2019s target rate. The prospect of an interest-rate cut typically boosts the stock market, since the promise of cheaper borrowing means a potential boon for firms and their investors. But the opposite also holds true, analysts said: As hope of a rate cut fades, stocks may turn lower. \u201cWith increased uncertainty comes increased volatility \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen so far in November,\u201d Bret Kenwell, an investing analyst at eToro, told ABC News, citing the interest rate expectations as well as a potential Supreme Court ruling that could do away with a large swathe of Trump\u2019s tariff policy. Despite acknowledging the recent strain, analysts signaled confidence about the path forward. Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, said the S&P 500 would finish the calendar year with an uptick from its current level of about 6,700 to 7,000.

Jeffrey Gundlach thinks the next financial crisis is lurking in the booming world of private markets. The CEO of $91 billion bond firm DoubleLine recently shared his take on an episode of Oddlots podcast. The $1.7 trillion private credit industry has been in focus lately amid high-profile blowups among big corporate borrowers, including First Brands and Tricolor Holdings, and as regional banks have come under scrutiny for problems with bad loans. And Gundlach thinks things are likely to worsen from here. He said that markets right now, from equities to fixed income, are overpriced, leading to a troubling outlook. The investor highlighted what he described as \"garbage lending\" in the private credit sector, a practice that puts the rapidly growing market on track for a financial crisis similar to the 2008 crash. \"The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,\" Gundlach stated. \"It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.\" To hedge the risk of a 2008-style blowup, Gundlach says investors should be holding a lot more cash, recommending a 20% allocation in portfolios. Gundlach isn't the only market commentator to sound the alarm on private credit. The relative lack of transparency and regulation in non-bank lending has shown that risks can go unnoticed for long periods of time. As recent corporate collapses reveal, tightening market conditions can quickly create problems for corporate balance sheets. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon compared these troubled companies to \"cockroaches,\" implying that more problems are likely brewing beneath the surface of the private credit market due to poorly underwritten loans made to struggling companies. Data from Rosenberg Research shows that problems in both household and corporate balance sheets may be rising. Gundlach highlighted the AAA ratings assigned to mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, which contributed to the subprime loan crisis of 2008. He raised the concern that private credit managers may not be able to realistically assess the value of loans on their books. \"There's only two prices for private credit \u2014 100 or zero,\" Gundlach noted. \"It looks like it's safe because you could sell it any day, but it's not safe because the price at which you sell will be gapping lower day after day after day.\" In Gundlach's view, the health of the US equity market may be the worst it's been in his entire career, and he thinks investors are misreading the current financial landscape due to its perceived strength, just as they did in 2008. \"The market is incredibly speculative and speculative markets always go to insanely high levels. It happens every time,\" he said. Jump to","label":0}

Premium noise-canceling headphones tend to be a choice between Sony\u2019s 1000XM5 and Apple\u2019s AirPods Max and the price difference is just ridiculous. Apple wants $549 for their headphones, while Sony\u2019s flagship just dropped to $248 on Amazon, down from $399 in a Black Friday deal that hits nearly all color options. Some colors are selling out fast as people realize they can get comparable performance for 2.5 times less money. If you\u2019re willing to step outside the Apple bubble and give up the brand premium, you\u2019re getting essentially the same listening experience for half the cost. See at Amazon The noise cancellation is powered by a pair of processors and eight microphones and it is as good as it gets: yes, even better than Apple\u2019s implementation. It works in real-time and adjusts to your surroundings to block out the din of airplane engines, coffee shop chit-chat, and street noise with scary effectiveness. An Auto NC Optimizer adjusts for atmospheric pressure, so the noise cancellation doesn\u2019t change whether you\u2019re at sea level or cruising at 35,000 feet. You can genuinely work or relax in near-silence even in the noisiest environments. The battery life hits 30 hours on a single charge to cover multiple cross-country flights or weeks of daily commutes without hunting for an outlet. With quick charging, you\u2019ll get three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, so forgetting to charge overnight doesn\u2019t ruin your day. A USB-C cable comes included, and the headphones work while charging if you absolutely need them immediately. Hands-free calling uses four beamforming microphones in concert with advanced audio signal processing to isolate your voice from ambient noise. These microphones focus on your voice while filtering out wind, traffic, and the general hum of people chatting in the background that usually ruins phone calls. Video conferences sound professional, even when you\u2019re calling in from a busy street or noisy office. Touch controls on the ear cups let you pause, play, skip tracks, adjust volume and answer calls without having to pull out your phone. After one day of usage, gestures become second nature, and responsiveness is immediate without lag or missed inputs. You can swipe up and down for volume, tap to pause, or hold to activate your voice assistant. It\u2019s large enough to register gestures but not so sensitive that an accidental touch constantly stops playback. Comfort comes from the lightweight design and soft-fit leather that distributes pressure equally across your head. The headband has just enough padding to prevent hotspots during long listening sessions without adding bulk. The ear cups create a seal that enables noise cancellation while staying breathable enough to wear for hours without sweating. These headphones disappear on your head in a way that heavier models never do. Sound quality provides the well-balanced and detailed profile Sony is known for without the bass-heavy tuning some brands use to impress in quick demos. Mids and highs remain clear and separated, which means vocals and instruments don\u2019t muddy together during complex tracks. The soundstage feels wide and natural rather than artificially processed. Audiophiles will appreciate the fidelity and casual listeners will enjoy how everything just sounds right without needing EQ adjustments. At $248 for headphones that go head-to-head with $549 AirPods Max, you save $301 and get equal noise cancellation, better battery life, and similar audio quality.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"I thought tablets and Chromebooks were dead?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Tablets and Chromebooks are reportedly continuing to rise in popularity, as a report from Omdia in early November suggests. Global tablet shipments have grown by an estimated 5.1%, with Lenovo seeing the most growth at 23%, followed by Huawei (11.5%), and \"Others\" (9.6%). Apple and Samsung remain at the top of the leaderboards when it comes to overall market share. However, both companies saw their overall market share drop a few percentage points, as Lenovo and Huawei started chipping away at the leaders.      Perhaps just as impressive is that Q3 2025 marks the \"seventh consecutive quarter of growth\" for tablets, a trend that many likely didn't expect. As for why this trend has been continuing, it's really a multitude of reasons. In the report, Himani Mukka, Omdia Research Manager says: \"Consumer demand has been driven by factors such as frequent new product launches, government subsidies, increased appetite for kids\u2019 and gaming tablets, competitive pricing, promotional campaigns, and seasonal back-to-school buying, which varies across regions depending on academic calendars.\" It's surprising to see that there hasn't been a singular driving force behind the continued growth in tablets. However, the same can't be said for Chromebooks, which saw an increase in global shipments by 3.1%. Of the companies listed in the report, only Lenovo and ASUS shipped more units over the course of the past year. Acer saw the steepest drop, with its annual growth down almost 35% and more than a 10% drop in market share, with Dell (-23%) and HP (-15.3%) also seeing substantial losses over the same time frame.      Unlike tablets, there is one major reason why Chromebooks saw a rise in popularity, and it's because of Japan's GIGA 2.0 initiative. This project aims to ensure that every student in \"compulsory education\" is provided with a tablet or computer, and what better way to do so than with a Chromebook. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android This came at the right time for the Chromebook market, as there was an almost 25% drop in global market share in North America. However, this could quickly change according to Kieren Jessop, Research Manager at Omdia, as they \"expect education funding in the US to increasingly come from state or local rather than federal sources, which could provide a steady boost to Chromebook shipments in the region.\" It will be interesting to see how these numbers look this time next year. We already have a pretty good idea that Google is gearing up to release Qualcomm-powered laptops running Android sometime in 2026. However, it's still unclear what that looks like, and whether they will replace Chromebooks or live alongside them.       Power in a smaller form factor Perhaps Lenovo has seen such a rise in tablet shipments thanks to the recent trend of releasing smaller flagship tablets such as the Legion Tab Gen 3. In other regions, it's known as the Y700, and is a popular option for both productivity and gaming.  Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"By\u00a0         Kristian Monroe                        Lydia Patel looks over the clothes from her Rent the Runway order at her home in Minnesota. As a busy pharmacist, YouTube creator and mom of three, she realized she doesn't need a lot of new clothes so she uses rented fashion instead.                                                           Jenn Ackerman\/for NPR                                       hide caption  Lydia Patel made a big decision two years ago:  she stopped buying clothes.  \"In my busy life nowadays \u2014 I realized especially after Covid \u2014 I go to work in scrubs,\" explains the Minnesota pharmacist, YouTube creator and mom of three. \"I don't dress up anymore for work, so I really don't need a whole lot of new clothes.\" After seeing the outfits she rarely wore to kids' birthday parties and daytime events languishing in her closet, she thought, why not rent her wardrobe instead? While Rent the Runway set the tone for the clothing rental industry when it launched 16 years ago \u2014 offering designer gowns for a night \u2014 it and trendy competitors such as Nuuly now let consumers borrow a set number of items, including dresses, jeans and even winter coats, for a monthly price.  The concept was intriguing to Patel. \"I kind of looked into rental as an option because I don't really want to hang on to pieces forever,\" she said. \"By the time I have something else to go to, the trends will have changed. My tastes might have changed.\"                  Rent the Runway set the tone for the clothing rental industry when it launched 16 years ago by offering designer gowns for rent at a fraction of the retail price.                                                           Jenn Ackerman\/for NPR                                       hide caption  Over two years later, Patel says, deciding to rent her clothes \"has opened up access to more quality pieces that are unique and fit what I want to wear at the moment without breaking the bank.\"  And she doesn't have to worry about storing or washing the items she borrows. At the end of the rental term, she returns the pieces to the companies and they handle the shipping and cleaning. \"I don't even know what you do with silk \u2014 and I don't want to,\" she says. Patel is just one of more than a half a million women \u2014 this industry caters almost exclusively to women \u2014 who are using clothing rental platforms, according to some of the companies' public data. The industry is worth $2.6 billion, and is projected to more than double in value by 2035, according to market research firm, Future Market Insights. Its growth is a signal that shoppers are looking for budget-friendly alternatives just as inflation and tariffs threaten to push clothing prices higher.                  Patel tries on clothes from her Rent the Runway order.                                                           Jenn Ackerman\/for NPR                                       hide caption  Apparel prices have risen 9% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's far less than overall inflation, which has increased nearly 26% over the same time period. Still, experts believe, as tariffs settle in and make their way through the supply chain and into stores, consumers will start to see price tags change.  This winter will likely see some strong increases in apparel sales. They'll be \"driven by inflation and tariff-related price increases as brands and retailers have to pay more to import clothing,\" says Sky Canaves, an analyst at the market research firm eMarketer. For some brands, this means passing on costs to consumers will be \"unavoidable,\" she says. Barely any garments are made in the U.S. today. If you're in the market for a new coat this winter, you may already be feeling the pinch. Jackets and outerwear prices rose 24% on average over the past year, according to an AlixPartners study. The cost increases have sent some shoppers exploring the rental and secondhand markets.  \"Services that can offer consumers the opportunity to keep their wardrobes fresh on an ongoing basis are really benefiting,\" says Canaves. It's an opportunity not lost on Patel. She estimates that if she purchased instead of rented her clothes, it would cost her thousands of dollars. Instead, using rental for just six months out of the year keeps her within the $500 she budgets annually for clothing.                  The cost increases for clothes have sent some shoppers exploring the rental and secondhand markets.                                                           Jenn Ackerman\/for NPR                                       hide caption  \"I put my subscription on pause most of the time,\" she says. She reactivates her membership before events or trips. Nuuly President Dave Hayne says that's OK: \"We know that subscribers aren't going to need us every month of the year, and that's fine.\"  He says the company has made it easy for customers to take a break and return when they need the service. And so far, Hayne says, subscribers have been coming back. However, rental fashion platforms are not immune from the impact of tariffs, which are leading to shipment cancellations and production delays. Fewer items reaching U.S. shores means fewer options for shoppers, Canaves says. Because rental platforms must keep their stock of styles constantly refreshed to meet customers' expectations, \"they're exposed to many of the same cost pressures facing traditional retailers,\" she explains.                  Patel is just one of more than a half a million women who are using clothing rental platforms, according to some of the companies' public data.                                           Jenn Ackerman\/for NPR                                       hide caption  It's harder for fashion rental companies to quickly pass on increased costs to consumers because their subscriptions are offered at set monthly prices. Hayne says Nuuly is taking multiple steps to manage the challenge of tariffs.  \"[We're] thinking about where we're sourcing from and where brands are buying from, and how we split costs,\" he says. Unlike other rental platforms, Nuuly is part of a large fashion company that also owns Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters. Hayne calls the relationship a \"big plus\" for Nuuly, allowing it to work closely with those brands on buying certain styles as well as purchasing apparel at cost. Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman says while her company has had \"bigger fish to fry\" than tariffs \u2014 after losing over half its subscriber base during the pandemic \u2014 it pays clothing brands based on the performance of its inventory, instead of buying the items outright. \"So we've been less affected than most,\" she says. The holidays are the busiest time for fashion rental as people shop for that special look for office parties, family gatherings and New Year's Eve that they can return once the party season ends. But the added demand strains existing inventory challenges. Both Nuuly and Rent the Runway have taken efforts to avoid running out of items. \"We heard from [our customers] that the biggest problem we had in our business was inventory availability,\" Hyman says. To address this, Rent the Runway committed to doubling the amount of styles available to its subscribers this year.                  Patel plans on wearing rented clothes for this busy holiday season.                                                           Jenn Ackerman\/for NPR                                       hide caption  But Hayne admits it's hard to get those numbers right. \"One of the most important things for this business to be successful is trying to balance inventory levels with subscriber levels,\" he said. Both Hyman and Hayne's advice to consumers looking to rent for the holidays: rent as soon as you can. This busy holiday season Patel says she'll be wearing rented clothes. She hasn't decided whether it will be a fun \"ugly sweater\" or a velvety dress. Regardless, she plans to return the items in January so she doesn't have to do the laundry.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":" \tThe Blue Oval has bid adieu to a long-running badge that catered to commuters, families and enthusiasts alike.  By Gray Van Dyke  \u00b7 Well, it finally happened. As of Friday, Ford built the last Focus. The news supposedly first came courtesy of the Blue Oval\u2019s employees, after which the company confirmed to Motor1 that the final example was a white five-door hatchback. Now, Ford hasn\u2019t exactly been shy about its discontinuation plans for the model. Quite the opposite \u2014 it first pulled the Focus from the American market in 2018, and it later announced that electrification would eventually bring an end to the nameplate in Europe (targeting this year). Still, even with the advance notice, the retirement of the Focus amounts to a great loss to the industry. It not only speaks to the state of the Blue Oval\u2019s own lineup, but also to that of the automotive world at large. After all, Ford had big aspirations for the Focus when it first introduced the car in 1998. As part of the company\u2019s Ford 2000 initiative, the nameplate was developed to be a global model, an effort to consolidate European and North American lineups under one unified strategy. Accordingly, the Focus made for a huge volume seller throughout its production life. During the car\u2019s 27-year run, the Blue Oval managed to move over 12 million examples.\u00a0 What\u2019s more, even though Ford engineered the Focus as an economical compact, that\u2019s not to say that the model was without its enthusiast appeal. Quite the opposite, in fact.\u00a0 The ST first appeared in 2002 in the form of\u00a0the ST170, bringing upgrades like stiffer suspension, revised styling and larger brakes. However, as much as it previewed the Blue Oval\u2019s hot hatch intentions, the model\u2019s bigger sibling is what really demonstrated the company\u2019s capabilities. That\u2019s because the Focus RS gave owners rally car thrills for the road. Between a punchy turbocharged engine, a grippy AWD system, a manual transmission and some slick visual upgrades, it had all the makings of a proper slide machine (especially in tasty limited-edition RS500 guise). Ken Block\u2019s endorsement didn\u2019t hurt, either. Being the higher-performance option of the two, the RS was discontinued in 2020. However, Ford kept the ST soldiering on until this past September \u2014 almost until the very end, there was some focus to the Focus on performance. In any case, as both a commuter and a driver\u2019s vehicle, the Focus proved extremely valuable to the brand because of its numbers.Though Ford was Europe\u2019s second-largest carmaker back in 2015, it came in at 12th overall as of last year, per Autocar and the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA). Put another way, the decision to cull longstanding cars like the Fiesta and the Focus has resulted in a huge blow to the Blue Oval\u2019s market share. It\u2019s since filled out the range with crossovers like the Kuga and the Puma, but those models haven\u2019t exactly picked up the slack. Which leaves Ford in a bit of a bind for the time being. Even before the official discontinuation of the Focus, Bill Ford Jr. had admitted that the company\u2019s car lineup was \u201cnot as robust as we need to be.\u201d Considering that the Mustang is now the sole new \u2018car\u2019 (rather than a crossover, a van, a truck or an SUV, etc.) that Ford sells \u2014 in the United States and in Europe \u2014 this proves especially true. While there\u2019s already been speculation that the Focus could return and some that Ford could be preparing new \u2018regular car\u2019 models, nothing at this time suggests that those two rumors align. In fact, the Focus may not even be revived as a sedan\/hatchback. Besides, without a concrete plan for what\u2019s to come, all there is to do for now is speculate. Until what, if any, successor comes, let\u2019s pour one out for the Focus and hope that Ford can find its own (focus) again.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Reselling tickets to live events for a profit is set to be banned by the government. Ministers are expected to announce the plan in a bid to tackle touts and resale sites which offer tickets at several times' face value. Restricting ticket touts was one of the Labour government's election pledges, as fans complained of massively inflated prices for resale tickets for music and sporting events. The decision comes a week after dozens of artists including Sam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay urged Sir Keir Starmer to protect fans from exploitation. A consultation on the changes had canvassed views on capping costs at up to 30% above the face value of a ticket.  But reports in the Guardian and Financial Times say ministers are expected to set the  limit at face value, although some fees could still be charged on top of the original ticket price. The government declined to comment on the reports. The move, which could be announced on Wednesday, comes after the open letter by some of the biggest names in music. The music stars urged the prime minister to stop the \"extortionate and pernicious\" websites that exploit fans. Other signatories included consumer watchdog Which? the Football Supporters' Association and groups representing the music and theatre industries, venues, and ticket retailers. According to analysis by the Competition and Markets Authority, tickets currently sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%. Investigations by Trading Standards have previously uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said it was \"great news for music and sports fans\", adding the plan would \"rein in professional touts and put tickets back in the hands of real fans\". She urged the government to \"show that the price cap is a priority by including the necessary legislation in the King's Speech\". Ticketmaster's parent company Live Nation Entertainment said it already limits resale in the UK to face value prices and described the reported plan as \"another major step forward for fans\". Resale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub have previously claimed that a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media, putting them at increased risk of fraud. The new pricing model will help the venue \"maximise ticket revenue\", the Royal Ballet and Opera says. Germany's Culture Minister calls the discovery a \"great moment for the world of music\". Josh Kapur, 19, says performing on the Strictly stage made him \"feel like a celebrity\".  Proceeds from Exodus Movement's event at the University of Wolverhampton will go to the relief fund. The garden will be incorporated into the primary's curriculum, with music workshops also planned. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

You can buy pretty much anything on Amazon \u2014 including a certified pre-owned Ford. The automaker announced on Monday that customers can now browse, buy, and fill out most of the paperwork for a pre-owned vehicle on Amazon Autos. Customers can peruse the inventory at dealers within a 75-mile radius and schedule a time for pick-up. Around 160-180 local dealers have said they're interested, and around 20 have already launched or will soon launch the program, Ford said. For now, the service is available in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Dallas, with plans to bring it to new areas. Ford is offering a 14-day or 1,000-mile money-back guarantee on the vehicles.  Ford specified in its press release that Amazon \"facilitates the transaction,\" but the dealers handle all follow-up. The automaker's stock was down around 1% and Amazon's stock was down around 0.5% by 11:40 a.m. on Monday. The announcement comes two years after Amazon struck a similar deal with Hyundai to sell new cars. Hyundai said it will integrate Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant, into its next-generation vehicles as part of the deal.  In August, car rental company Hertz announced it would sell pre-owned vehicles on Amazon, starting in four cities. Jump to","label":1}

Michael Burry fired off a warning about the AI boom in a \"Lord of the Rings\" wrapper on Sunday, and teased that he'll release more of his contrarian research in the coming days. \"One chart to refute them all \u2026 to be continued Nov 25th, or before,\" the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame posted on X. He attached a column chart tracking the S&P 500's total capital expenditures over the past 35 years, with depreciation subtracted and amounts divided by nominal US GDP \u2014 likely to keep the focus on new investments and show them as a share of the economy's total output. Burry's chart shows that stocks have peaked in the middle of past investment booms, while capital spending has kept climbing or remained elevated for another year or two before collapsing. The broader implication is that periods of overinvestment are inevitably followed by corrections. The chart highlights the Nasdaq index's peak just before the dot-com bubble burst, the S&P 500's peak just before the housing bubble popped and sparked a global financial crisis, and the S&P Energy index's peak just before oil prices crashed and the energy sector entered a prolonged downturn. Burry also highlights the Nasdaq 100's record high of around 26,000 points this quarter, suggesting he thinks that could be the market's peak in the middle of this capital cycle. His chart serves as a warning that stocks may have already topped out even as OpenAI, Meta, and other AI giants prepare to invest trillions of dollars in microchips and data centers as they jostle for position in the nascent AI market. If the pattern repeats, Burry's chart implies, AI companies will continue spending big for at most two years before the investment boom crumbles, and there could be a stock market crash and a recession on the cards. The Scion Asset Management chief attached a meme from \"The Lord of the Rings\" to his X post. It shows Gandalf the Grey asking Frodo Baggins, \"What can you see?\" while looking at The One Ring, but instead of an inscription about the immense threat and power contained within the ring, it reads \"Live Love Laugh\" instead. Burry may have deployed the meme to emphasize how complacent and blindly optimistic investors have become about the AI boom, to the extent that they only see good times, not warning signs. The investor is best known for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the US housing market, after his contrarian bet was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\" Burry went silent in April 2023 after repeatedly sounding the alarm on X about a historic asset bubble and a looming crash and recession. He's made a colorful comeback since October 30, posting several warnings about the AI boom using \"WarGames\" and \"Star Wars\" memes and quotes, revealing third-quarter bets against Nvidia and Palantir, trading barbs with Palantir CEO Alex Karp, and terminating his hedge fund's SEC registration, teasing that he's now \"unchained\" and moving \"on to much better things.\" In one post last week, Burry shared a still from \"The Big Short\" where he, portrayed by Christian Bale, lies on the ground exhausted, encircled by annotated mortgage prospectuses and other research items. Me then, me now. Oh well. It worked out. It will work out pic.twitter.com\/vaordNav8d \"Me then, me now. Oh well. It worked out. It will work out,\" Burry wrote, indicating that he's immersed in AI research but confident he'll be proven right once again. Burry shared on Monday that he'll soon be appearing on a podcast hosted by \"The Big Short\" author Michael Lewis to mark the 15th anniversary of the book and the 10th anniversary of the movie.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Peter Thiel's hedge fund sold its entire stake in Nvidia in the third quarter, according to a 13F filing. Thiel Macro LLC sold all of its 537,742 shares in the chipmaker, per the filing, which were valued at about $85 million at the end of the second quarter. Those shares would have been worth about $100 million at market close on September 30 \u2014 but it is unclear when Thiel's fund offloaded its stake. It comes hot on the heels of SoftBank disclosing that it sold all of its Nvidia shares during the same quarter. Thiel Macro's holding was relatively small when compared with Nvidia's $4.6 trillion market capitalization and the $5.8 billion stake sold by SoftBank. However, both sales come as some investors and tech leaders become increasingly wary of an AI bubble. Nvidia, which provides advanced chips to power AI applications, has ridden the AI boom to become the world's most valuable company, becoming the first to pass the $5 trillion milestone last month. SoftBank said during its earnings call last week that its decision to divest had \"nothing to do with Nvidia itself\" but was a way to reallocate its funds toward OpenAI. The share sales come as Nvidia is set to report its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who has previously been bullish on the AI boom, said in a Monday X post that Nvidia is a \"foundational piece\" of the AI revolution and he expects it to \"handily exceed Street estimates.\" Thiel's fund ended the third quarter holding stakes in Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, the filing showed. Combined, those shares were worth more than $74 million as of September 30. Other filings show that Thiel and his team have chopped and changed their US stock portfolio this year. In the first quarter, the fund exited Amazon and built stakes in Microsoft, Vistra, and ASML.  It exited Microsoft and ASML in the second quarter, then last quarter it disposed of Vistra, reinvested in Microsoft, and established a new position in Apple. The value of Thiel Macro's portfolio grew steadily from about $118 million at the end of last year to $153 million at the end of March, then $212 million at the end of June.  Only one stock has appeared in the fund's last four quarterly disclosures: Tesla. Both Thiel and Tesla CEO Elon Musk helped cofound PayPal, and since then, the pair have partnered and collaborated several times. Thiel's fund pared its Tesla stake by 76% last quarter to 65,000 shares worth about $29 million as of September 30, after more than quadrupling its Tesla share count in the second quarter.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"There\u2019s long been speculation about when Apple CEO Tim Cook might retire and who is likely to replace him. That intensified earlier this month when he turned 65. Cook himself has made only two on-the-record statements, but a new report over the weekend suggests that the company is now ramping up preparations to replace him \u201cas soon as next year\u201d \u2026 Tim Cook turned 65 earlier this month, and given that\u2019s a common retirement milestone, it led to renewed speculation about the potential timings. Cook himself started laying the groundwork back in 2021. He stated then that he didn\u2019t expect to still be at Apple in 2031, though he said on Dua Lipa\u2019s podcast two years ago that he would be there for a while yet. A Financial Times report on Saturday said that Apple\u2019s board had intensified its search for his replacement. Although Apple SVP of Hardware Engineering John Ternus is the prime candidate, the report says the board is also considering external candidates. It even suggests the company might make the announcement early in the year to give the new CEO time to settle in before WWDC in June and the next iPhone launch in September. If so, that would make the announcement just a few short months away. The piece does hedge, however, noting that planned timings could still change. As a number of other Apple commenters have observed, this has all the hallmarks of a deliberate leak. John Gruber observes that the number of people within Apple who would know about this is so small that an accidental leak doesn\u2019t seem credible. I don\u2019t think there are many people, if any, outside Apple\u2019s top executive team and board of directors who have\u00a0any\u00a0insight into Cook\u2019s thinking on this. That \u201cseveral people\u201d spoke to the FT about this says to me that those sources (members of the board?) did so with Cook\u2019s blessing, and they want this announcement to be no more than a little surprising. Former Google Ventures partner and Slack director MG Siegler points to the number of bylines on the piece. The fact that there are\u00a0four\u00a0reporters bylined on this 330-word post suggests that this is more than just idle speculation based on some loose chatter and more that this is a potential trial balloon on the idea that at least some people \u201cin the know\u201d are floating out there. A trial balloon is where a company chooses to leak a piece of information to the media in order to test reaction, and is named after the practice of releasing a party balloon before a hot air balloon launches in order to check the wind conditions. Given that Cook has overseen the growth of the company from a $350 billion value in 2011 to $4 trillion today, it\u2019s natural for the board to be concerned about market reaction to his retirement. If he is indeed planning to retire next year, the company would want to both gauge the response of investors and give people time to get used to the idea so that it doesn\u2019t come as a shock when the announcement is finally made. Investors might miss him but I\u2019m not sure Apple\u2019s customers will, too. The company really needs a more product focused CEO.  It\u2019s pretty clear, then, that Cook is now eyeing his retirement, although his loyalty to the company means he would only leave at a point when the market is ready for it. This leak is obviously designed to find out whether that point might potentially be early next year. At the time of writing, pre-market trading on AAPL is down well under 1%, which is within the normal range of random variations. This does tend to suggest that investors have been prepared for this for some time and are not unduly concerned. Putting all this together, I would not be at all surprised to see an official announcement in the first half of next year. It\u2019s possible that Cook could take an interim role as chairman or advisor to the board as a way of further reassuring investors.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes lidar is a \"fool's errand.\" A former Tesla engineer, Eric Aguilar, cofounded an entire company to perfect it. His bet: all robots \u2014 whether vehicular or humanoid \u2014 will need lidar to see. Lidar is a sensor that uses laser light to detect the distance of objects. Historically, the sensor has been used for mapping, but in recent years, it's become an extra set of eyes for self-driving cars, including Waymo's robotaxis. Aguilar cofounded Omnitron Sensors in 2019 and serves as CEO. He has worked with sensors for over 20 years, at Google X's drone delivery project, Tesla, and Argo AI, a robotaxi venture backed by Ford and Volkswagen, before it shut down in 2022. When Musk moved to forgo lidar, Aguilar, an electrical engineer by training, understood some of the Tesla CEO's misgivings about the sensor. They can be costly and not built as efficiently as they could be, Aguilar says. With Omnitron, he aims to make lidar both more affordable and durable by utilizing silicon and the semiconductor manufacturing process to produce the components inside the sensor at scale. \"This is what will unlock the market,\" he told Business Insider. \"This is what will open up the market to get companies like Mercedes and GM to buy lidars and put them in their vehicles.\" As more automakers explore driverless functions, Aguilar believes lidar will be an essential part of tomorrow's cars. Lidar can be a little like a disco ball: a laser is pointed at a mirror that is constantly moving on an electromagnetic motor, and the reflected light measures the distance of objects around whatever it's mounted on, such as an autonomous vehicle.  To achieve a better range with a lidar, you need a larger laser and, consequently, a larger mirror. That makes lidars more expensive, and when placed in a moving vehicle, the sensor could require constant adjustment. Companies have to \"recalibrate those sensors, redo alignment, or replace those sensors,\" Aguilar said. Aguilar said the problem with many lidar systems is how they're built. There can be numerous moving parts inside the sensor, which require frequent calibration and are susceptible to wear and tear when placed on top of a frequently moving car, the cofounder said. \"When you talk to OEMs \u2014 Mercedes, Volvo, BMW, GM \u2014 they don't want lidar to have to be replaced every two or three months,\" he said. \"And that's what I was experiencing working at these companies: Every two to three months, something would break in this thing and we'd have to get them replaced.\" That's where silicon comes in. With silicon, Aguilar said, you're dealing with fewer and lighter moving parts that can last longer. Silicon is much more durable, the Omnitron CEO argues, and could handle the kinds of temperature fluctuations an autonomous vehicle would experience. Then, by using a chip manufacturing process, the parts are built with nanometer-level precision and can be built at scale. \"So you get a wafer with hundreds and thousands of these devices instead of building one at a time,\" Aguilar said. Around the time Aguilar was at Google's moonshot factory, a single lidar unit could cost $120,000. Today, a similar model could cost around 10 grand \u2014 a significant drop, in part thanks to better designs and increased manufacturing scale. Aguilar says Omnitron's process brings down those same lidar units to \"the hundreds of dollars.\" In self-driving cars, Aguilar sees lidar as the key to covering rare edge cases on the roads. Cameras are \"terrible\" in low-light situations, he said. The cofounder used shadows as an example. \"When a shadow is being cast, a car can get confused as to: Is that a real object or is that a shadow?\" Aguilar said. That's where lidar comes in. The Omnitron cofounder also sees humanoid robots as a ripe market for sensors. Companies like Agility Robotics use lidar to help their humanoid robots navigate their environments. Much like humans rely on sensors beyond their eyes to determine the amount of force needed to pick up objects, Aguilar said robots will need lidar to understand the depth of their surroundings and the objects and people within them. Aguilar's case for lidar in cars or robots echoes what many CEOs in the self-driving space have already said on the sensors: It all comes down to safety. \"The bar for integrating (robots) into the human experience \u2014 it's going to be much higher,\" he said. \"I'm not going to let this thing hold my baby, for example, if I don't know that this thing is robust and this sensor is really, really important for that.\" Jump to","label":0}

A Chinese Tesla rival is betting on huggability to take on Elon Musk's Optimus robot. EV startup Xpeng unveiled the latest version of its humanoid robot, called Iron, earlier this month, and CEO He Xiaopeng said the company wanted its bipedal bots to be \"highly human-like.\" In an earnings call on Monday, he told analysts that Xpeng had found adding fake muscles and \"bionic skin\" to Iron made people more comfortable touching and even hugging the robot. \"This is very exciting because traditional robots really were not that attractive and appealing for human beings to give them a hug,\" said Xiaopeng. Unlike many rival humanoid robots, Iron has a distinctly human-like physique, with Xpeng showcasing male and female variants. Users will be able to customize the robot with different body types, the company said. In one demo at the unveiling, Xpeng employees even cut into the robot's flexible \"skin\" to demonstrate that there was no one inside. Speaking to analysts on Monday, Xiaopeng said Xpeng aims to sell 1 million Iron robots a year by 2030, with mass production set to begin by the end of 2026. The auto executive, who predicted that the market for humanoid robots would ultimately be larger than the car market, added that he expects humanoid robots to be initially used in retail and as tour guides. Xpeng plans to put Iron to work in its stores next year, he said. The production ramp-up is the latest sign that Tesla's biggest robotics rival could come from China. Musk's automaker is preparing to begin mass production of its own humanoid robot, Optimus, by the end of 2026. Musk has predicted Optimus could be the biggest product ever, and Tesla's AI chief told employees that 2026 will be the \"hardest year\" of their lives. Founded in 2014, Xpeng has been one of the most successful startups to battle Tesla for a piece of China's red-hot EV market. The Guangzhou-based company has smashed sales records this year and is close to becoming profitable. Xpeng executives said on Monday the EV startup will launch seven new vehicles next year, including three robotaxi models, and the company also plans to begin mass production of its $280,000 flying car in 2026.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"The market for third-party iMessage apps has largely dried up, but Apple seems keen to keep it going. Over the weekend, the company debuted a new iMessage sticker pack for its Arcade title Sneaky Sasquatch. Remember when iMessage apps were more of a thing? Within Apple, it seems, there\u2019s still effort being put into developing iMessage sticker packs. This weekend the company debuted a brand new iMessage app, as spotted by Aaron Perris. Sneaky Sasquatch Sticker Pack is now available on the App Store as a free download. It was inspired by the hit Apple Arcade title, Sneaky Sasquatch. The sticker pack offers over 50 iMessage stickers themed to the game, many of which feature the titular Sneaky Sasquatch expressing a variety of standard emoji-style emotions. Why would Apple develop and release a sticker pack for an Arcade title? Because it recently became the owner of that very game. Apple Arcade\u2019s game library is almost entirely made up of third-party titles. And Sneaky Sasquatch originated as a third-party offering, but earlier this year Apple acquired RAC7, the two-person developer team behind it. At the time, Apple indicated it was a \u201cunique circumstance, as it saw an opportunity to help the team grow its game more on Apple Arcade.\u201d Now with Sneaky Sasquatch as an official Apple property, perhaps we\u2019ll continue to see more expansions of the title thanks to the additional resources Apple is able to put behind it. Do you ever use iMessage stickers? Let us know in the comments. Apple Arcade is available as a\u00a0standalone service for $6.99\/month\u00a0or included in the Apple One bundle. It offers access to over 200 games with no ads or in-app purchases. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        In a show-stopping second test flight, Blue Origin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New Glenn stuck the landing and successfully sent NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ESCAPADE mission to Mars on Thursday. These milestones mark the beginning of a new era for Jeff Bezos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s megarocket, establishing it as a strong competitor in the heavy-lift launch market. New Glenn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2026-2027 launch manifest will be the true test, however. Blue Origin is preparing to deliver cargo and crew landers to the lunar surface, launch new hardware to deploy and maneuver satellites, and expand the Amazon Leo constellation (formerly known as Project Kuiper). These ambitious missions will provide further opportunities for New Glenn to prove itself as a dependable heavy-lift workhorse. Following the success of Thursday\u2019s launch, New Glenn could soon begin launching national security payloads. The Space Force is now entering the final stages of a review process to grant the rocket a National Security Space Launch (NSSL) certification. Blue Origin currently holds an NSSL Phase 3 Lane 2 award, under which the Space Force plans to tap the company for about seven missions starting in fiscal year 2026. In case you missed Thursday\u2019s launch, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brief recap before we dive into what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming down the pike for New Glenn. The rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at roughly 3:55 p.m. ET. Its ascent burn, stage separation, and fairing jettison were all clean as a whistle. Following separation, the booster completed a successful re-entry burn and landed intact on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean\u00e2\u0080\u0094a major first for Blue Origin. Just before 4:30 p.m. ET, New Glenn deployed NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s twin ESCAPADE probes, sending them off on an 11-month-long journey to Mars. For its next trick, New Glenn will launch a prototype Blue Moon Mark 1 (MK1) lunar lander. The mission, dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cPathfinder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is currently scheduled for sometime in January 2026, though Blue Origin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior director of civil space, Jacqueline Cortese, has said the company could launch an MK1 demonstration mission before the end of the year. MK1 is a cargo lander designed to eventually ferry up to 3 tons of payload to the lunar surface. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stepping stone to the MK2 crew lander, which NASA has contracted for the Artemis 5 mission. New Glenn will launch the MK1 prototype into low-Earth orbit, where it will circle the planet three to four times before performing a maneuver to enter a more elliptical orbit. After completing one more lap around Earth, the lander will execute another maneuver to adjust its trajectory toward the Moon. It will take roughly a week to reach lunar orbit and finally touch down on the surface. MK1 will be carrying a NASA payload called SCALPSS (Stereo Cameras for Lunar-Plume Surface Studies). This array of cameras will be placed around the base of the lunar lander to collect imagery during and after descent, gathering critical data to assist future Moon landings and improve NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of how they affect the lunar surface. This proof-of-concept mission will be a key step toward the development of MK2, as the two landers will share much of the same hardware. New Glenn is slated to launch an MK2 prototype sometime in late 2027. Two missions will also test New Glenn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to reliably deploy satellites for both government and commercial purposes in 2026, though their timing remains uncertain. The megarocket will launch Firefly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Elytra Mission 1, which aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Elytra spacecraft. This orbital vehicle is designed to maneuver satellites. The mission will also test Xtenti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FNTM-RiDE satellite dispenser. Sometime in mid-2026, New Glenn will launch its first batch of Amazon Leo satellites, adding to the current constellation of more than 3,000. Amazon Leo is Bezos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rival to Elon Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Starlink, aiming to provide global, high-speed broadband internet. Needless to say, New Glenn has a busy year ahead. The success of its most recent test flight has set high expectations for the rocket heading into 2026. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see if it continues to deliver.

The duffel opens wide so you can actually see what you packed, and at 60 liters, it\u2019s large enough for extended trips but won\u2019t get you dinged for oversized baggage. The backpack straps are handy on the trail or in the airport. At 30% off, it\u2019s a solid pick if you need something more versatile than a rolling suitcase. Osprey Osprey\u2019s Arcane series uses welded construction instead of stitching, which means your laptop and gear stay dry even when you get caught in a downpour.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"The classic muscle car formula is to drop a big V8 into a small car, spin the rear tires until they turn into smoke, and call it a day. A\u00a0Chevy Camaro, or even a Nova, is a great choice for this, but certainly not a Sonic, which has half the cylinders and wrong-wheel drive. Nathan Hoy did it anyway, and the end result is so wrong, it's right. We reviewed the Chevy Sonic RS back in 2013. It made a not exactly thrilling 138 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque from its turbocharged 1.4-liter inline-4. Hoy fixed that in his 2017 model by replacing the anemic four-banger with GM's LM7, a 5.3-liter V8 that was GM's bread-and-butter V8 for trucks in the 2000s. Its 285 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque are more than double what the Sonic originally made. The engine is completely stock except for a front sump oil pan that made the steering rack easy to sort. Other than that, Hoy just cleaned up the engine and shoved it into the Sonic. His Instagram isn't nate_the_ls_guy\u00a0for nothing. You wouldn't know it from looking at the outside, which looks entirely stock. It even has the original wheels. The loud V8 burble from the cast-iron shorty headers and barely muffled exhaust does give away the secret a bit, but that's just enough to make you look at the car and go, \"Huh?\" Power goes to the rear wheels (yes, the proper wheels) through a custom 54-inch driveshaft into a Chevy S-10 rear axle. That axle is positioned precisely in the rear of the Sonic by welding it directly to the original suspension's lateral links. Hoy originally used a Turbo 350 automatic transmission, but has since replaced it with a T-5 five-speed manual transmission, along with other parts to make everything work together. These are all genuine muscle car parts in what may be one of the most unusual applications ever. The Sonic also contains many other parts to make it work in this weird way.\u00a0The radiator from a\u00a0VW Scirocco,\u00a0plus an always-on electric fan, keeps the V8 cool, even with no thermostat.\u00a0Beefier front springs from a Chevy Equinox on the Sonic's stock struts help support the extra weight of the iron-block V8.\u00a0Amazon supplied other parts like the wiring harness and fuel injector adapters. \"LS swap all the things\" has become such an overused clich\u00e9 that it's no longer funny. We've seen them in everything from a Porsche 912\u00a0to a tiny Suzuki kei car. But this one is special, not just because it looks completely original from the outside, but also because it turns a Chevy Sonic, of all things, into a proper muscle car, with a big V8 up front that lights up the back tires anytime you want.

Can old Hollywood learn new tricks? That was the question hanging over a four-hour \"master class\" I recently sat in on to help people in the TV and movie industry pivot to the creator economy. With shows being canceled left and right, shoots moving to cheaper locales overseas, and layoffs wrought by industry consolidation, these are tough times, even for a workforce used to unpredictability. Meanwhile, the independent creator economy is booming. \"I'm just trying to figure out if there's a way to move into this creator economy as a person who's behind the scenes,\" one of the attendees, Rebecca Bregman, who was laid off after 15 years in unscripted TV, told me. She described the job market for her skill set as \"bleak.\" \"I'm sad, I'm mad,\" she said. Called \"Flipping the Script Master Class,\" the course Bregman and I attended was free and hosted by G&B Digital Management, a 10-year-old firm that represents creator talent, including Blake Scott Silva and Dr. Marie Mansaray-Lahai, who goes by RIE DEFINED. G&B founder and CEO Kyle Hjelmeseth said he saw an urgent need for the course, given the high number of people out of work. G&B has hosted two in Los Angeles and one in New York so far. Some 40 people from film and TV turned out for my session. Held in a cozy space in Brooklyn's DUMBO filled with cushions and colorful shaggy rugs, the class was part career training, part support group. I spoke with several attendees, most of whom had worked for over a decade in traditional Hollywood jobs, primarily in production, directing, writing, and performing. Some were facing down unemployment and scared, while others were merely creator-curious. They had a lot of questions. For example: The mood grew more heartened as Hjelmeseth and his education director, Joey Gagliardi, walked attendees through a high-level overview of the creator economy and practical ways they could leverage it. The day ended with a panel featuring Amber Kemp-Gerstel, who shared her journey from unscripted TV to DIY creator. Hjelmeseth got the tough lessons out of the way for his audience. Big media companies aren't the powerful arbiters of culture they once were, and green lights are getting scarcer. But he offered encouragement. \"I really want everyone to feel like there's possibility out there,\" he said. Gagliardi broke down the dos and don'ts of building an online presence. Here were my 5 biggest takeaways from the class: Hjelmeseth said G&B thinks of creators as falling into a few buckets. There are personalities and entertainers, but there are also educators and industry insiders, which is where a lot of people who are used to working behind the scenes in Hollywood can play. The phones came out when he showed a slide showing how you can get paying gigs this way. One example he gave was Kayse Goodell, a filmmaker, who showcases the work done by people on set like grips and photography directors. Others do voiceovers or let their visual work speak for itself. The point is: There are a lot of ways to put yourself out there without being on camera. Even if you aren't trying to earn a living as a creator, having a strong social presence shows people in the creator economy that you understand the space and are pitching your skills. The nomenclature may be different \u2014 think profile photo, not headshot \u2014 but many filmmaking tasks have a counterpart in the creator economy. \"You've already been trained for all of this,\" Gagliardi said. \"Nobody runs a ship tighter than a producer.\" As an old-school journalist, this was reassuring to hear. Don't assume people know the value of your work. Cyndi Steele, a former TV producer who's now G&B's chief of staff, advised the group to use specifics \u2014\u00a0like the number of episodes or hours of programming you've produced \u2014 in pitching creator-economy people who may be unfamiliar with how legacy Hollywood works. Post what you're passionate about or are an expert in, and build it into your everyday life. That way, it won't feel like such a chore. Post regularly and with a consistent message so people know what to expect. This also makes you more marketable if you're looking for brand dollars. The easiest way is to stick with one format and a few stock phrases. Crustbycarson, an accountant who posts about running and cooking in his off time, is a good example of this. Open with a hook. \"It's the economy of attention, and if you want to be part of it, you have to have that cold open to captivate them in the first few seconds,\" Gagliardi said. This came up a lot with attendees, a group used to working on traditional, high-budget productions. On social, the production value is less important than the entertainment value. That said, some creators feel more at home with higher quality production values (and some brands want to associate themselves with that). Those working in traditional formats are familiar with a model in which the audience comes to them. If you want to become a creator, you have to build an audience from scratch. If you're working with creators, understand that they expect to be part of the process. It's not like the old Hollywood model, where producers called the shots and talent often just showed up. \"We haven't treated creators as creatives,\" Steele said. \"If you work with a creator, you have to understand, they're the expert.\" Jump to","label":0}

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with John Santa Orta, 34, an assistant operations manager in St. Cloud, Florida. Santa Orta was a homeowner, but now prefers to rent. He's renting a home at TW - a Quinn Residence, a build-to-rent townhouse community in St. Cloud. The community consists of townhomes intended for renters and operates like an apartment complex. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Earlier this year, I was looking for an apartment in St. Cloud, Florida, and I was only finding one-bedroom apartments in the $2,000 range. I was driving one day when I saw a sign that said, \"Townhouses for rent.\" So I thought, \"Let me drive in there and see.\" When I did, I saw that it was actually a townhouse community just for renters. At first, I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a rental community \u2014 that was new to me. I started doing a little more research online, comparing and contrasting apartments and townhouses to determine which would be better for my budget. The idea of having more space pushed me more toward the townhouse. I didn't want to live in an apartment and then have neighbors upstairs jumping on the floor at 2 o'clock in the morning. I thought that at least with the townhouse, I would get a backyard, a garage, and be a little bit more comfortable. I haven't had any major issues since I moved in August, and it actually feels like the home is mine. I owned a home with my girlfriend, but then we separated, and I couldn't afford the house on my own. So we put the house on the market for sale. The house did sell after being on the market for a year, but it surprised me to see all the extra and hidden fees that agents don't disclose during the homebuying process. If I had known that about the additional costs, I probably would've never bought a house. I would've kept my money in my bank account, kept renting, and kept enjoying life. Many people who buy a home want their finances to be consistent, but it wasn't happening for me. I started paying about $3,000 a month into my escrow account, and over the three years I owned my house, the amount continued to increase. I walked away paying $3,300 a month when I thought it was supposed to be $3,000. That's due to property fees increasing, as well as other taxes and fees. My monthly rent for the townhouse unit is now $2,225. There is a landscaping service at $55 a month, a concierge service at $10.95, a smart home package at $35, and then I have water, sewage, utility bill, and electricity through the rental company. Along with one more utility bill, my total expenditures come out to $2,588 a month. Now that I'm renting, I know that next year, if the rental company increases the rent, they'll give me a heads-up. I feel like that has given me more leeway in controlling my expenses, where I can say, \"OK, I want to be able to plan something.\" Then I can plan a trip or buy something else. I'm able to do that without any surprises in the following year. As a renter, I don't have to worry about the lawn because TW comes to cut the grass every Friday. With the concierge service, I can submit an order online for someone to fix something in my house, so if my AC goes out, I don't have to call an AC company to come check it and see what's wrong. When I was a homeowner, my garbage disposal stopped working. It was $125 just for the guy to come out to tell me to take it apart to see what was wrong with it. Luckily, I didn't need a replacement, but if I had, I think the cheapest one would have been over $100. So for me, I'll stick to renting. I don't think I would look into buying a house again. I would rather stay where I am, save up money, and do something better with it than buy a property. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Two new Christmas-themed Lego Star Wars sets are on the market, but which should you get this holiday season, the Advent calendar or the Gingerbread AT-AT?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Two Lego Star Wars sets, two Christmas-themed sets, two similarly priced sets. But which should you buy this Christmas? The Lego Star Wars Advent calendar or the Gingerbread AT-AT? I've pitted these two Lego Star Wars Christmas sets against each other, as they're both holiday-themed and in a similar price range, but they're wildly different. Below, I'll compare and contrast the key specs and details of each set so you can get a better understanding of which one to choose this holiday season. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are just around the corner, so you can expect to see plenty of deals coming soon. If you want other top Lego content, check out our guides to the best Lego Star Wars sets, best Lego Marvel sets and best Lego space sets. But to compare the Lego Star Wars Advent calendar and the Gingerbread AT-AT, scroll down below. One of the biggest things anyone looks for in a Lego set is how big it actually is, and how many pieces you get. That determines how much space you'll need to display the completed set and, usually, how long and how simple the building process is. If you're considering the Lego Star Wars Advent calendar 2025, the important numbers are 263 pieces in total, with 24 total gifts. That means 263 pieces for mini-builds and including minifigures. The total dimensions of the set are 15.04 x 10.32 x 2.78 inches, which is essentially the size of the box, as all the gifts are figures, minifigures and mini-builds that can be displayed and played with in front of a festive backdrop. The Gingerbread AT-AT is a vastly different set and measures at over 7.5 x 9 x 4 inches, but comes with 697 pieces. So, it's a lot smaller and therefore will take up less room when on display, but it also comes with nearly three times the number of pieces, so it offers a lot more building. Specs Advent Calendar Gingerbread AT-AT Dimensions Over 15 x 10 x 2 inches 7.5 x 9 x 4 inches  Pieces 263 697 Figures\/Minigifures 8 buildable droids, 8 figures\/minifigures 1 gingerbread Darth Vader  Both sets also offer minifigures. Naturally, the Advent Calendar offers more: eight buildable droids, six figures and two mini-figures. The Gingerbread AT-AT set comes with just one: Darth Vader. Both sets offer festive figures as the Advent calendar offers a Jawa in a Christmas jumper, BB-8 as a snowman and other holiday versions of droids. Darth Vader, on the other hand, has the choice of holding a candy cane or his lightsaber and is dressed in gingerbread color. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! On the whole, it depends on what you're looking for. The Advent Calendar is ultimately a larger set and offers more variety, but if you're a Lego purist, an AT-AT to build and display, alongside a Darth Vader minifigure, may prove too tempting. Naturally, both festive sets have a holiday aesthetic to them. This year's Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar has a heavy focus on droids, with the backdrop being a workshop with a Christmas tree and a fireplace. On top of this, some of the figures come with a holiday twist, whether it's BB-8 dressed as a snowman, a Jawa wearing a Christmas jumper, or other droids built using holiday colors. The play and display elements of the Advent Calendar come down to the builder's imagination. The festive backdrop provides a setting in which the mini-builds and figures can be displayed. But, 24 different items in the set means any combination of build or figure can be used for display, and of course, any other figures you may already have can be used in front of the backdrop to add to the play potential. The Gingerbread AT-AT set's festive feel comes from its gingerbread coloring as well as finer details like Christmas pudding feet, candy cane blasters and fairy lights hanging from the side. Also, a gingerbread Darth Vader can hold a candy cane instead of his lightsaber. In terms of playability, the AT-AT doesn't offer much, but perhaps more than meets the eye. It features posable legs, an opening cockpit and a side panel that opens up to reveal a cozy and festive interior for Darth Vader to sit down and enjoy a warm drink. Of course, this model is meant to be put on display, given it's an AT-AT with a unique look and, given its size, it can stand out without taking up too much room. If the cost of a Lego set is the determining factor in whether or not you buy it, you should know that the Advent calendar is the cheaper set of the two. It's retail price at the time of release is $44.99, although we are seeing some deals for it, taking it below the $40 mark. The Lego Star Wars Gingerbread AT-AT will retail for $59.99, so it's the more expensive of the two, but it's still in the same price range. However, it offers more building with almost three times the number of pieces in the set. Advent Calendar Gingerbread AT-AT $44.99 \/ \u00a329.99 $59.99 \/ \u00a354.99 Overall, these are two great Christmas-themed sets with a clear festive feel. The advent calendar is aimed at younger children with an age recommendation of six and above. It also has more minifigures and is more conducive for imaginative play and less expensive. The Lego Gingerbread AT-AT is for slightly older builders, with a recommended age of 10 and above. It also comes with nearly 700 pieces, so could frustrate younger builders. It has fewer minifigures, but the one it comes with is Darth Vader. It's also the more impressive of the two sets when put on display. In short, if you're looking for one over the other, I would recommend the Gingerbread AT-AT. Sure, it's more expensive, but not considerably, and you get a lot more building out of it. It's more impressive to look at when on display and its extra features give it another layer on top of just being a festive Star Wars set. I think it's worth the extra $15, especially for anyone over the age of 10.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"The Play Store now hands you the right apps for your Android XR gear.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Google is introducing a major XR upgrade for the Play Store that will change how Android users find apps for their mixed reality headsets. The folks at Android Authority have spotted a new \u201cXR headset\u201d chip alongside the usual phone, tablet, Chromebook, and TV compatibility chips you see on Play Store app listings. When you tap this chip, the Play Store apparently displays screenshots, reviews, and details specific to the immersive format, giving you a preview of exactly how an app behaves when you strap on a headset. This update also extends to the browsing experience: under both the Apps and Games tabs, the \u201cOther devices\u201d filter now includes a dedicated XR headset section, making it easier to discover apps designed for mixed reality and VR environments. This change comes at the right time, as Android is moving into XR hardware. Google and Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy XR headset is a key part of that push, and Google is trying to avoid a situation where the hardware launches before the content ecosystem is ready. With Google organizing the Play Store around XR, consumers won\u2019t have to hunt for compatible apps one by one. Google's ambitions stretch well past a single partner. Google\u2019s clearly making sure Android apps work smoothly across the wider XR landscape. You can see that in platforms like Valve\u2019s Steam Frame VR, which is expected to run Android apps and is speeding up XR content support with its own developer kit program. So, improving the Play Store\u2019s XR features now helps Android stay important as more companies join the mixed-reality market. From the user's perspective, this simplifies everything. If you\u2019re considering buying an Android-powered headset, or already planning to pick up the Galaxy XR when it hits store shelves, the Play Store\u2019s new layout makes it clear which apps are built for immersive use. The revamp gives you a cleaner preview experience, better context from other XR users, and an easier way to browse apps designed specifically for spatial environments. For Google, this is a smart first step. Building the content structure early makes things easier for both developers and users later on, so Android will have a strong ecosystem ready before XR hardware becomes mainstream.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Though mobile devices and Apple Silicon have seen ARM-64 explode across the world, there\u2019s still decent odds you\u2019re reading this on a device with an x86 processor \u2014 the direct descendant of the world\u2019s first civilian microprocessor, the Intel 4004. The 4004 wasn\u2019t much good on its own, however, which is why [Klaus Scheffler] and [Lajos Kintli] have produced super-sized discrete chips of the 4001 ROM, 4002 RAM, and 4003 shift register to replicate a 1970s calculator at 10x the size and double the speed, all in time for the 4004\u2019s 50th anniversary. We featured this project a couple of years back, when it was just a lonely microprocessor. Adding the other MSC-4 series chips enabled the pair to faithfully reproduce the logic of a Busicom 141-PF calculator, the very first to market with Intel\u2019s now-legendary microprocessor. Indeed, this calculator is the raison d\u2019etre for the 4004: Busicom commissioned the whole Micro-Computer System 4-bit (MCS-4) set of chips specifically for this calculator. Only later, once they realized what they had made, did Intel buy the rights back from the Japanese calculator company, and the rest, as they say, is history.  Since its history, it belongs in a museum\u2013 and that\u2019s where this giant, FET-based calculator is going. If you happen to be in Solothurn, Switzerland, you\u2019ll be able to see it at a new history of technology exhibit opening at the Enter Museum in 2026. Do check out the write-up and links at 4004.com if you want to learn about this important piece of human history. The museum-quality hack. Three 4003 shift registers are on the left, with a 4001 ROM above the 4004 CPU in the center, flanked by three 4002 RAM \u201cchips\u201d on the right. Photo by [Klaus Scheffler].We had to specify \u201cfirst civilian microprocessor\u201d at the start of this article because the US Navy beat them to the punch by a whole year, and kept it secret until 1998. There\u2019s something very 1970s about the fact that top-secret US military technology was reinvented for a Japanese calculator within a year. It honestly makes [Federico Faggin], the man credited with the design, seem no less visionary than when we thought he was first out of the gate. Can 4004 run Linux? I don\u2019t see why not, with RISC-V or ARM emulation, as has been done with 6502 and AVR. Might take a few weeks to boot though. Yes, there was even a HaD article about it. [Dmitry Grinberg] did so here: https:\/\/dmitry.gr\/?r=05.Projects&proj=35.%20Linux4004 Someone ran an emulator on the 4004 to do just that. https:\/\/linux.slashdot.org\/story\/24\/09\/28\/2238229\/how-i-booted-linux-on-an-intel-4004-from-1971 Forget Linux, can it run Doom?   ;) Disagreements often arise over \u201cwho invented it first.\u201d In the case of the first microprocessor, it comes as no surprise that this question is disputed. My take on the 4004\u2019s place in history (\u201ccivilian\u201d or otherwise) is this: yes, the F-14 avionics \u201cCentral Air Data Computer\u201d (CADC) was truly a groundbreaking use of multi-chip, silicon integration (LSI). Ray Nolt and his team deserve bragging rights. They do! But to me, whether the CADC was \u201cthe first microprocessor\u201d is a distraction. Intel really did \u201cshoot the first salvo\u201d in the \u201cwar\u201d of customer-programmable microprocessors (while companies like Texas Instruments were a mere \u201cphoto finish\u201d behind them). There is no sense in quibbling over whether the CADC was a custom DSP or a general purpose computer. In my considered opinion, the key feature of the 4004 was that anyone could write code for it, burn their code into a ROM, and make a microprocessor the \u201cbrain\u201d of their product. And this enabling technology is what kicked off the microprocessor industry as a driver of innovation. A revolution takes more than one inventor. It takes a village. By what about the Four Phase Systems AL1? Sellam P.S. Federico Faggin deserves bragging rights too, for squeezing an entire CPU onto a single chip. (Or should he be remembered for the 8080? Or for the Zilog Z80?) And it is a fluke of history that Texas Instruments (TI) was not given more credit. They developed a fixed-function, single-chip calculator (around a 4-bit microprocessor with internal ROM) at the very same time Faggin was working on Intel\u2019s multi-chip Busicom 141-PF printing calculator contract. It was stiff competion from single-chip calculators that motivated Busicom to negotiate away exclusive rights to the Intel 4004 family in exchange for lower prices, allowing Intel to pivot from being a semiconductor RAM company to, well\u2026 The rest is history. Amazing calculator! Looks like they cheated with the 4001 ROM. Well, we only replaced the ROM transistor array with an programmable EEPROM, the remaining parts such as I\/O etc are unchanged. To build a ROM out of transistors hardwired to a certain program code is possible, but very unflexible. So I wouldnt call it a cheat My very first job was an assembler building LORAN C receivers. We used the msc4 set and eeproms. Max ram, hand made 7 segment displays each segment was a hand stuffed single led hand wired to a header. It was very hi-tech for it\u2019s time 76-77. A bit of a common myth here \u2013 the 4004 is completely unrelated to the 8008. The ISA of the 8008 was designed by the DataPoint computer terminal company, and is the basis if the modern x64 ISA. Federico Faggin and his team worked on the 4004 exclusively, and and shared no ISA details whatsoever. The 8008 team just liked the name of their internal rival, and saw a marketing opportunity.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Criminal gangs are buying up haulage firms to pose as truckers and steal goods by the lorryload, the BBC has learned. We found evidence that a group of haulage companies were purchased using a dead man's details. One of the haulage firms was then hired as a subcontractor by an unwitting UK transport company. A manufacturer loaded one of the subcontractor's lorries up with goods - which were then never seen again. Alison - not her real name - runs the Midlands transport firm that was tricked by the fake subcontractors, and says it is \"incredible\" that \"a gang can go in and target a company so blatantly\". This brazen tactic is just one of the ways criminals are targeting haulage firms who deliver retail stock and other supplies all over the country, as freight theft in the UK rose to \u00a3111m last year, from \u00a368m in 2023. Footage obtained by the BBC shows criminals raiding lorries as they make deliveries, breaking into vehicles while they wait in traffic, cutting locks and breaking into depots, and stealing whole trailers packed with goods. Drivers, who frequently have to stop and sleep overnight in their cabs, have told the BBC they often wake to find the curtained sides of their lorries slashed by criminals who tried to get at the cargo inside, with shipments of designer clothes, alcohol and electronics among the most common targets. \"You should care because it hits your wallet,\" says John Redfern, a former security manager for a major supermarket. As more products get stolen, the cost of goods for the consumer will go up over time, he said. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said freight crime is becoming \"more sophisticated, more organised\" and said police forces need to work with the industry to respond. Fraud targeting hauliers - including criminals using bogus haulage companies - is on the rise in the UK, according to the police's National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service. \"Our industry is under attack,\" says Richard Smith, managing director of the Road Haulage Association. The industry body hears every day of businesses targeted by \"highly organised crime gangs\" and police have warned them of \"a recent growth\" in much more sophisticated methods, he says. The fraud identified by the BBC appears to follow a pattern previously seen by Europol in mainland Europe, where \"legitimate transport companies on the brink of bankruptcy\" are bought by organised crime groups who pick up several cargoes \"and then vanish\". After Alison's firm was targeted, the officers working on her case told her police were also investigating similar crimes in other parts of the UK. Alison's haulage firm, which moves millions of pounds around the country each year, subcontracted to a smaller transport company for a job earlier this year. She says she sometimes does this when her lorries are busy or in the wrong place. \"Their insurance was in place, their operators' licence was in place,\" she says. \"It looked great.\" The lorry arrived at the manufacturing company, a forklift truck loaded it up with DIY products and the lorry drove off, she says. But unknown to Alison and the manufacturers, the lorry had been using fake number plates. It disappeared with the cargo worth \u00a375,000. \"The first we knew about it was the destination company rang us and said, 'where's our load gone?'\" Alison says. She tried to ring the subcontractor, but the number had been disconnected.  So who had taken the goods? We followed a twisting trail to try to find out, involving a dead man's identity, a mystery Romanian woman and a \u00a3150,000 Lamborghini Urus. The company Alison hired was called Zus Transport. A month before the theft, it had been sold by its previous owners - there is no suggestion they were involved in any wrongdoing. The BBC discovered that the takeover was funded by a bank transfer from a company owned by a UK-based Romanian lorry driver named Ionut Calin, who went by his middle name Robert. We found a network of five transport companies, including Zus Transport, seemingly purchased by Mr Calin this year. But Mr Calin died in November 2024, we confirmed with Romanian officials. That was months before his bank details had been used to buy several of the companies and his name used to register three of them at Companies House. We have no reason to believe he was involved in crime, and dozens of people on social media paid tribute to him as a good man who helped others in the industry. The former owners of several of the transport companies said they had dealt not with Mr Calin, but with a man called \"Benny\". So who was he? We found him by investigating the director of Zus Transport named in Companies House records, a Romanian woman. Information about her is scarce, but we found a phone number for her. When we searched for the number in WhatsApp, it showed a profile picture of a young woman, with a different name, in a Lamborghini. The profile picture helped us identify her as a relative of Mr Calin, and the wife of a man named Benjamin Mustata. Mr Mustata and his wife had posed for a photo when collecting a Lamborghini from a dealership in April, a week after the theft targeting Alison's company. When we showed images from social media of Mr Mustata to a former owner of one of the transport companies, he identified him as \"Benny\" - the man he had met face-to-face to negotiate the sale of the company. A phone number Mr Mustata used in 2023 to rent a property in Coventry was also used to arrange collection of the goods stolen by the subcontractors who scammed Alison. The same number had also been used by \"Benny\" to buy one of the transport companies using Robert Calin's name and bank details. When we went to Mr Mustata's address to deliver a letter with questions about his suspected involvement in the theft, we were told he had moved to Romania. That was false. We tracked him down to Coventry, where he was selling luxury cars. Asked about Zus Transport, Mr Mustata said: \"Go away.\" He denied using a dead man's identity to buy haulage companies and using Zus Transport to steal goods. He admitted buying Zus Transport, but said he did so on behalf of a relative and was not in control of the company at the time of the theft. Mr Mustata said somebody else had been using Zus Transport's name on a subcontracting platform, and that they must have stolen the goods. \"The company is registered in my address. My own address. I'm living there. How you think, yeah, I was doing things bad to my own address?\" he said. He said the stolen load had \"nothing\" to do with him, adding: \"It's not my fault.\" Fraud lawyer Arun Chauhun examined the BBC's findings and said the scheme targeting Alison appeared to be \"well set-up\", involving identity fraud and deceiving Companies House, the government body that registers limited companies. He said he thought there was a \"kind of malaise that businesses can afford to take the hit\" because they have insurance, but in reality crime such as this \"damages individual lives, those people who own the businesses\". But as for whoever is ultimately behind the crime, Mr Chauhun said: \"I think they're just thinking, well, the system's never going to have the resource to catch up with us.\" Labour MP Rachel Taylor, who represents North Warwickshire and Bedworth where about one in five people work in logistics, said the BBC investigation \"lays bare what I hear constantly from hauliers: that increasingly sophisticated crime gangs are having a huge impact on their businesses\". She said it had \"gone unrecognised for too long\", and called for a \"joined up national policing strategy and more resources to tackle this issue, so we can put these organised criminals behind bars where they belong\". Deputy Chief Constable Jayne Meir, the NPCC's first lead for freight crime, said a new team at Opal - a police intelligence unit tackling organised acquisitive crime - would start targeting the issue next year. But in the meantime, business owners such as Alison say crimes like these have a \"massive impact\".  \"We're going home at night and we're not sleeping,\" she says. \"Haulage businesses don't make a lot of money and it only takes something like this and you're out of business.\"  The Menawethan goes into the water ahead of its expected coming into service in the UK in 2026. Haulage firms are introducing electric heavy goods vehicles, but say many more chargers are needed. Workers, such as The HGV Girl, are trying to attract young people to the lorry driving industry. A consumers group says prices would rise in the short-term but decrease in the long-term. The new flat rate prices are set to be applied to provide \"transparency around ferry costs\".

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"The official Week 3 Black Friday deals are now in full swing, with up $400 off MacBook models, the first notable discount on Apple Watch Series 11, and the ongoing AirPods 4 offer at the $85 all-time low. Stock is quickly dwindling on the\u00a0M4 MacBook Air deals at $250 off, but we do now have all-time low pricing on the M5 MacBook Pro at up to nearly $150 off the list price, as well as Powerbeats Pro 2 at up to $138 off. All of that, alongside the lowest prices yet on select 2025 Apple Watch Ultra Alpine and Trail Loop models, awaits below.\u00a0 While we caught some deep deals on Apple Watch Series 10 as part of the early Black Friday festivities, this morning Amazon is kicking off week 3 with the best prices ever on the new Apple Watch Series 11 GPS + Cellular models at nearly $50 off in both the 42mm and 46mm sizes. Details await below. While we have already spotted some $49 price dropson the 2025 Apple Watch SE 3, as well as $99 discounts on the Ultra 3 Apple just released in September, today\u2019s deals mark the first notable chance to save on Apple Watch Series 11. Outside of some very light launch deals, discounts on the Series 11 lineup have been slight at best. But this morning Amazon has knocked a solid $50 off select GPS + Cellular configurations to deliver new all-time lows and the best prices we have tracked to date: Update: This Amazon Resale deal has returned and at an even lower price: Grab an Apple Pencil Pro down at $62.65 shipped. Details below in the original post. The official Apple Pencil Pro \u2013 Cupertino\u2019s latest and greatest iPad writer \u2013 carries a $129 list price and almost never drops below $100 in brand new condition. However, we just caught a compelling opportunity to land one over at Amazon at just over $67 shipped. Details await below.\u00a0 Coming courtesy of the official Amazon Resale program, you\u2019ll now find \u201cUsed: Like New\u201d Apple Pencil Pro units sitting down at $67.39 shipped on Amazon. That\u2019s nearly 48% under the $129 list price and one of the lowest prices we have ever tracked from a reputable source. While I guess for some throwing down the extra $33 is worthwhile just to grab a brand new one, and understandably so, if you\u2019re looking for the lowest price possible this Amazon Resale offer is a compelling one.\u00a0 This is also rated among the highest-quality Used\u201d products Amazon Resale delivers, and comes \u201cbacked by Amazon\u2019s 30-day return policy.\u201d \u00a0 All of our products go through a quality check by us prior to being sold. We thoroughly test the functional and physical condition of each item and give the product a specific grade before selling it. We also inspect our products for missing accessories and packaging damage. Based on our quality check, each item will be assigned one of the four evaluations to describe its overall condition: \u201cLike New\u201d, \u201cVery Good\u201d, \u201cGood\u201d, and \u201cAcceptable\u201d. Apple Pencil Pro has been available on Amazon and other retailers at $99 for a quite a while. So long and often you can make an argument that $99 is really the regular price for one at this point. That said, it will still run you $129 from Apple, and we haven\u2019t seen it sold on Amazon for any less than $99 once all year long \u2013 the last time it dropped below that was ahead of Black Friday last year and it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as low as we are tracking here today.\u00a0 Just as a quick reminder, Apple Pencil Pro is compatible with the new M5 iPad Pro machines as well as the following: The Week 3 Black Friday deals have now begun at some retailers while big-time early sales are set to end later today at Walmart and Best Buy, but we are either way now tracking the best prices ever on Apple\u2019s latest M5 MacBook Pro. Amazon is now offering the two most affordable 16GB configurations with prices approaching $150 in savings. Amazon got off to an early start, as expected, with the Apple\u2019s M5 MacBook Pro offering $50 price drops near the end of October shortly after released. We specifically warned readers not to buy one at that time, but we are now looking at solid price drops with over $120 in savings on the most affordable model and nearly $150 off the 16GB\/1TB model in Space Black \u2013 these are new Amazon all-time lows and the best deals we have tracked online for Apple\u2019s only Mac carrying the new M5 chip: Question: It is Black Friday, aren\u2019t they still going to drop even lower? Answer: Yes, maybe.\u00a0 Anything can and might very well drop lower as we approach Thanksgiving 2025 and the subsequent Black Friday weekend. We were targeting both of these two machines at $150 off for Black Friday this year and that might very well happen, but they are also already very close to that right now.\u00a0 Based on our extensive experience, and last year\u2019s October M4 MacBook release, we expect both of these configurations to be $150 off for Black Friday \u2013 this is what happened last year and it wasn\u2019t until Christmas Eve 2024 before we saw the most affordable M4 go for any better than that. If you\u2019re looking to make sure you get one of these under the tree, the prices we have here today are quite respectable, even for this time of year \u2013 but they could, of course, go for less between now and then. But for those looking towards the more affordable M4 MacBook Air, just about every model in the entire lineup is now sitting at the best, and very much Black Friday-worthy, price: We caught our very first deal on Apple\u2019s new Midnight 44mm Midnight SE 3 wearable the other day. It went completely out of stock before making a return yesterday \u2013 it is still live at the moment \u2013 and now the most affordable Midnight model in the new collection is live at its $199.99 all-time low. Amazon is now offering the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 in the Midnight colorway down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $249, this is nearly $49 off and the best price we have ever tracked.\u00a0 While this one did drop to the same $200 we have here now at a few days ago, it almost immediately went out of stock and remained unavailable until this morning. Considering almost no one had a chance at this deal earlier in the week, today\u2019s offer is effectively the first chance to score a notable price drop on the most affordable Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 \u2013 the most affordable 2025 Apple Watch \u2013 and a new Amazon all-time low. This year\u2019s new Apple Watch SE model is the most compelling model Apple has ever released if you ask me. It is, by and large, for just about anyone but the most hardcore users, effectively an Apple Watch Series 10 with less color options. It runs on the same S10 chip and finally supports an always-on display (a must-have for me) as well as double-tap and wrist-flick gesture support. It\u2019s clearly not a Series-grade Apple Watch, but starting at $200 it\u2019s awfully close and much more affordable \u2013 the most affordable Series 11 starts at $389 on Amazon.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":" Sonic the Hedgehog 3  I know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no point in getting heated about the Game Awards every year, but the 2025 nominations are really making this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s event feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna be the Taco Bell of award ceremonies. By that, I mean it feels like every category\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominations are made up of the same five or so games. Clair Obscur and Ghost of Yotei were eating, but pretty much anything else got snubbed. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not here to yell about games, actually. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m here to call attention to one of the most egregious snubs of the show, which is found in a non-game category. Specifically, where the hell is Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in the Best Adaptation category? Best Adaptation was added to the Game Awards\u00e2\u0080\u0099 categories in 2022, rewarding TV and film adaptations of video games for finally getting off of the Uwe Boll assembly line and sometimes being things worth watching. Now that pretty much every company from Nintendo to Sony is trying to get into streaming services and multiplexes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a worthwhile category to have at a video game award show. However, the 2025 Adaptation category is so vile in its inclusions and omissions that it\u2019s enough to make a hedgehog vow to destroy the world for his dearly departed best friend. This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominees range from forgettable to absolute dogshit. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with: First of all, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get me started on The Last of Us season two; you can read literally thousands of words I wrote on it earlier in the year. Meanwhile, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, the movie that currently holds the highest Rotten Tomatoes score of any video game adaptation, is nowhere to be seen. There are a few reasons this probably happened. The cinematic adaptation of Sonic Adventure 2 came out last December, just late enough to miss the 2024 awards but still be eligible for the 2025 ceremony. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long enough for the jury to have forgotten that the movie could compete for the prize, and for stinkers like Minecraft and The Last of Us to be top of mind. This is an especially heinous oversight given the Very Bad Knuckles Paramount+ show, which sidelined the actual Sonic characters for the most obnoxious of its human originals, was nominated in 2024. Part of getting past the whole \u00e2\u0080\u009cputting stock in award shows\u00e2\u0080\u009d phase of your life is recognizing that they are often merely reflections of what the jury actually got around to. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely why 2025\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nominees, rather than representing the breadth of the medium, wound up being so many of the same games over and over again. Some of the categories, such as Accessibility and Esports, are voted on by a jury of experts, while a lot of the rest are more generalized, which often keeps the more niche games, like the IMO obvious GOTY contender The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, from getting the nods they deserve. And sometimes you just get weird oversights, like Sonic the Hedgehog 3 missing out on a nomination for Best Adaptation, while Jack Black saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cChicken jockey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d gets to cosplay as a good film for a night. God, The Last of Us season two is going to win, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? I gotta lie down. Keanu Reeves didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve this.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":" Nestled in the peaceful Swedish countryside, Vagabond Haven\u2019s Sofia tiny house proves that living small doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing style or comfort. At just 172 square feet, this compact dwelling has captured the attention of the tiny house community for its clever use of space and its unrelenting connection to nature. The first thing you notice about Sofia is the windows. Large panoramic panes wrap around the interior, while a strategically placed roof skylight sits directly above the king-sized bed. This design choice transforms the sleeping area into a private observatory where residents can watch clouds drift by during the day and count stars at night. The bohemian chic interior complements this openness, creating an atmosphere that feels more like a cozy retreat than a tiny house. Built on a double-axle trailer measuring 20 feet in length, Sofia maintains the mobility that makes tiny house living so appealing. The spruce construction keeps the weight manageable while providing the structural integrity needed for Scandinavian winters. Vagabond Haven designed this model specifically for year-round living in harsh Nordic conditions, ensuring robust insulation and high-quality materials throughout. The dimensions measure 6.1 meters in length, 2.55 meters in width, and 4 meters in height, creating a profile that\u2019s road-legal yet surprisingly spacious once inside. Designer: Vagabond Haven        The interior layout showcases thoughtful space planning. The elevated bedroom platform doubles as storage, with slide-out furniture tucked beneath that transforms the area from sleeping quarters to living space. A well-equipped kitchen lines one wall, featuring everything needed for daily cooking without feeling cramped. The living area adapts to different needs throughout the day, proving that 16 square meters can accommodate more activities than you\u2019d expect. This transforming interior design has earned Sofia recognition for making such a compact footprint surprisingly livable for two people. The bathroom deserves special mention for its wet-room design using Fibo Trespo panels. Buyers can choose between flush, composting, or Cinderella incinerating toilets, making the Sofia adaptable to various locations and lifestyles. The shower cabin offers either curtain or glass door options, while an energy-saving water heater keeps utility costs low. These choices reflect Vagabond Haven\u2019s commitment to customization within their standardized models. A cupboard with washing basin and options for infrared or regular mirrors complete the bathroom setup, proving that compact spaces can still offer genuine comfort and flexibility.        What sets Sofia apart from other tiny houses in its size category is the attention to eco-friendly details. The company uses sustainable materials throughout construction and offers various off-grid solutions for those seeking complete independence. A rainwater harvesting system, a recuperator for ventilation, and options for solar power mean Sofia can sit comfortably in remote locations far from municipal services. The design philosophy behind Sofia recognizes that tiny house dwellers want genuine quality, not just miniaturized versions of conventional homes. Every cabinet, window placement, and storage solution serves multiple purposes. The result feels intentional rather than cramped, stylish rather than sparse. For those interested in seeing Sofia firsthand, Vagabond Haven offers a 3D virtual tour on their website, allowing potential buyers to explore the space before making the journey to Sweden. Ready-built models can ship within two to four weeks when in stock, while custom orders take longer but allow buyers to select specific materials, colors, and finishes that match their vision. Sofia represents a sweet spot in the tiny house market: small enough to remain affordable and mobile, yet large enough to serve as a legitimate full-time home for couples or solo dwellers seeking connection with nature and freedom from excess.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"OLED TVs have firmly established themselves as the market leader when it comes to picture quality. This is also the reason why, when you read most recommendations for the best TVs on the market, you'll find an OLED model at the top. Despite all the advancements in LCD TVs, they still fall short of OLED TVs in aspects like true black levels, contrast ratio, and viewing angles.\u00a0However, OLED TVs are expensive, with the best 65-inch models, such as the LG G5 and Sony Bravia 8 II, costing between $2,500 and $3,000. Even the most affordable OLED TVs, like the Panasonic Z85A and LG B5, have a list price of over $1,800 for the 65-inch sizes, making them significantly more expensive than most LCD TVs. If you are a smart buyer who's looking for the best value for money TV, an LCD TV can be a good alternative to an OLED TV. LCD TVs may not give you the absolute best picture, but they can still deliver excellent performance that will impress most people.\u00a0Keep in mind, when we say LCD TV, it is any TV in the market right now that's not an OLED TV, regardless of whichever marketing term is used to describe it. This includes\u00a0LED TVs, QLED TVs, QNED TVs, ULED TVs, and\u00a0Mini-LED TVs. All these TVs are LCD TVs at the core, but they have extra technologies, which are often reflected in these marketing terms. Marketing confusion aside, here's what helps modern LCD TVs deliver a good visual performance.\u00a0 It's true that OLED TVs have a better picture quality than LCD TVs. However, in the last several years, LCD TV manufacturers have implemented several technologies that have closed the gap between an LCD TV and an OLED TV. Some of these technologies include Mini-LED backlighting, quantum dot technology, and full-array local dimming.\u00a0Each of these technical-sounding terms takes the LCD picture quality to the next level. For example, Mini-LED backlighting, which is used in most good LCD TVs on the market right now, enables better backlight control and higher peak brightness, which not only helps the TV deal with glare and reflections in a brightly-lit room but also improves black levels. It's typically paired with full-array local dimming, which controls when and which of these tiny LEDs are lit or dimmed in a scene to give you deeper blacks and brighter highlights where needed. Quantum dot technology, on the other hand, enhances the color production and is far more efficient than the traditional color filter. So, an LCD TV with quantum dots can display a purer and wider range of colors, helping produce a more lifelike picture for you.\u00a0Thanks to these three display technologies, most people don't need to spend the big bucks buying an OLED TV. A Mini-LED TV is the closest you can get to an OLED in terms of colors and brightness \u2014 for a much lower price. TV is often just one part of a good visual or home theater setup, and with the right devices, you can substantially improve your TV-viewing experience. You can use some of the money saved to get some additional devices. For example, a soundbar is often a no-brainer add-on if you appreciate good sound, as modern TVs don't really deliver good audio due\u00a0to their inherently thin nature. This can easily be solved with a good soundbar that won't cost you a lot and will seamlessly attach to your TV using the ARC or eARC port. Bias lighting is one cheap little upgrade that you can make to your TV setup to enhance the viewing experience in dark ambient conditions. It helps reduce eye strain and also tricks your eyes into perceiving better black levels and more vibrant colors. Finally, if you are not enjoying your TV's built-in operating system or you feel your TV is running slow, you can add a separate streaming device, such as an Apple TV 4K, Nvidia Shield, Google TV Streamer 4K, or Roku Ultra, to get better performance. With an Apple TV 4K, you can even ditch most of the spying and advertising done by modern TVs and streaming devices.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"On Nov. 16, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House after spending a weekend at his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. As usual, a press photographer was on scene to snap photos. They went viral on social media not long after being posted online.  That's because, in the background, a U.S. flag appeared to be on the ground, which would be a breach of the U.S. flag code. That code states that the flag should \"never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.\" Upon viewing the photos, several Snopes readers wrote in asking us whether they were real. They were. However, photos were taken at an angle that did not allow us to confirm whether the flag ever touched the ground. We reached out to both the White House and the photographer who took the image for more information. Until we learn more, we have omitted a truth rating for this claim. White House spokesman Davis Ingle called the claim that the flag had touched the ground \"fake news\" in an email statement to Snopes. \"Due to the high winds on Sunday evening in the Washington, D.C. area, the flag was lowered into a special container out of an abundance of caution during the Marine One landing,\" he said.\u00a0 That statement still contradicts the flag code, because the \"special container\" would still have been beneath the flag.\u00a0 Official press photographs are generally posted to the stock photo site Getty Images. Looking for recent photos of Trump at the White House quickly revealed the snapshots as legitimate images, credited to photographer Mandel Ngan. Some posts on social media provided a potential alternate angle, but Snopes could not confirm whether that image was legitimate. Regardless, both images (and video footage) did depict the flag in a position that could have made it touch the ground. Some kind of box-shaped container was visible near the flag in the photos. The flag in the photograph was attached to one of the two flagpoles Trump installed after he re-took office in January 2025.\u00a0 4 USC Ch. 1: THE FLAG. https:\/\/uscode.house.gov\/view.xhtml?path=\/prelim@title4\/chapter1&edition=prelim.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Investing  \t\t\t\t\tSending You to Google News in 3  \u00a9 Deagreez \/ iStock via Getty Images SEC filings reveal that Warren Buffett sold more Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in the most recently reported quarter. That was the bad news. The good news was that the company had a strong quarter. Worries that the new iPhone 17 would sell poorly were misguided. However, its stock performance is lackluster. So far this year, Apple is up 14%, which is no better than the broader market. Apple\u2019s topline and iPhone revenues last quarter were strong. Total revenue was up 8% to $102.5 billion, and per-share earnings rose 13% to $1.85. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, said, \u201cToday, Apple is very proud to report a September quarter revenue record of $102.5 billion, including a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and an all-time revenue record for Services.\u201d iPhone sales rose from $42.6 billion in the year-ago quarter to $49 billion. But the good news ended there. China is the largest smartphone market in the world by far. Although the market share there changes often, Apple is up against local companies Huawei, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Oppo. Some of these companies already have artificial intelligence (AI) features on their products. Apple\u2019s Greater China revenue dropped from $15.0 billion last year to $14.5 billion. That means Greater China is only 14% of the company\u2019s revenue. Apple is still, by most definitions, in last place in the AI race across America\u2019s mega-cap tech companies. It has no public-facing AI product. It does not have a cloud business on which it can use AI to capitalize. In fact, Apple is at least a year behind the industry. Tero Vesalainen \/ Shutterstock.com Apple was supposed to announce advanced AI features with the launch of the iPhone 17. Not only did it miss that target, but no AI product is due until early next year. There are rumors that Apple will use a Google AI product and pay Alphabet a huge amount to do so. That makes it captive to Google\u2019s success in the sector. Google competes with several huge public companies, like Microsoft, and several private ones, led by OpenAI. Other companies have hired away several of the top engineers Apple brought in to lead its AI efforts. There is still a chance that AI will never be successful as a paid product for consumers. Perhaps it will eventually be considered no better than an advanced form of Google search. Finally, worry has begun about who will replace CEO Tim Cook. When Steve Jobs stepped down, it looked like Cook would be a downgrade. That has not been the case. In the past five years, Apple\u2019s stock is 132% higher. The market is up 89% over the same period. Cook took over in 2011. He is now 65 years old. He may not leave soon, but the guessing has started.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Kevin Dietsch\/Getty Images Warren Buffett is tech\u2019s most famous skeptic. So when a quarterly securities filing revealed late Friday that Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has taken a first-ever, multibillion stake in Alphabet, the parent company of Google, investors sat up and took notice. Shares of Alphabet rose about 5% heading into Monday's market open.  The new Berkshire position became public following an almost 50% rally in Google stock so far this year \u2014 all the more surprising because Berkshire's investor team is well known for waiting until stock prices look cheap. Even as Berkshire has, over the last decade, placed similar bets on Apple and Amazon, the decision still carries outsize weight. Given Buffett\u2019s long-standing aversion to richly valued growth stocks, not to mention his reputation for caution near market peaks, Berkshire's vote of confidence suggests that Alphabet shares are fairly valued or even inexpensive, despite the run-up.  The routine 13F filing on Friday revealed that Berkshire acquired roughly 18 million shares, worth about $4.3 billion, at some point in the third quarter, with Alphabet now the conglomerate\u2019s 1oth-largest holding. The purchase most likely came from one of Buffett\u2019s two portfolio managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who have both been granted power to make smaller bets within Berkshire\u2019s $350 billion equity portfolio. The two have nudged Berkshire into tech since the late 2010s, exemplified by positions in Amazon and Apple, both of which have thus far paid off handsomely.  The Berkshire endorsement also adds a layer of legitimacy to Google's AI narrative, signaling confidence, even as, in recent weeks, investors have balked at AI-related buildout costs among major tech companies like Meta.  For the 95-year-old Buffett, it also represents a kind of late-career redemption. The investor, never shy about admitting his mistakes, has publicly said he \u201cblew it\u201d by failing to buy Google early. For analysts and traders, the move also offers a glimpse of Berkshire's post-Buffett future \u2014 one that\u2019s slightly cozier with Silicon Valley and, by extension, AI.  The stake comes as Berkshire continues trimming other tech holdings, including another 15% cut to its massive Apple position, now worth about $60 billion.  Still, Apple remains its single largest investment.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-11-17","content":" \t\t\t\t\tBy Jill Goldsmith  Co-Business Editor  \tE.W. Scripps is not loving the latest move by larger rival Sinclair, which revealed earlier Monday that it acquired an 8.2% stake in the smaller broadcaster on the open market and wants to own it as the industry continues to consolidate.  \tIn response, Scripps said its \u201cboard will take all steps appropriate to protect the company and the company\u2019s shareholders from the opportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else.\u201d  \t\u201cScripps\u2019 board of directors and management are focused on driving value for all of the company\u2019s shareholders through the continued execution of its strategic plan. The board and management are aligned on doing only what is in the best interest of all of the company\u2019s shareholders as well as its employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States,\u201d Scripps\u2019 statement said. \u201cThe company\u2019s board has and will continue to evaluate any transactions and other alternatives that would enhance the value of the company and would be in the best interest of all company shareholders.\u201d  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tSinclair Reveals Merger Talks With E.W.

A source told Deadline that talks between Sinclair and Scripps ended with no transaction.  \tScripps surged 40% on Monday after Sinclair\u2019s revelation that it had acquired 6.275 million shares and said it believes that if an agreement can be struck, a deal could close in nine to 12 months.  \tSinclair also made the case for a combination, including $300 million in annual cost savings, reduced leverage, and further scale as competition intensifies. The nation\u2019s largest station owner Nexstar signed a mega-deal in August to acquire broadcaster Tegna. Scripps is the third largest operator of\u00a0ABC affiliates behind Sinclair and Nexstar.  \tSEC rules require Sinclair to reveal its holding in Scripps, but not to explain in detail why it took the position.  \t           \t\u201cThe biggest hurdle we see to completing a SBGI\/SSP combination are social issues (family control, pro forma ownership structure, and Board representation),\u201d Sinclair said in the filing, referring to the stock symbols for the two publicly traded companies, and longtime ownership by the founding Scripps family.  \tWall Street analysts asked Scripps CEO Adam Symson about M&A on an earnings call this month. He noted \u201csignificant opportunities to buy, sell and swap stations,\u201d as it\u2019s been doing, as well as looking at bigger deals. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that transformational M&A at this moment can be really accretive, in addition to the work we\u2019re doing with optimizing our portfolio, and we\u2019ll continue to operate in that marketplace.\u201d  \tAsked about the family\u2019s role in such decisions, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t speak for our controlling shareholders. This is a management-led process. Obviously, our Board of Directors is very, very involved. And then from there, we bring the Scripps family in. I can reiterate what I\u2019ve said before [that] over the long history of this company, the family has always acted in the best interest of all shareholders and is committed to doing what is best for the company, that creates the greatest shareholder value.   \t\u201cLook, just to be very, very clear, this isn\u2019t some kind of hobby for the Scripps family. This is a business. It\u2019s an investment, and it\u2019s their American legacy, and I know they are committed to doing what creates the greatest value for all shareholders.\u201d Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

(NYSE: F) shares are up 32% this year, compared to 14% for the S&P 500. And the stock has a yield of 4.6%. Ford\u2019s earnings were fine, neither disappointing nor spectacular. Revenue rose 9% to $50.5 billion. Per share earnings increased from $o.22 to $0.60. Although Ford has set a recall record this year that may never be broken, the talk about warranty damage to the bottom line has quieted down. jetcityimage \/ iStock Editorial via Getty Images The one thing the market is besotted with is the company\u2019s pullback from electric vehicles (EVs). Although CEO Jim Farley has expressed tremendous anxiety about Chinese EVs, he has lost the temptation to chase the Chinese. For the time being, tariffs are holding that competition in check. Ford has apparently given up future walking. Part of giving up future walking is to admit, publicly or not, that much of Ford\u2019s investment in EVs was a mistake. Plans for selling hundreds of thousands of EVs in the United States is no longer part of the Ford discussion. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the company will end the manufacture of its EV flagship, the F-150 Lightning. Dealers will not miss them. Ford is not alone in the problem of EV sales. Legacy car companies that hoped the U.S. market would be a success have found it was not. Ford\u2019s gasoline-powered business in the U.S. is as healthy as any other car company. It has 13% of the market. As people turn away from EVs, they turn toward fossil fuels. And the rate at which they will eventually turn back toward EVs is uncertain. Through the first 10 months of this year, U.S. sales for Ford have risen 6.6% to 1,834,492. Sales of its workhorse F-Series were up 11.4% to 688,510. Necessity is the mother of invention.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":" Huawei just confirmed November 25 as the official launch date for its Mate 80 series, and the company isn\u2019t holding back. Four distinct models, each with its own camera architecture and design identity. The standout? A flagship variant packing 20GB of RAM and an octagon-shaped camera module that breaks from the circular designs dominating the smartphone industry. Designer: Huawei This is Huawei\u2019s play for design differentiation in a market where most flagship phones look nearly identical from the back. The Mate 80 lineup spans from the accessible base model through to the RS Ultimate Design, a halo product that signals where Huawei sees premium smartphone design heading. The Mate 80 and Mate 80 Pro share a circular rear camera module housing three sensors, including a periscope telephoto lens. Both phones feature dual front cameras with 3D face unlock technology. It\u2019s a refined, approachable design that builds on Huawei\u2019s established camera bump aesthetic.       The Mate 80 Pro Max steps up with a quad-camera system that includes dual periscope telephoto lenses. That\u2019s two dedicated telephoto sensors for optical zoom flexibility, a configuration that gives photographers multiple focal length options without digital cropping. Dual front cameras maintain consistency across the upper-tier models. Then there\u2019s the Mate 80 RS Ultimate Design. The octagon-shaped camera module is the immediate visual differentiator, a geometric departure that catches attention without feeling gimmicky. It houses four rear sensors and pairs with dual front cameras, but the design statement is what matters here. Huawei is using the RS Ultimate to establish a distinct visual identity for its most premium offering. Huawei assigned different color families to each tier, reinforcing the hierarchy through material and finish choices. The Mate 80 and Mate 80 Pro come in Dawn Gold, Obsidian Black, Snowy White, and Spruce Green. These are accessible, versatile colorways that work across different user preferences without pushing too far into statement territory.  The Mate 80 Pro Max gets Polar Night Black, Polar Silver, Polar Day Gold, and Aurora Blue. The naming convention evokes extreme environments and natural phenomena, positioning this model as the performance flagship with colors that suggest technical capability. The RS Ultimate Design narrows to three options: Dark Black, Pure White, and Hibiscus. That last color, Hibiscus, has generated notable attention in early discussions. It\u2019s a bold, design-forward choice that signals this phone is as much about aesthetic expression as technical specifications. The Mate 80 RS Ultimate Design ships with 20GB of RAM paired with either 512GB or 1TB of storage. That\u2019s the highest RAM configuration in the entire lineup, positioning this model for users running multiple resource-intensive applications simultaneously or future-proofing for increasingly demanding mobile workflows. The base Mate 80 and Mate 80 Pro offer 12GB\/256GB, 12GB\/512GB, and 16GB\/512GB configurations, with the Pro adding a 16GB\/1TB option. The Mate 80 Pro Max comes in 16GB\/512GB and 16GB\/1TB variants. Huawei structured the RAM progression to create clear performance tiers across the lineup.       Huawei opened pre-orders through its Vmall online store ahead of the November 25 launch event. The company is simultaneously unveiling the Mate X7 foldable, positioning the launch as a comprehensive showcase of its flagship smartphone strategy rather than focusing solely on the traditional slab phone format. The dual launch suggests Huawei sees both form factors as equally important to its premium positioning. The Mate 80 series represents refinement and camera innovation within the established smartphone template, while the Mate X7 addresses users prioritizing screen real estate and multitasking flexibility. The Mate 80 lineup shows Huawei using design variation to create meaningful differentiation within a single product family. Most manufacturers rely primarily on camera count and technical specifications to separate models. Huawei added visual language shifts, particularly with the RS Ultimate\u2019s octagon module, to make the hierarchy immediately apparent. The dual periscope telephoto system in the Pro Max addresses a real pain point for mobile photographers: the gap between primary wide and telephoto focal lengths. Two periscope lenses allow for more granular zoom options and better image quality across the telephoto range. Whether these design choices translate into market success remains to be seen when the phones launch November 25. But Huawei is clearly betting that distinctive design, aggressive RAM configurations, and advanced camera architectures can carve out space in the competitive flagship smartphone market.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"When it comes to travel chargers that charge all of your gear (sans a laptop), I\u2019ve tried a ton over the years, and most have some kind of downside with either size or power. The ESR CryoBoost Foldable 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station might finally be the one that solves all of my charging annoyances without any real drawbacks that I can see. It\u2019s compact enough to toss in a crossbody, delivers 25W Qi2.2 fast charging with active cooling, and charges your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time. If you travel often or just want to simplify your daily charging setup, this might be one of the top 3-in-1 chargers on the market.  \t\t\t\t\tUpgrade your home security with wireless cameras that includes HomeKit compatibility.\t\t\t\t MagSafe Monday: Every Monday, Bradley Chambers looks at the latest and greatest in the MagSafe and wireless charging industry to help you get the most out of your Apple devices that support wireless charging. The big win here is the combination of everything you need right in the box. ESR includes a really thick USB-C cable and a 50-watt power adapter. The packaging makes it clear that you\u2019ll want to use the included adapter for full performance. Overall, it\u2019s a solid setup that works perfectly out of the box. The foldable design of the ESR CryoBoost 3-in-1 Charger gives it a ton of flexibility. You can keep it folded and use it as a compact stand for your iPhone on a nightstand or desk, or unfold it to charge your AirPods and Apple Watch all at the same time. I suspect this is why ESR recommends using the included adapter. The hinge feels strong and locks into place nicely, so you can adjust it depending on where you are at (a hotel desk, airplane tray, or kitchen counters). It\u2019s a nice design that fits multiple roles without taking up much space. It\u2019s about as thick as some MagSafe batteries I own, which makes it an easy travel companion. The ESR CryoBoost 3-in-1 Charger is built around Qi2.2 technology, which pushes MagSafe charging up to 25 watts. That means you can take a supported iPhone (iPhone 16 and 17) from zero to around 60% in about half an hour. Wireless chargers can heat up your iPhone over time, which can slow down charging and affect long-term battery health. ESR aims solves that problem with an internal fan that kepe your iPhone cool while it charges. In testing, ESR says it keeps the phone up to 10 degrees cooler than chargers without fans, and that makes a difference in how quickly it tops off your battery. I don\u2019t have lab equipment to measure it, but I\u2019ve dealt with my fair share overheating from MagSafe for years, so any cooling is a win in my book.  \t\t\t\t\tUpgrade your doors with Apple Home Key and the Aqara U50.\t\t\t\t The Apple Watch charger on the back is also worth mentioning. It\u2019s MFW-certified, meaning Apple officially approves it for fast and safe charging. You can expect an Apple Watch Series 10 to charge from 0 to 80% in about 30 minutes. Since the charger is built right into the stand, there\u2019s no extra cable to pack when you travel. The ESR CryoBoost Foldable 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station is one of the best travel chargers I\u2019ve picked up. It hits an awesome balance between compact size and fast charging power. The active cooling means you actually get the full benefit of 25-watt Qi 2.2 charging without your iPhone getting overheated, and the ability to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods from one device makes it an easy thing to keep in your travel bag. I also really appreciate that ESR includes everything in the box: the thick USB-C cable and 50-watt adapter make it ready to go without needing to bring your own cable or adaptor. Whether it\u2019s your daily charging or in a hotel room, this is a thin and flexible charging setup that brings both speed and active cooling.

That is not betrayal, that is basic survival in a place where HR keeps receipts and does not care about Aunt Linda's feelings. I'm all for helping friends and family, the job market is, well, not the best we've seen to say the least. Bur, and this is a big but, family loyalty always sounds nobler when no one mentions the part about fraud.\u00a0 This is a classic \"family first\" myth colliding with corporate reality. At home, family means you look the other way, smooth things over, and in this case, say he just \"rounded up\" his experience. At work, family means absolutely nothing when the numbers and dates do not match. HR does not care that you once shared a trampoline; they care that he lied on paperwork with the company logo on top.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"Here's hoping this employee-boss dispute actually gets played out in court. Imagine having a decently steady job for over three years with benefits including a 401k. After an arduous job search in a difficult market, you think you've found the ideal setup. Sure, things have not been going great for the company as of late, but you seem valued there, and you think that you wouldn't be on the chopping block should layoffs inevitably occur. Then, one day, you check up on the status of the money in your retirement account, and you notice something strange. When you investigate it further, you realize that the money you had been contributing from your paycheck into your 401k had not been going into that account for more than a year. In fact, it turns out that your boss was responsible for taking that reserved money from each paycheck and collecting it for himself. He just assumed you weren't careful enough to notice, but he was wrong. I guess layoffs ended up being the least of this employee's concerns. Now, he's considering legal action to get all that well-earned compensation back into his own account. Like what you see? Follow our WhatsApp channel for more.

{"date":"2025-11-17","content":"By\u00a0         Sarah Boden       Botox has become increasingly popular with people in their 20s seeking to stave off wrinkles.  Clinics market what is known as \"baby Botox,\" lower dose treatments administered less frequently than those for midlife adults \u2014 perhaps only once or twice a year. Patients share the process in online videos filmed from injectors' offices, asking for a touch up to blur away any hint of crows feet or 11 lines between the brows. It may seem absurd that anyone so young would be worried about aging. But like putting on sunscreen, patients say their use of Botox is preventive.  Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A, an injectable neurotoxin derived from the bacterium that causes botulism. Other brand names include Dysport, Xeomin and Jeuveau. When administered in small amounts, the treatments block the nerve signals to the muscle causing it to relax, thereby temporarily reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Attorney Stephanie Moore started getting Dysport when she was 27 to slow the formation of wrinkles around her eyes, which she attributes to her expressive face.  She pays about $460 per visit, and says these thrice-yearly injections are one of her favorite ways to treat herself: \"I feel a lot more confident.\" There aren't comprehensive stats on what age groups are getting Botox, but data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons shows that between 2019 and 2022, the use of injectable neurotoxins grew by more than 70% across all age groups under 70, including Gen Z adults. It is not approved for use in minors, so the youngest someone can get Botox is 18. Demand for other types of aesthetic procedures and surgeries, including cheek implants and fillers, has also jumped since the COVID-19 pandemic. This timing is no coincidence says sociologist Dana Berkowitz, author of the book Botox Nation: Changing The Face of America. During the pandemic, people's lives migrated to virtual spaces. That included younger people who had this experience at a formative age. They attended high school or college on Zoom during the day, and then logged onto TikTok and Instagram for socialization in the evenings. Berkowitz says by looking at curated images of others far more frequently, inevitably, people were comparing those faces to their own. At the same time, Berkowitz says some celebrities, along with social media influencers, now openly earn income through endorsements of various cosmetic procedures, further normalizing it. While the 20s seem young for Botox, Dr. Kristy Hamilton, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Houston, says young adults can start to show signs of aging \u2014 a lot of it comes down to genetics and sunscreen. \"Sometimes we see people in their mid-20s that have a lot of wrinkles, and that's just life,\" she says. But what's wrong with having wrinkles? Ageless beauty is seen as a \"status symbol\" in today's society, says Berkowitz. Young women she researched told her these treatments show they were able to invest in themselves at a very early age: \"It was like they were part of this elite kind of social club.\" As Berkowitz explores in her book, falling short of society's definition of feminine beauty can incur a professional tax. \"Our ideal femininity is a youthful one,\" she says. Research shows that people who are perceived as beautiful get better treatment, says David B. Sarwer, who studies the psychological aspects of appearance and cosmetic procedures at Temple University's College of Public Health. Sarwer points to a robust body of literature on how attractiveness can positively influence one's academic performance, professional advancement and legal outcomes. One study even found that newborns who are seen as more attractive by hospital nursing staff get picked up more frequently. \"It may make some, dare I say, strategic sense for people to say, 'I want to find a way to improve the way that I look,'\" he says. Botox was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetic use in 2002. Physicians interviewed for this story note that since then millions have gotten it safely. Reports of dangerous side effects are extremely rare, and typically linked to counterfeit or mishandled Botox. There are still some risks. For one, it can stop working because your body forms a resistance to it. This can be frustrating for patients, says Dr. Paul Durand, a Miami-based board-certified plastic surgeon. He hasn't seen any research explaining why this happens, but theorizes that younger people might be at higher risk because of their more robust immune systems. Another concern is that too much Botox at too high a dose over time can cause excessive atrophy, or shrinking of the muscles. Since we lose volume in our faces as we age anyway, a person's face can start to look hollow instead of youthful. Durand says well-trained clinicians can avoid that result by not overdoing it, i.e. not injecting too deep or using too much of the drug. But assessing a clinician's skill level may be difficult for patients.  Any medical doctor, regardless of specialty, can legally administer cosmetic injections without any special training or certification. That includes dentists. Durand and Hamilton both recommend going to a plastic surgeon or dermatologist's office. Though Berkowitz says there are skilled injectors outside these specialties. She recommends that a Botox-curious patient ask friends or family for a referral. Most people who get cosmetic procedures say they're happy with the outcome. Sarwer says the patients who are most satisfied are seeking to address discontent with a specific feature \u2014 like Moore's desire to soften the lines around her eyes. But the evidence on how these procedures improve self esteem and quality of life are inconclusive, Sarwer says. When cosmetic patients chase an unattainable ideal of beauty due to a mental health condition like body dysmorphic disorder or severe depression, Sarwer says Botox and other procedures don't improve their symptoms.  He explains these patients are, \"better treated by a mental health professional than they would be treated by a plastic surgeon.\" Durand turns away patients who want so much Botox that it would essentially freeze their face, blocking their ability to form expressions. \"That looks terrible,\" he says.  But in his experience, a determined enough person will eventually find a clinician to say \"yes,\" given that administering Botox can be a lucrative revenue stream with relatively few overhead costs. Not only do clinician training and skill levels vary, so do prices. Discount treatments are unlikely to yield desired results, as Berkowitz warns. Amateur Botox can result in an obviously treated face. And there's another problem: Once patients start with Botox or a similar injectable, they're unlikely to stop, says Berkowitz: \"You get people in their 20s, you have a lifelong consumer.\" Berkowitz herself is one of those lifelong consumers: She started getting Botox at 32 and now at 47, needs higher doses, paying about $800 per appointment. For someone who starts young, that money \u2014 which could add up to tens of thousands of dollars in your 20s and 30s \u2014 could be spent paying off student loans, investing for their future, or traveling the world. If you stop getting the injections, the effects wear off and wrinkles reappear. In this way, Botox is addictive, argues Berkowitz, who admits that getting it feels in conflict with her feminist ethics, which aim to decenter appearance. But Hamilton, the Houston plastic surgeon, says for many of her young patients, Botox is simply part of their overall investment in their health and appearance.  \"Gen Z have this very different view on these things,\" she says. \"This is part of their self-care. It's part of their wellness.\" Stephanie Moore in Pittsburgh, says shaping her appearance with Botox makes her happy. She notes that her husband has tattoos, which she thinks are unnecessary and expensive. \"But that's his body and his choice,\" she says. \"And this is my body and my choice.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
