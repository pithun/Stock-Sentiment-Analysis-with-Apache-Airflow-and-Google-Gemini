{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"                 Reading time 2 minutes        The price of bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000 on Tuesday, a shocking plunge from the cryptocurrency\u2019s all-time-high of over $126,000 on Oct. 6. The world\u2019s best known crypto hasn\u2019t been priced below $100,000 since May. Bitcoin dipped to $99,966, according to CNBC, before recovering above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin is down 7% on the day and 13% on the week, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto enthusiasts point to a similar slide in tech stocks this week, as traders worry they could be overvalued, according to Bloomberg. Despite claims from the crypto community that digital money offers an exciting new world divorced from the constraints of fiat currency, the price of bitcoin often mirrors moves in the stock market. Palantir\u2019s stock price is down 8% on the day despite posting another quarter of record revenue on Monday, and Nvidia is down over 3%. Michael Burry, the investor who famously predicted the housing market crash in 2008, disclosed recent bets against Palantir and Nvidia, which has rattled people who are already nervous about the potential for an AI bubble to burst. Tech companies have invested billions in artificial intelligence but generative AI hasn\u2019t produced the kind of productivity gains or revenue to justify that investment. At least not yet. There\u2019s also nervousness about signals from the Federal Reserve that it might not cut interest rates again next month after a rate cut last week. One of the things confusing matters at the moment is that policy makers don\u2019t have a clear picture of the jobs market. The September jobs report was delayed and while the October jobs report is scheduled for this coming Friday, there\u2019s uncertainty about how accurate the data will be. The Fed has been leaning more heavily on private data from payroll company ADP, which shows a slowdown in hiring. But it remains to be seen just how bad the employment picture might be. President Donald Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, in August because he didn\u2019t like the numbers that were produced. Trump baselessly called the numbers \u201crigged.\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell referred to the the confusion over the numbers as a data \u201cfog\u201d when announcing the rate cut last week. \u201cWhat do you do if you\u2019re driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d Powell said, according to Axios. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to play into things. [\u2026] But there\u2019s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving.\u201d Other top cryptocurrencies also struggled Tuesday, with Ether down 9% to $3,300 and XRP down 6% to $2.20. BNB, the fourth most popular cryptocurrency, is trading down over 6% and Solana is down almost 7%. TRON is down 1% and Dogecoin is down 5%.

Fed chair Jerome Powell made some on Wall Street uneasy when he signaled that another rate cut was no guarantee when the Fed meets again.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp is famous for being a little much, but he just outdid himself in Palantir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nov. 3 letter to shareholders, and on an earnings call the same day. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excerpt from this document intended for people who are checking in on what the company is doing with their investment dollars: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should, indeed must, return to a shared national experience\u00e2\u0080\u0094an embrace of common identity that by definition puts forward certain ideas, values, culture, and ways of living at the exclusion of others [\u00e2\u0080\u00a6]It is and was a mistake to casually proclaim the equality of all cultures and cultural values.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the earnings call accompanying the letter, Karp added for good measure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe power ICE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also claimed that he makes \u201csure Palantir stays as tribal and cultish and unique as it was 20 years ago\u201d by only hiring \u201cthe right people.\u201d When he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not decrying \u00e2\u0080\u009cvacant and neutered and hollow pluralism\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his shareholder letter, Karp writes about all the freshly created value Palantir produced last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0094$1.18 billion in sales for a 63% year-over-year gain. As raw numbers, those are impressive, but, quick question: does the letter itself perhaps come from the mind of a CEO who has the same mental pathology as that guy from a viral video who sat on a plane in the pro-Trump shirt smirking and nodding at everyone who walked past him? Palantir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cascent has confounded most financial analysts and the chattering class, whose frames of reference did not quite anticipate a company of this size and scale growing at such a ferocious and unrelenting rate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Karp wrote, adding that his company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cdetractors have been left in a kind of deranged and self-destructive befuddlement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yes, Palantir was once smeared by never-wrong market genius Jim Cramer as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeme stock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The stock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popularity also troubled some skeptical shareholders around this time last year because it seemed like a militaristic, AI-centric data firm co-founded by Peter Thiel may have only been spiking because Donald Trump had just been elected again. For instance, Bloomberg noted at the time that Joseph Bonner of Argus Research moved Palantir from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy\u00e2\u0080\u009d column to \u00e2\u0080\u009chold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that Bonner said the stock price was \u00e2\u0080\u009cgetting ahead of what the company fundamentals can support.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The stock has been on its way to the moon ever since, and revenue has been solid. Bonner must feel so silly. But to say the haters are \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfounded\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a bit of a stretch. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at what Palantir is: Akshay Krishnaswamy, Palantir\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief architect for commercial business, gave this account three years ago: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were founded in 2003 with the mission of building data-driven operations and decision-making software. We got our start in intelligence and defense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to the Palantir website, its military platform, Gotham, \u00e2\u0080\u009csupports soldiers with an AI-powered kill chain, seamlessly and responsibly integrating target identification and target effector pairing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Palantir explaining what Palantir is, not anyone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion. For context, however, AI is the main area of the economy currently driving growth, and tech companies are on an AI spending spree while Palantir markets AI products for business. The Pentagon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget has never been higher, nor has the budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and meanwhile Palantir has a reputation for seeking ways to bring more technology to battlefield carnage and help the Trump Administration conduct operations to, among other things, boot asylum seekers. Point being, I sort of doubt even Joseph Bonner of Argus Research is \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfounded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even though he whiffed on his Palantir stock tip a year ago. The haters who bother Karp so much seem to be observing that, yes, Palantir certainly gives off the impression of a money-printing machine in the current business environment, and they\u2019re pointing out that there might be some roiling undercurrent of risk investors might not want to take on. Anyone who still believes in that risk might focus on this less manic, but still strange passage from the letter: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has indeed been difficult for outsiders to appraise our business, either its significance in shaping our current geopolitics or its value in the vulgar, financial sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It strikes me as odd for Karp to write in a shareholder letter that the real significance of Palantir is that it shapes global politics, and that generating financial value is some kind of \u00e2\u0080\u009cvulgar\u00e2\u0080\u009d afterthought. A statement like that reads like a right-wing version of that woke interference in capitalism stuff that Donald Trump hates so much. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no financial analyst\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take even informal investment advice from me\u00e2\u0080\u0094but maybe Palantir stock should be in the \u00e2\u0080\u009chold\u00e2\u0080\u009d column after all.

Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Google made some major changes with the Pixel 10 series, and it seems that all that hard work has paid off, as the Pixel 10 lineup has seemingly become a hit among U.S. customers. A report from Counterpoint shows that Pixel sales in the U.S. grew significantly year over year, jumping 28% in September 2025 compared to the same month the previous year (via WCCFTech). This is a major win for Google, especially in a market where customers tend to hold onto their devices longer. The report even notes this as a \"single-month sales record for the OEM.\" Pixel sales in the U.S. have also been growing steadily over the past few years. According to the report, Google's share in the $600+ smartphone market rose from just 0.1% in September 2022 to 7% in September 2025. And even though 7% may not sound huge compared to Apple and Samsung, it represents nearly 70 times growth in just three years, which is massive.      Similar trends were seen across major U.S. carriers. At T-Mobile, Google's share grew from 0.1% to 6.5% between September 2022 and September 2025. Verizon saw an even bigger jump from 0.1% to 7%, while AT&T showed slower growth, rising from 0.1% to just 2.3%. Interestingly, the growth Google is enjoying doesn't appear to come at Apple's expense \u2014 the brand it often targets in ads \u2014 but rather at Samsung's. Apple increased its sales share from 72% to 80% in the $600+ smartphone market over the past three years, while Samsung declined from 26% to just 12% in September 2025 compared to September 2022. Google has been investing heavily in the Pixel lineup, adding new AI features, improving hardware, and running consistent marketing campaigns, and it's finally paying off.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        Michael Burry, the investor who is famous for predicting the 2008 housing market crash and was portrayed by Christian Bale in the Oscar-winning movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d has a new bubble prediction. This time, it\u2019s AI. Burry\u2019s hedge fund Scion Asset Management disclosed put options on Nvidia, and an even larger one on Palantir, according to regulatory filings from Sept. 30 that were released on Monday. Both companies are considered AI darlings, and their stocks have been buoyed high on the tails of the AI trade. Nvidia is the only company in the world to be worth more than $5 trillion. Palantir\u2019s stock was up 150% this year. Palantir CEO Alex Karp was visibly unhappy about Burry\u2019s decision. \u201cI do think this behavior is egregious and I\u2019m going to be dancing around when it\u2019s proven wrong,\u201d Karp told CNBC on Tuesday morning. Days before his positions were disclosed, Burry posted and still has pinned a rather cryptic X post showing a photo of Christian Bale portraying him in \u201cThe Big Short\u201d movie, along with text that says \u201cSometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\u201d Then on Monday, Burry posted four more images with no context to his X profile. One of them was depicting declining year over year growth in the cloud segments of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in 2023 to 2025 versus 2018 to 2022. All three of those companies dominate the market as top cloud providers. Another chart was titled \u201cU.S. tech capex growth is matching the tech bubble of 1999-2000.\u201d Other experts have also warned of similarities between the current state of the AI market and the 1999 dot-com bubble, which burst in 2000 and evaporated around five trillion dollars in market value. Every other company\u2019s earnings report nowadays mentions the word \u201cAI,\u201d in a striking parallel to the way every company in the early 2000s would plaster \u201c.com\u201d to delight investors, which has started to worry some skeptics that stock prices may have become detached from actual earnings. Earlier this year, Apollo Global Management\u2019s influential chief economist Torsten Slok said that the only difference between the dot-com bubble and the \u201cAI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s.\u201d More recently, the Bank of England also warned that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble. The third photo in Burry\u2019s X post was a Bloomberg diagram showing the circular dealmaking by top AI companies, with Nvidia in the center of the trade. The circular dealmaking concerns have been getting more attention in recent months, especially as AI darlings Nvidia and OpenAI continue to announce deal after deal worth billions. The AI industry has increasingly become a tangled web of multibillion-dollar investments, rapidly expanding inwards as a handful of tech giants with overlapping interests ink partnerships with each other. These circular investments inject more money into the system and prop up not just the market but the entire U.S. economy. So, if all goes according to plan, they can continue to build economic growth. But if even one cog is faulty, and breakthroughs slow down or demand doesn\u2019t pan out as expected, it could create a domino effect that can take the whole system down. In a final post, Burry posted a page from a book called \u201cCapital Account.\u201d He had highlighted two segments describing the telecommunications crash, which followed the dot-com bubble burst: \u201cBy 2002, it was commonly reported that less than 5 percent of US telecoms capacity was in use. Thousands of miles of expensive fibre optic networks remained \u2018unlit\u2019 beneath the ground,\u201d and \u201cWholesale telecoms prices fell by more 70 percent a year in 2001 and 2002. Many of the companies which not long before had been valued at huge premiums to their invested capital, now sought protection from creditors.\u201d It\u2019s not out of bounds to say that Burry is drawing a parallel between the current AI-driven state of the stock market and the financially turbulent times of the early 2000s. The investors of the 2000s weren\u2019t completely incorrect on the potential of the internet. The internet did turn out to completely change society and our everyday lives, and the demand for the fibre optic networks did eventually arrive. But investor enthusiasm overestimated just how fast and large these companies could deliver on the hype. Fed researchers issued a similar (though much less bubble-certain) warning earlier this year, pointing out the risk that comes with building expensive infrastructure too quickly for anticipated demand. If the demand doesn\u2019t scale as expected, the Fed researchers wrote, it could lead to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisastrous consequences,\u00e2\u0080\u009d much like the railroad over-expansion of the 1800s that led to an economic depression towards the turn of the century.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"If you've only heard of Tile and AirTags, you're missing out.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.       Join Namerah Saud Fatmi as she explores the cool, quirky, and sometimes downright odd world of smartphone accessories, gadgets, and other nerdy toys every week. Until 2024, Bluetooth trackers were only compatible with either Google's or Apple's Find My Device network. However, a new range of universal trackers is now widely available, allowing users to pair them with both Android and iOS devices. Tile, Chipolo, and Pebblebee are at the forefront of this innovation. While Tile by Life360 is more widely known, you may or may not be as familiar with the latter names. I'm here to tell you that both Chipolo and Pebblebee have amazing trackers. Today, I'll be focusing on universal trackers that are rechargeable and how they perform compared to Tile by Life360 trackers, which set the industry standard. Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Bluetooth trackers come in a few form factors. The most popular shape is a circular chip, featuring a hole or loop that allows for attachment to a key ring. Since they're so small and lightweight, you can even attach them to pet collars, though most brands don't advertise them as such for legal reasons. Chipolo's keychain attachment is called the LOOP, whereas Pebblebee's take on it is called the Clip. They compete directly with the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024). I use all of these brands regularly and can say that their loudness levels are more or less the same, which is why I did not mention volume levels in my comparison. Category Chipolo LOOP (2025) Pebblebee Clip Universal (2024) Tile by Life360 Pro (2024) Range 400ft \/ 120m 500ft \/ 150m 500ft \/ 150m Water and dust resistance IP65 IPX6 IP68 Battery 6 months, rechargeable via USB-C 1 year, rechargeable via USB-C 1 year, replaceable CR2032 cell Dimensions \u00a040 x 57 x 8 mm 45 x 38 x 8.50 mm 59 x 34 x 7.7 mm Price $39 $34.99 $34.99 The Chipolo LOOP has a superior IP rating compared to the Pebblebee Clip Universal, but it's also more expensive. Other than that, Pebblebee has the upper hand in this arena. Both charge via USB-C, but Chipolo lasts for six months on a single charge, whereas Pebblebee delivers twice as much \u2014 a whole year. Pebblebee also has a better Bluetooth range, 500 feet, as opposed to Chipolo's 400-foot range. Meanwhile, the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024) costs the same as Pebblebee's Clip and has the same range, but it has a far more heavy-duty IP68 water and dust-proof rating. Although the Tile Pro lasts for a year too, it doesn't recharge. Instead, you need to replace the CR2032 battery when it dies. The second most commonly preferred type of Bluetooth tracker is a wallet tracker. These are shaped like credit cards and can be just as slim, depending on which brand you buy from. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Chipolo's CARD stands out because not only is it rechargeable, but it features magnetic Qi wireless charging (not Qi2, just plain old Qi). I interviewed the company's co-founder and CDO about this clever contraption in detail, which you can read here if you're interested. Category Chipolo CARD (2025) Pebblebee Card Universal (2024) Tile by Life360 Slim (2024) Range 400ft \/ 120m 500ft \/ 150m 350ft \/ 100m Water and dust resistance IP65 IPX6 IP68 Battery 6 months, rechargeable via Qi wireless charging 1.5 years, rechargeable via proprietary magnetic USB-C cable 3 years, non-replaceable Dimensions 85.2 x 53.6 x 2.5 mm 96 x 106 x 14 mm 85.4 x 53.9 x 2.5 mm Price $39 $34.99 $29.98 It's so disappointing to see that Tile couldn't figure out a way to make its card-shaped tracker rechargeable. It'll need to be disposed of after three years, meaning you'll end up buying another one and spending far more money in the long run. Pebblebee's Card is rechargeable, but you need to use a special magnetic charging cable with a Type-C port on one end. If you lose the cable, you're done for. Meanwhile, Chipolo's pricier CARD recharges via any Qi, Qi2, or MagSafe wireless charger. It's awesome because it's so versatile and not proprietary, so you don't have to worry about losing the cable. Despite this, it's just as thin as the Tile Slim! Setting up the universal trackers from Chipolo and Pebblebee is incredibly quick and easy, thanks to Google Fast Pair and Find Hub. Before you have time to process what's happening, everything sets up. You don't even need the dedicated brands' apps on your phone. Both Chipolo and Pebblebee's universal trackers are added to the Google Find Hub, and you can manage them from there. All three brands' trackers can be used as is without purchasing a monthly subscription; however, you may not be able to make the most of them at times. Life360 offers a free membership tier, but to enjoy the best features of your Tile tracker, such as live location sharing, you must be on a paid plan for $14.99\/month or $24.99\/month. Chipolo has no premium plans, but Pebblebee has an Alert Live subscription that costs just $2.99\/month or $24.99\/year for live GPS location updates and alerts. If you're willing to pay a premium for more than just Bluetooth tracking, Pebblebee's plan is worth the splurge.      When buying a Bluetooth tracker intended for use on a keychain, I'd say it depends on where you live. If you're in a tropical region subject to constant rainfall, it's probably best to opt for something with robust waterproofing. This would give Tile by Life360 the edge over the rest, but the Tile Pro's replaceable cell is cumbersome. I recommend getting the Pebblebee Clip Universal instead. It's the whole package for the cheapest price among the three. You get IPX6 water resistance, a USB-C cable for charging, and a year-long battery life. I myself use the Clip on my car key fob. Pebblebee includes a sturdy key ring, which is a nice bonus. When it comes to wallet trackers, the Chipolo CARD is the reigning champion. Tile's entry doesn't even recharge; you'll have to toss it after three years, creating e-waste. Meanwhile, the Chipolo CARD recharges wirelessly, so you don't have to worry about having your proprietary cable around like the Pebblebee Card requires. For about $4 more, you get magnetic Qi wireless charging and a vastly superior IP rating, so it's the one you should pick.       Recharge it wirelessly The Chipolo CARD has a 400ft Bluetooth range, uses magnetic Qi wireless charging, and features a robust IP65 rating. It's a slim card-shaped tracker that fits in wallets and narrow spaces easily.       Hang it anywhere The Pebblebee Clip Universal comes with a charging cable and a nice metal key ring. It only has an IPX6 waterproof rating, so you need to be careful with dust. However, its size, loudness, and range are spectacular. They are \"universal\" because they are compatible with both Google's Find My Device network (for Android) and Apple's Find My network (for iOS), allowing users to track their items regardless of which mobile operating system they use. Unlike some competitors, both Chipolo and Pebblebee offer rechargeable trackers. The clip-style trackers (Chipolo LOOP and Pebblebee Clip) charge via USB-C, while the Chipolo CARD uses magnetic Qi wireless charging, and the Pebblebee Card requires a proprietary magnetic USB-C cable. The Chipolo CARD is generally considered the superior option for wallets. It's significantly thinner (2.5 mm) compared to the Pebblebee Card (14 mm) and offers the versatility of magnetic Qi wireless charging, meaning you don't have to worry about losing a proprietary cable. While the trackers can be used without a subscription, some advanced features may require a monthly fee. Namerah enjoys geeking out over accessories, gadgets, and all sorts of smart tech.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":" by Michele Russo, Sophia Prix, Jonas Goergen and Emanuel de Bellis A decade ago, Samsung\u2019s Family Hub Refrigerator became the poster child of the smart home revolution. It was marketed as \u201cthe smart way to manage food,\u201d and it was a success. But today, as the smart product market matures, selling \u201csmartness\u201d alone isn\u2019t enough. Indeed, while the smart home products industry is currently projected to reach $537 billion by 2030, three out of four projects in the space, by some estimates, still fail to deliver expected value.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"                 Reading time 3 minutes        A deadly outbreak of listeria tied to precooked pasta meals has gotten more grim. At least two more people have died from the bacterial disease over the past month, while several more have been hospitalized. Federal health agencies provided the newest update on the outbreak late last week. In total, there have been six linked deaths and 25 hospitalizations across 18 states. Numerous pasta brands sold in chains nationwide have already been recalled, including those sold at Trader Joe\u2019s and Walmart, though it\u2019s possible there are still more contaminated foods yet to be identified, officials say. \u201cPublic health investigators continue to gather information on what ill people ate before getting sick to determine if additional products are linked to the outbreak,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its update released on October 30. Health officials first reported the outbreak in June, though the earliest cases seem to date back to August 2024. Though cases were initially linked to a single brand of ready-to-eat pasta meals, by early October, it became clear that the outbreak affected multiple products sold at stores across the country. The ultimate source of these cases appears to be Nate\u2019s Fine Foods, Inc., a wide-spanning supplier of pasta to retailers (though not directly to customers). Since the CDC\u2019s previous tally in late September, there have been seven new cases in three states identified, along with two deaths. Yet the true toll of the outbreak is almost certainly larger than reported, since some people will recover without ever seeing a doctor. It also can take up to four weeks for officials to identify whether someone\u2019s illness is connected to the same strain of listeria, further delaying the recognition of cases (the latest reported case was on October 16). Even More Pasta Just Got Recalled in That Deadly Listera Outbreak The symptoms of listeria tend to take around two weeks to appear following exposure. They include fever, muscle aches, nausea, tiredness, vomiting, and diarrhea; people with a more severe infection can also experience headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. As is often true with foodborne germs, listeria infections are more dangerous for people with weakened immune systems, the elderly, newborns, and pregnant women. Tragically, at least one woman during this outbreak is thought to have lost her pregnancy as a result of her illness. Since early October, several more retailers supplied by Nate\u2019s Fine Foods have issued recalls over their potentially tainted pasta products. Giant Eagle announced a\u00c2\u00a0voluntary recall of its \u00e2\u0080\u009cSmoked Mozzarella Pasta Salad\u00e2\u0080\u009d sold in the prepared foods departments of its Giant Eagle and Market District locations across western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and Indiana. And Sprouts Farmers Market announced a voluntary recall of select lots of smoked mozzarella pasta salad sold from the deli service counter or Grab & Go section at Sprouts stores in 24 states; these products were sold between August 21 and October 7 of this year. These products are in addition to the recent recall of Scott & Jon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shrimp Scampi with Linguini Pasta Bowls (9.6 oz), which affected products with these best-by dates: 3\/12\/2027, 3\/13\/2027, 3\/17\/2027, and 3\/21\/2027. The list of previously recalled products, broken down by retailers, can be seen below. Trader Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo Best-by dates: Albertson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pasta salads supplied by Nate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fine Foods have also been\u00c2\u00a0recalled. The full list of grocery stores where the Albertson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pasta products have been sold: Consumers with further questions about the recalled products can contact Nate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fine Foods at 916-677-7303 between noon and 7 p.m. ET (9 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time on the West Coast), Monday through Friday.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lindsay Mustain, a former Amazon recruiter in her 40s who lives in Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity. Before I started my career coaching business in 2017, I was a recruiter. From 2016 to 2017, I worked at Amazon, where I sourced top talent and performers globally. Anybody who tells you that the labor market is booming isn't telling the truth. I consider this the toughest job market I've ever seen for the average job seeker. Companies aren't overhiring like they used to; they're doing precise hiring. That means candidates have a responsibility to clearly demonstrate how they'll either save or make a company money. There are a lot of other things that are playing into what's causing the current job market crisis, too, like generative AI. At Amazon, I recruited top talent \u2014 what I call \"top 1% talent.\" They approached job searching in a very different way from the average job seeker. It's the same process that I teach my clients now; I call it intentional career design. Many job seekers come with what they feel is a very well-prepared package, but they might not have a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because it's telling, rather than showing, impact. It's not their fault, because they've been taught to present their skills in line with the job description. To increase your chances of landing the job you want, there are three steps to follow. For every $100,000 you want to make, you need to have at least seven figures of impact on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I say \"at least\" because right now, the more, the better. This could include revenue growth, an increase in reputation, reach, or profit margins, or risk reduction. It doesn't matter what job you do, whether it's a support role or if you're on the executive team. You need to demonstrate how you help a company save or make money. A company will hire someone when there is a reason for it \u2014 meaning a business case with an expected commercial benefit for the company. Your seven-figure signature needs to be aligned with what's happening. The job market is in flux, so if you're marketing a skillset that's becoming antiquated, that's a problem; you're not competing in the current labor market. The second step is then what I call \"Me Inc.\" marketing materials. I run \"Lindsay Inc.,\" and you run \"You Inc.\" That means the tools we use to market our business need to be on point. Your marketing materials need to show proof, impact, and quantifiable results \u2014 not just responsibilities. When it comes to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you've got about six seconds to make an impression. Recruiters often look at your LinkedIn profile before giving you an interview, so your profile needs to model the same story as your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but with a few other features, like a profile picture. People talk about the bias that it brings, but a profile photo on your LinkedIn page drives more views. Humans quickly interpret profile photos and make unconscious decisions, often influenced by some biases. You want to use that bias to frame yourself as warm, welcoming, competent, influential, or likable. Another thing that really matters is your headline, both for your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and your LinkedIn. Make sure your headline classifies what you do \u2014 the level, the scope, the impact. It should also have some sort of secret sauce, something that you do that's uniquely you, as part of the candidate differentiation strategy. Just like a news headline should hook the reader's attention and make them want to read more, your LinkedIn headline should try to get them to go past the fold and scroll down on the page. Your LinkedIn summary should show that seven-figure signature. It should help potential employers understand in just a few seconds that you're somebody worth spending at least 30 minutes with on the phone. Next is the candidate choice framework, which is about visibility and understanding the hidden job market. How can you increase the visibility of your LinkedIn profile to recruiters and attract more views? You engage on LinkedIn. Engaging strategically with the right information is a key part of being a top 1% talent. You should be sharing, commenting, and building your network immediately. It's so important to increase your influence, visibility, and perceived authority because recruiters aren't waiting for you to find our job openings and apply. When I was a recruiter, I went through the fair consideration process, but generally, before a job got approved for the budget, I was already sourcing candidates and talking to people to make my shortlist of who I wanted to interview first. The truth is, the hidden job market is not as hidden as it seems. It lives in conversations and relationships. It could be a friend of a friend of a friend, your neighbor's cousin, or a LinkedIn connection you made after commenting something thoughtful. Every person you meet is somebody you want to build a relationship with, because they're all ways into that hidden job market. Don't just come up and say, \"Hey, can you get me a job?\" Build a relationship and let that open doors because you're so clear about expressing what you do that people think, We'd be so lucky if we even got a chance to interview them.

Starbucks' China business is getting a big jolt with a new majority owner. The Seattle-based coffee chain announced on Monday that it would sell a large part of its China business to private equity firm Boyu Capital. In a deal valued at $4 billion, Boyu is acquiring 60% of Starbucks China's business, with plans to close in the first three months of the year, per a press release. The release said that the Boyu partnership would help elevate Starbucks' customer experience in China and speed expansion into new cities. In an open letter on Monday, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said that through the Boyu partnership, he aims for Starbucks to grow from 8,000 stores in China to over 20,000.  Starbucks' stock was flat in after-hours trading, and it's down more than 16% in the last year. Boyu, which has offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Singapore, oversees a portfolio of retail heavyweights, including Alibaba Group and Chinese retail tech company Meituan. It also has a stake in battery manufacturer CATL, which makes batteries for electric vehicles like Tesla. One of the firm's cofounders, Alvin Jiang, is the grandson of China's former leader, Jiang Zemin. In response to a request for comment, a representative of Starbucks China directed Business Insider to Niccol's open letter about the sale. Representatives for Boyu Capital did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The Boyu sale comes at a critical point for Starbucks China. The country is Starbucks' second-largest market after the US. In the latest quarter, China's $831 million in sales made up about 8.7% of the chain's total sales globally. But it has posted several quarters of weak sales in the country. Starbucks' same-store sales in China fell 11% in the second quarter of 2024 and only turned positive in the latest quarter, with a 2% increase. The chain's problems in China include increasingly price-sensitive customers and the emergence of budget coffee chains like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee. Niccol spoke about Starbucks' challenges in China during an October 2024 earnings call, shortly after he became the company's CEO. \"All indications show me the competitive environment is extreme, the macro environment is tough, and we need to figure out how we grow in the market now and into the future,\" he said. Jason Yu, the managing director of China-based CTR Market Research, told Business Insider in September that the partial sale of Starbucks' China business would inject capital and aid the chain with resources like real estate and local supply chain partners. \"I think it is quite encouraging to see that they are actually turning around their business,\" Yu said in September.

Most people can\u2019t justify spending over $3,000 on a laptop, even if they desperately need a bigger screen for spreadsheets, video calls and multitasking across multiple windows. These premium business machines usually stay out of reach, reserved for corporate budgets and lucky pros with generous tech allowances. Amazon just changed the game by slashing this HP 17-inch powerhouse from $3,599 down to $1,029, delivering a 71% discount that feels like Christmas arrived months early. This deal moves a laptop packed with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD into territory where most people can actually afford it without maxing out credit cards. See at Amazon The AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor in this machine cranks up to 4.3GHz across six cores, giving you enough processing muscle to handle demanding spreadsheets, multiple browser tabs, and video streaming all at the same time. Those six cores split workloads intelligently, dedicating processing power where you need it most while managing background tasks efficiently. Integrated Radeon Graphics handle everything from PowerPoint presentations to casual gaming and video editing without the need for a dedicated graphics card, which would ramp up the price further. The 17.3-inch HD+ touchscreen boasts 1600\u00d7900 resolution for significantly more workspace than you\u2019d get from the standard 15-inch laptops that make you constantly switch between windows. This additional screen real estate revolutionizes the way you\u2019re working with documents and spreadsheets, letting you see two pages side by side or keep reference materials visible while you draft emails. An anti-glare coating reduces eye strain while working long hours under office lights or near windows, and touch functionality lets you navigate with natural gestures like pinching to zoom and swiping between apps. You can tap your way through presentations during meetings or scroll through research papers with your finger, and interactions will feel more intuitive than reaching for a trackpad all the time. The webcam of the HP True Vision 720p camera has a physical privacy shutter that slides shut when one wants guaranteed off-camera status without paranoia about whether video software actually went off. AI Noise Reduction filters background chatter in coffee shops, keyboard typing sounds, and ambient noise that normally ruins video calls to make your voice clear and professional. HP Fast Charge technology pushes the battery to 50% capacity in about 45 minutes, which means a quick charging session between classes or meetings gives you hours of untethered productivity. Under optimum conditions, the battery delivers upwards of nine hours of video playback to cover a full workday of up to long study sessions without hunting for outlets. A dedicated Copilot key launches Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant instantaneously for drafting emails, summarizing documents, and generating quick answers to research questions. Windows 11 Pro adds in some enterprise features not found in the home edition, such as BitLocker encryption and Remote Desktop, and advanced security tools to safeguard sensitive work files. For $1,029, you\u2019re getting specifications that would normally see you paying upwards of triple the asking price. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

Laptops with serious power usually carry a price tag equal to a small fortune. You know how it goes: you look at the specs you actually need, check the price, and immediately start compromising. Maybe you don\u2019t really need that much storage, right? Well, HP just threw an early Black Friday sale on Amazon that changes the game completely. This 17.3-inch laptop comes with 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor-basically the kind of setup that normally runs close to $4,000. The good new is that right now, it\u2019s sitting at $1,199 after a 70% discount. See at Amazon The 17.3-inch touchscreen gives you breathing room that smaller laptops just can\u2019t match: If you have ever tried to work on a 13-inch screen and felt you were playing Tetris with your windows, you will appreciate the reason size matters in this respect. The HD+ anti-glare panel means you can set up near a window without spending half your day adjusting the angle of the screen so that you can actually see what you\u2019re doing. The touchscreen aspect really does speed things up when scrolling through long documents or just generally navigating about Windows 11 Pro. The Ryzen 5 7430U processor runs 6 cores and 12 threads and hits speeds up to 4.3GHz when you need it. In plain English, this means you can video call your team while updating a presentation with Slack pinging in the background and your music playing without your laptop freezing up or fans screaming like a jet engine. The integrated Radeon Graphics handle streaming and everyday visual tasks without breaking a sweat. It\u2019s not a gaming rig, but it covers everything most people actually do on their computers day in and day out. But here\u2019s where it gets interesting: 64GB of RAM is absurd for most laptops and that is precisely why it\u2019s so great. Most computers ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you into this constant dance of closing programs to free up memory. With 64GB, you just stop thinking about it: Keep your email open all week, run that resource-hungry video editing software, open 50 browser tabs for your research project and the laptop just handles it. The 4TB SSD storage means you are done with that \u201cdelete old files to install new programs\u201d routine. Your whole photo collection from the last decade, work projects, personal files, software and backups can all live on one drive. And SSDs load everything faster than old hard drives so your programs open in seconds instead of you watching that spinning wheel for what feels like forever. In Windows 11 Pro, there is Microsoft Copilot, the AI tool that helps draft emails, summarize long documents, or even brainstorm ideas when you\u2019re stuck. Built-in AI image features let you edit photos without downloading extra software. Windows Hello logs you in via facial recognition which means no more typing passwords every time you open your laptop. At $1,199 for this configuration, you\u2019re getting a laptop that doesn\u2019t force you to choose between the features you want versus the ones you can afford.

You know it: your gaming mouse is what makes\u2026 or breaks your performance. That split-second delay, the cursor skipping across the screen during a flick shot, or buttons that don\u2019t register fast enough-all deal breakers when you\u2019re trying to rank up. The Logitech G502 Hero has been a favorite among serious gamers for years and Amazon just dropped the price from $69 down to $37 as they clear out remaining stock. This 46% discount brings one of the most respected gaming mice down to impulse-buy territory. See at Amazon The Hero 25K sensor tracks with 1:1 accuracy over a range from 100 to 25,600 DPI, which means the cursor goes exactly where you want it without any smoothing, filtering, or acceleration messing with your muscle memory. High DPI settings let you make huge sweeping movements with tiny hand motions, perfect for fast-paced shooters where you need to whip around instantly. Lower DPI gives you pixel-perfect precision for sniping or editing work when you need that surgical control. The adjustable weight system lets you change how the mouse feels in your hand by adding up to five 3.6-gram weights or taking them away. Some gamers like a light mouse to move quickly around, while some like it with more heft for stability and control. You\u2019ll be able to try different weight configurations until you find what feels right for how you grip the mouse and what games you play. The 11 programmable buttons give you instant access to abilities, macros or commands without reaching for your keyboard. Map your most-used actions to thumb buttons, assign weapon switches to side clicks or set up complex macro sequences for MMOs and MOBAs. The onboard memory stores up to five profiles directly on the mouse so your settings follow you to LAN parties, friend\u2019s houses, or tournament setups without needing to reinstall software. The RGB lighting syncs with other Logitech G gear via Lightsync technology and lets you coordinate colors across your whole setup. You can match your team colors, set up reactive lighting that responds to in-game events or just pick colors that look good on your desk. The lighting isn\u2019t just aesthetic either: you can set different colors for different DPI levels so you know at a glance which sensitivity you\u2019re running. The wired connection eliminates any sort of battery anxiety or input lag that a wireless mouse may introduce. You never have to stop mid-game to charge it, never have drops in connection during clutch moments, and never have to deal with added weight from batteries. The braided cable resists tangling and holds up better than its rubber-coated alternatives, which inevitably crack and fray. For $37, this mouse is cheaper than going out to dinner but upgrades a piece of hardware you touch for hours every single day.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Breaking News Intern The financial mind who predicted the biggest market collapse in recent history is playing his hand once again. Michael Burry, the investor and hedge fund manager whose prediction of the 2008 housing market crash inspired the 2015 film The Big Short, has disclosed two put options against tech giants Nvidia and Palantir totaling more than $1 billion. A put option is a bet that speculates about and profits from a company\u2019s share price falling. Filings from the Securities Exchange Commission released on Monday show that Burry\u2019s hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, purchased $187 million and $912 million in bets against Nvidia and Palantir, respectively\u2014as concerns surrounding the true valuations of artificial intelligence companies spark rumors of a potential AI bubble. The decision from Scion marks a second bet against Nvidia by the hedge fund since it disclosed a $98 million put against the company during the first quarter of the year. Nvidia, which became the first company to reach over $5 trillion in market value last week, dropped more than 3 percent on Tuesday as of 3 p.m. EST while Palantir dropped nearly 9 percent. Both the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 also dropped a percentage point on Tuesday. Palantir CEO Alex Karp melted down over Burry\u2019s bets during an interview with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, calling the idea \u201cbats--t crazy.\u201d \u201cThe two companies he\u2019s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\u201d Karp said. \u201cHe\u2019s actually putting a short on AI.\u201d Burry took to X last Thursday to share a cryptic post harkening back to his prediction of the housing bubble nearly two decades ago along with a popular photo of Christian Bale\u2019s portrayal of him in The Big Short.  pic.twitter.com\/K3mnVUzpkj \u201cSometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it,\u201d he said in the post. \u201cSometimes, the only winning move is to not play.\u201d Burry\u2019s X account shows only three other posts, one of which depicts a chart suggesting the AI boom is sustained by partnerships between Nvidia and OpenAI while another post shows a highlighted passage from Edward Chancellor\u2019s book Capital Account. \u201cBy 2002, it was commonly reported that less than 5 per cent of US telecoms capacity was in use,\u201d the highlighted passage reads. \u201cWholesale telecoms prices fell by more 70 per cent a year in 2001 and 2002. Many of the companies which not long before had been valued at huge premiums to their invested capital, now sought protection from creditors.\u201d Burry seems to be hinting that the actual value of AI technology may not be worth the lofty valuations placed on the companies that produce it, warning that a potential market crash may be in the future.

Reviews ethics statement      Apple doesn't market its machines as affordable, but that could be changing.    Apple may release more affordable Mac laptops to compete with Chromebooks and budget-friendly Windows laptops as early as 2026.\u00a0 Bloomberg's Mark Gurman\u00a0reports the company has plans to roll out a machine for \"well under $1,000.\" According to Gurman, the new laptop is already in early production\u00a0under the codename J700. This matches\u00a0earlier rumors that a low-cost MacBook Air was in the pipeline at around $599, which would allow Apple to directly compete with other cheap laptops, including Chromebooks and Windows PCs.\u00a0 A representative for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0 Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. According to the report, costs will be kept down by using a lower-end LCD that's smaller than the 13.6-inch MacBook Air, potentially making the new affordable MacBook as small as 12 inches.\u00a0 Another way Apple could reduce the cost is by using an A-series iPhone chip, which falls short of the top-tier performance offered by the MacBook Pro or the current M4 Air. The upcoming chip may be a variant of the A19 Pro chip\u00a0that debuted with the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air, which Apple says is capable of MacBook-level performance.\u00a0 As CNET senior editor Matt Elliott noted, the promise is a bold one. He speculates that the rumored $599 MacBook Air may get the same smartphone processor, or an M-series chip based on that architecture.\u00a0 Bloomberg also reports that a MacBook Pro with an M5 Pro and M5 Max chip is in development, and Apple has completed work on a MacBook Air powered by the M5 chip, which is planned for release early next year.\u00a0 The affordable laptop would be designed for casual users, students and businesses, specifically individuals who need a device for tasks such as web browsing, light media editing and document creation. The tech giant is also targeting the education market, as well as iPad buyers who may also want a traditional laptop.\u00a0 The rumored $599 MacBoook Air should bring down costs compared with the M4 MacBook Air (pictured above) by using an iPhone chip.\u00a0 \"If this is strictly a move to entice consumers with a high-quality, lower-cost MacBook running MacOS in place of an iPad with a keyboard, then yes, Apple can likely take a chunk of that market,\" said Josh Goldman, managing editor at CNET.\u00a0 \"Making inroads into the education market at this point, where Chromebooks have taken over since the pandemic, will prove challenging, though I'm sure it's nothing that throwing billions of dollars at can't fix,\" CNET's Goldman said.\u00a0 Price is likely to be key here. A $599 price tag would place the new Mac in the same range as more affordable Chromebooks and entry-level laptops, representing a significant change from Apple's previous strategy.\u00a0 \"Apple potentially dipping into the Chromebook range of $300 to $500 with a new MacBook is a big departure,\" said Goldman. He notes that one of Apple's most affordable MacBooks is the M4 MacBook Air, available new starting at $999 for the 13-inch model.\u00a0Walmart still sells a new M1 MacBook Air, a 5-year-old laptop, for around $600.\u00a0 By contrast, an iPad 11th Gen with a Magic Keyboard will run you around $600, making it clear that Apple's target market for the rumored device is students and lighter users.\u00a0 Apple typically hasn't targeted the lower-priced segment of the market with its MacBooks. However, with consumer wallets under pressure from inflation,\u00a0high tariffs\u00a0and layoffs, an affordable MacBook could be imperative and timely.\u00a0","label":0}

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Robert E. Williams, a 40-year-old VC board director and startup advisor based in Maryland. It's been edited for length and clarity. I spent the first 13 years of my career at AT&T, working my way up to an assistant VP-level position. Then, I remember asking myself a question that unlocked a complete shift in what I wanted: If all the money and safety were to blow up in Big Tech, what would I really want to do? In 2021, I left AT&T and stepped down from my title to take a bet on myself. After a series of calculated career risks, I joined an AI startup, and now I work in venture capital as an advisor for startups I believe in. The startup world has been invigorating and completely unlike the past predictability of Big Tech. If Big Tech is a luxury yacht, then startups are a speedboat. In 2007, I came straight out of undergrad into an account executive role at AT&T, where I had a really supportive development system around me and was able to take on a lot of responsibility quickly. I met some great people and had mentors who really showed me the ropes. Plus, the money was safe, which meant a lot as a young twenty-something. I worked my way up from sales manager to director and was eventually promoted to an assistant VP role in 2018. I had a lot of responsibility, but everything felt very structured. From weekly meeting cadences to quarterly business reviews, I always knew the playbook we'd run for that day, week, and month. While I valued the stability of a big company, the relationships I built, and my time leading large teams, I wanted to expand my experiences into the growth areas of tech. In 2020, that was the cloud and the earlier days of AI and machine learning. I wasn't ready to make the startup leap yet, but I knew I needed to join an established company with a culture of innovation and disruption in emerging tech. When I left AT&T, I joined AWS as a sales leader. It was a calculated risk, but I was willing to bet on myself to prove that I could thrive in this new environment. A year later, I took another calculated step down to a startup-style division of Palo Alto Networks, and then I felt ready to go all in on startups. In 2023, I joined an AI and quantum startup as its head of global channels, and later its head of revenue and partnerships. We were building partnerships around the world, so I was probably on a plane at least every other week, getting in front of customers. I worked most days from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., building the team, responding to customers, and negotiating contracts. My scope of work was much broader than it ever was in Big Tech, and it was invigorating. I'd quickly see the fruits of my labor as new customers, partnerships, and media came through. In one moment, you could be helping the team respond to a critical RFP response deadline, and then in another, you'd be briefing investors from a $100M VC fund. The pay is high risk, high reward. It's very common to forgo some of the typical Big Tech cash \"on target earnings\" for additional equity upside. I found it important to have a genuine conviction in both the market and the startup before making that tradeoff. It needs to fit into your lifestyle goals for three to five years until an exit event. There wasn't anything I disliked about startup life, but after a few years, I wanted to scale that impact across multiple companies. In May, I stepped down to an advisor role at the startup, which allowed me to become a board of director for a VC, and an advisor for two other startups: one fintech company and one medical device startup in Africa. Even though I'm covering more ground in terms of companies, I've gotten so much time back, not having to be on a plane every week. I've been spending more quality time with family and reconnecting with old friends that I haven't seen in some time. I've also had time to double down on mentorship and advisory work with startup founders and students from historically underrepresented groups. At a startup, you can have a lot of individual impact. You can take the risk of getting equity and stock options, but you have to remember that most startups fail. That being said, when you consider reduced job security and the AI boom, Big Tech isn't the safe option it used to be. Beyond anything else, it's important to find out what you're functionally good at. I'm great at go-to-market business development and strategic partnerships, and that's been my anchor throughout my career. If you can narrow in on what you're good at, you'll be incredibly valuable in Big Tech or startups. Do you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech?

Here's where to find the cache at the Marano Station. By      Billy Givens    on November 4, 2025 at 3:01PM PST As you work your way through Tian Wen's questline in Arc Raiders, you'll eventually begin a quest called Market Correction, which tasks you with finding and sabotaging a cache in the Buried City. This quest is relatively straightforward in execution, but finding the precise spot where the cache is located might prove a bit tricky--especially in the midst of chaotic battles with the ARC and other raiders who may be working on the same quest. When you're ready to complete Market Correction, you can follow the steps below to round up the cache at Marano Station and be one step closer to finishing up Tian Wen's expectations for you. Market Correction takes place in the Buried City map. You won't need to extract to complete the quest, so feel free to load in using a Free Loadout if you're worried you might not make it back alive. Your destination is Marano Station, which is located on the northwestern side of the map in the Outskirts area. This whole side of the map is filled with debris and walls for cover, so you can sneak your way into Marano Station without too many worries. When you arrive, you'll be looking for a set of canisters against a wall at the station. There are two different sets of these near each other, but you need to visit the ones in the north.  When you've discovered the correct canisters at Marano Station, interact with them once to identify the cache. Afterward, interact with them a second time to sabotage the cache. Doing so will complete the quest for Tian Wen. You're now free to extract (or die trying). The Northern Station beside the nearby Library is likely to be your best bet. Passing through this point of interest will let you do some looting, too, which isn't a bad idea given that you may be using a Free Loadout and don't have much to lose by running into aggressive raiders.

Should investors be worried about the bull market running out of steam? Eric Jackson says no, even as stocks waver on Tuesday amid fears of unsustainable valuations. Jackson, who became a retail-trader hero this summer after boosting shares of Opendoor Technologies, thinks the latest jitters are a head fake and that the bull market will overcome the latest bearish concerns. Investors' concerns on Tuesday have to do with sky-high tech valuations, which have come to the fore after Palantir stock tumbled as much as 9% on Tuesday despite strong earnings results. The slide in the stock and the subsequent drop in broader indexes were partly prompted by the CEOs of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs saying at an event this week that the market could see a decline of as much as 20%. But to Jackson, it's a wall of worry that markets can scale. In a post on X, he urged investors to hold on and not panic. Bull markets climb walls of worry. This is one of them. \u2694\ufe0fThis morning futures are down 1.5%.Some central banker somewhere is worried inflation will \u201cstay high.\u201dDavid Solomon says there\u2019s \u201crisk of a correction.\u201dCrypto\u2019s soft.Powell\u2019s remarks \u201cspooked\u201d traders.And Michael\u2026 \"Tomorrow it'll be new headlines,\" Jackson wrote. \"Sit on your hands. Don't get shaken out by the nervous Nellies who are always wrong and never accountable later.\"  He also criticized \"The Big Short Trader\" Michael Burry's recently unveiled short position on Palantir stock.  In a separate post,  Jackson provided a more detailed analysis laying out why he believes the AI market is not a bubble.  \"The same Cassandras who scream 'bubble' today said the market would crash every single year from 2009-2014,\" he wrote. \"Instead, that became a 12-year bull market.\" He highlighted the fact that the Federal Reserve has only cut interest rates twice this year and that the market is only now starting to see increased liquidity amid easing monetary policy.  \"History will show this wasn't the top of an AI bubble,\" he said. \"It was the bottom of the participation curve.

Almost four months after her American Eagle ad campaign ignited controversy online, Sydney Sweeney is addressing the backlash. In a new interview with GQ, the \"Euphoria\" and \"Anyone But You\" star was largely nonchalant about the \"great genes\" ads, which sparked debate online over the campaign's perceived racial implications. \"I did a jean ad,\" Sweeney said. \"I mean, the reaction definitely was a surprise, but I love jeans. All I wear are jeans. I'm literally in jeans and a T-shirt every day of my life.\" A post shared by American Eagle (@americaneagle) That jean ad not only led to an impressive stock surge for American Eagle, but Vice President JD Vance mocked the backlash. Even President Trump gave his two cents. \"The jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get 'em Sydney!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. So what did Sweeney think of Trump's shoutout? \"It was surreal,\" she told GQ. Still, she admitted she didn't pay too much attention to the controversy surrounding the ad in the summer because she was working. \"I kind of just put my phone away. I was filming every day. I'm filming 'Euphoria,'\" she said, referring to the upcoming third season of the HBO series. \"So I'm working 16-hour days, and I don't really bring my phone on set, so I work and then I go home and I go to sleep. So I didn't really see a lot of it.\" Sweeney will next be seen in \"Christy,\" in which she plays former boxer Christy Martin. The movie is in theaters Friday.      Jump to","label":0}

Who has the upper hand in the battle between Google and Disney? Disney channels, including ESPN and ABC, have been unavailable on YouTube TV since October 30, after Disney and Google's premium TV service failed to reach a new licensing deal. Disney has a market capitalization of $200 billion. But in Big Tech terms, it's small fry. Google parent Alphabet has a market cap of more than $3 trillion. The spat is a problem for Disney in a way that it isn't for Google's YouTube, said Rich Greenfield, partner and analyst at LightShed Partners. Greenfield said the drivers of investment interest in Google are search, AI, cloud, and maybe YouTube. \"No one is betting on the future of YouTube TV for their investment thesis in Google,\" he told Business Insider. He said that for Disney, the blackout means losing 15% of its subscriber base across ESPN and ABC. \"This is a real problem,\" he said. \"If this doesn't get settled, this is financially really painful.\" YouTube TV is much more important to Disney than to Google, said Dan Salmon at NewStreet Research. It's true that Google's business overall won't feel a big impact from the outage. Looking more narrowly at the live TV business, though, shows Disney has some advantages of its own, analysts say. \"No Disney means no ESPN, which is a major loss for YouTube TV,\" said Marisa Jones, an analyst at EMARKETER. YouTube has offered its subscribers $20 if the outage drags on. Google has talked up how serious it is about winning the living room and growing YouTube TV subscriptions. It recently shared numbers showing YouTube TV was the No. 4 pay-TV service in the US. Losing ESPN could hurt its growth prospects. Disney also has its own YouTube TV rival in Hulu + Live TV, and a 70% stake in Fubo, another streaming TV service. It recently launched its stand-alone ESPN flagship streaming service. \"Disney has these alternative monetization channels that weren't characteristics of the battles of yesteryear,\" Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris said. Guggenheim published US Apptopia data on Tuesday, showing an 88% increase in Fubo TV downloads from October 31 through Monday compared to the prior week, while Hulu downloads have increased by a more modest 33% compared to the prior week. ESPN downloads were up 5% on the same basis. It hasn't been all bad for YouTube TV \u2014 the data showed that its downloads have also increased, up 25% compared to the prior week. In general, neither company benefits from a prolonged disruption. \"The path of least resistance is to reach an agreement, and I think these two will reach one,\" Morris said. \"If YouTube is serious about YouTube TV \u2014 and it's a major player in the bundled channels economy \u2014 it does matter to Google. So when they're digging their heels in, it shows they do care and they're going to try to use their negotiating leverage to get what they want.\"      Jump to","label":0}

How popular are the Dallas Cowboys? Not popular enough to convince YouTube TV to pay up for Disney's TV networks, including ESPN, apparently. Roughly 10 million YouTube TV subscribers were unable to watch America's Team take on the Arizona Cardinals on ESPN's \"Monday Night Football,\" as the Disney-owned network remains blacked out on the Google-owned TV service. Disney and YouTube TV's stalemate centers on money. The media powerhouse wants YouTube TV to pay what it's calling the market rate for its channels, while YouTube TV warns that doing so would require it to raise prices for the second time in less than a year. Until the two sides resolve the carriage dispute, ESPN and other channels from Disney won't be available on YouTube TV. Google has said that it will refund YouTube TV subscribers $20 if the blackout lingers for an \"extended period of time,\" though it's unclear what the threshold for such a bill credit is. Disney and ESPN have made several attempts to get viewers on their side. The Mouse House set up a website sharing its side of the story, complete with tools for YouTube TV subscribers to express their frustration with Google. ESPN broadcast its flagship college football show \"College GameDay\" for free on the ESPN app and X. The sports network also recruited some of its top personalities, who spread the word about the YouTube TV blackout dispute on social media. But so far, those attempts haven't convinced Google's YouTube to pay up for access to Disney networks like ESPN. It's unclear which company will fold first, as each could make a convincing case for which side has more leverage. Disney's argument is that Google-parent Alphabet is a $3.4 trillion bully that's trying to play by different rules. A Disney spokesperson said YouTube TV's parent company is \"using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we've successfully negotiated with every other distributor.\" YouTube TV could counter by saying that it's keeping consumers top of mind, saying in a statement that \"Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers.\" The company also noted that Disney offers competing virtual TV services, Fubo and Hulu + Live TV, which could give it more leverage. In the end, both sides need each other. Disney's TV business would take a huge hit without the affiliate fees from YouTube TV, which has grown into one of the biggest pay-TV services. And while YouTube TV is a drop in the bucket revenue-wise for Google and Alphabet, it's a key part of their long-term strategy to control the living room. Sports fans can only hope that both sides see that before the next weekend of college football.           Jump to","label":0}

It's no secret that becoming a homeowner is financially out of reach for many millennials and Gen Z buyers. Zillow data shows that in 2025, the typical median-income family would need to earn about $17,670 more this year than last to afford the mortgage on a typical US home. It couldn't happen at a worse time. While home prices are dipping in some cities, they remain high nationwide. And even though mortgage rates have edged lower week by week, they're still hovering around 6% \u2014 a far cry from the 3% range seen just a few years ago. All this is unfolding against the backdrop of a sluggish economy and a job market marked by slower wage growth and a wave of layoffs hitting employers both small and large. However, Zillow's home trends expert Amanda Pendleton notes that some young homebuyers are finding a workaround \u2014 by asking friends and family to help them fund a home purchase. \"Spoiler alert, they're not doing it alone. Thirty-eight percent of all buyers today are getting some kind of gift or loan from a family member or friend. And another fun stat \u2014 20% of wedding registries now include house funds,\" Pendleton told Katie Notopoulos on Business Insider's new video podcast, \"Well Spent.\" Turning to family and friends is exactly what Aislyn and Ali Benjamin did when they got married in 2022. The California couple didn't want traditional wedding gifts like kitchen appliances, or anything that would be forgotten and gather dust in a few years. Instead, they asked their guests for cold, hard cash to help fund the construction of their first home. It's easy to understand why. The Benjamins both run small businesses in Danville, California, a city about an hour east of San Francisco, where the median home price was $1.8 million in September, according to Zillow. Buying a home in the city was unrealistic, and renting wasn't a long-term solution. For them, building an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in Ali's parents' backyard in San Ramon just eight minutes from Danville was their best shot at homeownership. And why not use a day when everyone was already celebrating them to help make it happen? \"I just made a GoFundMe, and we sent it out with our invites so people could contribute through the online link,\" Aislyn, 30, told Business Insider. In total, the couple raised $5,545 on GoFundMe and received about another $5,000 in cash, checks, and other gifts at their wedding, bringing their total to about $10,000. That money, along with help from Ali's parents, allowed them to build a 1,200-square-foot ADU by Bay-area-based company Villa for $500,000. They also financed the project with a mortgage. \"It gave us a little bit of a head start and a buffer, allowing us to not have to save up quite as much money,\" Ali Benjamin, 35, told Business Insider. \"We would rather have wedding money spent toward a home than getting gifts.\"            Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Written byAnanda Banerjee Edited byHarsh Notariya Bitcoin\u2019s November start has once again disappointed traders. The price has dropped 2.4% in the past 24 hours and is down 6.2% over the past week.  While the market has been stuck in a pattern of short rebounds and deeper pullbacks, on-chain data now points to another dip, possibly significant, before the next rally phase begins. The Net Unrealized Profit\/Loss (NUPL) metric shows how much profit or loss Bitcoin investors are holding. When NUPL values drop sharply, it signals that holders are losing incentives to sell \u2014 often setting up the next bottom. Currently, Bitcoin\u2019s NUPL sits at 0.47, the lowest level since April 8, when it fell to 0.42. During that earlier cycle, Bitcoin\u2019s NUPL declined in three stages \u2014 0.48 on February 26, 0.44 on March 10, and 0.42 on April 8 \u2014 before Bitcoin rallied from $76,000 to above $125,000. Want more token insights like this?\u00a0Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya\u2019s Daily Crypto Newsletter\u00a0here. This time, the metric started falling in late October. And the current reading matches the first stage of that earlier drop, the level on February 26. If this structure repeats, the next leg lower \u2014 toward 0.42\u20130.44 \u2014 could occur by early to mid-December, marking the next accumulation phase before a recovery takes hold.  As NUPL drop involves shaking out the weak hands, it might be followed by a steady BTC price drop. And that looks likely, now! A \u201cbearish crossover\u201d happens when a short-term exponential moving average or EMA (like the 50-day) crosses below a long-term one (like the 100-day). On Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart, this crossover is forming right now \u2014 and it\u2019s critical. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a short-term trend indicator that tracks price changes by giving more weight to recent movements. It helps identify whether buyers or sellers currently control the market. From a buyer-seller perspective, this indicates that short-term sellers are gaining the upper hand over longer-term holders. It reflects a shift in control: traders who bought recently are exiting, while longer-term investors are hesitant to buy until clear strength returns. This setup often sparks panic-driven selloffs, forcing weaker hands out of the market before a fresh accumulation phase begins. If the 50-day EMA fully crosses below the 100-day and prices fail to recover quickly, that could accelerate a short, intense shakeout that pushes NUPL to its final base range (0.42\u20130.44). Bitcoin is currently hovering near $106,900, just above the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement at $106,300. This level acted as short-term support in October. If that level breaks, the next target sits near $103,500. That would result in a roughly 3%\u20134% drop and would then lower the NUPL. If that level breaks, the BTC price might head lower.  However, a strong daily close above $111,400 would flip the short-term structure bullish again. That level has acted as resistance since October 30. Breaking above it would invalidate the bearish crossover\u2019s effect and open a path toward the $113,300 zone. However, such a significant Bitcoin price upmove would also invalidate the NUPL-based bottoming theory, at least for now.

If you own a TV, there's a good chance you're familiar with Chip and Joanna Gaines. The HGTV-famous duo launched to super stardom with their series \"Fixer Upper\" in 2013, becoming two of the most recognizable faces in reality television. Rather than just focusing on the show, though, the Gaineses used their newfound fame to launch several other business ventures. From building out brick-and-mortar stores in their hometown of Waco, Texas, to launching a TV network, Chip and Joanna have created an empire under their Magnolia banner, elevating them to the same echelon of influence as lifestyle icons like Martha Stewart and Ina Garten. Read on for a closer look at the couple's businesses and revenue streams. \"Fixer Upper\" rocketed Chip and Joanna Gaines into stardom, and it became one of HGTV's most successful series of all time. The first season premiered in May 2013, and the original series aired through 2017. Although \"Fixer Upper\" ended, Chip and Joanna have returned for different versions of the show in more recent years on their own network (more on that in a bit). \"Fixer Upper: Welcome Home\" aired in 2021, and the couple also returned to the small screen with specials like \"Fixer Upper: The Castle\" in 2022 and \"Fixer Upper: The Lakehouse\" in 2024. In October 2025, they announced the latest iteration of the series, \"Fixer Upper: Mountain House,\" which is set to premiere in December. The Gaineses founded Magnolia Realty in 2003 in Waco, Texas. Chip used to own the company with John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark, who later sued Chip for over $1 million. Lewis and Clark said that Chip pressured them into selling their shares of the company for just $2,500 each in May of 2013, just before it was announced that the Gaineses would star in \"Fixer Upper.\"\u00a0 A judge dismissed the lawsuit and sealed the records of the case, including Chip's deposition on the matter, according to the\u00a0Waco Tribune-Herald. Magnolia Realty has since expanded to five other markets in Texas, as stated on the company's website. Despite its success today, the company likely wasn't worth much before the couple rose to fame. Chip had to go to county jail just after their first son, Drake, was born in 2005 because he and Joanna had accrued $2,500 in unpaid tickets for allowing their dogs to roam around unleashed. Joanna had to scrape together money for his $800 bail. \"I think for me, the best lesson is always having a nest egg on the side,\" Joanna told Business Insider of the incident. The Little Shop on Bosque was the original Magnolia Market, and Joanna opened it in 2003 after getting encouragement from Chip, according to the Magnolia\u00a0website.\u00a0 As the Gaineses wrote on their website, the shop closed in 2014 before reopening in 2018 as a destination for \"slightly damaged and last chance items at a discount\" from the Magnolia line. The Magnolia Market at the Silos, a large complex dedicated to businesses owned by Chip and Joanna, is the modern iteration of the Gaineses' Little Shop on Bosque. It opened in Waco in 2015. The store focuses on selling home goods, and it is updated seasonally by Joanna and her team. \"Jo curates the full product assortment at Magnolia Market and on magnolia.com to reflect the colors, textures, and beauty of each season,\" the Gaineses' website says of the store. Tourism in Waco has boomed since the Gaineses opened the Silos. According to the Waco tourism site, 564,000 people visited the city in 2013, and the city had over 2 million annual visitors by 2019. That number dipped after the pandemic, but it returned to more than 1.8 million by 2024. Silos Baking Co. opened in 2016 on the Silos grounds, offering cookies, cupcakes, and more. You can also order some of its products online for delivery. Silos visitors can also buy food from Magnolia-owned brands at food trucks that come to the property. The Magnolia Journal, released quarterly, is essentially Chip and Joanna's version of O, The Oprah Magazine or Martha Stewart, and it typically features a photo of Joanna on the cover. As the Magnolia website states, the Journal includes recipes, advice, and stories centered on a seasonal theme. Joanna has also used the Journal as a way to speak directly to her fans. For instance, she wrote an essay in the fall 2021 issue titled \"A Time For Forward Motion,\" which addressed the negativity the Gaineses sometimes experience online. The essay was also published on the Magnolia blog. Target first announced its partnership with the Gaineses for Hearth & Hand in 2017. The home line, which includes both decor and furniture, is now a familiar sight at Targets around the country. The Gaineses' partnership with the retailer is still going strong as of 2025, with the couple most recently releasing a Hearth & Hand holiday collection. The collection is also available on the Magnolia website. Magnolia Press opened in 2018, and it offers an array of coffees, teas, and pastries. Chip and Joanna wrote on their website that they wanted to open a coffee shop as a place for people to take a break from the hustle and bustle of life. \"A coffee shop can be a welcome retreat in the midst of a busy day, providing a moment of comfort and familiarity,\" they wrote on the Magnolia Press landing page. \"We wanted to create a place where guests could experience just that\u2014 a cozy and inspiring shop where life resounds and community is created.\" Magnolia Table was previously known as the\u00a0Elite Caf\u00e9, a popular Waco breakfast spot. After it closed in 2016, the Gaineses bought it and turned it into Magnolia Table. The new space is decorated with photos of Elite Caf\u00e9, and the Gaineses kept the original sign from the restaurant. Since Magnolia Table opened in 2018, it has served a variety of breakfast and lunch fare, featuring a menu that includes everything from homemade biscuits to avocado toast. The restaurant also began serving dinner in September 2024, offering elevated versions of recipes you'll find in Joanna's cookbooks. Magnolia Table also features a dedicated takeaway window to accommodate guests who wish to take their food to go, according to the Magnolia website. The Gaineses expanded the Silos in October of 2020, opening an array of specialty boutiques. Those shops have evolved in the past five years, and as of November 2025, the Silos is home to Magnolia Market, the furniture store Magnolia Home, and six specialty shops: The items sold in the stores can be purchased online through Magnolia's website. Chip and Joanna own two rental properties in Waco, Texas: Hillcrest Estate and Hillcrest Cottage.\u00a0 Visitors must rent the entire homes, according to the Magnolia site, and the properties' nightly rates aren't cheap. The Hillcrest Estate has an average nightly cost of $1,090. Chip and Joanna worked with AJ Capital Partners to transform a 100-year-old building in downtown Waco into Hotel 1928, a boutique hotel with thirty-three rooms. They documented the transformation of the property in \"Fixer Upper: The Hotel,\" which showed Joanna leaning into a more retro, moody aesthetic than she often used in her interior design. The hotel is also home to a rooftop restaurant, Bertie's; a larger restaurant with southern dishes, The Brasseries; and a coffee and pastry shop, The Caf\u00e9 at Hotel 2928. The hotel is frequently completely booked, and its prices range from around $400 for a basic room to over $2,000 per night for its largest suite. The Gaineses have written 11 books between them, all of which became New York Times bestsellers. Together, Chip and Joanna published \"The Magnolia Story,\" which gave readers a deeper look into their lives. Chip independently wrote \"No Pain, No Gaines\" and \"Capital Gaines,\" two memoirs about his life and business ventures.\u00a0 Joanna's eight books include the design book \"Homebody: Exclusive Edition\"; three cookbooks, \"Magnolia Table,\" \"Magnolia Table, Volume 2,\" and \"Magnolia Table, Volume 3;\" a memoir, \"The Stories We Tell;\" and three picture books, \"The World Needs Who You Were Made to Be,\" \"We are the Gardeners,\" which she wrote with the help of her children, and \"The Wonder You See.\" After their successful work with HGTV, the Gaineses announced that they would be launching their own network.  Magnolia Network first launched on Discovery+ and the Magnolia app in 2021. It then debuted on cable TV in January 2022 with a full slate of shows, though its initial launch was slightly rocky. One Magnolia original series, \"Home Work,\" was temporarily pulled from its lineup after homeowners alleged that the hosts, Candis and Andy Meredith, went tens of thousands of dollars over budget, damaged their homes, and didn't complete renovations in some cases. The Merediths denied the allegations, and Magnolia began airing the show at the end of January 2022. Despite the controversy, Magnolia's cable debut was largely a success, with 3 million people tuning into the channel on the day of its launch.\u00a0 As of 2025, the Magnolia Network is home to over 30 original series, including \"Fixer Upper.\"  Joanna partnered up with Target to sell Magnolia Table's new collection of frozen pastries. The line, which ranges in price from $9.99 to $11.99, includes three types of cookies, banana bread, cinnamon rolls, and a frozen version of Jo's Buttermilk Biscuits, a beloved staple at Magnolia Table and in her cookbooks. Some of the items in the collection were tastier than others, as Business Insider found in its review of the line.             Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":" \t\t\t        November 4, 2025 9:00am by \t\t\t        Barry Ritholtz   \u00a0 \u00a0 October, far from being the scariest market month, was strong pretty much anywhere you looked. There were signs that the economy is slowing, but equity markets shrugged that off \u2014 Rate Cuts! \u2014 and racked up their sixth straight month of gains. The 10-year Treasury rallied, sending yields down to 4.08%. Precious metals hit new all-time highs; Year-to-date, GLD shares were up 66% before pulling back 8.5%. And the US Dollar was strong in October relative to the rest of the G10 currencies. If you want to find reasons to be concerned, there are plenty: Valuations are extended, AI bubble chatter is everywhere; the market is concentrated at the top and gains are increasingly narrow; there are some credit concerns and minor blow-ups; sentiment is ugly. If today\u2019s pullback has you concerned, be aware of your bias towards action: You want to do something \u2014 Anything! \u2014 in response. This Action Bias is a cognitive foible that pushes you to act instead of think. You should be strategic in your planning, not tactical in your reactions. The goal is always to enhance your portfolio with high-probability decision-making. That is not the result you derive from the bias towards action. Instead, it acts as a salve to reduce your anxiety as it gives you the illusion of control. Doing something makes you feel like you have influence over random events, which you decidedly do not. If you have a plan and you follow it, you should be just fine. But be aware, this goes against millions of years of evolution that wants you to take action. We dislike inaction because it looks lazy and\/or incompetent. The thinking is, doing something is better than nothing, even if that something is ill-considered and low-probability. You probably shouldn\u2019t do anything, but if you must do something, then consider these five things you can do that will satisfy your urge to action, but not affect your actual long-term investments: 1. Sell your speculative holdings. Many of us hold a few flyers, microcaps, and ill-advised tip stocks from our brothers-in-law. If you are truly concerned, consider raising cash in your Cowboy account, but leave your main portfolio untouched. 2. Look at Individual Stock Holdings: Even indexers sometimes accumulate single stocks. We buy these for a variety of reasons, including on rare occassions, ones that actually come true. But I bet a lot of your single stock holdings were purchased with specific catalysts in mind that have failed to materialize. If you bought something a while ago waiting for a new CEO,\u00a0 an analyst upgrade, FDA drug approal, M&A, a hot new product, or some other magic bullet \u2014 and it has yet to occur \u2014 then cut it loose. You can revisit it if you need to in the New Year. 3. Crypto: Sell your shitcoins now; if that doesn\u2019t alleviate your concerns, consider reducing your Bitcoin\/Eth holdings. I sold my Bitcoin last week; this wasn\u2019t a market call or verdict on BITC, rather, I wanted some dry powder in case some opportunities opened up. 4. Sell Physical Gold: My wife has decades\u2019 worth of broken bracelets, single earrings, clasps that no longer work, and jewelry she no longer wears. Over the past few months, we twice took a haul to our favorite local shop; we received one credit of $7,200, and another of $4,100. (Note to spouses: there is no free ride, and this will probably cost you more money.) 5. Update Your Plan: After run-ups of 16.5% in the S&P 500 and 23% in the Nasdaq 100, a down day of 1 to 2% should not make you nervous. Are you close to retirement, paying for College, or some other large financial expense? Perhaps your upset stomach is alerting you to the fact that your risk you have assumed and your immediate needs are not aligned.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Chancellor Rachel Reeves is contemplating tax rises in her Budget on 26 November. And she has said one of the key reasons is that the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), is going to lower its UK productivity growth forecast for the coming years. So why would lower UK productivity forecasts lead to tax rises? And is this something the government could have anticipated before it pledged not to raise taxes on working people in its 2024 election manifesto? BBC Verify has been looking into the statistics. Productivity is the amount of goods and services the entire UK economy produces for each hour of work done by everyone in the working population, also known as \"output per hour\". It gives an indication of how efficiently a country's economy is using its workforce and equipment to produce these goods and services - and so how productive a country is. A country with higher levels of productivity often has higher average wages and incomes. In the Spring Statement in March 2025 the OBR projected total UK productivity would grow by around 1% each year over the next five years. If productivity grows more slowly it means overall GDP growth - and overall tax revenues - will be lower than previously expected. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has estimated each 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the official productivity growth forecast increases projected government borrowing by \u00a37bn in 2029\u201330. That is the year when the government's chosen borrowing rules require it to balance day-to-day spending with tax revenues, essentially so it's not borrowing for anything except investment. So if the OBR downgraded its forecast for average UK productivity growth over the next five years from 1% to 0.8% (-0.2 percentage points) that revision would increase projected borrowing in 2029-30 by \u00a314bn. In March, the chancellor gave herself \"headroom\" against meeting her borrowing rules in 2029-30 of only \u00a39.9bn. In other words, this was the leeway between meeting and not meeting her rules. That means an OBR productivity forecast downgrade of 0.2 percentage points (\u00a314bn) would, on its own, wipe away this headroom, pushing the government into a projected deficit in that year. And if the chancellor wanted to restore that headroom against her rules she would need to either cut government spending or raise taxes by an equivalent amount. Given the spending budgets of departments were fixed in the June Spending Review, the chancellor is expected to try to restore her headroom against her fiscal rules by raising taxes. The UK's productivity growth has been unusually weak since the financial crisis. Between 1971 and 2009, UK output per hour grew by 2% a year on average. But since 2010 it has grown by an average of just 0.4% a year. This productivity growth slowdown is not unique to the UK. It has been a feature of most advanced countries since 2010. However, the UK's slowdown has been relatively large. In the period 2010 to 2023, the UK's average annual growth rate fell by an average of 1.9 percentage points relative to the growth rate in the period 1971 to 2009. This was worse than the rest of the G7 group of industrialised nations, apart from Germany and Japan. For many years after 2010, economists treated the UK's productivity slowdown as a puzzle, because there was no consensus on the cause. Some pointed to the lasting and outsize impact of the financial crisis on the UK, given our economy's reliance on financial services through the City of London. Others suggested the austerity era spending cuts and tax rises of the last Conservative-led government had contributed to it by reducing overall economic activity at a time when the UK had the potential to grow more quickly without generating inflation. More recently, Brexit has been cited as a contributor - both due to the reduction in trade relative to the UK staying in the EU's single market and customs union since 2020 and also the damage to business investment from the long period of uncertainty about the UK's future status in the years after the 2016 referendum. There is still no consensus on the reasons for the productivity slowdown, though many economists think historically low levels of investment in the UK economy - both from the private sector and government - are likely to be an important part of the story. Not really, because in its most recent forecast the OBR was notably more optimistic about UK productivity growth than other UK forecasters, including the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In March, the OBR was projecting medium-term potential supply growth for the UK (a wider measure of productivity, which includes increases in the available workforce) of 1.79%, versus the Bank of England's 1.5% and the IMF's 1.36%. And the OBR has been persistently optimistic about UK productivity growth since 2010. Given that, it is not surprising that the OBR has downgraded its forecasts to be more in line with other forecasters. Public finance experts note that if Rachel Reeves had given herself more headroom against her fiscal rules in March 2025 then she might not have needed to respond to this downgrade by raising taxes. Many public finance experts cautioned after her last Budget in October 2024 that if productivity growth disappointed, her plans and pledges not to raise taxes again looked vulnerable.

ABF explores spinning off Primark chain from food brands as UK shoppers cut back on fashion purchases The chancellor's pitch: the Budget will be painful, due to the actions of others, but it will be worth it, to tackle debt, help public services and promote growth.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Here\u2019s why we believe GoodRx (GDRX) stock is worth considering: It is expanding, generating cash, and is available at a notable valuation discount. Let\u2019s examine the figures. Free Cash Flow Yield is calculated as free cash flow per share divided by stock price. Why is this significant? If a company generates a substantial amount of cash per share, it can be utilized to drive further revenue growth or simply returned to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. For a quick background, GoodRx offers a platform for comparing and saving on U.S. prescription drug pricing, along with subscription services, pharmaceutical manufacturer solutions, and telehealth offerings. Regardless of the direction one stock takes, your portfolio should remain on course. Discover how High Quality Portfolio can assist you in doing so. But do these figures provide the complete picture? Check Buy or Sell GDRX Stock to determine if GoodRx still possesses a competitive edge that withstands scrutiny. The Key Point? The Market Can Recognize and Reward The statistics below stem from the \"high free cash flow yield with growth and discount\" selection strategy since 12\/31\/2016. The metrics are derived from monthly selections, under the assumption that a stock, once chosen, cannot be selected again for the next 180 days. However, Consider the Risk GoodRx is not exempt from significant fluctuations. It experienced a decline of about 41% during the Covid pandemic and suffered an even steeper drop of nearly 93% during the inflation crisis. Even with all the favorable aspects surrounding it, the stock can endure considerable declines when the market shifts. Strong fundamentals are essential, but as these movements illustrate, nothing is entirely secure when volatility strikes. Moreover, the risk isn\u2019t restricted to severe market downturns. Stocks can decline even when the market is favorable \u2014 consider occurrences such as earnings reports, business updates, and changes in outlook. Check GDRX Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has bounced back from sharp declines in the past. Consistently identifying winning stocks is a challenging endeavor \u2014 particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4 years. Why is this the case?

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"OnePlus outclasses its rivals yet again when it comes to charging tech.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Best answer: The OnePlus 15 supports up to 120W wired charging when using a charger that's compliant with the SuperVOOC protocol. You also get up to 50W wireless charging, with a charger complying with the AirVOOC standard. If you're in the market for a flagship Android smartphone, we suggest waiting a bit for the OnePlus 15. The top-tier smartphone was recently launched in China and is set to make its global debut soon. As you'd expect, the latest and greatest \"flagship killer\" from OnePlus packs in a wide range of improvements, including a fresh new design, blazing-fast hardware, and a reworked triple-lens primary camera system. However, what really makes the OnePlus 15 stand out is its behemoth 7,300mAh silicon-carbon battery, which should help make the phone go for multiple days on a single charge. But when that battery does need a top-up, how fast can you expect it to charge?      The short answer is, very fast! The OnePlus 15 can be charged at an astounding 120W, provided you use the brand's own wall charger and cable that utilize the SuperVOOC protocol. Similarly, the phone supports up to 50W wireless charging with a wireless charger using the AirVOOC standard. It's worth noting that both are proprietary charging protocols developed by OPPO, the sister brand of OnePlus. With third-party chargers, the OnePlus 15 can be charged at 36- 55W in wired mode, based on the charging standard (e.g., PPS, PD) used by the charger. It's also worth noting that the global variant may differ in charging speed due to various reasons, so it may have a slower charging speed outside of China. Of course, a gargantuan battery and industry-leading charging speeds are just two of the many goodies that'll make sure the OnePlus 15 earns its spot among the best Android phones out there. The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, which is complemented by up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. It also has a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with razor-thin bezels and an ultra-smooth 165Hz refresh rate. You have a triple-lens primary camera system housed in a redesigned module, IP69K dust and water resistance (just like the OnePlus 13), and a whole lot more.       The newest killer flagship With the latest OnePlus 15, you get a finely crafted smartphone that works even better than it looks. It has top-of-the-line hardware specifications, a 165Hz LTPO AMOLED screen, a versatile triple-lens camera array, and a big 7,300mAh battery that can be juiced up in just a few minutes.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is arguably the biggest stock-market cheerleader in American political history. And that fact is throwing a floor under stocks in a way few people realize. It\u2019s another reason to buy stocks now\u2014or better still, stock-focused closed-end funds (CEFs). Because when things get rough, we can count on Scott to temper policies that might otherwise ruffle the markets. This sounds like a minor thing, but it\u2019s key in a market like this, which I see as still having room to run, even though, yes, valuations are getting stretched. To get at the moderating effect of Bessent\u2019s presence, we need to start with President Trump, who has a long history of caring about the stock market, even though his career was in private real estate. While presidents have tended to downplay the stock market, or outright ignore it, Trump remained keen on stocks for many years, tweeting about the markets at many points prior to, and during, his first term. So when Trump won the election late last year, many expected his focus on stocks to continue. This is partly why stocks tanked following Trump\u2019s unveiling of massive tariffs in April, as many commentators started wondering whether he had lost interest in the stock market as an indicator of presidential success. \u201cThis time around, Trump may not care about market dives,\u201d wrote CNN. That narrative didn\u2019t last long\u2014Trump\u2019s reversal on tariffs after markets took a nosedive gave us the TACO acronym: \u201cTrump always chickens out.\u201d  And since then, well, stocks have been doing well. Yes, that\u2019s partly because earnings growth is strong, as we discussed in last Thursday\u2019s article. But it\u2019s also because investors realized they\u2019d discounted Trump\u2019s indifference to stock prices when, in fact, he still cares a lot. Trump hasn\u2019t explicitly said his administration wants stocks to surge, but quite recently, Bessent did exactly that. \u201cWe want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,\u201d said Bessent in a recent interview with the Financial Times, suggesting that a downturn in stocks will cause both him and his boss to step back if they go in a direction markets don\u2019t like. Later in their chat, Bessent told the FT, \u201cI have a healthy regard for the market,\u201d while emphasizing that it is precisely this concern that distinguishes Trump\u2019s administration from others that have tried a radical overhaul of trade agreements. \u201cWhat gets people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don\u2019t respect the market \u2026 you\u2019ve got to respect the market.\u201d An administration official expressing such a bullish view is unusual. But having a bullish attitude is not. Nor is it a Republican-only thing. In the early 2010s, President Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve, and his quantitative easing program of the time resulted in a new phrase on Wall Street: \u201cthe Bernanke put.\u201d It basically meant that, if the stock market starts to fall, Bernanke would intervene. I was working on Wall Street at the time, and the \u201cBernanke put\u201d was a common topic of conversation. And stocks did as the Fed wished. And now, history is repeating itself\u2014pros are talking more and more about the \u201cBessent put.\u201d As one lobbyist quoted by the FT put it: \u201cWhen it counts, he\u2019s a fighter in our corner. It\u2019s almost like this \u2018Bessent put\u2019\u2014he knows not to go too far where the markets would be disrupted.\u201d But this time, the \u201cBessent put\u201d trade is just getting started. It\u2019s been less than a year since Bessent was confirmed, so it\u2019s still early. But stocks have returned 15% since he was confirmed, even including the tariff selloff. That also means every selloff in the short term is a buying opportunity\u2014at least while the \u201cBessent put\u201d is around. We don\u2019t have to wait for that next selloff, either, because it\u2019s possible to buy many stock-focused CEFs trading at unusual discounts right now, despite the market\u2019s march higher, like the 8.5%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG). ASG is a holding in my CEF Insider service. It\u2019s a nice pickup now because it holds stocks of companies of all sizes: small-, mid- and large-cap names all feature here. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and the other top tech names are all main holdings, as well as others, like property manager FirstService (FSV), Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI) and DNA-testing firm Natera (NTRA). ASG not only has a strong long-term track record (it\u2019s up 195% in the last decade, including dividends) but has both increased regular payouts and paid out some huge special dividends, too. Sure, that dividend does float a bit, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s tied to the fund\u2019s underlying performance. That\u2019s actually a good setup as it gives management latitude to reinvest its profits without worrying about being tied to a fixed payout. That, in turn, drives further upside for us. Moreover, as I write this, ASG trades at a 9.3% discount to NAV, which is much more generous than its five-year average of 2%. That puts additional upside on the table as that discount returns to normal. And having a \u201cfriend\u201d in Bessent doesn\u2019t hurt, either!

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"The vast majority of model rockets go vaguely up and float vaguely downwards without a lot of control. However, [newaysfactory] built a few rockets that were altogether more precise in their flight, thanks to his efforts to master active roll control.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Oracle (ORCL) stock has shown remarkable rallies historically. It jumped about 40% in one day earlier this year on report of a massive surge in AI and cloud-related contract backlogs, signaling explosive future growth. But that\u2019s not all. There have been seven occasions when ORCL stock climbed more than 30% in less than two months, particularly in 2011 and 2024.  Can it happen again? Certainly, but there will need to be a trigger. What could that be?  Triggers That Could Elevate The Stock The asset allocation methods of Trefis\u2019 Boston-based wealth management partner produced favorable returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P dropped over 40%. Our partner has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation structure to offer clients improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. How Do Financials Appear Currently If current financials are sound, you\u2019d be more confident to hold the stock until the trigger that sparks massive upside rally. For deeper insights on ORCL, read Buy or Sell ORCL Stock. Below are key figures that are significant. But How Does The Stock Perform In Adverse Conditions? When assessing risk for Oracle, it is evident that even robust companies can suffer during market downturns. During the Dot-Com Bubble, ORCL dropped approximately 77%, which is significant. The Global Financial Crisis saw it fall around 41%, and the Inflation Shock led to a similar 40% decline. Even smaller market corrections like the 2018 Correction and the Covid Pandemic resulted in declines of nearly 19% and 29%, respectively. Strong fundamentals are essential; however, as Oracle\u2019s history illustrates, it is not shielded from severe losses when the market turns. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three \u2013 the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"A Kurdish crime network is enabling migrants to work illegally in mini-marts on High Streets the length of Britain, a BBC investigation can reveal. The fake company directors are paid to put their names to official paperwork, and have dozens of businesses listed on Companies House, but are not involved in running them. Two undercover reporters, themselves Kurdish, posed as asylum seekers and were told how easy it would be for them to take over and run a shop and make big profits selling illegal vapes and cigarettes. We have linked more than 100 mini-marts, barbershops and car washes, operating from Dundee to south Devon, to the crime network. But a financial crime investigator told the BBC he believes it goes much wider. Reacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, said: \"Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it.\" For the first time, we can reveal the inner workings of a criminal system that lets asylum seekers work in plain sight on UK High Streets, in mini-marts that mainly profit from illegal cigarettes and vapes. One man told us weekly takings from illicit tobacco at his shop could be \"sometimes, up to \u00a33,000\". The men who facilitate it all - so-called \"ghost directors\" - each have dozens of businesses listed on Companies House but in many cases are not involved in running them. \"The shop doesn't belong to me, it's just under my name,\" one of them told our undercover reporters. Many of the businesses are dissolved after about a year, and then re-opened with small changes to official paperwork. These businesses have \"all the red flags\" associated with organised criminality, a financial crime investigator told the BBC. During our investigation we found: The two Kurdish journalists involved in our investigation know that tensions over immigration are high. They worry that such coverage of illegal activities within the Kurdish community could inflame hostilities. One of them is a former asylum seeker himself, and says \"I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us.\" Over four months, we monitored a Kurdish Facebook group where businesses across the UK were listed for sale. New adverts popped up every week. The reporters got in touch with three people who listed mini-marts for sale in Crewe, Hull and Liverpool. They said they were interested in running a mini-mart and trading illegal cigarettes. In Cheshire, the man running a Crewe mini-mart called Top Store said he would sell his shop to one reporter for \u00a318,000 cash. The shopkeeper, who went by the name Surchi, assured our journalist that \"you don't need anything\" to own and run a mini-mart as an asylum seeker. Surchi told us he was himself a Kurdish asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK in 2022, but whose claim had been refused. When the BBC later confronted him, he told us he had paperwork proving his right to work. We asked if he could show us these documents, but he hasn't provided them. Asylum seekers generally do not have the right to work in the UK while their claim is being processed. Permission to work is only granted in limited circumstances and is subject to strict conditions. If asylum seekers are granted permission to work, they can only apply for eligible jobs on the Immigration Salary List. These do not include being a shop manager or shop assistant. Like our undercover reporters, Surchi told us he was from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, an area that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The region is often referred to as Kurdistan, but it is not an independent country. To avoid scrutiny by the authorities, Surchi said he paid someone called \"Hadi\" about \u00a3250 a month to be named on official papers. \"That's his job and he probably has 40 to 50 shops under his name. There's no problem, he doesn't mind what you sell,\" he explained. This arrangement let Surchi go under the radar of immigration enforcement and sell whatever he liked. He said he had never paid any council tax and that our undercover reporter would not need to officially register the company. Immigration enforcement officers had only come by once in the past five years, when he was out, Surchi said during his sales patter. They never returned, he said. Trading Standards had raided the shop once, Surchi said, and he had been given a \u00a3200 fine for selling illegal cigarettes and vapes. Shop owners in the UK caught selling these items can be fined up to \u00a310,000, but the profits that can be made from such products far outweigh the penalties. During a tour of the premises, Surchi took us outside to a so-called \"stash car\" where he said he hid the bulk of his stock until 17:00 each night, when Trading Standards officers finished for the day. He also told our reporter that \"you could make a hiding spot\" for the stock in the shop's basement - where he also showed how he tampered with the electricity meter to avoid paying utility bills. Surchi sold vapes to a group of teenagers while we were at the shop. \"I have customers that are 12 years old, I don't have any problem with them,\" he said. Customers paid via a card machine into a bank account, he explained. Both of these belonged to his cousin, he said, who owned a mini-mart 15 miles away in Stoke. On Facebook, we discovered Kurdish builders willing to help us conceal illegal vapes and cigarettes. One of our reporters posted that he had bought a mini-mart in Manchester and was looking for \"a specialist to build a space to hide cigarettes in the shop\". Six builders got in touch. One sent us a video of what looked like a vending machine for illegal cigarettes hidden in a loft, which, at the press of a button, pinged packets down a chute to a concealed vent below. It was \"fine craftsmanship\" and cost \u00a36,000, the builder said, claiming it was guaranteed to fool Trading Standards' sniffer dogs. As we delved deeper into who officially owned these mini-marts, a network of ghost directors began to emerge. One name that kept coming up was Hadi Ahmad Ali - the Birmingham man to whom Surchi told us he was paying his monthly fee. We found Mr Ahmad Ali listed on Companies House as being from Iraq, in his 40s and a director of more than 50 other businesses - mini-marts, barbers and car washes. One of our reporters phoned him pretending to be an asylum seeker looking to buy the Crewe business to sell illegal cigarettes. Mr Ahmad Ali said the shop didn't belong to him but the lease was under his name. He confirmed he could keep it in his name for our undercover reporter, for a fee of between \u00a3250 and \u00a3300 a month. He also said he could try to provide a bank card for the shop. \"I will give you a 50% guarantee that I can get you a bank card. I have another six to seven shops under my name in Hull and other places.\" Mr Ahmad Ali is still listed as an active director on several businesses on Companies House. We later learned that in October 2024 he had been disqualified from being a company officer for five years. The ban followed illegal cigarette sales at a shop in his name in Chorley, Lancashire - including to a 16-year-old. Separately, he pleaded guilty to his involvement in the sale of illegal cigarettes in Lincolnshire and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. When later confronted by the BBC, Mr Ahmad Ali told us these mini-marts were nothing to do with him, and he had contacted Companies House to get his name removed from the businesses. A spokesperson for Companies House said it \"now has greater powers to share information and support law enforcement investigations\". \"Where criminality is suspected, information and intelligence are shared with relevant partners.\" Our research linked Mr Ahmad Ali to another man, Ismael Ahmedi Farzanda, who we found was a ghost director and responsible for 25 mini-marts. Mr Farzanda's name came up because Companies House filings showed he had taken over as company director from Mr Ahmad Ali at seven mini-mart businesses. The pair also shared a co-directorship on one shop in Blackpool. One of our reporters managed to call Mr Farzanda, using the same cover story as he had told Mr Ahmad Ali. \"I just put the shops under my name for people,\" said Mr Farzanda who, like Mr Ahmad Ali, was based in the West Midlands. He told us an \"accountant\" would take care of the paperwork, bank accounts and payments to him, and that he would have no problem with us selling illegal cigarettes. The only request he had was that if the undercover reporter was ever caught by the police, he should let him know immediately. \"If you know you're caught, tell us so that for the interviews we can change the name and not get in trouble,\" he told our reporter. Mr Farzanda was fined \u00a34,500 in August after one shop, registered in his name in Haslingden, Lancashire, was caught selling illegal vapes to a 14-year-old, according to local media reports. Seventeen shops registered under the names of Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda have been raided since 2021 with illegal tobacco and vapes seized, Trading Standards sources confirmed. Despite being registered on official documents as being from Iran, Mr Farzanda told our undercover reporter he was actually from the Sharazoor district in neighbouring Iraq. Both our undercover reporters say they are aware of Kurdish people who have arrived in the UK on small boats and pretended to be Iranian, believing their asylum claims would have a better chance of success. When later presented with our evidence, Mr Farzanda denied all the allegations put to him by the BBC. When we looked into the official records attached to all the companies listed for Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda, a suspicious pattern emerged. We found companies would be set up for a year, dissolved, and then set up again - each time with a slightly different spelling of the businesses' names. The men's names and birthdays would also be changed slightly. \"Why are they doing that? It's most likely to evade tax and to dodge scrutiny by authorities,\" said financial crime investigator Graham Barrow, when we showed him our data. We have also confirmed details of two further ghost directors - with 40 companies listed between them. This UK-wide network of more than 100 company directorships in the names of just four individuals has \"all the red flags that I would associate with organised criminal networks\", said Mr Barrow. The network of businesses identified by the BBC could stretch even wider across the country, said Mr Barrow: \"I certainly think it's hundreds. It could easily be bigger than that,\" he said. We visited more than a dozen mini-marts linked to this network of ghost directors. Everywhere we went, it was the same story - the shops were on rundown High Streets in some of the UK's most deprived areas, such as Blackpool, Bradford, Huddersfield and Hull. All but one of the shops sold counterfeit or smuggled cigarettes for about \u00a34 per pack, instead of the average UK price of \u00a316 for a pack of 20. As well as Surchi's story in Crewe, our investigation revealed details of other Kurdish asylum seekers being employed illegally. A mini-mart worker in a Blackpool shop linked to one of the ghost directors told us he had left an asylum-seeker hotel in Liverpool to work 14-hour days at the shop. \"In return I get \u00a360 to \u00a365 [per day],\" he told us. \"For three months, I worked for \u00a350 [per day].\" He was interviewed by the Home Office four months ago, he said, but hasn't heard anything since. The shop had been raided by Trading Standards three times, he told us - but he described that as \"nothing\". \"Just give them any name and they will walk away,\" he explained, saying that whenever he was asked who he was, he would give the name of a famous Kurdish singer, Aziz Waisi. He did say he was worried by immigration enforcement, however. \"They [Trading Standards] take the cigarettes and leave, but immigration makes you do fingerprints.\" We also found another Kurdish shopworker in a Salford shop registered under Ismaeel Farzanda's name, who said he was in limbo. \"I've been here for six months and I still haven't claimed asylum,\" he said. The 42-year-old said he had first come to the UK as a teenager, before returning to Kurdistan. He said he returned to the UK this year and \"they found my previous fingerprint records but nothing came of it\". He said he was staying with friends. \"Honestly, we're all struggling here and don't know what to do.\" The government says it has increased raids by 51% and this year raised the fines for businesses to \u00a360,000 per person found working illegally. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood added that the government has \"seized millions of pounds worth of unlicensed goods, banned dodgy directors and removed more than 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK.\" Additional reporting by Phill Edwards and Kirstie Brewer Highland Council is to hold a special meeting on the Home Office proposals for the Inverness site.

Holiday decorations usually fall into two categories: the cheap plastic stuff that breaks after one season, or the expensive ornaments you\u2019re afraid to let kids touch. LEGO just released their Christmas ornament selection building set that solves both problems at once: You build four festive ornaments with your kids, hang them on the tree, and pack them away safely year after year without worrying about shattered glass or broken hooks. Amazon\u2019s already moved over 30,000 units since the launch, and at just $12, this limited-edition set costs less than a single fancy ornament from most holiday stores. The catch is, LEGO\u2019s holiday products tend to vanish fast \u2013 and their Advent calendars are already out of stock everywhere, and this ornament set\u2019s following suit. See at Amazon This set consists of 153 pieces that build four different ornaments: Santa with his iconic hat and beard, a snowman with a scarf and carrot nose, a wrapped gift with a red bow, and a reindeer with decorated antlers. Each of the ornaments is approximately 3.5 inches tall which makes them big enough to easily view on the tree without feeling too big for smaller branches. Kids aged six and up can handle independent builds, though some smaller pieces may require a parent\u2019s assistance for younger children. LEGO ornaments give you something store-bought decorations can\u2019t match: they survive years of use without falling apart. Glass ornaments shatter when they hit the floor, cheap plastic ones crack and fade, but these brick-built decorations pack away in a box and come back out looking exactly the same next year. You can customize them by swapping pieces around or combining elements from other LEGO sets if your kids want to get creative. These ornaments work as standalone tree decorations or combine with other LEGO holiday sets to create larger displays on mantels or shelves. You can build a whole winter scene by adding different LEGO Christmas sets over the years which makes your holiday decorating an ongoing collection rather than a one-time purchase. The price point makes it easy to grab multiples if you want extras for other trees, to give as gifts to grandparents, or to let each kid build their own set. For $12, you get four ornaments-meaning you\u2019re spending about three bucks per decoration which undercuts most specialty ornament shops and gives you something way more engaging than pulling some pre-made items out of a box.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":" NintendoSwitch 2  Nintendo has announced that its brand new console, the Switch 2, has now sold over 10 million units in the first four months on sale. That makes it the most successful console launch ever by quite some margin. And the two flagship games,\u00c2\u00a0Mario Kart World and\u00c2\u00a0Donkey Kong Bananza, each have their own extraordinary figures to boast of. The Switch 2, launched June 5 after a peculiar and obfuscated build-up, went on to sell an extraordinary 3.5 million units in just its first four days on sale. Now, obviously that number includes pre-orders that built up rather chaotically from April, on top of post-launch sales in the opening days, so it was always going to be the most dramatic number. At the start of August, Nintendo revealed things were still going extremely well, with a total of six million Switch 2s sold in its first month. While numbers from rival console manufacturers are often more hazy, this fully confirms the hybrid gaming device as the most successful console launch ever, dwarfing the already impressive numbers of the original Switch, and beating the PS5 to 10 million sales by a full four months. Which is to say, the Switch 2 has sold twice as fast as Sony\u2019s behemoth. Come the latest financial filings from Nintendo, noting sales up to the end of September, the company reports that by September 30 it had sold a total of 10.36 million Switch 2s. Which is astonishing. Meanwhile,\u00c2\u00a0Mario Kart World has nearly doubled its sales since its first month, with a total of 9.57 million copies sold (and that\u2019s actually sold, rather than just shipped), while July 17\u2019s Donkey Kong Bananza has shifted 3.49 million carts. All these massive numbers have given Nintendo cause to increase its sales expectations for the end of the financial year. It was originally banking on 15 million Switch 2s sold by the spring, but that hope has now been raised to 19 million. Even this may still be a cautious under-estimation, given we\u2019re just now entering the holiday season\u00e2\u0080\u0094a time period most rival consoles deliberately launch directly into. On top of that, the Switch 2 has already sold for two more months after these reported numbers, and with Nintendo\u2019s plan to flood the stores with stock for Christmas, \u201conly\u201d another 8.5 million units by March 2026 could easily be reached. Nintendo also announced that it has sold 1.89 million more original Switches in the same time period, and made a mind-blowing 61.56 million software sales across those six months. The Switch 2, with its far smaller user-base, still sold 20.62 million games, although as you will note, three fifths of that is made up of two games!

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. A weakening jobs market prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice in two months. Does that mean it\u2019s time to shift your investment strategy?  In a word, no. While there may be opportunities to shift into a more defensive stance, evolving labor data is not a good reason to depart from an effective long-term strategy. Read on to find out why, and what you can do instead.  Your strategy should be hardy enough to withstand changing labor dynamics, rising prices, government shutdowns and more. In an interview, Waddell & Associates Investment Strategist Matt Gentzkow said you shouldn\u2019t need to update your portfolio in response to short-term market and economic conditions\u2014assuming your plan appropriately reflects your risk tolerance and financial goals.  Katie Klingensmith, chief investment strategist at Edelman Financial Engines, agreed. She explained, \u201cThe most effective approach is to stay invested, stay diversified, and keep your portfolio aligned with long-term goals rather than letting yourself fall into the emotional reaction to every economic release.\u201d Admittedly, remaining confident in your strategy is easier said than done. Negative economic headlines can be scary, especially if you are new to investing or nearing big financial milestones. In that scenario, it can be comforting to take some action rather than doing nothing.  Here are three moves you can make when the financial market outlook feels uncertain.   Your portfolio may feel more volatile now because its composition has departed from your target allocation. Gentzkow noted that stock prices have risen significantly since the downturn prompted by President Trump\u2019s tariff announcement last April. Your portfolio may hold too much value in stocks as a result.  Rebalancing is the solution. \u201cRebalancing can provide an opportunity to trim equity exposure and reallocate to fixed-income and alternative-income assets,\u201d said Gentzkow. Know that rebalancing in taxable accounts can trigger capital gains. You may also miss out on further gains if stock prices continue to rise, Gentzkow explained.   Risk tolerance can change over time. It\u2019s normal to feel confident and risk-hardy at younger ages and then become more conservative over time. It\u2019s also common to feel comfortable with risk when the market is hot, and less so when stock prices are falling.  As you gain investing experience, it will be easier to identify your sweet spot. You want to invest aggressively enough to earn good returns in rising markets, but not so aggressively that you feel panic in falling markets.  If you decide to lessen your risk profile, consider modifying your portfolio gradually. You can avoid capital gains by adjusting the composition of new investments rather than selling what you already own.   You could also shift to a more conservative sector strategy without changing your overall stock exposure, Gentzkow explained. For example, you might lessen your holdings in consumer discretionary and industrials, which have been strong, in favor of health care and consumer defensive. While this shift may feel safer, know that you would limit your upside if current \u201cmomentum and relative strength\u201d trends hold, Gentzkow said. The jobs situation in the U.S. may remain unclear for several weeks, which is another reason to resist any big investing changes. Typically, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, estimates the number of new nonfarm jobs in the economy shortly after the close of each month. As more data becomes available, the BLS revises those estimates.  New data releases and the revisions have been on hold since the government shutdown began in October.  Labor market concerns made headlines in August, after the BLS made big changes to previously reported May and June jobs data. The updated numbers indicated the U.S. economy added only 33,000 new jobs in those two months\u2014258,000 less than originally reported. After another downward revision announced in September, the data showed a loss of 13,000 jobs in June. As of the last report released, the economy added 79,000 jobs in July and 22,000 in August.  The Fed cut interest rates in September and again in October.  Until the flow of government employment data is restored, analysts and decision-makers will rely on private data like the ADP National Employment Report. The monthly report estimates changes in U.S. private employment and excludes government jobs.  The September ADP report showed a loss of 32,000 jobs. A preliminary estimate for the four-week period ending on Oct. 11 indicates an increase of 14,250 jobs. ","label":1}

Because it offers robust margins, minimal debt in its capital structure, and strong momentum. But most important of all - because of its connection with gold.  The stock has ridden the surge in gold prices - with the correlation between gold and Newmont hovering around 70%. Analysts now project gold can climb to roughly $4,600-$5,000 \/oz by end of 2026, citing central-bank buying and safe-haven demand.

Dodgers on Monday were already talking about winning three in a row. \"We are a mother effing dynasty, baby,\" screamed Dodger outfielder Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez at the Dodger Stadium event, which seemed to fill almost all of the 56,000 seats. \"Everybody has been about a dynasty. How about three in six years? How about back-to-back?\" And the team's biggest star, Shohei Ohtani, speaking in English, which he does rarely, said, \"I am so happy to be part of this team. I'm ready to get another ring next year.\" Only two teams, the New York Yankees (three times) and the Oakland A's (once) have ever won three consecutive World Series titles. Another Dodger Japanese pitching star, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who was the series' MVP after winning three games, also spoke in English. \"I love the Dodgers. I love Los Angeles.\"                  Yoshinobu Yamamoto #18 of the Los Angeles Dodgers (center) celebrates with teammates after defeating the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in game seven of the 2025 World Series at Rogers Center.

I don't know what to say right now,\" said Dodger fan Charles Ryan as he waited for the players to go by along the 1.7-mile route. Many people took the day off from work and brought their children to take part in the festivities.

After the players strolled onto the field through an opening in center field, rapper Ice Cube, a huge Dodger fan, drove a vintage blue Chevy convertible containing the World Series trophy. The Dodgers, with baseball's biggest payroll, have used their financial ability to pluck some of the most sought-after and most expensive free agents on the market.

One of the most touching moments of the rally occurred when Miguel Rojas, an unexpected hero of the series, addressed the crowd. Rojas, a light-hitting infielder, hit an unexpected home run in the ninth inning of Game Seven to tie it and force extra innings, when the Dodgers won it.

YouTube did not hold back in its latest jab at Disney. In a statement published on Monday, YouTube TV took a swipe at ABC News, outlining why it won't restore the news outlet's stations on its platform for 24 hours. On Monday, Disney sought to thaw weekslong tensions with the Google-owned platform after the two companies failed to negotiate a new contract that would let YouTube TV subscribers watch Disney's television channels. A Disney spokesperson said in a statement that the company asked YouTube to bring back ABC for Tuesday's US Election Day. Voters head to the polls for key local contests, including the New York City mayor's election and California's Proposition 50, which decides whether officials can redraw the state's congressional map. \"We believe in putting the public interest first and hope YouTube TV will take this small step for their customers while we continue to work toward a fair agreement,\" Disney said. But YouTube was quick to decline the offer. \"Unfortunately, your proposal would permit us to return Disney's ABC stations only for a day and will cause customer confusion among those who may briefly see ABC on YouTube TV only to lose it again shortly after,\" YouTube said in a Monday blog post. The company also made it clear that news viewers have alternatives. \"There are plenty of other options for customers \u2014 election news information is very widely available across other broadcast stations and news networks on YouTube TV, as well as on the main YouTube service, for free,\" the blog post read. \"In fact, on the last two US election days, the vast majority of tuned in YouTube TV subscribers chose not to watch ABC,\" it added. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. YouTube's statement is the latest in its standoff with the streaming giant. Since October 30, Disney's networks, including the ABC and ESPN channels, have been unavailable on YouTube TV as part of a blackout. Disney has said YouTube TV isn't willing to pay the market rate. Meanwhile, YouTube TV has said that Disney's proposal would force it to raise prices again, while helping Disney-controlled rivals like Fubo and Hulu + Live TV. YouTube TV promised to give its customers a $20 credit if the blackout drags on. This high-profile carriage fight meant that YouTube TV subscribers couldn't watch ESPN's college football games this past weekend or its popular pregame show, \"College GameDay,\" through the platform. A carriage fight is a disagreement over the right to \"carry,\" or retransmit, a broadcaster's signal. Disney and ESPN have tried to win over fans by stirring up outrage against YouTube TV. ESPN enlisted megastars like Stephen A. Smith, Scott Van Pelt, and Mike Greenberg \u2014 the three personalities posted short clips on social media informing viewers of the dispute and directing them to a Disney-owned website to petition YouTube TV. The blackout and viewers switching over to competitor news or sports channels put Disney in a tough spot. Following ABC's decision to take Kimmel off the air, Disney has been recovering from a widely followed boycott that cost it millions of streaming subscribers.     Jump to","label":0}

AI is fueling a surge in cyberattacks. Startups, especially in Israel, are rushing to use their own AI to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. The latest is Tel Aviv-based Daylight, which closed a $33 million Series A round led by Craft Ventures, the San Francisco firm cofounded by David Sacks, backer of SpaceX and cofounder of PayPal.  The funding comes as Google is attempting to close its $32 billion acquisition of Wiz, another Israeli-founded security firm, in what could be one of the largest cybersecurity deals ever. Funding for Israeli security startups nearly doubled last year compared to 2023, reaching a level equal to 40% of the entire US cybersecurity funding market, according to data from Startup Nation Central. Other investors in Daylight's round include Bain Capital Ventures, Maple VC, and a who's who of Israeli cybersecurity founders, including Wiz's Assaf Rappaport, Torq's Ofer Smadari, and Armis's Yevgeny Dibrov. Daylight declined to share the valuation of the round. When Daylight launched at the beginning of the year, cofounders Hagai Shapira and Eldad Rodich didn't set out to raise another round of funding so soon. They'd just closed a seed round, hired their first engineers, and shipped their first product, an AI-driven managed detection and response platform. Then Craft Ventures reached out with an offer too good to resist. \"You don't want to take more money than you can handle,\" Shapira told Business Insider on a Zoom call from Tel Aviv. \"But we're proving every day that we deserve that trust of our investors and, of course, the trust of our customers.\" Like Wiz's founders, Shapira and Rodich are veterans of Unit 8200, Israel's elite intelligence unit that has produced some of the country's most successful tech entrepreneurs. Vega, another young Israeli cybersecurity company founded by 8200 veterans, announced $65 million in funding at a valuation of $400 million in September. In the first quarter of this year, cyber attacks increased by nearly 50% per organization, according to Check Point Research. The prevalence of attacks makes it a good time to be in the cybersecurity business, said Kevin Gabura, a principal at Craft Ventures. \"AI has had a really disruptive impact on cybersecurity, and so that's why you're seeing a lot of new companies actually being built here,\" said Gabura. \"You've got all these AI agents that are going after different aspects of cybersecurity operations.\" Gabura said he was confident enough to offer Daylight a preemptive term sheet based on its early traction; The company already has dozens of clients across the US and Europe, including The Motley Fool, Cresta, and McKinsey Investment Office. \"They had shipped a ton of product in just the short time that they've been around,\" said Gabura. We spent a lot of time talking to people who have used the product, and the feedback was really strong.\"        Jump to","label":0}

Among the many who have tracked gold's stunning rally this year, Noura Sakkijha has an especially personal \u2014 and economic stake \u2014 in the game. As the cofounder and CEO of the jewelry brand Mejuri, Sakkijha said that the company's direct-to-consumer model has helped it stay nimble amid soaring gold prices, in part by offering customers an entirely new material. Investors have flocked to gold, driving its price up by more than 50% this year. Prices of the safe-haven asset hit a record of nearly $4,400 per ounce in October, before falling sharply and settling to around $4,000 per ounce. Silver prices have also gone up and reached an all-time high last month. \"You're operating at a completely different cost for all fine jewelry brands,\" Sakkijha told Business Insider. Coming from a family of jewelers, Sakkijha said maintaining accessible pricing is important. With its direct-to-consumer model, Mejuri works with manufacturers and sells jewelry straight to consumers, which Sakkijha said has come in \"very, very handy right now, because what you need is agility.\" The brand \u2014 popular on social media and known for accessible luxury, like classic chain necklaces that cost a few hundred dollars \u2014 can more easily adjust its prices, she said. Mejuri has introduced 10-karat gold, in addition to its typical 14-karat gold, silver, and vermeil, which is gold-plated jewelry. Sakkijha also said Mejuri has started offering some products in vermeil that it used to only sell in 14-karat gold. The metals make a big price difference \u2014 for example, Mejuri's \"bold huggie hoops\" cost $268 in 14-karat gold, $198 in 10-karat gold, $78 in sterling silver, and $78 in vermeil. \"The goal for us is to make sure that we always have well-designed products that are very well made at great prices,\" Sakkijha said. Sakkijha estimated that Mejuri has raised prices by less than 10% across collections in the past year, in part to cope with changing material costs. The price change varies by item, the company told Business Insider, meaning some have seen a larger increase. Mejuri is based in Canada, but Sakkijha said that the majority of its market is in the US, meaning she's had to react to tariffs and trade tensions quickly. Mejuri manufactures globally, and Sakkijha said they've adjusted some production plans in response to evolving tariffs. Though the skyrocketing gold prices are far from ideal, Sakkijha said Mejuri is in a good spot, since it's known for dainty jewelry that uses less material. \"We design into these price points that we know are very important to our customers,\" she said.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Aziz Ansari's career has led to him becoming a key player on the hit NBC sitcom \"Parks & Recreation,\" developing and starring in his own Emmy Award-winning Netflix series with \"Master of None,\" and headlining a whole bunch of stand-up comedy specials. Now, the multi-hyphenate has made his feature directing debut with the dramedy \"Good Fortune,\" which resembles\u00a0a somewhat darker update of the Frank Capra-directed holiday classic \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" In addition to writing, directing, and producing, Ansari also stars in the film as Arj, a struggling Los Angeles man who's barely getting by to make ends meet, only for his life to take a turn for the even worse upon making connections with his wealthy tech investor boss Jeff (Seth Rogen). In an attempt to show Arj that Jeff's wealth isn't everything it's cracked up to be, the delightfully charming yet naive angel Gabriel (Keavu Reeves) allows the pair to live in one another's shoes. But complications arise when it seems that this divine switcheroo has seemingly solved Arj's problems all at once. \"Good Fortune\" hasn't been doing so hot at the box office, having only grossed $15.8 million worldwide against a $30 million budget at the time of writing. It has, however, received a largely positive critical reception, with \/Film's Michael Boyle praising Reeves' performance and calling him the movie's clear standout in his review. Luckily, if you've been unable to catch \"Good Fortune\" in theaters, you'll soon (very soon, in fact) have a chance to watch Ansari's directorial debut from the comfort of your own home. Indeed, \"Good Fortune\" is now set to become available to either rent or purchase on most PVOD platforms beginning November 7, 2025, although physical media heads will have to hold off on buying it until December 9, 2025. Per usual, should you decide to check out \"Good Fortune\" on any of the popular PVOD platforms like Prime Video, Apple TV, or Fandango at Home, it'll cost $19.99 to rent and $24.99 to buy (at least in the early going). Alternatively, those hoping to acquire the movie on physical media will need to prepare themselves to pay a literal good fortune of their own. According to the folks at Lionsgate, the 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD versions of the film will come with some hefty price tags. The traditional Blu-ray rounds up to $39.99, while the DVD comes out to $29.99. And then, if you purchase the 4K exclusive combo pack from Amazon, it will come out at $34.99. Just to make things even more confusing, the film's special features are an assortment of exclusives across the many platforms (although I expect most of them to be on the various physical media formats).

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Written byShigeki Mori Edited byOihyun Kim A powerful consortium comprising Japan\u2019s major securities firms, led by SBI Holdings, and trust banks, will fundamentally reshape equity trading. Beginning in 2026, Japanese retail and institutional investors can trade tokenized versions of public company shares 24\/7, with minimum purchase sizes as low as 1 Japanese yen (JPY). The rollout marks one of the most significant regulated applications of blockchain technology in traditional finance to date. The initiative involves transforming traditional listed equities into Security Tokens (STs) and enabling their trading on an industry-wide infrastructure. The consortium is tokenizing existing corporate shares, an asset class measured in trillions of dollars. Moreover, clear regulatory frameworks for digital securities make Japan a standout, enabling institutional players to participate within existing compliance structures. As one analyst noted on X: \u201cRWA Regulation 101: US: GENIUS Act \u2192 stablecoins; UK: building a full FSMA-based crypto regime; UAE: already licensing tokenized real estate; Asia: corridor pilots & AML-first rules. What else?\u201d RWA Regulation 101:> US: GENIUS Act \u2192 stablecoins> UK: building a full FSMA-based crypto regime> UAE: already licensing tokenized real estate> Asia: corridor pilots & AML-first rulesWhat else? The proposed system challenges established market norms. These typically require stock purchases in 100-share units or other minimum lot sizes, often restricting access for smaller, retail investors. The digital securities system introduces unprecedented fractional ownership and liquidity levels by setting the minimum investment threshold at just JPY 1 and enabling continuous, round-the-clock trading. Therefore, the initiative is a strategic effort by Japan\u2019s finance sector to align its offerings with the expectations of the digital generation and encourage a widespread transition from savings to investment.  For instance, the perceived scarcity of regulated 24\/7 on-chain equity trading venues worldwide further highlights the significance of the Japanese initiative. \u201cThere is no other venue in the world where you can trade equities onchain, 24\/7. This will be the only way hundreds of millions of households get exposure. Massive rerating of global markets incoming.\u201d@ThinkingUSD commented. Incase you're too slow to realize, this is a true 0 to 1 moment for Global Finance.There is no other venue in the world where you can trade equities onchain, on a CLOB, permissionlessly, 24\/7. This is the only relevant equity market in the world open through the weekend.There\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/R0yvO0LKIO Industry experts expect global regulators and exchanges to scrutinize Japan\u2019s model.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"It was big news when Josh and Benny Safdie, the brotherly filmmaking duo behind \"Heaven Knows What,\" \"Good Time,\" and \"Uncut Gems,\" decided they were going to venture out and work on their own projects. Where Josh teamed up with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet on \"Marty Supreme,\" Benny opted to collaborate with Dwayne 'The Rock\" Johnson for \"The Smashing Machine.\" Based on the 2002 documentary of the same name, the film is a dramatization of the experiences of extreme wrestler and MMA fighter Mark Kerr as he deals with various personal and professional hurdles. In addition to painting a tender portrait of a man on the ropes, the complex character study also gives a peek into the toxic relationship between Kerr and his girlfriend, Dawn Staples (Emily Blunt). Despite all of the hype around \"The Smashing Machine\" being Johnson's career revitalization, the film sadly couldn't muster much public interest. It not only flopped at the box office, it also stands as the worst opening weekend for a Johnson-led film ever, garnering $6 million against a $50 million budget. \"The Smashing Machine,\" in spite of this, has earned plenty of accolades, with \/Film's Bill Bria praising it as an MMA drama that packs a subversive punch. It also won the Silver Lion at the 82nd Venice International Film Festival. If you didn't get to see the film during its short theatrical window, then you now have the chance. As of November 4, 2025, A24 has made \"The Smashing Machine\" available already on PVOD markets like Prime Video, YouTube, and Fandango at Home, along with a Blu-ray pre-order on its website. If you decide to check out \"The Smashing Machine\" on any of the PVOD platforms, renting it will come out to a $19.99 price tag, while purchasing a digital copy will come out to $24.99 (at least in the early going). But if you're a physical media person who wants to add Safdie's tender MMA drama to your collection, both the 4K Ultra HD and Blu-ray are currently available for pre-order on the A24 website. Although there's no official release date, they're expected to ship sometime in January 2026. This follows the A24 practice of releasing physical copies of its movies in-house, as it can give it the packaging and presentation an extra boost. In terms of bonus features, those unfortunately appear to be exclusive to the Blu-ray release. Specifically: In spite of \"The Smashing Machine\" being a financial disappointment, it hasn't deterred Safdie from working with Johnson. Indeed, the pair are set to reunite over at Amazon MGM with\u00a0\"Lizard Music,\" an adaptation of Daniel Pinkwater's sci-fi\/fantasy children's novel.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Elon Musk went on Joe Rogan's podcast to explain, with total confidence and zero evidence, that the government shutdown is happening because blue states are stealing \"hundreds of billions\" in federal money to buy votes from undocumented immigrants. Joe Rogan agreed, because that's what Joe Rogan does when someone richer than him talks long and loud enough. \"The entire basis for the government shutdown is that\u2026 the Trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of, like, hundreds of billions of dollars to fund illegal immigrants in the blue states, in all the states really,\" Musk\u00a0said\u00a0to host Joe Rogan. What went unmentioned, however, was the actual dispute at the heart of the shutdown: the expiration of subsidies that will dramatically increase health insurance costs for millions of Americans. \u2026 Musk claimed that \"New York and California would be bankrupt\u2026 without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals, to create a massive financial incentive for illegals.\" When Rogan asked how, Musk responded that these states \"wouldn't be able to balance their state budgets, and they can't issue currency like the Federal Reserve can.\" Contrary to Musk's claims, California and New York would not \"be bankrupt\" without funding from the federal government. Both states pay significantly more in taxes to the federal government than they receive back in federal funding. The federal government relies on states like California and New York to subsidize states that are less wealthy. In this latest episode of America's favorite misinformation variety show, Musk and Rogan blamed immigrants for everything from budget shortfalls to democracy itself, apparently unaware that states like California and New York actually fund the rest of the country. As per the norm, Rogan didn't ask for proof; he just leaned in and let Musk improvise his way through another TED Talk for people who think \"research\" means \"ketamine.\" Previously:\u2022 Firefighters refuse to back up Elon Musk's misinformation\u2022 Elon Musk changes name to 'Lorde Edge' on Twitter and polls audience on Tesla stock dump\u2022 If it isn't drugs, Musk is a piece of work\u2022 Elon Musk to CA factory employees: Back to work.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"             POPULAR SEARCHES                         BROWSE BY            Maybe it\u2019s the trade deadline bringing a sense of closure. Maybe it\u2019s the marker of getting over the season\u2019s half-way point. But it seems like teams are making big decisions about their quarterbacks\u2019 futures. Yes, I\u2019m thinking about Miami and Arizona. This week might end up serving as a turning point for Kyler Murray and Tua Tagovailoa \u2014 where we look back and say: That was the beginning of the end. We\u2019ll talk about all that and more in this week\u2019s QB Stock Market. In these QB rankings, I\u2019m focused on monitoring the fluctuations of a QB\u2019s performance throughout the season. No one \u2014 not even Drake Maye \u2014 is safe at the top. No one \u2014 not even Dillon Gabriel \u2014 is stuck at the bottom. There is room for quick ascent \u2014 and rapid decline. One question holds most important: What have you done for your team lately? Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 That was yet another big win for the Bills against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. It\u2019s one worth celebrating. As always, there\u2019s the looming question:\u00a0OK, but can Buffalo finally do it in the postseason? You know \u2026 when it matters?\u00a0 Allen is 5-1 against Mahomes in the regular season. But Mahomes is 4-0 against Allen in the postseason. So the playoff question is a fair one. But one to save for a later date. In the meantime, this was an efficient game from Allen in a season where he hasn\u2019t met the superhuman standards that he set for himself in years past, particularly in 2024, his MVP campaign. And while receivers Keon Coleman and Joshua Palmer have yet to deliver on what GM Brandon Beane must have hoped for them, tight end Dalton Kincaid had himself a great game \u2014 amid a great season. And he did it amid the backdrop of Buffalo's last final play last year, when he dropped what would\u2019ve been a fourth-down conversion in the final moments of a loss to Kansas City.\u00a0 Kincaid has been a difference-maker, quietly leading the Bills in receiving yards after putting up 101 yards and a touchdown against KC. If you want to see the positive, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll look: the potential emergence of a top-tier pass catcher for Allen. (And if you want a defensive positive, you can see what the Bills got by\u00a0not paying for an elite WR1 \u2014\u00a0it was the pass rush that stopped Mahomes.) But there\u2019s one place that worried me about Allen\u2019s performance, and it was the way Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo fooled the Bills QB in the fourth quarter around the 10-minute mark. These are the types of plays where Allen seems to fail pre-snap. And it\u2019s not a coincidence that it\u2019s late in this game when Spags breaks out his best blitzes. Allen had a running back to set up protection for the blitzer, but instead sent James Cook into the flat for a route, leaving the rusher a free lane. It\u2019s a tiny error. But it\u2019s one that helped the Chiefs keep things close. As both teams know all too well, the margin for error will be even smaller if the Chiefs and Bills play in January. I have four quick takeaways from Mahomes\u2019 performance against the Bills:\u00a0 There are pocket passers who are fun to watch. (Baker Mayfield is one of them.) There are pocket passers whose playmakers are fun to watch. (Daniel Jones is one of them.) I find Sam Darnold fun to watch. The Seahawks offense has Darnold looking as comfortable as he did with the Vikings, which might now be a widely held fact (especially after Sunday night\u2019s showing) but also would\u2019ve been a highly contested concept prior to the season. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak\u00a0has built something that works really well for Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet. The Seahawks were so impressive that they upended the idea that you need to play 60 minutes in the NFL. Their game against the Commanders was over in the first half. This isn\u2019t to say Darnold is fully reformed. He makes boneheaded mistakes. He tries to do too much. But those jagged elements are part of what makes him entertaining \u2014 and dangerous. In Seattle, he seems to have found the right balance. That said, I did laugh at this second-half interception, if only because it felt similar to a play he made in the first half (which was a highlight for him). It was classic Darnold, feeling himself a\u00a0little bit too much. The Commanders did what they could to fight the sophomore slump. They added a checkdown, YAC demon in Deebo Samuel \u2014 who briefly looked like more than that. They added a left tackle in Laremy Tunsil. They re-signed star receiver Terry McLaurin to keep him happy. Those well-intentioned plans fell apart when the Commanders hit the field.\u00a0 I won\u2019t call them Paper Lions, but \u2026 The team has dealt with significant injuries to McLaurin, Austin Ekeler, Deatrich Wise and Marshon Lattimore, among others. But the biggest question is about Daniels\u2019 long list of injuries this year. There were already questions about his durability coming into the NFL. At this point, it\u2019s fair to wonder if he\u2019s injury-prone \u2014 and how much those injuries will interfere with his career in the long term. As smart and as fast and as prepared as he is, he\u2019s a slender guy at 210 pounds and 6-foot-3. Compare that to Drake Maye: 6-foot-4, 225 pounds. They appear equal in talent and playmaking ability. But that\u2019s only when Daniels is healthy. The Commanders QB needs to start taking better care of himself on the field. (And it wouldn\u2019t hurt for the organization to take better care of him, too.) Will someone give Jones another shot at QB1? Will anyone be willing to trade for him? He\u2019s on his first year of a two-year deal, so there\u2019s another question: How much would the next team have to adjust his contract? But this year\u2019s \"Geno Smith Award\" is likely to go to Jones. The 49ers QB2 could be the next high-pick-bust-turned-reclamation-project, like Smith (then Mayfield, then Darnold, then Jones). Depending on the coaching situations, there are a few candidates who might have interest in Jones: the Vikings, the Saints, the Dolphins, the Browns, the Cardinals. I\u2019ll admit, my gut on Jones is that he looks like a backup-caliber quarterback. But he\u2019s playing well right now. And it\u2019s definitely trendy (and salary-cap convenient) to help guys like Jones find their way for the right price. If you\u2019d have asked me if I believed in Jones (or Darnold or Mayfield or Smith) before their comebacks, I would\u2019ve said: no.\u00a0 Maybe it could happen for Jones next year. If not 2026, then in 2027 when he\u2019s slated for free agency. The drama surrounding Brissett and Kyler Murray appears to be real. And Dallas\u2019 putrid defense helped breathe life into the NFL\u2019s most glaring quarterback controversy. Brissett did a few nice things Monday night. Most notably, he layered a throw through the teeth of the defense to hit Michael Wilson for a 50-yard touchdown. But what has seemingly made the difference for Brissett (in relief of Murray) has been his one and only interception.\u00a0 Brissett is steady. Kyler is a roller-coaster.\u00a0 And it looks like the steady hand is having a positive impact on the offense. Remember: Murray is on a contract through 2028. He\u2019s making $32.6 million in new money this year and he\u2019s slated to make $42.5 million (in new money) next year, per Spotrac. Cutting him would be costly, even with a post-June 1 designation. Trading him would work nicely, but that\u2019s only if they can find a trade partner. The bottom line is this: Brissett might not be the future in Arizona, but he\u2019s done enough to create uncertainty around Kyler\u2019s future with the Cardinals. So \u2026 it\u2019s over in Miami. I\u2019m telling you now \u2014 for anyone who doesn\u2019t already know. It\u2019s over. It has something to do with Tua\u2019s recent performances. But the fat lady sang last week when Miami parted ways with general manager Chris Grier. The Dolphins are going to keep skidding through Week 18. And probably on Black Monday (though maybe earlier), they\u2019ll part ways with coach Mike McDaniel. Sometime after that, they\u2019ll also part ways with Tua. Tyreek Hill will be gone, whether by retirement or trade. Edge Jaelan Phillips is already gone. Edge Bradley Chubb was being shopped at the deadline. Even Jaylen Waddle appeared to be available in trade talks. For the Dolphins, it\u2019s going to be a messy and expensive transition. But that\u2019s the way this is headed. The question is whether Tua can find a home as a QB1 in 2026 \u2014 or later. It\u2019s hard to find a natural fit for him to start. What\u2019s more likely is that he heads to Los Angeles or some other Shanahanian offense where he could serve as a backup. Maybe he ends up Carson Wentz. Maybe he takes over for Matthew Stafford. Crazier things have happened. But it looks like the Dolphins will bench Tua in the coming games. And after that, we might not see him again till next year.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"After being delayed due to the regulatory uncertainty of rules surrounding the Digital Market Act, Apple has now confirmed that the flashy Live Translation feature for AirPods Pro and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation will be available in the European Union from next month. The feature requires compatible AirPods paired to an iPhone capable of running Apple Intelligence, that is iPhone 15 Pro or newer. It will presumably debut in the EU as part of the iOS 26.2 update, which hit the developer beta channels today. Live Translation supports a handful of popular foreign languages including French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.  Live Translation is a free software upgrade for supported devices in supported regions. You know when you have Live Translation because a new \u2018Live\u2019 tab appears in the Translate app of the connected iPhone.  With AirPods in, a person can start a conversation with you in another language, and you hear the translated version in your ears. The iPhone Translate app can also display a transcript of the conversation, so you can speak back in English, and the other person can read the translated version off the screen.  The Live Translation mode can be activated by pressing both buds simultaneously, or initiating a conversation through the Translate app on the connected iPhone.  In theory, the feature is a fantastic idea. In practice, there is a fair amount of delay between when the person speaks and when you hear the translated version. It isn\u2019t quite as smooth as you want it to be, but it is definitely handy in a pinch. And soon, everyone who lives in the EU will also be able to use it.

If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      Incorporating foods like fatty fish, blueberries and cabbage can promote long-term kidney health.    Stop treating your kidneys like a garbage disposal. It's time to add these superfoods to your diet. You probably don't think about your kidneys often, if ever. But these small, computer mouse-sized organs are your body's elite cleanup crew. They have the massive job of filtering all of your\u00a0blood\u00a0every 30 minutes, not to mention regulating your\u00a0blood pressure\u00a0and clearing out waste. While you can't just eat one thing as a miracle cure, you can make their job easier. A\u00a0balanced diet\u00a0full of the right vitamins and minerals is the best way to give your kidneys the support they need. If you're ready to give these tiny powerhouses a hand, here are 13 superfoods that can help. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.  Add CNET  as a preferred Google source on Chrome. This\u00a0nutrient-dense vegetable\u00a0is low in potassium and sodium while containing fiber, vitamins C and K and more. Plus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more. Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids.\u00a0Omega-3 fats\u00a0may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the\u00a0National Kidney Foundation. If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has\u00a0a chart you can use\u00a0to determine the levels in specific types of fish. Even with this information available, it's alway best to consult with your doctor when considering any health and wellness changes. Like cabbage, bell peppers pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants, too. You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to meals. Cranberries help\u00a0prevent\u00a0urinary tract infections. Although these usually stay in your bladder, they can travel to your kidneys, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation. Plus, cranberries have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table. We've discussed some of the best foods for the kidneys, but you can take it a step further. What foods help repair kidneys? Blueberries\u00a0deliver. Blueberries are healthy, with high levels of antioxidants and loads of vitamin C and fiber. They can also help reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD. There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get key vitamins and minerals, plus immunity-boosting benefits. Greens can contain a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet. Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost overall wellness.\u00a0A Harvard University\u00a0study found that it may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer. Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose virgin or extra virgin unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil. Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic contains a specific compound called allicin. For people with CKD, allicin \u2014 an active compound found in garlic \u2014 worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list. Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt. From the same family as garlic, onions\u00a0are another excellent, salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper. They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Cauliflower\u00a0provides crunch and plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, which is a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work. Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake. Egg whites are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis. Arugula is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types. You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example. Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help keep cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They also have plenty of antioxidants. Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":" According to a consistently reliable Apple insider, Apple is preparing to compete in the highly competitive low-cost laptop market by leveraging its iPhone and iPad-oriented A-series chips in a compact notebook.  Bloomberg\u2018s Mark Gurman claims that Apple is actively developing a budget-friendly Mac laptop to compete against entry-level Windows PCs and Chromebooks. The new device will be aimed primarily at students, businesses, and casual users who do lightweight tasks, such as browsing the web, working on documents, and basic media editing.  \u201cCode-named J700, the machine is currently in active testing at Apple and in early production with overseas suppliers,\u201d Gurman writes. \u201cThe Cupertino, California-based company plans to launch it in the first half of next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the product hasn\u2019t been announced.\u201d  Although Apple has long offered budget-friendly products across its lineup, its Mac computers have typically prioritized performance and premium designs, which necessitate higher price points. Apple\u2019s current most affordable MacBook is the 13-inch MacBook Air with M4, which starts at $999. The most affordable Mac is the Mac mini, starting at $599 without a display or accessories.  Gurman believes the anticipated low-cost Mac laptop will sell for \u201cwell under $1,000,\u201d as Apple will rely on cost-effective hardware across the board, including an iPhone processor and \u201clower-end LCD display.\u201d Speaking of the screen, Gurman says it will be smaller than the 13.6-inch display on the MacBook Air, although only \u201cslightly.\u201d If the rumors are true, this would mark the first time Apple has ever put an iPhone processor into a Mac. However, iPhone chips have generally worked well in iPad tablets, even though the iPad Pro transitioned to Apple\u2019s M-series computer chips for recent models.  As for why Apple might use an A-series iPhone chip rather than just using older M-series chips in a low-cost Mac, it stands to reason that Apple would prefer to make more of the current A-series chips than to dedicate manufacturing efforts to restarting older M-series production. The company is also committed to AI, which was not as heavy of a focus when designing the initial M-series chips.  \u201cA much cheaper Mac that maintains Apple\u2019s design and works smoothly with the company\u2019s other products could spur a new wave of Mac adoption \u2014 particularly in the US, where the iPhone dominates,\u201d Gurman speculates, noting that Apple\u2019s overall computer market share trails behind three companies, Lenovo, HP, and Dell, which all make low-cost laptops.  Beyond this expected low-cost MacBook, Gurman adds that Apple plans to release M5 and M5 Pro Mac mini configurations and an M5 Ultra Mac Studio at some point, adding that a totally redesigned MacBook Pro with M6 and an OLED touchscreen is planned for much farther down the road, late 2026 or maybe even early 2027. \u201cApple will debut two new external Mac displays as well,\u201d the analyst adds.

Stock futures are falling premarket as the government shutdown stretches into its second month amid a blitz of corporate earnings reports. Futures tied to the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 are lower by 1.4% in early trading, while futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 were down 1.1% and those tied to the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were dropping 0.7%. The three leading U.S. indexes finished Monday mixed.   Bitcoin is trading at $104,500, down from a high of more than $111,000 over the weekend. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which can impact mortgage rates and a host of other consumer loans, declined to around 4.09% after hitting 4.11% yesterday. Gold futures were mostly flat at around $4,000 an ounce.   Palantir (PLTR) shares are falling despite record quarterly results from the software company that were driven by strong demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform. Palantir reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 cents on revenue that jumped 63% year-over-year to a record $1.18 billion in the third quarter, well above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.   While Palantir still derives more of its domestic business from the government than corporations, its commercial segment drove much of the company's growth in the quarter. CEO Alex Karp called the commercial segment a juggernaut\" in a letter to investors in which he touted the company's \"otherworldly\" growth. Palantir shares, which have more than doubled this year, were lower by 7% in recent trading.   Executives at top Wall Street banks said that investors should brace for a market correction of\u00a0 more than 10% in the next 12 to 24 months. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs Group CEO David Solomon both told a Hong Kong financial summit that they see the possibility of a significant selloff in the next few months, according to news reports.   The executives said a market pullback could be a healthy effect as investors reassess the valuations of companies. The S&P 500 is trading at about 23 times forward earnings estimates, according to several data providers, above historical levels.   Starbucks (SBUX) said it was forming a joint venture with Boyu Capital to form a joint venture to operate its Chinese stores. The deal with the alternative asset management firm is valued at $4 billion, with Starbucks retaining a 40% stake in the operations. Starbucks has been seeing some success in its turnaround efforts, with same-stores sales growing in its most recent quarter after a year-and-a-half of declines. Shares of Starbucks, lower by 11% so far this year, were little changed in premarket trading.   Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) shares were plummeting after the pharmaceutical firm reported poor results for a trial of its treatment for the muscle-wasting disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The trial of 225 patients produced results that were not statistically more significant than a placebo. The company also reported a 17% year-over-year decline in revenue to just under $400 million. Shares of Sarepta were lower by more than 35% in premarket trading.

This time, though, visions of the Grabber lead the two traumatized teens to Alpine Lake, a Christian youth camp that harbors some disturbing secrets that come to haunt the sibling pair in unexpected ways. \"Black Phone 2\" is essentially Derrickson and Cargill's attempt to turn the Grabber into a Freddy Krueger type for a whole new generation. I don't think they quite succeed in making him that memorable, but it's hard to deny that there's an audience out there for these movies. In his review for \/Film, Rafael Motamayor even declared \"Black Phone 2\" a fantastic sequel on par with \"Dream Warriors.\" Now, despite\u00a0being one of the more prominent horror films of the Halloween season, \"Black Phone 2\" has already made its way home. As of November 4, 2025, Universal Home Entertainment has released the snowy sequel on PVOD platforms like Prime Video, YouTube, and Fandango at Home. Physical media folks, however, will have to wait a bit longer until the 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD is released on December 23, 2025. \"Black Phone 2\" serves as yet another great example of studios getting in the way of their own success. The 2025 horror sequel is a clear-cut box office hit\u00a0(having already made\u00a0$105 million against a $30 million budget in less than three weeks), yet Universal has opted to truncate the potential success of the film's theatrical run by allowing folks to watch it at home early. It just seems so silly for the studio to do this while the movie's still in the top two at the domestic box office. But should you feel compelled to seek out \"Black Phone 2\" at home, the PVOD rental price is currently at $19.99, while the purchase of a digital copy will set you back $24.99. The sequel also comes with an\u00a0assortment of bonus material, although your access to those will vary depending on the retailer you bought it from. They include: In the event you don't own either of the \"Black Phone\" films, there's already a bundle deal on Fandango at Home that's going for $29.99. It seems like a steal to get the first movie for an additional $5.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Motorola launches its budget 2026 Android phones early, costing less than $200.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. While companies like OnePlus and Xiaomi focus on new high-end Android phones for 2026, Motorola is unveiling its first budget-friendly smartphones as part of the Moto G family. These phones will be available before the end of the year and cost less than $200, making them likely choices for anyone in the market for a cheap Android phone, especially as we approach Black Friday. The Moto G 2026 and Moto G Play 2026 are very similar phones, both in terms of design and specs. As for what's the same, they both feature 6.7-inch 120Hz LCD panels and Motorola's more recent design language, which resembles many of the company's latest phones. They even share the same dimensions and weight.      They're powered by the MediaTek 6300, a decent mid-range chip that should be able to handle daily use just fine, even with 4GB of RAM (which can be expanded to 12GB via RAM Boost). It's actually a big deal for the Moto G Play 2026, as it's the first time a Play model will come with 5G connectivity. It's the same chip powering the Moto G Power 2025, so hopefully that translates to a better experience than the last Play model we reviewed. There's also a slight bump in battery capacity, which is now 5,200mAh. Motorola promises up to two days of battery life, which is certainly a draw. Finally, both phones run Android 16 out of the box, with support for Gemini and Circle to Search. Motorola is promising two OS upgrades and three years of software updates, which is a very slight but welcome improvement.      The body and heart are the same, but what separates the Moto G 2026 from the Moto G Play 2026? Firstly, the camera system is likely a bit better on the former, as the Moto G 2026 sports a 50MP primary camera, while the Play makes do with a 32MP sensor. Other sensors are essentially auxiliary (macro, ambient light) and likely serve only to give the phones the appearance of having more robust camera systems than they actually do, but Motorola promises \"stunning results\" with the AI-powered cameras. The Moto G 2026 also has double the storage at 128GB and supports faster charging, 30W wired versus 18W on the Moto G Play 2026. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android      Finally, the Moto G 2026 will be available in two Pantone colors: Slipstream and Cattleya Orchid, the latter of which is a very vibrant purple-like hue. The Moto G Play is only available in Pantone Tapestry, which is a rather muted blue. As is the norm with Motorola phones, you can expect faux leather to cover the rear, while Gorilla Glass 3 protects the front.      The Moto G Play 2026 is the cheapest model of the two and will be available first. Starting at just $169, it'll hit retailers and carrier stores on November 13, expanding availability in the coming months. Canadian buyers can also grab the phone on the same day via Motorola's online store. The Moto G 2026 will be available for $199 at Motorola.com and select carrier stores starting December 11, with availability expanding to more retailers and carriers on January 15. Canadian buyers can also get the phone on December 11 on Motorola's storefront.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Apple recently refreshed its Vision Pro headset with the M5 chip, but how different is it from the original version? This guide lists all of the differences between the two models. While the latest model sees no hardware changes beyond the chip and the headband, the M5 chip unlocks a series of new capabilities for the Vision Pro, such as a higher refresh rate, more rendered pixels, and longer battery life.  The M5 Vision Pro isn't classified as a second-generation model, which reveals how incremental Apple sees the update over the original M2 version. Nevertheless, it refines the headset in specific ways. All of the differences between the two models are as follows:    The new chip is dramatically more powerful and efficient, making the device tangibly faster at tasks that push multiple subsystems at once, such as creating spatial photos or loading widget-heavy environments. Latency is reduced and overall responsiveness improves enough to feel noticeable in daily use. While there aren't many workflows that can take full advantage of the M5 chip's capabilities, it provides considerable performance headroom and strengthens the headset's technical foundation for future versions of visionOS and third-party apps. That said, the upgrade is still bound by the same cameras, sensors, and displays as the \u200cM2\u200c model. The new 120 Hz refresh rate and 10% increase in rendered pixels subtly enhance motion smoothness and realism, but they don't transform the experience. Battery life is also slightly better, yet none of these shifts make the \u200cM2\u200c version feel obsolete. The software remains identical across both models, and since the new Dual Knit Band is available separately, comfort is also not a differentiator. For current owners, the decision to upgrade hinges on use-case. Developers, designers, or professionals who push the headset to its limits will appreciate the added headroom and smoother responsiveness. For everyone else\u2014especially those who primarily use the Vision Pro for watching TV and movies, Mac Virtual Display, browsing, or light productivity\u2014the \u200cM2\u200c version still delivers the same fundamental experience. The \u200cM2\u200c model's secondary-market prices also change the equation. With no trade-in program and units now listed on eBay at substantially lower prices, the original Vision Pro has become a far more accessible entry point into Apple's spatial computing experience. That makes the M5 model the better option for new buyers who want the most longevity and headroom, but the \u200cM2\u200c model remains better value for those entering the platform for the first time or waiting for a larger generational leap.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"India\u2019s top fund manager has a word of caution for retail investors riding high on the stock market boom. Sankaran Naren, Chief Investment Officer of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, has warned that investors are unknowingly shouldering the bulk of market risk \u2014 especially those who have gone all-in on equities, mid-caps, and small-caps amid soaring valuations. \u201cThis is the risk that all of you are taking, and I don\u2019t think people are aware of it, and this is the biggest worry that I have at this point of time \u2014 that the investor is taking all the risk,\u201d Naren said. \u201cWho is the seller? The seller is private equity. Private equity knows everything about the company. They know whether that stock is overvalued at 40 times or 50 times. The promoter is selling. The promoter knows whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued,\u201d he said at the Morningstar investor conference. \u201cAll of them are selling. The multinationals are also selling today. Just imagine \u2014 it means that the entire value of all that they operate in, in their home country and everywhere in the world, is negative. So how high is the valuation in India, you know? Why are they selling? They know that the valuation in India is so big. So, who is investing? The investor,\u201d Naren said. Is there anything wrong with the fundamentals? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with the fundamentals. Is there anything wrong with the macro? No. In the last one year, the government did everything possible. They cut GST, they cut income tax, they reduced interest rates. So, everything that had to be done in a good macro environment was done by the government. But the risks are taken by the investors,\u201d Naren said. What should investors do? \u201cTherefore, they should invest in everything. They should invest in asset allocation,\u201d Naren said. \u201cThey have to be invested in debt also. But if you look at this entire audience, you will find that they are only thinking of one asset class called equity, and they are not thinking of any other asset class\u2026 the asset class called debt is totally forgotten,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk-taking for the entire country today is with the investors. People don\u2019t seem to understand this aspect very clearly. If you invest in a small-cap fund, we will invest in small-caps (shares),\u201d Naren said. It may be recalled that investors have been pumping more and more money into small and mid-cap funds in the last several quarters. While this money will have to be invested in stocks, valuations are high in the\u00a0 secondary market and IPO shares. \u201cIf you invest in mid-caps, we\u2019ll invest in mid-caps (shares). If you invest in multi-caps, we\u2019ll invest in multi-caps. So tomorrow, if at some point of time, there are costly small-cap issues, the small-cap fund manager will invest in those costly small-cap issues. If there are costly mid-cap issues, the mid-cap fund manager will invest in the costly mid-cap issues. If the SIPs come in mid-caps\u2026 there are mid-cap IPOs that are very costly. The reason would be that we are getting money in mid-caps, so they are investing in mid-cap stocks. So essentially, the risk has been transferred to all the investors.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think this part has sunk into most investors, or the distributors, or the asset allocators. If at some point of time, small-caps correct, people will say, who made the decision? The investor,\u201d Naren said. PM Narendra Modi urged women to vote in large numbers for NDA in Bihar elections. He highlighted NDA's development in the state and criticized RJD-Congress for women's safety. Home Minister Amit Shah warned against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and praised NDA's commitment to national security. Other NDA leaders promised further progress and development in the state.","label":1}

What are you waiting for?  Release Date: November 7 Editor's Notes: In an unexpected mash-up of worlds, Nike\u2019s SB skate division rebuilt the Air Max 95 from the ground up to make it a kickflip-friendly thrasher without losing its signature bulky shape.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite its well-documented struggles in recent years\u2014ranging from manufacturing setbacks to market share losses in the CPU space\u2014Intel has historically been a generous steward of shareholder capital.  In the last decade, Intel (INTC) stock has returned a notable $94 Bil back to its shareholders through cold, hard cash via dividends and buybacks. Let's look at some numbers and compare how this payout power stacks up against the market's biggest capital-return machines. As it turns out, INTC stock has returned the 19th highest amount to shareholders in history. Why should you care? Because dividends and share repurchases represent direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also signal management's confidence in the company's financial health and ability to generate sustainable cash flows. And there are more stocks like that. Here is a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. Quiz time: Over the last 5 years, which index do you think the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed - the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer might surprise you. See how our advisory framework helps stack the odds in your favor. Top 10 Stocks By Total Shareholder Return For full ranking, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you notice here? The total capital returned to shareholders as a % of the current market cap appears inversely proportional to growth prospects for reinvestments. Stocks like Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are growing much faster, in a more predictable way, compared to the others, but they have returned a much lower fraction of their market cap to shareholders. That's the flip side to high capital returns. Sure, they are attractive, but you have to ask yourself the question: Am I sacrificing growth and sound fundamentals? With that in mind, let's look at some numbers for INTC. (see Buy or Sell Intel Stock for more details) Intel Fundamentals   That's a good overview, but evaluating a stock from an investment perspective involves much more. That is exactly what Trefis High Quality Portfolio does. It is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. INTC Historical Risk Intel shows how volatile even big names can be. It fell about 74% during the Dot-Com Bubble and dropped 55% in the Global Financial Crisis. The 2022 inflation shock hit it hard too, with a 62% decline. Smaller shocks weren\u2019t kind either \u2014 around 35% in the Covid selloff and 26% in the 2018 correction. Solid fundamentals help, but Intel\u2019s history proves that no stock is immune when markets turn. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good - think events like earnings, business updates, and outlook changes. Read INTC Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance statistics.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Azad Engineering began operations in 2008 with a single Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine, machining turbine components for a Europe-based energy company. Seventeen years later, it now boasts hundreds of CNC machines and has a market capitalisation of Rs 10,000 crore. The company\u2019s stock trades at a P\/E ratio exceeding 100x, reflecting the market\u2019s confidence in its capabilities.  So what does Azad Engineering do differently, and are the valuations justified? The company\u2019s business model is strategically built around two high-entry-barrier segments: Energy and Oil & Gas (launched in 2008) and Aerospace and Defence (launched in 2017).  Both require mission-critical precision where there is no margin for error, creating a deep \u201czero-defect\u201d manufacturing culture. This segment remains the company\u2019s primary revenue anchor, contributing Rs 358.6 crore or 79.1% of the total revenue in FY25, growing 26% YoY. Azad Engineering is a Tier-1 supplier of critical components like compressor airfoils, specialised machine parts, and critical machine parts. Its customer base consists of global giants such as GE Vernova, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Siemens Energy, which collectively control about 75% of the global land-based turbine market. The key entry barriers are the long qualification cycles for these products. Because these are critical parts that go into gas turbine engines, they have to be accurate to 5-10 microns, thinner than a human hair, which typically measures 50-120 microns. Customer stickiness is exceptionally high, with key client engagement exceeding 10 years.  This segment\u2019s growth is supported by a strong order book of approximately Rs 3,500 crore. Moving up the value chain is also driving growth. A key accomplishment has been qualifying critical components for the combustion section of turbines. This is supported by significant capacity expansion, including dedicated, newly inaugurated lean manufacturing facilities for Mitsubishi (March 2025) and a GE Vernova facility (substantially completed in FY25). At least six more lean manufacturing facilities are currently under construction. This segment is the company\u2019s designated key growth engine. It delivered a breakout FY25, with revenue surging 84.1% YoY to Rs 80.7 crore. The segment now comprises 17.9% of total revenue, up from 12.9% a year ago. Under this segment, Azad Engineering manufactures life-critical components, including engine assemblies, APU parts, actuators, unison rings, and structural parts. These components are vital for major global platforms like the Boeing 737, Airbus A320, and A350 families. Key customers include global OEMs like Rolls-Royce and Honeywell Aerospace.  The segment\u2019s future growth is supported by an order book of approximately Rs 1,720 crore. The rapid revenue growth is the payoff from completing long and arduous qualification cycles. With these qualifications now secure, management has highlighted that the company is shifting from development to a full-scale production ramp-up, backed by long-term contracts and deep OEM relationships. Azad Engineering\u2019s order book now exceeds Rs 6,000 crore, more than 14x FY25 revenue. Management indicated that the order book execution is tied to ongoing capacity expansions, including the inauguration of dedicated lean manufacturing facilities and a state-of-the-art forging plant in Tunki Bollaram, Hyderabad. Short-term (next 12-18 months): Focus on stabilising 8 dedicated lean facilities, with 3 additional units at Tunki Bollaram going live in FY26. Capex deployment of ~Rs 450 crore in FY26 will support incremental revenue realisation from existing orders, targeting 25-30% YoY revenue growth in FY26. Medium-term (FY26-FY27): Revenue from capacity additions (Rs 250-300 crore capex driving Rs 550 crore incremental revenue) could push annual revenue to Rs 1,000 crore. All facilities are projected to stabilise within 12 months. Long-term (next 5-6 years): The full order book is anticipated to be realised over this horizon, aligned with contract durations and global OEM demand in energy, aerospace, defence, and oil and gas. However, not all order books are equal. These are not necessarily firm purchase orders with delivery timelines. While customers agree to purchase X parts at Y price, delivery windows may depend on upstream forecasts. If OEMs like Mitsubishi, Hitachi, or Rolls-Royce face production bottlenecks, Azad Engineering\u2019s order execution may be impacted. This matters for valuations. Azad Engineering is an exceptional company trading at an exceptional multiple. At 108X, the price per share of the company implies strong embedded growth, a highly moated business model, highly capable and trustworthy management, and a strong balance sheet.  Management is guiding for 30% revenue growth with potential EBITDA margins expansion, which could lead to higher EPS growth versus revenue. The company boasts 1,400+ qualified parts, and switching costs for customers are significant. The only chink in the armour: there is no room for disappointment. Any prediction errors or delays on the OEM\u2019s side could see a few weak quarters. This could lead to a sharp correction in price and saner multiples.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"It's basically gambling.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.       So many tech products! It can help if you take a breath, a step back, and think about what you really need. We're here to help you do just that! There are plenty of tech products out there. Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle. Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything. Often, it's good to take a step back and see what's inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next. We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process. Early Black Friday sales are already here, and we'll see even more in the next few weeks. Should you go for it or wait? Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. That familiar itch. You know the one. The subtle desire for that sleek new rectangle nestled in your pocket. But a question lingers: should you jump now, in early November's relative calm, or brace yourself for the legendary, chaotic Black Friday deals that you're sure are coming on November 28th? It can seem like a modern tragedy in miniature. To buy, or not to buy? That is the question. But this isn't Hamlet. It's a parsing of promotional promises, and a glimpse into a future where your new pocket companion is smarter, sleeker, and of course, slightly more demanding of your wallet. It's just like a weekend in Vegas; a gamble, and trying to sort it out is like reading digital tea leaves.      The pull of immediate gratification is a powerful force. Is your current phone teetering on the brink, ready to draw its final breath? A cracked screen spider-webbed across your vision, a battery that drains faster than it can charge, or so sluggish that tapping is a waiting game? When it's that bad, the immediacy of a new device trumps the potential savings of Black Friday. Then there's the anxiety effect. The fear that your phone, the one you've been meticulously researching, will vanish in a digital puff of smoke during the Black Friday frenzy. The algorithms predict demand, but sometimes, even the most sophisticated models are just wrong, and the stock sells out instantly. Buying early can seem like a form of self-care, but you need to make sure. And let's not forget the retailers, ever eager to dip into our wallets. The \"early Black Friday\" sales are already upon us. It's a gamble, a game of chicken with consumerism. Are these truly discounted delights, or a clever way to exploit our temptation? Occasionally, a diamond emerges from the rough \u2014 a genuine deal that warrants immediate action. We worry that we'll miss it when we really need a new phone.      Black Friday sales are like a Siren song. They've been etched into our consciousness, synonymous with substantial savings. We're talking price cuts averaging between 30% and 38% on electronics. And while some might scoff at percentages, consider the sheer volume of devices on offer and the potential for significant savings on everything from flagship marvels to budget-friendly workhorses. Chances are someone will have the phone you want on sale by Black Friday. Then there's the dark magic of carrier deals. \"Free\" phones dangled like a digital carrot, contingent on new lines, trade-ins, or the bundling of complicated Byzantine plans. A bargain, sometimes one that many find too tempting to resist. And it's no longer just a single day. The \"Cyber Week\" period, stretching from late October through Cyber Monday, has morphed into a sprawling treasure hunt, an extended period of promotions and promises. The sheer volume of what's on offer is overwhelming, but it also presents a big opportunity for a discerning, dedicated shopper. Armed with a little research and a dash of skepticism, you can navigate the deal deluge and come out on top, feeling like you made the right decision.      So, what is the smart play? What is the right Black Friday strategy? Be aware that if you crave the latest and greatest, you'll likely have to pay a premium. Black Friday may offer carrier deals on new devices, but the real savings often lie in last year's flagships. Consider your typical 2-3 year upgrade cycle. Is a slightly older, yet still powerful, device a worthwhile compromise? If your phone is on its last legs, don't suffer. Explore existing early Black Friday deals or strong carrier trade-ins now. You might be able to save a few dollars had you waited, but you can't be sure. If maximum savings are your ultimate goal, then Black Friday is your battleground. But be a savvy shopper: Do your homework: Research prices before the sales begin. Read the fine print: Especially for \"free\" or heavily subsidized phones. Consider older flagships or refurbished options for amazing value. Most importantly: Track prices to ensure a genuine discount, whether you're buying now or waiting a few weeks for the \"big sale\". Ultimately, the decision is yours. Decide what matters most \u2013 immediate gratification, or the deepest possible discount on a slightly older model. Black Friday has evolved into an extended event, and shopping for big-ticket items has become more challenging than ever. Me? If I needed a phone right now and a suitable device showed up at the right price today, I'd buy it. If I just wanted something new or could hold out for a few weeks, I'd wait to see what was on offer for Black Friday.

Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software, and in the world of legal technology, Thomson Reuters is trying to stay off the menu. The company runs one of the largest hoards of legal data on the planet. It's combining this information trove with generative AI to offer new products, such as Westlaw Advantage and CoCounsel, that help automate legal work. The strategy was a hit with investors earlier this year, but since the summer, new rivals have grown bigger, bringing questions about Thomson Reuters' AI future. A potentially more troubling question: Can CoCounsel produce legal intelligence that's better than what ChatGPT and existing big AI models can already provide? In essence, is Thomson Reuters working on a \"model wrapper,\" or something with more enduring value? The company made its pitch on Tuesday when it reported quarterly results, and the response from Wall Street was tepid at best. Thomson Reuters shares fell more than 6%, leaving them down more than 30% since mid-July. The Toronto-based company said its legal unit grew organic revenue 9% to $700 million, up from 8% growth in the first half of the year. AI features drove \"double-digit growth\" across its CoCounsel products. On a call, Thomson Reuters CEO Steve Hasker told analysts that virtual \"agents\" are taking on more of a lawyer's work. The company's edge, he argued, is the one-two punch of its law library and editorial content. \"Difficult, if not impossible, to replicate,\" he added. These days, Thomson Reuters is playing defense as much as offense in this lucrative part of the tech industry. While the company has been a heavyweight in legal tech for decades, the rise of generative AI cracked the door for challengers, and a wave of new entrants has rushed in as venture funding piles up. In June, RELX's LexisNexis unit formed a strategic alliance with AI legal tech startup Harvey. The partnership brought together the world's other huge corpus of legal data with a technical team capable of applying generative AI to this information trove. Now, when lawyers fire up Harvey's service, its outputs include content and citations from LexisNexis, although a LexisNexis login is still required. In late August, another challenger emerged when legal operations platform Clio acquired vLex, a specialist in legal data, for $1 billion. Thomson Reuters's Hasker dismissed frothy AI startup valuations and bold growth claims, calling them \"squishy,\" during the call on Tuesday. He also said CoCounsel adoption is outpacing rivals. The CEO framed Thomson Reuters' moat as a powerful combination of its Westlaw legal data and human-in-the-loop editing and validation, arguing this is essential in an industry where accuracy, timeliness, and security are paramount. \"Litigation is high-stakes work with no room for error and significant consequences for being wrong,\" Hasker said. Its Westlaw product ingests more than 300 million documents a year from hundreds of court systems and tens of millions of rulings. An in-house bench of attorneys and editors turns this scramble of data into court-safe guidance, writing headnotes, verifying facts, and tagging issues to make the content easier to find. Roughly 85% of primary documents in Westlaw, such as cases and statutes, carry these editorial upgrades. The strategy now is to push beyond retrieval and summarization and into more generative services that help lawyers with more valuable tasks. That includes agentic workflows. The question hanging over everyone in legal tech, Thomson Reuters included, is whether OpenAI jumps in. This AI giant could sell a vertically packaged app to law firms and in-house teams, though there are no clear signs this is in the cards right now. Still, fears flared recently after the startup posted demos using its own models and in-house AI software for contract review, a staple of the legal tech sector. If OpenAI goes there, it could risk cannibalizing customers who already pay to build on its models. Indeed, CoCounsel uses large language models including OpenAI's GPT offerings. (OpenAI is also an early investor in Harvey, which only sharpens the tension here). Even without a bespoke legal product, OpenAI is already the gravitational competitor. Lawyers already use ChatGPT, either officially or otherwise, and other business people are increasingly tapping the chatbot for legal input. Harvey's CEO has said buyers benchmark its legal AI solutions against the latest general-purpose models. That comparison means OpenAI can shape the market by shipping upgrades, keeping the rest of the field on alert. Hasker's counterargument is that depth wins. Specialized AI tools that tap unique and accurate legal data could gain ground against more general-purpose AI offerings. \"Customers are starting to understand the difference,\" he said, before adding an honest forecast. \"Anyone who will tell you they know exactly what's going to happen in this environment is probably slightly deluded.\" Have a tip?

If there's one beauty product that most people can agree on using, it's concealer.\u00a0 I rarely go a day without wearing at least a little, and I've experimented with dozens of formulas over the years. Out of all those I've tried, I've stayed most loyal to e.l.f. Cosmetics' Hydrating Camo concealer, using it on and off since 2020. But as TikTok and other social-media platforms like to remind me, there are a lot more options on the market. So I decided to test some of the most popular concealers over the course of a week. I quickly learned what all the hype is about. Though there are dozens of concealers that TikTokers use, I chose the four drugstore options that most commonly appear on my For You Page: L.A. Girl's $6 HD Pro Conceal, Maybelline's $12.99 Instant Age Rewind Eraser, NYX's $12 Bare With Me Serum, and e.l.f. Cosmetics' $8 Hydrating Camo concealer. All four can be purchased directly from the brands on their respective websites or at stores such as Ulta Beauty and Target. I tested each concealer multiple times, applying each one over the same products in the same order every day. I started with moisturizer, then added foundation, followed by concealer and light powder.\u00a0 At $6, L.A. Girl's HD Pro Conceal is the most inexpensive concealer I've seen discussed widely online. The product has been around for years and is sold in 42 shades \u2014 including ones meant to highlight and color correct. The concealer looked OK on my skin from afar, but it also felt heavy \u2014 as if I had applied an extra layer of foundation to my face. I also found that it clung to dry patches on my skin throughout the day and didn't cover my acne all that well. The $12 product from NYX is undoubtedly one of the most popular concealers on TikTok, with videos about it having millions of combined views.\u00a0 The product is sold in 17 shades, made with ingredients like tremella mushroom, and doubles as a serum. In my experience, the concealer fulfilled most of its promises: It concealed my acne, decreased the appearance of my dark circles, and hydrated my skin. I was especially impressed with the latter, as I noticed a natural glow on my cheeks and forehead. I did notice that NYX's concealer began to crease and become cakey on areas like my chin after wearing it for a few hours. After being re-blended with a beauty sponge, though, the product looked good as new. I've been using the e.l.f. Cosmetics Hydrating Camo concealer for years, and I continue to love the product. The concealer \u2014 sold in 25 shades \u2014 hydrates my skin and feels lightweight while still providing full coverage to my redness, acne, and dry patches. You also can't beat the $8 price tag, in my opinion. That said, I was also pleasantly surprised by how much I loved Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Eraser. The concealer \u2014 sold in 16 shades \u2014 has the lightest formula out of the four I tried. I especially love that my skin is left with a vibrant glow every time I use it. Still, I don't rely on it as much as the e.l.f. Cosmetics option. I mainly reach for Maybelline's concealer on days when my acne isn't flaring and I want medium coverage. If I were only to choose one concealer out of the four I've tried, I'd stick by my longtime favorite: e.l.f. Cosmetics' Hydrating Camo concealer. I've found this option to be the best for everyday use, as it's light enough to wear with other makeup but also full-coverage enough to wear on its own.\u00a0 That said, I found things to appreciate about the other three products I used, and I'd argue that each is worth trying depending on your preferences. So while there are countless TikTok beauty trends that I'll be avoiding, viral concealers won't be one of them.          When you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Night News Reporter Donald Trump is throwing a fit as a series of polls spell trouble for him and the GOP.  The president, who likes to tell people he has the \u201cbest numbers,\u201d appeared to acknowledge that recent polls have told a different story in a fuming Truth Social post he fired off Monday afternoon. \u201cSo many Fake Polls are being shown by the Radical Left Media, all slanted heavily toward Democrats and Far Left Wingers,\u201d Trump, 79, wrote.  But he wasted no time returning to his usual number-bragging. \u201cIn the Fair Polls, and even the Reasonable Polls, I have the Best Numbers I have ever had and, why shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked, before rattling off a string of supposed accomplishments. \u201cI ended eight Wars, created the Greatest Economy in the History of our Country, kept Prices, Inflation, and Taxes down, and am setting standards for Right Track \/ Wrong Track for a future U.S.A.\u201d In a strangely ruminative turn, the elderly president then declared, \u201cFake News will never change, they are evil and corrupt but, as I look around my beautiful surroundings, I say to myself, \u2018Oh, look, I\u2019m sitting in the Oval Office!\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s post comes just hours before Americans cast their ballots in a number of critical contests across the country, which are largely polling in Democrats\u2019 favor.  The president may have also been rattled by Sunday\u2019s CNN\/SSRS survey, which recorded his highest-ever disapproval rating.  The survey of 1,245 U.S. adults found that 63 percent were unhappy with Trump\u2019s performance as president. Trump\u2019s approval rating stood at 37 percent, the worst of his second term.  The CNN poll follows a YouGov\/Economist survey from last week that found 57 percent disapproving of Trump\u2019s job performance as president, compared to just 39 percent who approved. And while he may claim to have created the \u201cGreatest Economy in the History of our Country,\u201d Americans disagree.  Nearly three-quarters of respondents in the CNN poll said the U.S. economy is in poor shape, with 61 percent believing Trump\u2019s policies have made economic conditions in the country worse. The YouGov\/Economist poll found Trump recording negative net approval for his handling of the jobs and economy (-22 percentage points) and inflation\/prices (-32).  Despite Trump\u2019s denials, inflation has risen and the job market has faltered in his second term. Republicans more broadly are facing headwinds in the polls as the government shutdown continues. An NBC News survey conducted in late October found that 52 percent of Americans blame Trump and\/or congressional Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 42 percent who blame congressional Democrats. The same survey found Democrats leading Republicans for control of Congress by 8 points\u201450 percent to 42 percent\u2014with a year to go before the 2026 midterms. Meanwhile, in New York City, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is heavily favored to win Tuesday\u2019s election. In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger has consistently led Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears in the polls. In the New Jersey governor\u2019s race, Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill remains the favorite, even as the race has tightened. On the West Coast, California voters are expected to approve a ballot measure paving the way for new congressional maps that could give Democrats five additional House seats, offsetting Texas and other red states\u2019 own gerrymandering.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Toyota is stealing the show at SEMA this year. The brand is using the annual Las Vegas trade show as a stage to debut some seriously cool stuff, including a concept car that could finally make Camrys cool\u00a0and a Toyota FJ60 Concept with 389 horsepower. Toyota went in an unexpected direction, however, with its latest concept debuted at\u00a0SEMA: a side-by-side called the Scion 01. Scion, once positioned as a no-haggle pricing brand, was discontinued in 2016. Now, Toyota is using the name on a high-horsepower, four-door side-by-side. The Scion 01 is an off-roader with massive all-terrain tires, 26 inches of suspension travel, and a modern rugged look. According to Toyota, it's powered by a high-output hybrid system and uses\u00a0a turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces more than 300 horsepower. This could be the engine that powers the latest Toyota Tacoma and 4Runner, also known as the i-Force Max, though we're not sure just how different the engine is from the production unit in those rigs. If the i-Force Max Tacoma numbers of 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque end up being anywhere close to what this Scion concept gets, it would outclass just about anything you can currently find on a side-by-side showroom floor today. It's certainly much more powerful than current leaders in the side-by-side market like the supercharged Teryx5 H2\u00a0or the wildly fun\u00a0turbocharged Can-Am Maverick R. Big power is becoming increasingly popular in the side-by-side world, so off-road enthusiasts would likely welcome the Scion 01 into the fold. Vehicles like these need to be more than just powerful, though. Thankfully, Toyota is no stranger to off-roading and has kitted the Scion 01 out properly. Toyota claims the vehicle comes equipped with a \"first-of-its-kind\" FIA-compliant cage and that the interior is fitted with four bucket seats and racing harnesses. The company hasn't released any details on the construction and specific strength of the cage, but it looks pretty beefy to say the least. Concept or not, the interior of the Scion 01 looks ready for production, with lots of touches that Toyota faithfuls will recognize from the brand's modern trucks.\u00a0Various screens, suspension adjustment knobs, and even a dashboard full of switches make the concept look much closer to production than many of the thrown-together SEMA concepts we've seen over the years. If it were to be manufactured, its features would have it competing directly with top rivals from Polaris, Can-Am, and Kawasaki. A\u00a0silent EV-only mode is also listed among the 01's talents, giving it the capability to creep away from the campsite in the morning or go on and off your trailer at home without waking the neighbors. Here's hoping that Toyota will actually build it, if only for the selfish reason that I want to get behind the wheel of a side-by-side with this much power and torque.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":"Less than a week after Strategy (MSTR) reported Q3 earnings and hinted at launching an international perpetual preferred stock, the company has brought Stream (STRE) to market, a euro-denominated perpetual preferred security, the company said on Monday. STRE will be issued at 100 euros ($115) per share with a 10% annual dividend payable quarterly in cash, STRE targets professional and institutional investors in the European Economic Area (EEA) and will list on Euro MTF Luxembourg, clearing through Euroclear and Clearstream. If dividends are unpaid, they compound quarterly, with the rate increasing by 100 basis points per period up to a maximum of 18%. Should Strategy fail to declare a dividend, it must issue a Deferral Notice and use commercially reasonable efforts over 60 days to raise funds through sales of junior securities like STRK or STRD to cover deferred payments. STRE ranks senior to STRK, STRD and MSTR common stock but junior to STRF, STRC and debt. It is non-callable except under adverse tax circumstances or if less than 25% of shares remain outstanding, and investors may require repurchase following a \"fundamental change.\" The liquidation preference adjusts daily to the greater of the 100 euros stated amount, the prior day\u2019s market price, or the 10-day average, linking its value to trading performance.

{"date":"2025-11-04","content":" \t\t\t        November 4, 2025 9:00am by \t\t\t        Barry Ritholtz   \u00a0 \u00a0 October, far from being the scariest market month, was strong pretty much anywhere you looked. There were signs that the economy is slowing, but equity markets shrugged that off \u2014 Rate Cuts! \u2014 and racked up their sixth straight month of gains. The 10-year Treasury rallied, sending yields down to 4.08%. Precious metals hit new all-time highs; Year-to-date, GLD shares were up 66% before pulling back 8.5%. And the US Dollar was strong in October relative to the rest of the G10 currencies. If you want to find reasons to be concerned, there are plenty: Valuations are extended, AI bubble chatter is everywhere; the market is concentrated at the top and gains are increasingly narrow; there are some credit concerns and minor blow-ups; sentiment is ugly. If today\u2019s pullback has you concerned, be aware of your bias towards action: You want to do something \u2014 Anything! \u2014 in response. This Action Bias is a cognitive foible that pushes you to act instead of think. You should be strategic in your planning, not tactical in your reactions. The goal is always to enhance your portfolio with high-probability decision-making. That is not the result you derive from the bias towards action. Instead, it acts as a salve to reduce your anxiety as it gives you the illusion of control. Doing something makes you feel like you have influence over random events, which you decidedly do not. If you have a plan and you follow it, you should be just fine. But be aware, this goes against millions of years of evolution that wants you to take action. We dislike inaction because it looks lazy and\/or incompetent. The thinking is, doing something is better than nothing, even if that something is ill-considered and low-probability. You probably shouldn\u2019t do anything, but if you must do something, then consider these five things you can do that will satisfy your urge to action, but not affect your actual long-term investments: 1. Sell your speculative holdings. Many of us hold a few flyers, microcaps, and ill-advised tip stocks from our brothers-in-law. If you are truly concerned, consider raising cash in your Cowboy account, but leave your main portfolio untouched. 2. Look at Individual Stock Holdings: Even indexers sometimes accumulate single stocks. We buy these for a variety of reasons, including on rare occassions, ones that actually come true. But I bet a lot of your single stock holdings were purchased with specific catalysts in mind that have failed to materialize. If you bought something a while ago waiting for a new CEO,\u00a0 an analyst upgrade, FDA drug approal, M&A, a hot new product, or some other magic bullet \u2014 and it has yet to occur \u2014 then cut it loose. You can revisit it if you need to in the New Year. 3. Crypto: Sell your shitcoins now; if that doesn\u2019t alleviate your concerns, consider reducing your Bitcoin\/Eth holdings. I sold my Bitcoin last week; this wasn\u2019t a market call or verdict on BITC, rather, I wanted some dry powder in case some opportunities opened up. 4. Sell Physical Gold: My wife has decades\u2019 worth of broken bracelets, single earrings, clasps that no longer work, and jewelry she no longer wears. Over the past few months, we twice took a haul to our favorite local shop; we received one credit of $7,200, and another of $4,100. (Note to spouses: there is no free ride, and this will probably cost you more money.) 5. Update Your Plan: After run-ups of 16.5% in the S&P 500 and 23% in the Nasdaq 100, a down day of 1 to 2% should not make you nervous. Are you close to retirement, paying for College, or some other large financial expense? Perhaps your upset stomach is alerting you to the fact that your risk you have assumed and your immediate needs are not aligned. Consult with your advisor and review your long-term plan to determine if any adjustments are necessary. Note, this is not in response to market volatility but instead, your calendar and timing. Making these modest changes will alleviate your desire to do something, but without having a major impact on your long-term plan.
