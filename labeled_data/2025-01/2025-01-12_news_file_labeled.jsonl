{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"     Prospective homebuyers could see more options in 2025, but there's no quick fix for today's housing shortage.    In today's unaffordable housing market, high mortgage rates are just one part of the problem. Prospective homebuyers are also facing a long-running housing shortage.\u00a0 More than a decade of underbuilding has left the country with a deficit of nearly 1.5 million new homes. At the same time, current homeowners holding on to their lower mortgage rates are freezing resale inventory in what's called a \"rate-lock effect.\"\u00a0 When pent-up demand outweighs supply \u2014 in this case, for both new and existing homes \u2014 prices go up.\u00a0 In 2023, active housing inventory levels hit an all-time low, but experts see that trend slowly reversing. \"Better availability of homes for sale will provide a greater balance between buyers and sellers, meaning fewer bidding wars and price escalations,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic.\u00a0 However, even with a projected 11.7% increase this year, the number of homes for sale will still lag pre-pandemic levels by 23%, according to Realtor.com. Given the longstanding undersupply of houses, conditions are likely to remain challenging for homebuyers far beyond 2025.\u00a0 \"Inventory is going to increase, but supply will still be low by historical standards,\" said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, a multiple-listing service operating across the mid-Atlantic.\u00a0 Other variables are also at play, including the Federal Reserve's projections for fewer interest rate cuts and President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies, which are expected to be inflationary and potentially drag out housing market recovery. \u00a0 At bottom, any meaningful growth in housing inventory would require a surge in resale listings and a significant uptick in new construction. Both scenarios would depend on lower inflation and continued interest rate cuts by the Fed to decrease consumer and business borrowing costs. Here's why. The COVID-19 pandemic was a clear turning point for the housing market, and not only because of the scarcity of building materials from disrupted supply chains. As the lockdowns went into effect, the demand for homes surged as families relocated for more space and millions took advantage of record-low mortgage rates around 2-3%. The result was a white-hot seller's market, with existing homes being snatched up and prices increasing rapidly. Millions of homeowners were also able to refinance and lock in bargain rates, giving them more incentive to stay put.\u00a0 Today, 84% of current homeowners have interest rates below 6%, and average mortgage rates aren't expected to dip back to sub-6% levels in 2025. If homeowners were to list their properties and move now, they'd end up with a significantly higher rate on a new home loan \u2014 and more expensive monthly payments. For households unable to afford to sell their properties in recent years, the decision to move will become less about mortgage rates and more about lifestyle changes, said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda, a home construction data company. Big life decisions, such as relocating for work, having children or getting divorced could prompt more sellers to give up their attractive interest rates in 2025.\u00a0 Housing supply has been making a gradual comeback in the last few years, though certain regions have recovered far faster than others. For instance, states with the lowest levels of supply are concentrated in and around the Midwest and Northeast, where there's less available land to build on and the rate-lock effect is stronger. But in the South and West, where new home construction is more prevalent, housing supply is nearing or even surpassing pre-pandemic levels. In areas where new construction is sparser, supply will depend on whether mortgage rates decline and provide enough incentive to bring sellers off the sidelines. Sub-6% rates aren't low enough to break the rate-lock effect entirely, but a gradual easing in borrowing costs will at least help to loosen it.\u00a0 Still, if mortgage rates plunged to record lows again (in the context of a major economic crisis), buyers would likely flood the market to compete over limited inventory, which could cause home prices to surge again.\u00a0 To improve affordability, housing prices and mortgage interest rates would ideally move toward equilibrium at the same pace. In the lead-up to the 2007 financial crisis, new home construction was on the rise, peaking in early 2006. By 2009, new construction had declined by more than 125%. Today, housing starts are nearly 50% below pre-Great Recession levels.\u00a0 Moreover, builders have been prioritizing the construction of larger, more expensive single-family homes and multifamily housing to meet changing buyer demographics and net larger profits. This shift has led to a decline in the construction of starter homes, e.g., smaller (typically 1,500 square feet or less) low-cost properties that help lower-income families access homeownership.\u00a0 \"We have been witnessing the death of the starter home for the better part of a decade,\" said Brittany Webb, director of research at the National Housing Conference. That's made it particularly difficult for first-time homebuyers to find affordable homes in areas where they want to live.\u00a0 Over the last year, homebuilders have slowly begun shifting toward constructing smaller homes with lower price tags. Newly built homes tend to cost more than existing ones, yet experts see that price gap narrowing in 2025. Still, a lot depends on supply chains, the cost of materials and interest rates.\u00a0 \"Lower rates will likely result in more favorable lending conditions and lower construction costs for homebuilders, making new projects more profitable and spurring additional home construction,\" said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. There is much uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposed economic policies and the extent to which they will affect the housing market and monetary policy in 2025.\u00a0 Some campaign proposals, such as easing land-use regulations, could encourage development and boost housing inventory. Other proposals, including tariffs and tax cuts, could cause inflation to increase and prevent the Fed from making additional rate reductions.\u00a0 Higher tariffs, particularly on lumber, are a big concern for builders, said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Homebuilders. Increased construction costs could hamper homebuilding and drive up prices on newly built houses.\u00a0 Moreover, if interest rates remain high, homebuilders will be less likely to rely on construction and development loans to fund projects, and current homeowners may be less likely to list their homes.\u00a0 Still, many have expressed enthusiasm for Trump's deregulation proposals and his promise to sell federal land to developers for housing construction. \"Homebuilders are optimistic about the extension of the 2017 tax reform and efforts to reduce regulatory burdens at all levels of government,\" said Dietz.\u00a0 State and local governments would also have to loosen their zoning and land usage laws to make building houses easier and less expensive. That could take a long time, especially in areas where residents are opposed to increased development. Prospective buyers can't do much about the high mortgage rates tying up existing inventory or the pace of homebuilding. But there are ways you can find a house within your budget, even when the inventory is tight.\u00a0 Broaden your home search: Housing inventory varies across each state and metropolitan area. So even if you're set on putting down roots in a specific location, it's worth keeping an open mind. Lesser-known areas or submarkets bordering urban centers could offer a wider range of options that better fit your budget and preferences.\u00a0 Consider fixer-uppers: If you're comfortable with the potential cost and duration of renovations, fixer-uppers or older houses tend to offer more affordable asking prices. You'll also benefit from less competition and\/or bidding wars that are common with turnkey properties.\u00a0 Look into new construction: If you live in an area where there's a lot of new construction happening -- such as in the South or Western regions where there's more available land to develop and friendlier zoning laws -- you might be able to purchase a new house for a price similar to or even less than a pre-owned one. To attract buyers, many builders are offering all kinds of incentives, including mortgage-rate buydowns, discounted prices or closing cost assistance.\u00a0","label":0}

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 9 Nuclear Power and Quantum Computing Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE:SMR) stands against the other nuclear power and quantum computing stocks. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently cautioned investors about the risks of speculating in sectors like nuclear power and quantum computing, suggesting it could take a long time before these fields generate meaningful returns. While Cramer acknowledged the optimism that accompanies the start of each new year, he pointed out that sometimes the enthusiasm surrounding certain industries is misplaced. \u201cThis year, I see two themes that I want to caution people about: nuclear power and quantum computing. Both have promise, someday, but that day is not, just not near enough to justify the current valuations for these stocks.\u201d He clarified that while he does not view quantum computing as a hoax, he considers the current expectations surrounding the technology to be overly ambitious. The market, according to Cramer, is setting a low bar for progress in this area. READ ALSO 10 S&P 500 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar and Jim Cramer Discussed These 7 Stocks \u201cLook, I believe in nuclear power, but when GE Vernova, the company that arguably has the most to gain from it, says discouraging things about an uptick in commercial nuclear power coming any time soon, when quantum computing seems very much in its infancy, well, I fear people will get hurt speculating on even the biggest companies, let alone the smaller ones.\u201d The outlook for quantum computing became more uncertain last week when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that \"very useful\" quantum computers are at least a decade away. During a Q&A at Nvidia's Consumer Electronics Show Financial Analyst event, Huang suggested that 15 years might be an optimistic estimate, while 30 years could be more realistic. This timeline left little room for optimism among investors who had hoped for quicker breakthroughs. Cramer acknowledged the speculative nature of these sectors but advised investors to be cautious and realistic about the potential for short-term gains. \u201cYou can speculate of course, but please understand that, like at all New Years, the animal spirits are in play for a few stocks and I don't want you to be trampled by wayward bulls with visions of riches in front of their greedy eyes. You own Rigetti?... Take some gains and then go out and buy yourself a nice cashmere sweater.\u201d Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Nuclear power plant with all its safety & security protocols in place. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18 Cramer expressed worry about companies like NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE:SMR) as he said: \u201cWhen it comes to nuclear power over-enthusiasm, we\u2019ve seen some of these smaller companies that offer alternatives to the current plants, they worry me. Companies like Oklo with nuclear fission capabilities, NuScale Power with small form factor technology, they're exciting, but they're also years from developing anything meaningful. Or as my friend Michael Cembalest. chair of the Market and Investment Strategy group at J.P. Morgan wrote in his\u2026 2025 outlook, \u2018What nuclear renaissance? Wake me when we get there.\u201d NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) is a company focused on designing modular light water reactor nuclear power plants. One of the main aspects of its operations is its small modular reactor design, which became the first of its kind to be certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Despite its progress, the company has faced significant challenges. In late 2022, the Utah Associated Municipal Power System decided to terminate its agreement with the company. This agreement, which had been in place since 2015, had originally outlined plans to construct twelve reactor modules with an expected operational start by 2023. However, as the estimated costs of the project ballooned from an initial $3 billion to $9.3 billion, UAMPS chose to end its commitment, leading to the cancellation of NuScale\u2019s first planned small modular reactor project. The termination resulted in a $50 million charge for the company. The year 2023 also brought further financial challenges for NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR). Soaring expenses forced the company to cancel its plans to build six nuclear reactors in Idaho. The company\u2019s financial struggles were visible in its quarterly reports for 2024, where it reported decreasing revenue: $1.4 million in the first quarter, $1.0 million in the second quarter, and $0.5 million in the third quarter. The company also reported significant net losses during the same periods, with losses of $48.1 million in Q1, $74.4 million in Q2, and $45.5 million in Q3. Overall SMR ranks 5th on our list of the nuclear power and quantum computing stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of SMR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"OnePlus' next foldable might rock a titanium build and set a new thinness record for foldables.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Fresh reports from China hint at the Oppo Find N5's upcoming launch, and it's tipped to flaunt a super slim design wrapped in a titanium frame. Originally rumored for a 2024 release, the Find N5 (from which the OnePlus Open 2 is taking inspiration) faced some unexpected delays. There were even rumors it might get scrapped altogether. But recent leaks have put those worries to rest, showing that OnePlus and Oppo are still committed to making this book-style foldable a reality. In a Weibo post, leaker Digital Chat Station shared that the upcoming Oppo Find N5 will feature a titanium chassis. They also claim that it will be the thinnest foldable phone yet (via Notebookcheck). If these claims hold true, the upcoming Oppo model could dethrone the Honor Magic V3 as the slimmest book-style foldable. The Magic V3 currently measures 9.2mm folded and 4.35mm unfolded. This would set a new benchmark in the foldable market, though the leaker hasn't shared specific dimensions of the upcoming device. While previous leaks have teased the OnePlus Open 2's look, they haven't confirmed the materials used. However, the idea of a titanium body seems plausible, given how popular this lightweight yet durable metal has become in premium phones. Titanium\u2019s strength and lightness make it a top pick for flagships like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and the upcoming S25 Ultra. So, if the OnePlus Open 2 uses titanium, it would fit right in with the latest design trends and further cement its status as a premium foldable. In a separate Weibo post, leaker Smart Pikachu shared a detailed look at the device\u2019s key features. The design focuses on durability, with a triple-camera setup co-engineered with Hasselblad, including a periscope lens for better optics. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The tipster also claims that the phone will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and support satellite communication. It could also pack a \"nearly 6,000mAh\" battery with wireless charging support. Smart Pikachu also hinted at a February 2025 launch for the Oppo Find N5. This timing gives OnePlus a solid chance to lead the foldable market. With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 not expected until later in the year, the Open 2 could have a strong, uncontested run, helping it grab market share and build a loyal following before its biggest competitor arrives.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Vector flag of United States of America. Waving flag of USA, vector illustration. Bright colors You may have noticed that lately, the media is pumping out more stories on how the US economy and stock markets are leading the world. Well, it\u2019s true. Today we\u2019re going to get into a few reasons why that is. We\u2019re also going to look at how us income investors can use a special kind of income play, closed-end funds (CEFs)\u2014many of which yield north of 9%\u2014to cash in on America\u2019s runaway lead, boosting our dividends and setting ourselves up for 10% annualized returns, basically forever. We\u2019ll wrap with a real \u201cnuts-and-bolts\u201d view of the factors that go into the ongoing rise in US stocks\u2014uncovering fundamentals that few investors stop to learn (but can help us immensely, especially when a 2022-style pullback tests our nerve). Just the latest stories on American financial exceptionalism to come across my desk lately include this one from Fortune magazine. And another one from multibillionaire hedge fund mogul Ray Dalio\u2019s firm, Bridgewater Associates, which says that America\u2019s lead is likely to continue because \u201cUS companies are more innovative, more efficiently run, better at deploying capital and have a more shareholder-friendly orientation than their developed-world peers.\u201d That\u2019s all true, and its why the S&P 500 (the go-to index fund for which is shown in orange below) has crushed its global cousins in the long run: US Stocks Outperform As you can see, the S&P 500 index is up nearly 500% since 2011, as of this writing. That\u2019s the year of the IPO on the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS), which invests in the world\u2019s major stock markets except for America. As you can also see, VXUS is up just 82.6% in that time. So in other words, you\u2019re taking on currency exposure, volatility and other risks for an annualized return of 4.4%. That\u2019s less than what many high-yield savings accounts pay. Not a great deal! US-stock outperformance isn\u2019t news to us at my CEF Insider service, by the way. Our portfolio of high-yield CEFs, which boasts a current yield of around 10% on average, has been benefiting from it for years. In July 2017, for example, we bought the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a US-focused CEF that yielded around 9% then and pays about the same now. It\u2019s gone on to return 198% to us, including dividends, as of this writing, beating the S&P 500. It all leads to an interesting question that few investors pause to consider: What\u2019s driven the gains, in both the index and in funds like ADX? Let\u2019s look at 4 fundamental reasons why the prices of stocks\u2014and our stock-focused CEFs\u2014rise over time, and what we can expect from them in the long run (whether we see a pullback in 2025 or not). The first thing to consider here is that US firms have simply out-earned their counterparts globally. That\u2019s the first part of what\u2019s made US stocks rise in the long run. To see how earnings play into stock prices, let\u2019s look at Apple (AAPL), which realized $6.55 in earnings per share over the last 12 months\u2014meaning each share is an economic claim on $6.55 worth of earnings Apple earns per year. In other words, at around $244.00 a share, as of this writing, you can buy a piece of Apple that gets you about a 2.7% yield from your investment\u2014that is, to get $6.55 in earnings, you have to pay $244.00 for that claim. But of course, the company doesn\u2019t actually pass over those earnings to shareholders directly. They mostly get reinvested in the firm (apart from the portion that goes into dividends and buybacks, of course). But this does mean that, if Apple doesn\u2019t innovate, doesn\u2019t expand market share and is able to maintain its current level of productivity, your shares should rise by 2.7% per year. If we take the total earnings of the S&P 500 and divide them by the cost to purchase all those shares, we see that you can get a 3.3% yield from US firms. In other words, if nothing else changes, stocks should rise organically by 3.3% a year. Professional investors often call stocks an inflation hedge because when prices go up, companies\u2019 revenue does, too\u2014even if this inflation doesn\u2019t necessarily make the firm any more profitable. This rising revenue should make their shares rise, as well. For instance, imagine ABC Snacks produces potato chips for $2 a bag, selling 100 million bags a year for $200 million in revenue. After costs, the company earns $20 million in profit\u2014a 10% margin. Let\u2019s say ABC Snacks has 10 million shares, so $2 of profit accrues to each share. Now let\u2019s say inflation causes a bag of chips to rise to $2.10 per bag, with profit margins still being 10%. Now the company is earning $21 million in profit for that same 100 million bags of sales, and $2.10 of profit accrues to each share. No one is actually financially better off here\u2014inflation has caused all prices to rise, after all. But the key point is that the stocks will naturally rise to account for inflation. So, with US inflation at about 2.5% now, we should expect stocks to rise by about 2.5% a year. Of course, stocks can fall in the short term, like they did in 2022. That\u2019s the risk entailed in stock investing, and that risk needs to be paid back with reward. As a result, common stocks typically have about a 2% extra return baked in to compensate for this volatility. This \u201crisk premium\u201d has been observed in stocks for well over a century. Finally, we see the economy grow because of population growth and technological innovation. These things result in more productivity, which rises over the long term by about 2% on average. Thus, in addition to the returns above, stocks should also rise by about 2% to account for improvements in tech, a better-trained workforce and so on. Add all of these together and you\u2019ll see that stocks should rise by about 9.8% per year on average over the long haul. And that is, indeed, what we see throughout history. Going back to the late 1980s, the S&P 500 has returned 10.4% per year on average, pretty close to that 9.8% figure. So yes, we can expect stocks to rise in the years ahead\u2014and we should, by about 10% annually. And with a CEF investing in American equities like ADX, we\u2019ll get that mostly in the form of cash, thanks to the fund\u2019s outsized yield. That\u2019s another big advantage over investors who buy, say, a 1.2%-yielding S&P 500 index fund like the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). If those investors want to tap their SPY holding for cash, they\u2019ll be forced to sell, potentially into a downturn, reducing their gain potential in the future. With a CEF, we can simply collect our dividends as we wait for markets to turn north again. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

With Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20th drawing near, all eyes are on how investors will react this week, as it carries its own significance with key earnings reports and the much-anticipated inflation data release, which is expected to stay high. Moreover, the recent job data was better than anticipated, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may postpone its decision to cut interest rates. These reports will provide a foundation for the Trump 2.0 era, as the latest inflation and employment figures will give insights into the economic challenges and opportunities that his administration will encounter. With that context, let\u2019s dive into what this week has in store. This week, the pace picks up in the second half with a flurry of banking earnings reports. On Wednesday, banking heavyweights like JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.47%), BlackRock (BLK+0.84%), Citigroup (C+0.07%), and others are set to release their earnings before the opening bell.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  Skype, a telecommunications platform currently owned by Microsoft, became ubiquitous in the early 2000s, at one point accounting for up to 40% of all international calls.          While Skype has since lost some of its audience to Microsoft Teams \u2014 particularly in the business context \u2014 and a significant portion of its market share to Zoom, it still maintained an average of 40 million daily users as of 2020.               Founded in 2003 by Swedish entrepreneur Niklas Zennstrm and Danish entrepreneur Janus Friis, Skype held its first public trial in August of that year. By 2005, the company was acquired by eBay for $2.5 billion. In 2009, a portion of Skype was resold to Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board for $1.9 billion, giving the company a market valuation of $2.75 billion.               Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion, making it a division of Microsoft with its former CEO Tony Bates reporting to then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.               Following the acquisition, Microsoft integrated Skype into its product lineup, discontinuing Windows Messenger in favor of the Skype client, which became the default messaging service in Windows 8.1. By 2013, Skype was available across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iPadOS, iOS, Android, and BlackBerry.               By offering free voice and video calls between Skype users globally, it effectively undercut traditional telecommunications providers that charged hefty fees for international calls. This disruptive technology approach that Skype took paid dividends in terms of the platform's immense popularity, especially in regions where long-distance calling was prohibitively expensive.               Instead of paying telecommunications companies long-distance rates, the only fee you'd incur would be the internet data that Skype used for your audio or video call. Skype also offered low rates for calls to landlines and cellphones.               Through its North American subscription plan, you could get 2,000 minutes of calling for $5.94\/month \u2013 or the equivalent of about 0.297 cents per minute; if you go over 2,000 minutes, the rate goes to $0.35\/minute. For US only calls, a 2,000 minute plan costs just $2.54 with extra time costing only $0.15\/minute.               Despite no longer being the industry leader in terms of market share, Skype is still a capable free solution for video and audio calls.               Unlike the free version of Zoom, Skype doesn't have a 30 minute time limit. Additionally, in 2023 Microsoft integrated Bing AI with Skype, allowing users to converse with it in a private chat or mention it in group chats and ask it questions; you can even ask it to help plan vacation destinations or generate jokes.               However, Microsoft has clearly prioritized other tech like Microsoft Teams at the expense of Skype over the years.               In 2015, Skype for Business replaced Lync as Microsoft's business communication solution. In 2017, Microsoft announced plans to replace Skype for Business with Microsoft Teams, with its official retirement occurring in July 2021.               Where Zoom and Teams pull away from Skype is less in the one-on-one context and more in business centric contexts where you might have more than 50 people \u2013 the maximum size Skype supports \u2013 on a single call. Skype also does not have breakout room functionality like what you see with Zoom.               Once you've downloaded Skype to your computer or mobile device, you can make a new Skype call through desktop or mobile by opening the Skype app and clicking New call or Start a call.               You can add contacts to Skype or invite people to join Skype by navigating to the Contacts tab and clicking New Contact and searching for the person via their Skype name, phone number, email, or full name.               If you, too, are gravitating towards platforms like Zoom or Teams rather than Skype, you might be wondering how to delete your Skype account.               Since your Skype account is tied into your Microsoft account, it is not possible to close your Skype account without closing your entire Microsoft account. If you want to proceed, you can close your Microsoft account by visiting the Microsoft account closure page, signing in, and selecting either 30 or 60 days from the dropdown, clicking Next, and following Microsoft's prompts.               Your Skype name itself cannot be changed, however, you change your account's display name.               Start by clicking on your Skype profile picture, then select Skype profile and click the pencil icon to edit the display name and make your changes.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers. More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on. Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.  But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end? Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users. Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company. But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers. Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of. \"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24\/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC. \"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds. Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019. The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\". \"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds. A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.  For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands. But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists. \"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says. \"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says. Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users. She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience. These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\" Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer. \"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not. \"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor. Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\". \"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds. Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material. He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.  \"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island. \"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds. Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures. At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million. With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal. Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media. He manages boxer Tommy Fury and sports presenter Mac Griffiths (known as Michael on Love Island), who both appeared on the aforementioned 2019 series of the show. \"People would come off a show and do adverts for every single company, because these companies would want to take advantage of the quick exposure they could get,\" he tells the BBC. \"But four or five months down the line you'd be harming your own career, because you'd used your platform the wrong way and there'd be no credibility there,\" he adds. Jake says more recent reality TV contestants have learnt a lot from the mistakes of their predecessors, who were leaving shows with no real strategy. \"My biggest piece of advice is to go in with your eyes wide open,\" he cautions. Traitors finalist Alexander Dragonetti tells the BBC he's \"incredibly grateful\" after people donated more than \u00a370,000 to Mencap. The actress will leave the soap in February, more than three decades after her first appearance. The late singer died in October after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The journalist and author is stepping down from the programme but will continue to work with the BBC.  Billericay Town looks forward to Montel McKenzie's return after announcing his departure from a TV dating show.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":" With Mike Vrabel now off the coaching market, having joined the New England Patriots, all eyes turn to Detroit Lions' offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. And according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the Las Vegas Raiders are firmly in that mix: From <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NFLGameDay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFLGameDay<\/a>: Taking a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Raiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Raiders<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Bears?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bears<\/a> coaching searches and where it all stands... <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/vHIkEQqdNk\">pic.twitter.com\/vHIkEQqdNk<\/a> \"My understanding is the name to watch is Johnson. They are said to be enamored with him,\" he reported regarding the Raiders \"People ask and have been asking over the last 24 hours, 'Why would Ben Johnson be interested in a job that doesn't have a quarterback?' Tom Brady has loomed large recruiting Johnson, imploring him to take the interview and consider the Raiders. If that is something that will be a possibility for Johnson, and certainly that has worked\u2014Johnson is said at least to be interested.\" There have been other reports that Johnson and the Raiders might end up being a match: Ben Johnson \/ Raiders actually picking up way more steam in league circles over last 48 hours. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/FbHQh0uWSg\">https:\/\/t.co\/FbHQh0uWSg<\/a> The Tom Brady factor in Las Vegas has given the Raiders an edge in attracting candidates they typically wouldn't land. His influence is a key draw, which is why coaches like Ben Johnson agreed to meet with them. Johnson, 38, has been one of the hottest coaching names on the market for the past two offseasons, proving to be one of the most innovative and exciting play-callers in the NFL in recent years. His offensive scheme has helped propel the Lions to the realm of the league's elite teams and has fans in Detroit thinking Super Bowl after the team secured the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs. It's fair to argue that the Raiders aren't one of the more appealing openings remaining for a top candidate, however. The Chicago Bears (Caleb Williams) and Jacksonville Jaguars (Trevor Lawrence) have quarterbacks in place. The New York Jets, while a mess, have more overall talent on the roster. The Raiders had a strong 2024 draft, led by the superb rookie season of tight end Brock Bowers, but fired the man who orchestrated it (former general manager Tom Telesco) Las Vegas could look to trade up from No. 6 in order to gain a top-two pick, putting them in position to select a quarterback like Cam Ward or Shedeur Sanders, but that would come at the cost of giving up valuable assets into the future. This isn't a franchise that can afford to punt on multiple drafts down the line, given the other needs on the roster. Johnson's scheme is fantastic, but it also relies on the presence of a reliable quarterback (Jared Goff) and dynamic talent at the skill positions (Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Sam LaPorta, David Montgomery, Jameson Williams). The Raiders have Bowers, Jakobi Meyers and... not much else in that regard. Perhaps Brady can talk Johnson into rebuilding the proud franchise together. But if Johnson is ready to make the leap to head coaching, there are more appealing destinations available.","label":0}

Here\u2019s how it works.  Nvidia, already a leader in AI and GPU technologies, is moving into the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) market to address growing competition and shifting trends in AI semiconductor design. The global rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased the demand for GPUs, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed in 2024 the company will recruit 1000 engineers in Taiwan. Now, as reported by Taiwan's Commercial Times (originally published in Chinese), the company has now established a new ASIC department and is actively recruiting talent. Nvidia\u2019s H series GPUs optimized for AI learning tasks have been widely adopted for training AI models. However, the AI semiconductor market is undergoing a shift toward inference chips, or ASICs. This surge is driven by the demand for chips optimized for real-world AI applications, such as large language models and generative AI. Unlike GPUs, ASICs offer superior efficiency for inference tasks, as well as cryptocurrency mining. According to Verified Market Research, the inference AI chip market is projected to rise from a 2023 valuation of $15.8 billion to $90.6 billion by 2030. Major tech players including Google have already embraced custom ASIC designs in its AI chip \"Trillium\", made generally available in December 2024. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The shift toward custom AI chips has intensified competition among semiconductor giants. Companies such as Broadcom and Marvell have surged in relevance and stock value as they collaborate with cloud service providers to develop specialized chips for data centers.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"With the launch of the Galaxy S25 series just around the corner, there has been a lot of speculation about the so-called S25 Slim. It might be too early to sing its praises, though; according to a reliable tipster, the upcoming OnePlus Open 2 (also known as the Oppo Find N5 in the Chinese market) might be the thinnest foldable phone ever made. Digital Chat Station, a leaker with a pretty trustworthy track record, has claimed the OnePlus Open 2 will beat out even the Honor Magic V3. The Honor Magic V3 is only 9.2mm folded and 4.35mm unfolded \u2014 the slimmest on the market \u2014 so if the OnePlus Open 2 manages to squeeze its hardware into an even smaller form factor, it\u2019s going to set records. In addition, Digital Chat Station also claims the chassis will be made of titanium. While we have an idea of what to expect from the OnePlus Open 2, there are still quite a few details we don\u2019t know. The OnePlus Open 2 is expected to sport the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, feature IPX8 weatherproofing, and possibly even have a 6,000mAh battery. It\u2019s also rumored to have wireless charging, a feature that was notoriously absent from the original model. The Open 2 could possibly have a triple-camera setup on the rear, although there are conflicting reports that suggest it might have a 50MP telephoto camera. Many of these features were rumored earlier in the year, but this most recent leak corroborates them. The OnePlus Open 2 has no set price or release date, but considering the OnePlus Open is currently $1,300, we expect the price to be at least $1,500 or more, especially if OnePlus opts for a premium design with the chassis. Remember that all of this information comes from unofficial sources, so any of it could be incorrect. Until OnePlus makes an official announcement about the specs of the Open 2, know that any of these details could change before launch. Folding phones continue to grow slimmer with each iteration, packing more power and performance into smaller and smaller chassis. The OnePlus Open 2 is set to be a \u201cbook-style\u201d foldable versus a flip-style, and early whispers suggest a February release. That would give OnePlus even more of an advantage over Samsung, as the S25 Slim isn\u2019t expected to launch until summer. It\u2019s official: The highly anticipated OnePlus 13 will launch internationally next month. The phone was announced weeks ago and launched first in China before its global debut. According to OnePlus in India, the new phone will be available in three color options: Midnight Ocean, Black Eclipse, and Arctic Dawn. Notably, the Midnight Ocean colorway is the first OnePlus handset to feature microfiber vegan leather. The OnePlus U.S. site has also been updated to confirm that the OnePlus 13 is \"coming soon.\" The highly anticipated OnePlus 13 smartphone has been released in China and is expected to be available in the U.S. and other regions early next year. According to respected tipster Yogesh Brar, a OnePlus Watch 3 could debut internationally alongside the OnePlus 13 series. First teased this summer, the OnePlus Watch 3 is expected to offer some enhancements compared to the OnePlus Watch 2. That wearable device launched earlier this year to modest reviews. It\u2019s never easy to recommend a foldable phone, especially when you consider the high asking price and the reports of hardware issues that keep eliciting long posts on Reddit. My personal experience also drives this reluctance, even though I\u2019ve been using foldable phones consistently for half a decade now. Early in 2023, the hinge on my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 gave up. The phone would no longer open fully. A few days after the problem first manifested, I noticed a glue-like material oozing from the hinge gap.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Ozempic is just the beginning of a new era of obesity treatment. A review published this week previews the emergence of similar experimental drugs that will likely be even more effective at helping people lose weight. Researchers at McGill University conducted the study, which was a review of the clinical trial data surrounding GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy). The researchers reaffirmed the safety and effectiveness of today\u2019s drugs. But they also highlighted the potential superiority of newer compounds currently under development such as retatrutide, which has helped people lose more than 20% of their original body weight in trials so far. Wegovy and Other New Weight Loss Drugs Actually Work\u2014so What\u2019s Next? Semaglutide is a synthetic and longer-lasting version of the hormone GLP-1\u2014a hormone that regulates hunger and insulin production, among other things.\u00a0 Developed by Novo Nordisk, semaglutide was first approved for type 2 diabetes in 2017 as Ozempic, then for obesity in 2021 as Wegovy. It\u2019s far from the first GLP-1 drug to reach the public, but semaglutide has been a game-changer for obesity treatment. It\u2019s been shown to help people lose somewhere between 10% to 15% of their weight in studies, well above the typical success seen with diet and exercise alone and even surpassing the typical results of older GLP-1 drugs. Semaglutide isn\u2019t the only new kid on the block, though. Eli Lilly\u2019s tirzepatide mimics both GLP-1 and another hunger-related hormone called GIP\u2014a potent combination that has allowed it to dethrone semaglutide. In clinical trials, people on tirzepatide have lost as much as 20% of their baseline weight. There are dozens of other related obesity treatments in the pipeline as well, some of which have made it to human testing and are poised to overshadow even tirzepatide. The McGill researchers analyzed data from 26 randomized clinical trials of single-agent GLP-1 drugs, double agonists like tirzepatide, and even triple-agonist drugs like retatrutide, which combines synthetic versions of three hunger-related hormones: GLP-1, GIP, and the glucagon. These trials involved people living with obesity but who did not have type 2 diabetes. As expected, they found that today\u2019s approved drugs were generally safe and effective, with tirzepatide faring the best currently (participants lost up to 17% body weight after 72 weeks of therapy). But they also singled out retatrutide as performing even better in a shorter period of time, with participants losing up to 22% of their body weight after only 48 weeks of therapy. \u201cWe found that, of the 12 GLP-1 [drugs] identified by our search, the greatest mean body weight reduction was reported in randomized controlled trials of retatrutide, tirzepatide, and semaglutide,\u201d the researchers wrote in their paper, published Tuesday in the\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine. Retatrutide is being developed by Eli Lilly, and it\u2019s now currently being tested in phase 3 trials\u2014trials that will reach their conclusion by 2026. And it won\u2019t be the only newcomer arriving in the near-future that could outslug today\u2019s existing drugs. Last year, for instance, early trial results of the drug amycretin (developed by Novo Nordisk) suggested that it could provide greater weight loss than semaglutide and tirzepatide. Other drug companies are working on their own competitors to Ozempic, such as\u00a0Boehringer Ingelheim and Zealand Pharma\u2019s dual agonist survodutide. Expectations have gotten so high that Novo Nordisk\u2019s stock actually dropped when it announced that their drug candidate CagriSema (a mix of semaglutide with the experimental drug cagrilintide) only helped people lose 22% weight in a recent trial, rather than the 25% expected. These drugs aren\u2019t free of its negatives, of course. They commonly cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting, and have been tied to rare but serious complications like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis). Another major concern is their price, with semaglutide and tirzepatide often costing around $1,000 per month without insurance coverage (which often isn\u2019t provided by private and public insurers). That cost and surging demand has fueled a grey and black market for these drugs, with people turning to cheaper, but less safe compounded and counterfeit versions. Some experts hope that the arrival of more GLP-1 related drugs will help curtail some of these issues, particularly cost and insurance coverage. Whether that actually happens, we\u2019ll have to see. But it\u2019s almost certain that there will be plenty of drugs coming for semaglutide and tirzepatide\u2019s current crown as the best obesity treatments around.  experimental drugsobesityOzempic  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 Alexandra Sowa's new book The Ozempic Revolution is intended to be the \"first comprehensive user guide\" to GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic.                     New research suggests that inhaled xenon gas can help protect the brains of those with Alzheimer's disease.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  Single women are outperforming other cohorts as first-time home buyers in the US, with many successfully navigating a long-standing gender wage gap, high home prices, and elevated mortgage rates to lock down a purchase.          According to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors, single women made up 24% of first-time home purchases last year, while single men made up 11%.               The share of single women as a proportion of all first-time buyers has been on the rise, up over five percentage points in the last year, the data shows.               With smaller average incomes, many female homeowners say they never imagined owning a home on their own.               But real estate experts and homeowners tell Business Insider that those dynamics could be exactly the reason women are more likely to pursue homeownership.               With societal and economic factors working against them, high-earning single women understand that building equity through owning a home will help set them up for longer-term financial stability in the absence of a second income stream from a partner or spouse.               \"If we look at this by race, by age, by generation, we see the same trend. Women just outperform on homeownership. And this is something that we've seen consistently in the data since we started tracking it in 1981,\" NAR's chief economist Jessica Lautz told Business Insider. \"This is something that's been important for generations of women.\"               To be sure, women still face outsize challenges when buying a home, but it's a sacrifice they appear increasingly willing to make, Lautz said.               They are more likely to settle for a smaller space or wait until they are older to buy than single men, with a median age for first-time buyers of 38 compared to 33 for men, according to NAR data for 2023.               Single women are also more likely to move in with friends or family before purchasing to avoid paying rent, helping save up for longer. That was the case for Meghan, who told BI she moved in with her mom for a year after graduating from nursing school in 2018.               Things really started to fall into place, though, when she got a boost to her travel nurse salary as the COVID-19 pandemic drew huge demand for nurses around the country. This helped her save up for a down payment, she said.               The 30-year-old made the jump to homeownership in December 2022 with help from a state-funded program for first-time buyers that she used to buy a 575-square-foot condo in Boston.               After moving in, she struggled a bit to make her monthly $2,400 mortgage payment as she split her time between working and finishing her nurse practitioner's degree, but it was a decision she felt confident in regardless.               \"By the skin of my teeth, I made it through a really tough year. My savings were already depleted from buying the house in the first place,\" she said, adding it got easier after her salary increased again with her new degree.               Like Meghan, many women have increasingly pursued higher education in recent years, another area where they've outpaced men.               That could be another driver of their higher homeownership rates, First American's deputy chief economist Odeta Kushi said               \"As these things\u2014educational attainment, household income for women\u2014continue to rise, it's pretty reasonable to expect increased homeownership rate to follow suit. It's increasingly pursuing homeownership, and reaping its wealth creation benefits for this group,\" Kushi told BI.               Female homebuyers are also more likely to prioritize stability, Lautz said, making the certainty of a 30-year mortgage especially attractive as rental prices shoot through the roof.               Part of the rise in single female homeownership, too, could be that Americans in general are holding out longer to get married, Kushi said.               \"We have the nursery rhyme, 'first comes love, then comes marriage.' And I feel like for single women, first comes home ownership,\" Kushi said.               Meghan sees her home as a lasting investment as prices continue to climb, even if she may want to eventually upgrade to a larger home.               \"I don't think I'll ever sell it. If anything, I'd just have someone move in, or I'd just keep it and rent it. I think owning property, especially in Boston, is invaluable,\" she said.               For now, the women's respective homes have proved to be everything they wanted, with the security of calling it their own, they said.               Plus, it's helping them feel more independent and confident than ever before.               \"There's all these things where I'm like, 'Oh man, I'm way more capable than I thought I was,'\" said Megan O'Neil, a 36-year-old who bought a home in Memphis back in August.               That's changed her outlook on dating, too, she said.               \"I might be very intimidating to some guys, but I need a partner. I don't need somebody to take care of me. I need a partner, because I can do this by myself, too,\" she said.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  You might not have a parking spot or a desk, but you might have a CEO who wants you back in the office anyway.          That's the situation facing some corporate workers who've had a bumpy return-to-office process thanks to logistical hiccups.               Late last year, Amazon delayed RTO requirements for some workers because of a dearth of office space and a need to reconfigure some setups. At AT&T, which has also called workers back, employees at some offices have had trouble snagging workspaces in the new year and have resorted to working in a dining area or at conference tables, BI recently reported.               The push to populate hot desks and cubicles comes as many leaders appear fed up with talking about working from home. Some chiefs might see RTO mandates from high-profile companies like Amazon as the cover they need to issue similar orders. Yet, in the effort to bring workers back, not every office was ready for the influx.               \"Towards the end of last year, it became clear that CEOs were just done,\" Dan Kaplan, senior client partner at the recruiting firm Korn Ferry, told BI.               However, he said, some organizations didn't do sufficient prep work to call everyone back \u2014 especially after cutting office space during the depths of the pandemic when those who could do so logged on from home.               Now, Kaplan said, for some CEOs, the thinking goes, \"We'll clean up the mess later, but for now, we are ripping that Band-Aid and getting people the heck back in the office, come hell or high water,\" he said.               Some employers are shifting back to the office even as they don't know how much space they'll ultimately need in the next few years because artificial intelligence could one day replace some workers, Dan Root, head of global strategic alliances at Barco ClickShare, which makes tech used in office meeting rooms, said.               \"That starts to really make you question, 'OK, well, how much square footage am I going to be committing to?'\" he told BI.               Last week, the World Economic Forum reported that in a survey of companies worldwide, 41% said they planned to cut their workforce during the next five years in instances where AI could take on the work.               Another challenge: Some employers adjusted for hybrid setups \u2014 and added places for couches and other amenities to draw workers back to the office \u2014 that worked well when offices weren't always fully staffed. Yet now that more workers are coming back, space can be tight.               Nick Romito, CEO of VTS, a commercial real estate technology firm, told BI that two to two-and-a-half years ago, many employers looking for office space might have been shopping for less square footage than they'd need to accommodate a full staff. Many employers optimized for hybrid, yet that only works if people don't show up at the same time.               \"People trying to adjust for that a few years ago has now hurt them,\" he said. \"They took 10,000 feet when they really needed 15,000.\"               An AT&T spokesman told BI that the company is \"constantly enhancing\" its facilities to make them desirable and ensure workers have what they need. Office seating for 70% to 80% of employees is an industry standard, given the variables that can affect attendance on any given day, they said.               AT&T is \"quickly working through the challenges in select locations so the rest of our employees are best positioned to support their coworkers,\" the spokesperson said.               An Amazon spokesperson told BI that as of last week, the \"overwhelming majority\" of its workers had dedicated workspaces and have returned to the office full time. Among Amazon's hundreds of offices globally, \"only a relatively small number\" aren't yet ready for workers to return five days a week, the spokesperson said.               One reason some CEOs might feel comfortable calling workers back to the office is that while the overall US jobless rate remains low, it's often still a challenging job market for white-collar workers.               The difficulty many might face in finding other work could mean they're at the mercy of their employer's plans, Dan Schawbel, managing partner of the research firm Workplace Intelligence, told BI.               \"They might have no choice but to return to the office,\" he said, though added that in some cases, workers won't be able to comply because of family circumstances or owning a home too far from the office.               Worksites could get crowded if more workers comply with RTO orders than employers might have expected.               \"Strategic companies have made these calculations, but there is room for error,\" Schawbel said.               If workers do quit because they're unhappy with the RTO, Korn Ferry's Kaplan said, it's an easy way for employers to reduce costs without generating negative headlines around job cuts or incurring related expenses like severance or extended benefits.               \"For some of them, it's a free layoff,\" he said.

It looks like OnePlus and Oppo skipped the 2024 release time frame, but likely for a good reason. According to the rumors, the foldable will feature a new, more durable, industrial design featuring titanium and will likely be the thinnest foldable on the market, beating the Honor Magic V3. But there will be more than just design improvements. The report claims the device will feature an improved triple-camera Hasselblad system, Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, around 6,000 mAh battery, wireless charging and satellite communication support. Pretty much in line with what we've heard so far.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Login  Ro  12 January 2025   Apple iOS  Ming-Chi Kuo just released a new market report on Apple in December 2024, showing a sharp decline in sales year-over-year in China. Compared to December 2023, Apple's iPhone sales in the country slipped 10-12%. Kuo believes the main culprit is the lack of innovation. The iPhone 16 series wasn't well-received in China due to the minor improvements over the last generation. It's important to note that Apple's decline comes amid fairly stable market conditions in the country. The overall smartphone sales in China remained stable throughout December. Looking ahead, Ming-Chi Kuo believes Apple will lose even more sales in the first half of 2025. The launch of the upcoming iPhone SE4 won't be enough to offset the poor sales performance due to the limited impact the SE lineup usually has. Kuo isn't very optimistic about the iPhone 17 lineup either. With rumors suggesting the new iPhone 17 series will exclusively rely on eSIM with no physical SIM support, Ming-Chi Kuo believes the Chinese market won't respond well. Not all carriers in the country offer eSIM support, so it will be a challenge for some users.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"        Jeff Brady                        A contractor installs a solar panel on the roof of a home. Uncertainty over the future of a 30% federal tax credit has some homeowners rushing to get panels hooked to the grid before Trump becomes President.                                                           David Paul Morris\/Bloomberg via Getty Images                                       hide caption  The solar power industry is growing fast, accounting for more than half of all new electricity on the grid last year. But soon President-elect Donald Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress may try to reduce or eliminate government incentives that have driven much of that growth. That has potential customers who want to install solar on their homes worried about the future of an existing 30% federal tax credit. Some are responding by rushing to install solar now, before the credit can be eliminated. Others are deciding solar is too risky with an incoming Trump administration.  Solar installers face even more uncertainty with threats of increased tariffs that could make panels and other equipment more expensive. The industry's main trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association, has released a policy agenda that echoes some of Trump's language, such as \"energy dominance.\" But it's not clear that will sway a president who has been openly hostile to renewable energy.  Trump has suggested tariffs as high as 60% on imports from China and 20% on all other goods coming into the U.S. With the support of a Republican-controlled Congress, Trump also could rescind programs passed as part of President Biden's climate agenda, where allocated money has not already been spent.  Jorge Solares says he decided last summer to install solar panels on his house in the Boston suburbs. He was motivated by environmental concerns: solar power doesn't emit the climate-heating greenhouse gases that fossil fuels do. Saving money also was a motivation. \"We have a brand new baby, and we're hoping to make that investment, so at some point we won't have to pay [for] electricity and focus on her spending,\" Solares says with a chuckle. The panels will reduce his electricity bill and, he says, pay for themselves in five or six years. After that, his electricity will be mostly free. That plan seemed like a solid one, until Trump won the November election. \"Looking ahead, I just don't know what to expect from the next administration,\" Solares says. On the campaign trail last year, Trump vowed to boost oil and gas production, even though the U.S. already produces more oil than any country in history. At a speech to the Economic Club of New York in September, Trump said he would \"rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act\" \u2014 that's the Biden administration's climate-focused law, passed in 2022.  It's not clear what Trump's comments mean for clean energy tax credits. His transition office didn't respond to NPR's questions. But the future of these credits is a significant issue for homeowners who want to install solar panels. The 30% tax credit saved Solares about $8,000. \"Since we're spending so much money on this, the federal credit was just the way for us to get it [solar],\" Solares says, \"Otherwise it's just too expensive.\" It took months for inspections, permits and installing the panels on Solares' house. Given the tax credit's uncertain future, he pushed his installer to get the panels operating before the end of 2024 to ensure he can claim the credit on last year's taxes. Near Jacksonville, Florida, Jeff Beardsley says the uncertainty led him to a different conclusion. \"A big part of me wanted to lean towards solar,\" Beardsley says. He deliberated between installing solar panels plus batteries or a gas generator to keep the power on in his house after a hurricane. Solar power is more climate-friendly than a fossil fuel generator, which releases climate-warming greenhouse gasses. \"I certainly liked being able to generate my own power from the sun\u2026 You know, that's kind of cool, from a sustainability perspective,\" Beardsley says. But he couldn't get the solar project operating by the end of the year and potentially losing the 30% tax credit, so he concluded the gas generator was the better option.                  Solar companies worry President-elect Trump will raise tariffs on imported solar panels. Exact Solar President Doug Edwards, in his company's Newtown, Pennsylvania warehouse, stocked up on solar panels to avoid potential price increases.                                                           Jeff Brady\/NPR                                       hide caption  Companies that install solar panels say doubts about the tax credit's future, and other actions Trump may take after Jan. 20, are affecting their business. Some installers say they are drafting multiple business plans hoping one will help them respond. One installer in the Philadelphia suburbs decided to stock up on solar panels now. \"As you can see, we are packed to the gills here,\" says Doug Edwards, president of Exact Solar as he walks through his company's warehouse in Newtown, Pennsylvania. The space is filled with pallets of boxed solar panels waiting for installation. Edwards stocked up because of another uncertainty. Trump campaigned on putting 20% tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S. If that happens quickly \u2014 say, in the months between when a job is bid and when it's finished \u2014 that could make a solar project unprofitable. By stocking up, Edwards locked in panel prices, protecting both his business and his customers' wallets. Also in his warehouse there's black metal \"racking\" for mounting panels on a roof. Some of it is made in the U.S., so it qualifies for higher federal tax credits. Those credits also could be at risk if Trump and Republicans pursue an extensive overhaul of the Inflation Reduction Act.                  In an aerial view, solar panels are seen on the roof of an apartment complex in San Rafael, California.                                                           Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  Edwards says he's hired new workers based on the assumption that such incentives would be around for a decade. \"We've almost tripled in size in the last few years \u2014 all local hiring, all local team members,\" Edwards says, \"And we're just hopeful that we won't have to slow that down or have that disrupted in a major way.\" While Edwards remains positive about the future of the solar industry, there is a lot of concern that incentive changes and increased tariffs could lead to job losses, or that companies will hire fewer new workers than expected. Stephen Irvin with Amicus Solar Cooperative says when his more than 80 member companies have to pay higher panel prices, \"that means that maybe now they can't hire that extra person they were hoping to. That's a job loss right there.\" And Irvin says it's a mistake to see the solar industry as more aligned with Democrats. \"Our companies, and our membership, are spread evenly across red and blue [congressional] districts,\" Irvin says. \"Solar is not just a Democratic issue. It's an American issue.\" The solar industry hopes President-elect Trump and Republicans in Congress will come to see it that way too. And leave subsidies in place that encourage more homeowners to install solar power. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  Mark Zuckerberg has shown himself to be the ultimate Silicon Valley shape-shifter, and in the first couple of weeks of 2025, we got our best look yet at the latest version of the Meta CEO.          To kick off the new year, Zuckerberg made some big changes at his company, includingditching third-party fact-checking and slashing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.               He appears to be remaking Meta, which did not respond to a request for comment, at least partly in the image of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. And he doesn't seem too concerned about the backlash he's facing in some quarters, including from the same people who villainized him during the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the 2016 election and even his own Meta employees \u2014 many of whom have reacted negatively to his decision to roll back DEI efforts.               His recent moves hint that he's entering a new era, one in which his leadership increasingly reflects Trump's tastes. You might call it Zuckerberg 3.0.               For years, Zuckerberg was known as an almost robotic presence in Silicon Valley. Some people criticized him for copying ideas rather than innovating, and others held on to his image as a wunderkind wearing hoodies or too much sunscreen.               By the end of 2023, though, the Meta CEO had undergone a substantial makeover and was garnering praise in business and cultural circles.       Zuck got jacked and was winning jiu-jitsu competitions. He went on popular podcasts, like Joe Rogan's, to discuss his workouts and make fun of himself.               As a business leader, he acted as the adult in the room and led Meta's \"year of efficiency,\" which turned the company's stock around.               In 2024, he continued his transformation: He ditched his jeans-and-hoodie uniform for designer T-shirts and gold chains. And his adoration for his wife, Priscilla Chan \u2014 as evidenced through gifts including a statue of her, a custom Porsche minivan, and his very own version of \"Get Low\" \u2014 won him fans.               His newfound swagger grew into a new kind of boldness.               In the fall, he said his biggest regret in his two decades of running Meta was taking responsibility and apologizing for problems that he believed weren't Meta's fault.               Cut to 2025. Zuckerberg now appears to embrace some of the \"anti-woke\" ideas favored by some political billionaires, including Musk, Peter Thiel, and, of course, Trump.               While Zuckerberg didn't endorse Trump \u2014 or Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 in the 2024 election, he and other tech CEOs were quick to congratulate Trump on his victory. Zuck met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago weeks after the election and, through Meta, donated $1 million to his inaugural committee.               Now he's taking what he calls \"masculine energy\" and putting it into action at Meta.               \"Masculine energy, I think, is good, and obviously society has plenty of that, but I think that corporate culture was really trying to get away from it,\" he said in an interview on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast episode that aired Friday. \"It's like you want feminine energy; you want masculine energy.\"               He added: \"But I do think the corporate culture sort of had swung toward being this somewhat more neutered thing.\"               He started the new year by putting Dana White, the UFC CEO and Trump's longtime ally, on Meta's board and replacing the company's liberal head of policy, Nick Clegg, with the former GOP lobbyist Joel Kaplan.               Then he\u00a0ended third-party fact-checking\u00a0on Meta platforms, which some conservatives have criticized, in favor of a more hands-off approach. Like X, Meta is now set to use \"community notes\" to allow users to police each other.               \"The recent elections feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech,\" Zuckerberg said while announcing the changes, implying that the choice was, at least in part, a response to the political landscape.               And Meta's chief marketing officer, Alex Schultz, told Business Insider that Trump's election influenced the policy change.               The decision has come under scrutiny, with some saying the lack of content moderation would open the door to hate speech.               Under the policy, for example, Meta users can say that members of LGBTQ+ communities are mentally ill for being gay or transgender.       Dozens of fact-checking organizations have signed a letter calling it \"a step backward for those who want to see an internet that prioritizes accurate and trustworthy information.\"               Still, others, including Musk and Trump, have lauded the change.               \"Honestly, I think they have come a long way, Meta, Facebook,\" the president-elect said Tuesday.               In his recent Rogan interview, Zuckerberg said that while some may see the timing of the content changes as \"purely a political thing,\" he had been thinking about them for a while.               \"I feel like I just have a much greater command now of what I think the policy should be, and, like, this is how it's going to be going forward,\" he said.               Zuckerberg's recent decision to cut Meta's DEI initiatives could also placate conservatives, who have criticized such policies.               While Trump has not commented on the decision, he has criticized DEI policies in the past.               On Friday, Meta's vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale, said in an internal memo that the company would no longer have a team focused on DEI or consider diversity in hiring or supplier decisions.               \"The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\" she said in a memo.               The decision sparked backlash. Internally, nearly 400 employees reacted with a teary-eyed emoji to the announcement; one called it \"disappointing,\" and another said it was a \"step backward,\" BI reported Friday.               \"Wow, we really capitulated on a lot of our supposed values this week,\" another employee said in a comment, seemingly referring to the DEI and fact-checking moves.               Others, though, did seem to support the move: 139 employees \"liked\" the post, and 57 responded with a heart emoji.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- For years it\u2019s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market\u2019s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%. Most Read from Bloomberg A Blueprint for Better Bike Lanes What Robotaxis Brought San Francisco Ambitious High-Speed Rail Plans Advance in the Baltic Region New York, San Francisco Ranked Worst for US Traffic in City Centers Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market\u2019s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response. The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time. \u201cIt is unusual,\u201d Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added. Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it\u2019s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007. \u201cIf the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,\u201d said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson\u2019s global head of solutions. \u201cEpisodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.\u201d The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies. The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump\u2019s election. Building Barriers While there\u2019s \u201cno magic\u201d to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create \u201ctechnical barriers,\u201d said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock\u2019s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise. Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what\u2019s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn\u2019t been this good in a long time. \u201cOnce yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,\u201d said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. \u201cAnd if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.\u201d Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup\u2019s wealth division told clients there\u2019s a buying opportunity in bonds. The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn\u2019t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,\u201d Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said. What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in. \u201cThe real question is where we go from there,\u201d said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. \u201cIf it\u2019s 5% on its way to 6% then that\u2019s going to get people concerned, if it\u2019s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.\u201d Red Flags The key isn\u2019t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump\u2019s policies. And that\u2019s putting equities in a vulnerable position. \u201cWhen you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,\u201d said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even including Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that\u2019s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies \u2014 Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. \u2014 are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they\u2019re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. \u201cInvestors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,\u201d said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. \u201cThe mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.\u201d That\u2019s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies\u2019 sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500. At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. \u201cThe companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable \u2014 and that could include the Mag Seven \u2014 and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,\u201d said Janus Henderson\u2019s Peron. \u201cWe\u2019ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek He Built Russia\u2019s Biggest Tech Company.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Gateley (Holdings)'s  ROE. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.  View our latest analysis for Gateley (Holdings)  The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Gateley (Holdings) is: 13% = UK\u00a310m \u00f7 UK\u00a380m (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2024). The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every \u00a31 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of \u00a30.13. We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features. At first glance, Gateley (Holdings) seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. Gateley (Holdings)'s decent returns aren't reflected in Gateley (Holdings)'smediocre five year net income growth average of 3.0%. A few likely reasons that could be keeping earnings growth low are - the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance. As a next step, we compared Gateley (Holdings)'s net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 8.7% in the same period. The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Gateley (Holdings)'s's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry. Gateley (Holdings) has a three-year median payout ratio of 67% (implying that it keeps only 33% of its profits), meaning that it pays out most of its profits to shareholders as dividends, and as a result, the company has seen low earnings growth. Additionally, Gateley (Holdings) has paid dividends over a period of nine years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 68%. However, Gateley (Holdings)'s ROE is predicted to rise to 26% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio. In total, it does look like Gateley (Holdings) has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

(NYSE:PRLB) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw a significant share price rise of 37% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at Proto Labs\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.  See our latest analysis for Proto Labs  Good news, investors! Proto Labs is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $56.85, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Proto Labs\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -18% expected next year, near-term growth certainly doesn\u2019t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Proto Labs. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk. Are you a shareholder? Although PRLB is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. We recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to PRLB, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on PRLB for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, we recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future. So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Mark Zuckerberg appeared on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast earlier this week, and he had a lot of words to say about Apple. In particular, the Meta chief targeted the company\u2019s innovative streak and the cumbersome ecosystem weaved around it. \u201cThey haven\u2019t invented anything great in a while. It\u2019s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they\u2019re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,\u201d Zuckerberg told Rogan. Here\u2019s the fun part. Meta \u2014 which went by the name Facebook not too long ago \u2014 tried to get a foothold in the phone market. And we\u2019re not just talking about social media apps here, but actual hardware. In 2011, the company partnered with HTC and launched two phones. The ChaCha was a QWERTY phone with a dedicated Facebook button at the button. The idea was to offer one-tap access to the Facebook social-verse. Then there was the HTC Salsa, which kept the \u201cf\u201d button but went for a regular full-screen slab format. Neither phone got a successor. Poor build, uninspiring internal hardware, and subpar camera experience were some of the issues that adopters faced. Two years later, Zuckerberg again knocked at HTC\u2019s doors and created a custom Android experience called Facebook Home. The software even received praise for its thoughtful design and clean looks on the HTC First smartphone. Unfortunately, smartphone enthusiasts didn\u2019t buy too much into the idea of a phone tied deeply into the social media fabric. Mind you, this was long before Facebook was deemed a ticking privacy bomb. Setting aside the reasons for the failures, Facebook simply wasn\u2019t deemed charming \u2014 or competent enough \u2014 to beat the rising tide of iPhones or even gain a foothold in the Android market. Alright, maybe Zuckerberg is not salty about those failures. It seems he is genuinely concerned about Apple losing its innovation mojo. And in his opinion, that is taking a toll on the sales figures as well. \u201cI am not even sure they are selling more iPhones at this point,\u201d he told Rogan. \u201cI think part of it is that each generation doesn\u2019t get that much better, so people are just taking longer to upgrade than they would before.\u201d The Meta chief is not entirely off the mark here. Apple has indeed lost its competitive edge to Chinese brands when it comes to smartphone innovations. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from selling more phones. Or even tablets, watches, or computers. Zuckerberg can\u2019t quite claim that Facebook excelled in those categories, either. Meta\u2019s best win in the XR hardware segment materialized only after it acquired Oculus for a couple of billion dollars. In 2022, Meta reportedly canceled its ambitious smartwatch project, according to Bloomberg. The same year, Reuters\u00a0reported that the short-lived Portal smart display line was also put on ice. During the nearly three-hour-long interview with Rogan, Zuckerberg also touched upon Apple\u2019s platform restrictions, using the AirPods as an example. \u201cThey\u2019ve just thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way,\u201d he said. Zuckerberg also broached the issue of Apple\u2019s App Store fee structure, which has attracted its fair share of criticism and antitrust concerns. \u201cSo, how are they making more money as a company? Well, they do it by basically, like, squeezing people,\u201d referring to the 30% fee Apple charges for apps and in-app purchases distributed via the App Store. Apple has loosened some of the restrictions \u2014 which include allowing external payment pipelines \u2014 following multiple investigations and Europe\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act (DMA) reforms. The interview is worth a watch, especially in the wake of dramatic changes at Meta in the past few days. The company has ended its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Meta has also ended its independent fact-checker system for Facebook and Instagram, aside from some questionable moderation changes, all of which have raised serious concerns. A complaint against Apple has been raised in the U.K. by industry giant BT Group, where it has voiced concerns over the company\u2019s use of eSIM technology, claiming it could hurt its business and stifle competition. The BT Group, which owns the EE network, the U.K.\u2019s largest mobile operator by subscribers, told the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) according to a report by The Telegraph: \u201cWe encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSIMs, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d If you use the popular messaging app WhatsApp on an iPhone, there may be times when you wish you had the ability to add more than one account. The good news is that a recent update for WhatsApp, released via Apple\u2019s TestFlight beta program, includes the feature, suggesting that it could be rolled out soon for everyone using WhatsApp on an iPhone. Android users will be scoffing at this news, as the feature has been available for WhatsApp on that platform since 2023. But hey, better late than never. In yet another contradicting leak, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17 Pro series to remain essentially the same as the one in the iPhone 16. Some of the first leaks about this year's iPhone suggested Apple might shrink the size of the Dynamic Island. This new rumor indicates the opposite, but it doesn't necessarily mean Jeff Pu was wrong in his initial theory. Apple could have changed course due to a variety of factors, including an uncertain economic climate and changing global regulations. The Dynamic Island has always been something of a contentious topic. Some fans love it, but others believe it takes up unnecessary space that would better be spent on the screen. Since its initial launch with the iPhone 14 Pro, the Dynamic Island has remained mostly untouched. Over the years, the rumor mill has stoked discussion over the feature, but it seems that it's here to stay, at least for another generation.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, the new Apple smart home hub, which some refer to as \u2018Apple command center\u2019 or simply \u2018HomePad\u2019, might ship a little bit later than anticipated. Apple has been working on a new device for your smart home for a decent while, and the company is expected to launch it this spring, particularly in March. As a refresher, here\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting with the product: Gurman also says you\u2019ll be able to \u201chang it on a wall or place it on a countertop \u2014\u00a0perhaps in a few spots around the home.\u201d Despite many rumors circulating for such a long time, it did sound like Apple was getting really close to finally releasing this thing. However, because of many of the Apple Intelligence delays, it might take a little bit longer to hit the market, according to Gurman: Apple has been\u00a0planning to introduce\u00a0the\u00a0home hub in March, but it may take longer to reach consumers. The device\u2019s new operating system \u2014\u00a0code-named Pebble \u2014\u00a0is heavily tied to App Intents features coming in iOS 18.4 and iOS 19, so it\u2019s plausible that the hardware itself will ship a bit later.\u00a0 Even though Apple is launching the hardware later, it still sounds like we\u2019re set to see an unveiling in the coming months. It\u2019s a little unfortunate that there\u2019ll be a release delay, but it makes sense given this products heavy reliance on Apple Intelligence. Gurman also reiterates that Apple is planning to launch \u2018LLM Siri\u2019, a more conversational chatbot-like assistant, in iOS 19.4 \u2013 which will launch in spring 2026.

But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the RM plc (LON:RM.) share price is up 72% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 4.9% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Unfortunately the longer term returns are not so good, with the stock falling 43% in the last three years. With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.  Check out our latest analysis for RM  Given that RM didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings. In the last year RM saw its revenue shrink by 8.4%. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned a solid 72% the last twelve months. To us that means that there isn't a lot of correlation between the past revenue performance and the share price, but a closer look at analyst forecasts and the bottom line may well explain a lot. You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). If you are thinking of buying or selling RM stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet. It's nice to see that RM shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 72% over the last year. That certainly beats the loss of about 10% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for RM   you should know about.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"   Manage your account  Firefighters fought on into the night Saturday in a bid to get on top of massive wildfires around Los Angeles as winds ramped up, pushing the blazes towards previously untouched neighborhoods. At least 16 people were now confirmed dead from fires that have ripped through the city, leaving communities in ruins and testing the mettle of thousands of firefighters -- and millions of California residents. Despite heroic efforts, including precision sorties from aerial crews, the Palisades Fire continued to grow Saturday, pushing east towards the priceless collections of the Getty Center art museum and north to the densely populated San Fernando Valley. \"We're a nervous wreck,\" Sarah Cohen told the Los Angeles Times of the threat to her Tarzana home. \"Every time they drop water, it gets better. But then it gets worse again.\" Footage from the Mandeville Canyon area showed one home consumed, with a wall of flame licking up a hillside to menace others. A brief lull in the wind was rapidly giving way to gusts that forecasters warned would feed the blazes for days to come. \"Critical fire-weather conditions will unfortunately ramp up again today for southern California and last through at least early next week,\" the National Weather Service said. \"This may lead to the spread of ongoing fires as well as the development of new ones.\" - Row - The Palisades fire was 11 percent contained Saturday but had grown to 23,600 acres (9,500 hectares), while the Eaton Fire was at 14,000 acres and 15 percent contained. Official figures show more than 12,000 structures burned, but Cal Fire's Todd Hopkins said not all were homes, and the number would also include outbuildings, recreational vehicles and sheds. The sudden rush of people needing somewhere new to live in the months ahead looked set to make life hard for already-squeezed renters in the city. \"I'm back on the market with tens of thousands of people,\" said a man who gave his name as Brian, whose rent-controlled apartment has burned. \"That doesn't bode well.\" With reports of looting and a nighttime curfew in place, police and National Guard have mounted checkpoints to prevent people getting into the disaster zones. But that has left residents frustrated as they queue for up to 10 hours to try to get back in and see what, if anything, is left of their homes. One woman, who gave her name as Janelle, told broadcaster KTLA she knew her house was gone, but she needed \"closure.\" \"I see the photos, I see the videos, and I just want to see it with my own eyes,\" she said, her voice breaking. The long queues left some people fuming about poor management, the latest gripe from a population already angry over hydrants that ran dry in the initial firefight. City officials put on a united front Saturday after reports of a behind-the-scenes row and suggestions that Mayor Karen Bass had sacked her fire chief. \"As you see here, the chief and I are lockstep in our number one mission, and that mission is to get us past this emergency,\" Bass told reporters. An at-times tense joint press conference came after Chief Kristin Crowley complained her fire department was short of cash. Among those known to have died in the tragedy was former Australian child star Rory Sykes, who appeared in British TV show \"Kiddy Kapers\" in the 1990s. \"It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of my beautiful son @Rorysykes to the Malibu fires yesterday. I'm totally heart broken,\" his mother Shelley Sykes wrote on social media. Teams with cadaver dogs were combing through the rubble, with several people known to be missing and fears that the death toll will grow. - Investigation - A huge investigation was underway to determine what caused the blazes, involving the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), along with local authorities, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. \"We are not going to leave any rock unturned,\" he said. \"If this is a criminal act -- I'm not saying it's going to be -- if it is, we need to hold whoever did this, or groups responsible,\" Luna added, appealing for anyone who had information to come forward. While the ignition of a wildfire can be deliberate, they are often natural, and a vital part of an environment's life cycle. But urban sprawl puts people more frequently in harm's way, and the changing climate -- supercharged by humanity's unchecked use of fossil fuels -- is exacerbating the conditions that give rise to destructive blazes. hg\/sn The rising young figure skater from Barrington, R.I. had thousands of social media followers.

An American Airlines flight with 64 people on board collided with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter with three soldiers aboard on Wednesday night Natalya Gudin and her husband, Alexandr Kirsanov, who coached two young figure skaters aboard American Airlines Flight 5342, had a choice to make before the plane took off: Who would go and who would stay.  The couple decided Kirsanov would fly to Wichita, Kansas, to accompany their skaters at the National Development Camp for figure skating, Gudin told ABC News in an interview.

(Photo by Aric Becker\/ISI Photos\/Getty Images) In Saturday\u2019s Sprouts Farmers Market Collegiate quad, a meet considered a \u201cpreview of the National Championship,\u201d the 10-time National Champion Utah Red Rocks finished a disappointing fourth. Though competing with the best in the nation in No. 1 Oklahoma, defending National Champions LSU, and National Runner-Up California, Utah\u2019s final score was the only sub-197 score of the day. Their tally marked an underwhelming result for the highly talented squad led by two Olympic medalists and the No. 1 freshman. While few questioned Utah\u2019s fourth place finish in the standings, the scoring that led to their final result raised eyebrows. In the eyes of the Utah fans and coaches, their scores were too low. Head Coach Carly Dockendorf voiced her frustration with the scoring in a post-meet press conference reported by The Salt Lake Tribune, marking a surprising departure from the typically impartial comments from NCAA coaches. \u201cThe scoring was interesting today,\u201d Dockendorf said. \u201cThere were just some routines that we were shaking our head a little,\u201d she said, adding that she understands they \u201ccan\u2019t control what the judges do.\u201d She continued, \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, though. It is really hard to do a beautiful routine, and then not feel like you\u2019re getting rewarded.\u201d Fans also took to social media to express frustration, with one expressing their desire to see the scores reviewed by the new judging review board. \u201cI hope the new SCORE board reevaluates this entire meet,\u201d they said. \u201cI'm thrilled the judges are taking deductions, but they have to be taken equally across all conferences and divisions.\u201d Another fan accused the judges of showing \u201cfavoritism\u201d towards SEC teams. While opinions differed on Dockendorf\u2019s reaction, she and her staff can take action. New in 2025, coaching staff can now submit specific routines to the newly appointed judging SCORE board. If an egregious score is detected, the judges responsible could be demoted as the season progresses. Dockendorf plans to do just that.  Dockendorf reported that Utah \u201cused all six of [their] routine summaries\u201d \u2013 the maximum amount allotted to each institution per-competition. \u201cWe just felt that there were some routines that I had no idea how we got those (scores),\u201d she added.

Though Dockendorf\u2019s statements were unusual, they are likely to be the first of many as the season progresses. In a year marked by significant change in the sport\u2019s evaluation process, growing pains are to be expected. While the more stringent week one scoring and SCORE Board are positive developments, the changes are detrimental if inconsistently applied.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Light Dark   Jan 7, 2025       About 42 mins    Although my first computer was an Apple II, I never was a Macintosh user, as my family switched afterwards to the PC. But reading the magazines made me familiar with this family of computers and I wanted to add a pre-OSX Macintosh to my collection for some time. The only things that refrained me were that most Macs use esoteric plugs and that I did not have the space. Until I stumbled on a YouTube video claiming that the Mac Mini G4 was one of the best machines to play pre-2000 games. It is indeed one very last PowerPC machine commercialized by Apple and the community modded Mac OS 9 to support it. The Mini G4 is built around a G4 CPU running at least at 1.25GHz. While modest by 2005 standards, this is more than twice the clock-speed of the first PowerMac G4 which was touted as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuper-computer\u00e2\u0080\u009d when it was commercialized in 1999. The machine promised to have enough power to run almost every game from the last century packed in the smallest space possible. This was the model I had to collect! This article will summarize the PowerPC developments leading to the G4, explain why a 2005 machine should be able to range 20 years worth of Mac games,  then present the Mini G4 and explain how to install Mac OS 9. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only here to see the games, you can jump straight to the end. Apple must hold the record of different CPU architectures used in the same family of computers. Through the years, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMacs\u00e2\u0080\u009d were powered by the 68000 family, then by PowerPC CPUs, then by Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and finally by ARM based \u00e2\u0080\u009cApple Silicon\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The G4, the heart of the Mac Mini, is one of the last PowerPC used in Apple computers. When Motorola introduced its 68000 in 1979, this was the bomb. The CPU was very powerful and prepared a bright future with 32-bit characteristics that promised to give birth to full 32-bit successors. The 68000 was a tremendous success and won a lot of designs, from home computers to UNIX Workstations. But it did not win the most important of all: the IBM PC. Excluded from the huge volumes of IBM and its clones, Motorola CPU division relied on relatively high margins from Apple and the Workstations to stay in the game. But in the mid-80s, all was compromised by the new buzzword: RISC. The RISC paradigm allowed the workstation integrators, such as SUN, to design a CPU tailored for their needs for a relatively modest price. And the cherry on the cake: they smoked their CISC contemporaries performance-wise. Motorola reacted by introducing its own RISC architecture, the 88000. But the design did not sell well. With the Workstation market lost, Motorola feared to become too dependent on the success of Apple which was its last major client for the more modern members of the 68K family. Meanwhile, Apple could see that the future of the 68K family was not assured and began to consider alternatives, including the 88000 from Motorola. But nothing on the market was truly satisfying until IBM proposed a deal. Of course, IBM was the major player in the PC market, the PC CPUs were provided by Intel and AMD. In the meantime, IBM was doing very well with its RS\/6000 line of computers that were powered by a brand new multi-chip RISC CPU named POWER. With the desire to expand its architecture to the desktop market IBM reached Apple and proposed them an alliance. Apple introduced Motorola to the deal as they had more experience producing CPUs in high quantity and for a low price: the AIM, Apple-IBM-Motorola, alliance was born in 1991. Among its goals: introduce a POWER compatible single chip CPU that would serve the needs of Apple and others in the desktop market. They called it the PowerPC. The AIM alliance gathered engineers from Motorola and IBM at the Somerset facility in Texas with the goal to produce a coherent family. The 601 was to be introduced as soon as 1993 while two new chips were to be designed in parallel and marketed one year later. The 603 was to target relatively low powered devices such as laptops and the 604, more powerful, aimed for workstation. And a few months later, AIM hoped to produce the 620, the first 64-bit PowerPC. If the instruction set was based on IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s POWER, Motorola provided the 60x bus, derived from its 88110. It had the advantage of reducing the engineering effort and costs for both the first PowerPC CPU and its motherboards. Based on prior works from IBM to produce a one-chip POWER CPU, the very first PowerPC, christened 601, was engineered in only one year! The first samples were available in October 1992 and the volume production started in mid-1993, with IBM introducing the RS\/6000 model 250, equipped with a 66MHz PPC 601 in October. The first Power Macintosh appeared in March 1994. The production volume allowed by Apple was very high compared to other RISC architectures and allowed Motorola to price the PowerPC 601 aggressively. But the 601 was not perfect: its architecture comprised only one Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that was used both for integer operations and address calculation. This was a heavy burden that would be alleviated in subsequent designs. Branch prediction was also more simplistic than on the Pentium.  PowerPC 601 block diagram (MPR 19921028) Nevertheless, without the need to decode the cumbersome x86 instructions, the 601 could use its transistor budget to provide a very generous 32-KB unified cache. It fared favorably against the Pentium in benchmark, especially when operating on floating point numbers. And with only 2.8 million transistors, it was cheaper to produce.  Starting with the 601, each generation, Motorola will try to price its PowerPC at half the price of a comparable Pentium (source: MPR 1993-05-10) The first reviews of the Power Macintosh were enthusiastic. Legacy 68K software ran through a very capable emulation layer at the speed of a mid-range 68040, while the software recompiled to take advantage of the chip were faster than on a PC, especially if they made use of the floating point unit. The 68000 emulation techniques will be discussed later on. The PowerPC 603 was introduced in May 1995 and was the first PowerPC designed from a clean sheet and was focused on low-cost and low-power, dissipating only around 2.5W at 66MHz, less than one third of the 601 at the same clock-speed. Its architecture introduced a dedicated Load\/Store Unit, speeding integer operations and had limited instruction reordering capabilities. In order to help cut costs and reduce power consumption, the 603\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cache was half the size of the 601\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and separated data from instructions. Thanks to the architectural improvements, the 603 was around as powerful as the 601 at a given clock-speed. Alas, the data cache was now too small for the 68000 emulation. As most of the code running on the Macintosh still required to be emulated, the PowerPC 603 gained the bad reputation of being slow.  The 603 architecture feature the dedicated branch and load\/store units (source: MPR 19931025)  Keys differences between the 601 and the 603 (sour: MPR 1993-10-25) Less than 6-months later, in October 1995, an enhanced 603e version was launched, doubling the amount of cache, at the cost of adding 1 million transistors. The 604 architecture was not a derivative of the 603\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as the two chips were designed in parallel. From the beginning, the 604 was planned to focus on sheer performance, demonstrating the full potential of the PowerPC. It came with almost everything bigger and more plentiful than on the 603. At the cost, of course, of being larger and more expensive to produce. The 604 had no less than three ALUs, one dedicated to complex operations such as multiplication and division and two dedicated to more typical single-cycle operations. In order to help keep all those ALUs busy, the instruction reordering capabilities were boosted as was the branch prediction circuitry which became fully dynamic. The 604 was the first PowerPC chip to implement a full double-precision floating-point unit. Other PowerPC designs only used a single-precision FPU that took less die area but required more time for double-precision operations. Finally the 604\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cache was bigger and more sophisticated than on the 603.  PowerPC 604 block diagram (source: MPR 19940418) When it was introduced to the market, in early 1995, the PowerPC 604 had no equivalent in the PC market. The Microprocessor Report went so far as to declare \u00e2\u0080\u009cPPC 604 Powers Past Pentium - PowerPC Chip Will Open Performance Gap, Possibly Permanently\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  The 600 family covered a wide range of performance and prices (MPR 19940418) But of course the Pentium, then the Pentium Pro, evolved quickly and a more performant revision, the 604e, was introduced in July 1996. Cache was doubled and a new functional unit was introduced to handle the condition registers. When the AIM alliance announced its plans in 1991, the PowerPC 620 was to be the pinnacle of the family. Targeting the uppermost segment of the market, it would be more powerful than even the 604 and would be the first 64-bit PowerPC. Compared to other RISC designs, PowerPC chips were very cheap to produce, but average performers. The 620 was the first intended to compete with the best RISC of its time when introduced in 1995. But things didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go as intended and the 620 was introduced in late-1997! At that time it was outdated and even the 604e could be faster. The 620 was quickly trashed and very few units sold, none to Apple.  The situation in mid-1994. Light grey CPUs were scheduled for 1995 and the 620 would allow the PowerPC to keep its price performance advantage. But it was 2-year late. (source: MPR 19940418) Introduced in November 1997, the PowerPC 750, or G3, used the 603 as a basis and improved it in every regard. As the main market for such a chip was Mac OS, its designers tuned it to better fit Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ecosystem. The G3 introduced a second ALU dedicated to simple operations, borrowed (and enhanced) the dynamic branch prediction capabilities of the 604 and tuned the TLB for Mac OS. The floating point unit was improved but, as on the 603, was not able to process full precision numbers as fast as half-precision ones. But the biggest performance improvement came from the caches. The L1 cache was doubled and the L2 cache was accessed by a dedicated backside bus, running at half or one third of the CPU frequency. As the G3 embedded every cache support chip, only the SRAM chips had to be added to the motherboard. This was a design that is very close to the Pentium II, but the cache still laid on the motherboard instead of being in the same package as the CPU.  The G3 block diagram (source: MPR 19970217) All these improvements allowed the G3 to be quite competitive with the Pentium II while remaining small and cheap to produce. Furthermore, its max power requirement was only around 5W which made it suitable for notebooks from day one.  The G3 was still competitive against the Pentium II. But the days of providing the same performance for half the price were gone. (MPR 19980824) The G3 quickly replaced all the 60x in Apple machines. The G3 was really nice but it missed something important compared to the Intel family: SIMD instructions. Those \u00e2\u0080\u009cvector\u00e2\u0080\u009d instructions can process multiple data at the same time and can speed up the algorithm used in video and audio processing. Multimedia was all the rage at the time! Intel introduced MMX with great fanfare on a revision of the Pentium in 1996. Restricted to integer only they were not very useful outside of some of these multimedia applications but were sold by the marketing as a huge advantage. As Intel was about to introduce MMX2, later renamed SSE, with the Pentium III, Motorola reacted by announcing Altivec: SIMD instructions coming with the PowerPC 7400, a.k.a G4. Altivec, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cVelocity Engine\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Apple, was really the star of the show concerning the G4. Outside the addition of this vector unit, the G4 was only an enhanced G3 ; the only significant difference being that its regular floating point unit was at last able to process double precision floating point at full speed. But Altivec was very ambitious. At a glance, it could seem that it only allowed the PowerPC to catch up with x86. Just like the SSE on the Pentium III, it was a SIMD instruction set manipulating 128-bit wide floating point vectors. A single instruction could be used to process four 32-bit floats at once. But far more transistors were dedicated on the G4 than on the Pentium III or any other architecture.  Altivec was late in the game, but was more advanced than other SIMD instruction sets. (source: MPR 19980511) Firstly, its instruction set was designed to be as clean and generalist as possible and not tuned to help a particular set of algorithms, while on the Intel side MMX and its first revision of SSE were not as powerful and flexible. In particular, Altivec provided an fmac instruction. This instruction is at the heart of many signal processing algorithms and could be processed way faster on the G4 than on the PIII. Furthermore Altivec provided a completely arbitrary permute instruction: very useful to reorder a data set between operations. Secondly, the G4 vector unit hosted 32\u00c2\u00a0128-bit dedicated registers vector operations, integer of floating point. Meanwhile, the Pentium III SSE only offered 8\u00c2\u00a0128-bit registers for floating point and the instruction set was \u00e2\u0080\u009c2-operands\u00e2\u0080\u009d, meaning that one of the registers had to be used as the result destination. The resulting pressure on the meager 8-register set was very high. Concerning the integral operations, MMX \u00e2\u0080\u009cborrowed\u00e2\u0080\u009d the registers set of the regular floating point unit. Those were only 64-bit wide and switching from regular floating point mode to MMX had a cost, while on the G4 there was no penalty for mixing AltiVec, integer, and FP instructions.  The G4 block diagram (source: MPR 19981116)  Zoom on the Altivec Unit (source: MPR 19981116) The G4 was competitive with regular code and was far ahead with vectored code, which was of course heavily supported by Apple. And as always, it was cheap to produce and cool enough to fit into laptops. But there was one caveat. Built on the G3, the G4 inherited its short pipeline. Longer pipelines help to boost the frequency at the cost of penalizing the performance in case of branch mis-predictions. Equipped with a 4 stage pipeline, the G4 was stuck for too long around 500MHz while Intel and AMD were racing toward the GHz. That is why in January 2001 Motorola shipped a 7-stage PowerPC 7450, which was sometimes called G4e. But other internal changes were so numerous that it could have been called the G5. Two new integer units were added and the vector units were also revamped for better performance. The L2 cache became embedded on the chip while circuitries were kept to support an external cache on a dedicated bus: the L3. Finally, in order to compensate for the longer pipeline, the branch predictor was greatly enhanced.  More than just a longer pipeline, the 74xx brought a lot of changes (Source: MPR 19991025) As the true G5, the PowerPC 970 from IBM, was too hot to be used in laptops and small form factors, Apple continued to ship computers with the G4e until the demise of its PowerPC line of computers. And that is why the Mac Mini G4 came to the market with a 1.25GHz or a 1.42GHz G4e as late as 2005. A perfect match for a cheap, small and silent Macintosh! Now we can see the whole evolution of the PowerPC CPUs that lead to the G4e  The evolution of the PowerPC leading to the G4e (Source: MPR 19991025) We just saw that the G4 powering the Mini was the result of a long line of PowerPC CPUs, all compatible. But the Mac platform history evolved during the years, and its CPU which was 68K based until 1995. I will discuss here how the 2005 Mini on Mac OS 9 should be able to run some 20 year older software, targeting another CPU family and a machine with different Sound and Graphical abilities. In 1994, while the 68K family was a dead end, the PowerPC was a clear path towards the future for the Macintosh line of computers. But there was a problem: all Macintosh softwares, including its System, were written to be run on a 68000 CPU and the PowerPC provided no backward compatibility. Without it, buying a new PPC Macintosh would have little more value than switching to a Pentium PC for most Apple customers. Fortunately, there is a way to run software written for other incompatible CPUs: emulation. Emulating \u00e2\u0080\u009clegacy software\u00e2\u0080\u009d when a new computer architecture was introduced was nothing new. IBM did it in 1964 in order for its then new System\/360 to run programs written for the IBM 1401. The downside is that emulating another CPU is very intensive and emulated programs run slower than it would on its original processor. A tricky problem for Apple: who would buy a brand new and expensive Macintosh only to discover that his programs run slower? Fortunately, Apple did not start from a blank sheet. When it was clear that the 68000 was losing steam, Apple explored ways to use a RISC processor in a Mac OS machine, more -than a year prior to the AIM alliance announcement. At first Apple tried to run an AMD 29000 alongside the 68000, both sharing memory, in order to accelerate parts of the OS that were heavily used by every application. Running Quickdraw and the Toolbox on the RISC chip would dramatically accelerate the system. Indeed, according to the \u00e2\u0080\u009c80\/20 rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d, most programs spent around 80% of their time executing 20% of the code, mainly those libraries. And at some point this question arose: \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dWould it be possible to emulate the 68000 on the RISC CPU?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This would pave the way to a more simple hardware design with a single CPU. The research team considered other RISC alternatives and finally settled on the Motorola 88000. A machine was even prototyped with an 88100 CPU plus two 88200 cache MMU units, plugged into the case of a Macintosh LC. It could boot and run the Macintosh ROM unmodified on an emulator written by Gary Davidian, as a single-person project.  The prototype of a Macintosh based on an 88100  (Source: computerhistory.org) Then, around October 1991 the PowerPC was announced: the future of the Macintosh became clear. But at the time of the announcement, there was no PowerPC yet to develop on. So the newly formed team developed on RS\/6000 computers then got a \u00e2\u0080\u009cRSC\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a one chip POWER CPU, development board that could be plugged into a Mac. And finally around September 1992, a proper PowerPC 601. Thanks to all the work done for the 88000, the emulator running on the PowerPC could be developed quickly and was even better. The emulator could simulate the user space of a 68LC040 plus the exception stack frames of a 68020. The Motorola floating point was not emulated as 80-bit floats could not be directly manipulated by the PowerPC FPU, and even 32-bit and 64-bit floats did not behave exactly the same on both processors. But this was not very important because, in 1994, very few applications made use of the FPU. Those which did were professional and domain specific programs that were natural candidates to be rewritten for the PowerPC to benefit from its performance. Furthermore, many other existing Mac applications performed their floating point calculus using the SANE (Standard Apple Numerics Environment) library, which was optimized for the PowerPC and ran better in the emulator than on a 68040 Macintosh. So with the new architecture, the System team had the following goals: The PowerPC version of System 7 was re-architectured around a NanoKernel and the tightly coupled 68000 emulator. The NanoKernel was responsible for the low level stuff requiring PowerPC native code. The 68K emulator would of course run all non-native code. In order to make it as fast as possible, the NanoKernel itself was optimized to serve the emulator very quickly for specific but common scenarios such as when a 68K application did a system call that would trigger its equivalent in the NanoKernel. When the first PowerPC machines shipped with the new System 7.1.2, most of the System 7 itself was not ported to PowerPC and was still running 68K code. In order to make disparate PowerPC code and 68K code work together, Apple introduced the Mixed Mode Manager. It allowed functions in the PowerPC ISA to call functions in the 68K ISA and vice versa. Which was not a small achievement, as the 68K calling convention depended on the programming language used. This was obviously costly. That is why some programs could pay a heavy price when going, from instance from a native function to a System function still in 68k then maybe to another System function ported to PowerPC and so on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Architecture of the System Software For performance reasons, Apple was incited to port more and more functions to PowerPC in each Mac OS release. We can guess that the goal of having a 100% PowerPC Mac OS was achieved around October 1998, when Mac OS 8.5 was the first to require a PowerPC to run. Furthermore, the emulator itself, and with it the ability to run 68K code, became better and faster with each \u00e2\u0080\u009cclassical\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mac OS version and was present until the very last version: Mac OS 9.2.2. The following benchmark was published in the May 1994 issue of MacWorld. They were by measuring the running execution time of various tasks in real world 68K applications. FPU tests did not run on a true FPU: they were emulated by integer functions, even on the Quadra 800. All times are in seconds. We can see that when emphasis is placed on pure 68K execution speed, the PowerPC machines fare less well than a low-end 68040. But the result is way better when the speed of the video subsystem is measured, as Quickdraw ran a lot of native code. Even if the performances were not stellar, they were good enough. The PowerPC models sold on the promise of delivering more performance with future PowerPC aware applications. And they did. The original 128K Macintosh and the following models could display 512 \u00c3\u0097 342 bitmap graphics in pure black and white. It is well known that the machine was revolutionary at the time of it introduction, for it was entirely mouse driven and provided a rich set of APIs so the programmer had not to bother with too much of low-level details. QuickDraw was dedicated to producing and displaying custom 2D graphics. But some programmers thought they could do a better job and directly accessed the framebuffer. As modern GPUs do not work the same way and do not offer pure black and white capabilities, it will pose compatibility problems. Fortunately, starting with the Macintosh II introduction in 1987, the System had to handle 16 ou 256-color displays. QuickDraw had to be modified to offer more abstraction: the application could allocate a 1-bit, 4-bit or 8-bit framebuffer and QuickDraw hid the ugly details. It also did its best to assure compatibility with existing programs. So if a game conformed to the QuickDraw API, it should work on the Mini, even if it is antique and in pure black and white. The sound capabilities of the 1984 Macintosh were quite good for its time. As the IBM PC, it was equipped with a speaker driven by a timer and able to produce square-waves. However, it could also produce complex sounds using hardware assisted Pulse-Width Modulation. This is a technique that can approximate \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormal\u00e2\u0080\u009d waveforms  using only amplitude-fixed squares.  The red waveform can be approximated by a speaker driven by the blue pulses (Source: Wikipedia) Some rare PC, or even Apple II, games used the same technique. But it was not trivial and, without any hardware assistance, very CPU intensive. But on Macintosh, there were some hardware facilities. At each end of each rasterline, one byte from a small buffer was read by a DMA and provided to a Pulse-Width modulator. This could approximate the rendition of a monoral 8-bit 22.25-KHz sampled sound. Finally a 8-step attenuation could be applied to the final level as a way to control the volume. Of course, a friendly API was provided: the Sound Driver. It could produce squared sound, 4-tone synthesized sound, or play provided samples. Behind the stage, the Sound Driver computed the appropriate samples and populated the buffer. If square and given-samples were somewhat easy to handle, computing the 4-tone synthesis could occupy up to 50% of the 8-MHz 68000 time! With the introduction of the Macintosh II, a more modern API was provided: the Sound Manager. Indeed, the Macintosh II audio hardware had little in common with its older sibling. It was based on a true codec able to play 8-bit stereo sound sampled at 44.1-KHz and a 4-channel wavetable synthesizer. Furthermore, it was now common for computers to connect to external synthesizers through MIDI or record sounds. The Sound Manager had to offer a more flexible abstraction to the underlying hardware. But it was also supporting the old Sound Driver functions for compatibility purposes. In order to produce sound with the new interface, the application provided \u00e2\u0080\u009cchannels\u00e2\u0080\u009d of commands to a \u00e2\u0080\u009csynthesizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d which could be one of three sort: Those commands could go to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodifier\u00e2\u0080\u009d before being fed to the selected synthesizer, for instance to add an effect or change the pitch. Each synthesizer could handle several channels, mixed together leading to the production of complex sound and melody. All of this independently to the underlying hardware. That is why the Mac Mini G4 should be able to play sound, even if it is equipped with a standard audio codec, as were the majority of PCs of the time: MacOS9 Sound Manager should do whatever is required to play sounds according to the commands. It contrasts with the situation on PC, where at the time of MS DOS games had to directly speak to the hardware and provided several drivers for the most popular sound cards of the time. Of course, Sound Blaster prevailed, but the clone had to be compatible at the hardware level and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a card today that is the perfect solution to cover every MS DOS game. Unfortunately, Sound Driver was marked as obsolete at the time of System 7, in 1991. System 7 continued to be compatible, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if it was still the case at the time of Mac OS 9. I hope so \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0085. So to conclude about sound compatibility. It ought to be excellent for games that followed Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidelines and used Sound Manager, starting around 1987. For those which used the older Sound Driver: \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009e The Mac Mini G4 was introduced in January 2005 at a starting point of $499. As Steve Jobs stated on stage, its main purpose was that \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople that are thinking of switching will have no more excuses\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In addition to being the cheapest Mac ever, the Mac Mini was designed to have a very small footprint, run cool and silent, and be used along any standard keyboard, mouse and display. Thus, it came with many standard ports that are still supported nowadays: USB, Ethernet and DVI\/VGA. The Mac Mini G4 is still quite easy to plug and interact with \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082.  Most of the ports are still usable nowadays The hardware configuration of the $499 Mac Mini G4 was as follow: A beefier model with a 1.42-GHz CPU and an 80-GB hard-drive was also sold for $100 more.  Top-side of the motherboard  Bottom-side of the motherboard. The GPU does not even need a heat-sink. Considering the PowerPC retrospective exposed earlier, even a 1.25-GHz is a quite powerful CPU for our objective: running Mac OS applications and games up to the very early 00s. The lowest amount of memory, 256-MB, is a bit short for Mac OS X, but is plenty for our purpose. And it is easy to replace the memory module. The GPU needs a little presentation of its own. The ATI Radeon 9200 was an entry-level card. Despite its name, it had not much in common with the powerful Radeon 9700 that was commercialized at the same time. The 9200 was a kind of a stripped down Radeon 8500. As such it was a DirectX 8.1 class GPU, whose capabilities were comparable to a Geforce3\/Geforce4 or the GPU in the original Xbox. In the Mini G4, the 9200 is paired with only 32-MB of VRAM which by 2005, when the machine shipped, was frankly ridiculous. This was the amount of memory that shipped with 1999 PC GPUs such as a NVIDIA TNT2 or a first generation of Geforce. Graphics are clearly the weak point of the machine. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect the Mini to be able to run 3D games in extra high resolutions. You can even feel it when opening more than a few windows in Mac OS X. But once again, the purpose exposed here is to run older games and programs. The ATI driver is good, notably concerning OpenGl support, even on Mac OS 9. We will see that 3D games such as Quake 3 run smoothly \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008a. Finally, you can easily open the machine to upgrade the RAM and replace the slow mechanical hard-drive with a SSD plugged into a PATA adapter. The Mac Mini G4 shipped with Mac OS X 10.3 \u00e2\u0080\u009cPanther\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It could run pre-OSX applications through the Classic Mode, a complete OS 9 running in some kind of VM. It allowed a good amount of compatibility with many programs, but anything trying to directly access the hardware would fail. It is better to run the real thing, even if Mac OS 9 was never officially supported on the Mini. Fortunately, the community hacked an official version from a close hardware configuration and managed to port Mac OS 9.2.2 to the Mac Mini G4! The only caveats are that the internal speaker is not supported and the sound level is fixed at around 33% when using the line output. This can be cumbersome, but if you are using an external amplifier, it is a minor annoyance. The first step is to get the ISO dedicated to the Mac Mini G4. If you need a Mac OS X ISO but do not have the disc that came with your Mini you will be able to find them on specialized websites. In order to boot on a Mac OS install disc, press Option (alt on a PC keyboard) when you hear the chime at the very beginning of the boot process. A menu will allow you to choose your boot medium.  The boot selection screen If you want to dual boot Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, boot on  the Mac OS X disc. Then use the Disk Utility to split the existing partition into two new ones. I called mine Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. Then install OS X into its partition.   Restart the computer but this time,  boot with the OS 9 disc. It will automatically display a text file containing the proper install instructions. Basically, it consists of restoring the image that is contained on the CD to your partition of choice.  Et voil\u00c3\u00a0!  The Mac Mini G4 can now boot on either OS \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008e Just be aware that OpenFirmware, the first stage of the boot process can be a little picky concerning the keyboard and the mouse that are plugged. In my case, I was not pleased by my Logitech USB keyboard and refused to display any other bootable medium than the regular OS X hard-drive that came pre-installed in the machine. It took me many hours of trials before I finally swapped the keyboard\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Once Mac OS is booted, everything works as expected\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 except for the internal speaker which remains silent! And unfortunately the line sound output is fixed at around 40% of the max level and cannot be set otherwise. But if you have an external amplifier, it is no problem. If you are used to Windows, you will be disturbed by the lack of right-click support, even if you plugged a standard PC mouse. You can download drivers corresponding to the manufacturer to alleviate this problem. Here is a link to Logitech drivers.  SpeedOMeter 4.02 running in native PowerPC mode The Mac Mini G4 is three times faster than a PowerPC G4 400. The computer that was bragged as a Supercomputer by Steve Jobs. Despite the fact that this bench is entirely synthetic and a bit too old, it indicates that the CPU power should be plenty enough to run any power-hungry game or applica\ttion from the late 1990s.  SpeedOMeter 4.02 running in the 68K emulator And equally important, even when emulating a 680x0 to run legacy software, the Mini is far more powerful than a Quadra 950, one of the most powerful 68K Macintosh ever released by Apple. No legacy application will lack CPU. Until now, I affirmed that the Mac Mini G4 would be perfect to run most of the Macintosh library, backed by some history, technical facts and benchmark.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"From Tillman and Yun, \u201cGains from Gunboats: U.S. Aircraft Carriers and Financial Markets in East Asia\u201d (2025).  Asia, in particular East Asia and the South China Sea, is one of the regions that are particularly exposed to geopolitical risk. We study the impact of an increased presence of the U.S. military in Asia on asset prices and capital inflows in the region. For that purpose, we construct a novel index from local newspapers reporting on the presence of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups in the region and estimate the market impact of a surprise change in this index. Our findings reveal that a higher military presence causes an increase in stock prices, an appreciation of the local currency, and an inflow of foreign capital, but also a higher level of geopolitical risk. Interestingly, during the first Trump administration, some effects change the sign. We also distinguish between newspapers reporting on the deployments of U.S. aircraft carriers related to tensions with North Korea and those related to tensions with China. Here are the impulse response functions for variables associated with Korea and Taiwan.  \u00a0  Note that FX is defined so down is an appreciation of the local currency. CSG = \u201ccarrier strike group\u201d. Hence, the stock market, currency and equity inflows respond significantly to unexpected appearances of CSGs. In contrast, no such effect is found for China. As an aside, here are CSG and ARG deployments as of 6 January 2025:  Source:\u00a0USNI, accessed 1\/11\/2025. DoD\u2019s annual report on Military and Security Developments involving the PRC is here.

Repeating myself here: \u201cOrigins of Stock Market Fluctuations\u201d https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w19818 The abstract: \u201cThree mutually uncorrelated economic disturbances that we measure empirically explain 85% of the quarterly variation in real stock market wealth since 1952\u2026 In the short run, shocks that affect the willingness to bear risk independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most of the variation in the market.\u201d That looks consistent with the gunboat effect described by Tillman and Yun. The other two determinants? Allocation of returns between factors is the biggest determinant of returns in the long runs, with productivity a smaller factor. Also, tangentially, this: \u201cDo Financial Crises Differ Between Periods of Hegemony and Power Struggles?\u201d https:\/\/archive.ph\/o\/F5Z3r\/https:\/\/www.lse.ac.uk\/Economic-History\/Assets\/Documents\/Workshops\/Financial-Crises-Cassis\/Papers\/Final-Brezis-financial-crisis-June-2024.pdf From the abstract: \u201c\u2026hegemony is associated with (financial crisis) \u2018isolation\u2019 periods, while (financial crisis) \u2018contagion\u2019 tends to occur during phases of \u2018struggle for power\u2019. In consequence, during periods of \u2018struggle for power\u2019, financial contagion tends to occur, whereas hegemony fosters containment.\u201d It may be a stretch, but while we are pretty clearly in a \u2018struggle for power\u2019 period, it may be that reassertion of hegemony \u2018fosters containment\u2019 sufficiently to support risk taking in regional financial markets. Or not. I dunno. Not to get all Yves Smith \u201cmilitary industrial complex\u201d conspiratorial, but knowing that U.S. gunboats improve equity performance does look like a reason for richies to support military spending. The investor class benefits from the taxes (interest payments) imposed on the general public. Macroduck: I agree we shouldn\u2019t use equity returns as sole reason for undertaking *public* policies. However, to the extent that equity returns signals positive economic activity in our allies\u2019 economies, I\u2019m for it. Yep.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"According to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, Apple will be launching a new Apple Watch SE later this year, as well as introducing refreshes for Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3. Based on today\u2019s rumors, it\u2019s sounding like it\u2019ll be a big year for Apple Watch. Gurman doesn\u2019t provide many specifics for the new Apple Watch SE, other than the fact that it\u2019ll \u2018sport a new look\u2019. Apple introduced Apple Watch SE in 2020, based on the design of 2018\u2019s Apple Watch Series 4. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll be getting a design that more closely resembles 2021\u2019s Apple Watch Series 7 \u2013 or maybe it\u2019ll be something new entirely. In the past, Mark Gurman has reported that Apple is considering a plastic body for Apple Watch SE, so it\u2019s possible he\u2019s referring to that. In any case, if you\u2019re in the market for an Apple Watch SE, I\u2019d hold out for this new model, which should finally launch this year. If Apple ends up going with a plastic Apple Watch SE, I\u2019d also expect a bunch of fun colors to come alongside it. The higher-end Apple Watches, on the other hand, shouldn\u2019t introduce any sort of new design. Gurman says they\u2019ll \u2018probably stay roughly the same.\u2019 However, that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be anything to look forward to. Apple Watch Ultra 3 should be gaining support for satellite connectivity and 5G RedCap, vastly expanding users connectivity options. Apple will also likely introduce high blood pressure detection on both Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 later this year. Apple\u2019s blood pressure readings won\u2019t give users exact numbers, but instead warn users of anything they should be aware of: The blood-pressure feature\u2026is designed to work in a similar way to Apple\u2019s sleep apnea detector. It won\u2019t give users specific readings \u2014 such as diastolic or systolic levels \u2014 but it will inform them that they may be in a state of hypertension. Blood pressure monitoring was initially expected to debut in Apple Watch Series 10, but got delayed due to the new, thinner design of the watch. Apple should be ready to launch it this year, however. Gurman also mentions that Apple is working on a new AI coaching service and an all new health app, though timing is unclear. These additions should coincide with the launch of AirPods with heart rate monitoring. If all of these rumors come to fruition, it sounds like Apple will be refreshing every single Apple Watch model at once, something the company hasn\u2019t done since 2022, where they introduced Apple Watch SE 2, Apple Watch Series 8, and the original Apple Watch Ultra. We were expecting this in 2024, but instead of Apple Watch Ultra 3, we just got a new black titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2 instead, and the new Apple Watch SE mysteriously never shipped. Nonetheless, hopefully everything works out this year. Are you looking forward to Apple\u2019s 2025 Apple Watch lineup? Let us know in the comments.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":" Created in January 08, 2025     2025  \u00a0 \u00b7 \u00a0   AI, \u00a0   Startups  tl;dr: Recent AI progress has enabled new products that solve a broad range of problems. I saw this firsthand watching over 100 pitches during YC alumni Demo Day. These problems share a common thread - they\u2019re simple enough to be solved with constrained AI. Yet the real power of AI lies in its flexibility. While products with fewer constraints generally work better, current AI models aren\u2019t reliable enough to build such products at scale. We\u2019ve been here before with AI, many times. Each time, the winning move has been the same. AI founders need to learn this history, or I fear they\u2019ll discover these lessons the hard way. In 2019, Richard Sutton started his famous essay \u201cThe Bitter Lesson\u201d with: \u201cThe biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin\u201d. He points out that throughout AI\u2019s history, researchers have repeatedly tried to improve systems by building in human domain knowledge. The \u201cbitter\u201d part of the title comes from what happens next: systems that simply use more computing power end up outperforming these carefully crafted solutions. We\u2019ve seen this pattern in speech recognition, computer chess, and computer vision. If Sutton wrote his essay today, he\u2019d likely add generative AI to that list. And he warns us: this pattern isn\u2019t finished playing out. \u201cAs a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes (\u2026). We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation\u201d From an AI research perspective, the Bitter Lesson deals with clear definitions of \u201cbetter.\u201d In computer chess, it\u2019s your win rate; in speech recognition, it\u2019s word accuracy. But this post looks at AI products in the application layer (see Figure 1), where \u201cbetter\u201d means both performance and adoption in the market. We\u2019ll cover adoption in Chapter 2. For now, let\u2019s focus on product performance - the amount of economically valuable work a product can replace. Better performance means handling more complex problems, which unlocks more value.  Figure 1, illustration of different types of AI products. In this post, we talk about the application layer. AI products are typically an AI model wrapped in some packaging software. You can improve their performance in two ways: You can pursue both paths, but here\u2019s the crucial insight: as models improve, the value of engineering effort diminishes. Right now, there are huge gains to be made in building better packaging software, but only because current models make many mistakes. As models become more reliable, this will change. Eventually, you\u2019ll just need to connect a model to a computer to solve most problems - no complex engineering required.  Figure 2, illustration of the diminishing returns of engineering effort when building AI products in the application layer. The value diminishes both as more engineering effort is made and as better models are released. The graph above shows how engineering effort becomes less valuable as models improve. Current models have significant limitations, which means companies can still gain a lot from engineering work. I saw this at YC alumni Demo Day, where companies were finding success. The landscape splits into two groups: those with products in production at scale (solving simple problems) - a small group for now - and those targeting slightly more complex problems. This second group is doing well because their proof-of-concepts suggest their goals are achievable with enough engineering effort. But here\u2019s the key question these companies face: will the next model release make all that engineering work obsolete, destroying their competitive advantage? The launch of OpenAI\u2019s o1 model illustrates this risk. I spoke with many founders in the AI application layer who were worried because they\u2019d invested heavily in perfecting prompts to boost performance. But with o1, prompt engineering matters less. As Figure 2 shows, o1 is smarter, but this means there\u2019s less value in the engineering work these companies did. At its core, this engineering effort aims to constrain AI and reduce its mistakes. From observing many solutions, I\u2019ve identified two main types of constraints: These two types of constraints create a framework for categorizing AI products: Table 1: Classification of famous AI products. Note that ChatGPT likely follows a predefined code path for each message, making it a workflow rather than an agent. Let\u2019s explore how each category might be implemented for the same task: a business analyst creating investment pitch slides. Here\u2019s one possible approach for each: Almost all products at Demo Day fell into the vertical workflow category. This makes sense - current models aren\u2019t reliable enough for other approaches. As a result, even problems too complex for vertical workflows are being forced into this mold since it\u2019s the only way to get close to acceptable performance with current model capabilities. While engineering can improve these solutions, there\u2019s an upper limit to what it can achieve. For problems that are out of reach with current models, the better strategy would be to wait for more capable models that can handle them with minimal engineering. As Leopold Aschenbrenner argues in \u201cSituational Awareness,\u201d for many problems, the engineering work will take longer than the wait for better models: \u201cIt seems plausible that the schlep will take longer than the unhobbling, that is, by the time the drop-in remote worker is able to automate a large number of jobs, intermediate models won\u2019t yet have been fully harnessed and integrated\u201d This pattern should sound familiar. Let\u2019s return to the Bitter Lesson. AI researchers repeatedly tried to engineer their way to \u201cacceptable performance,\u201d only to be overtaken by more general solutions that simply used more compute. The parallel to how today\u2019s AI products are built is striking. And we can make this connection even clearer by examining how the Bitter Lesson applies to our two types of constraints: For problems with unclear solution paths, products with more autonomy will achieve better performance. Similarly, when dealing with large, complex input spaces, less specific products will perform better. This is the first in a four-part series examining the role of startups in AI. We\u2019ve observed a historical pattern: AI models that leverage domain knowledge consistently get overtaken by those that leverage compute. Today\u2019s AI products show striking parallels to this pattern. Though I\u2019ve tried to focus on observations rather than opinions in this first part, my view likely shows through. Building software to compensate for current model limitations seems like fighting a losing battle, especially given how rapidly models are advancing. As Jarred, partner at YC, noted in the Lightcone podcast: \u201cthat first wave of LLM apps [vertical workflows] mostly did get crushed by the next wave of GPTs.\u201d Sam Altman has repeatedly advocated for building startups that make you excited for releases of better models, rather than scared of them. Many of the founders in the AI application layer I speak to are excited about model releases, but for the sake of their startup, I don\u2019t think they should be. They might be missing the insight from Figure 2; better models might actually reduce your edge, not enhance it. Of course, this is from the point of view of product performance - building something that can solve harder problems more effectively. In the next part, we\u2019ll explore a different dimension: market adoption. After all, having better performance doesn\u2019t guarantee winning the market. There\u2019s another way to understand the Bitter Lesson using basic statistics. When building models, you typically face a tradeoff. You can either make a model that\u2019s very precise in how it approaches problems (high bias) or one that\u2019s more flexible but less predictable (high variance). The Bitter Lesson suggests choosing the flexible approach. Why? Because with more compute power and data, you can make flexible models more reliable. It\u2019s like having more practice shots in basketball - eventually, you\u2019ll become consistent even with a less rigid shooting form. The reverse isn\u2019t true - a overly rigid approach will always be limited by its built-in assumptions. This maps directly to our discussion of AI products. Vertical workflows and specific constraints are like adding rigid rules - they make the AI more reliable now but limit how good it can eventually become. In contrast, letting AI operate more freely might seem risky today, but it allows the AI to find better solutions as models improve. As we\u2019ve seen throughout this essay, betting against flexibility has historically been a losing strategy.  Figure 1: Comparison of traditional machine learning, which requires manual feature engineering, with deep learning\u2019s end-to-end approach. The traditional approach needs humans to define what\u2019s important in the data, while deep learning figures this out by itself. Traditional machine learning requires humans to decide what\u2019s important in the data. You take raw input, like an image, and manually extract meaningful patterns or \u201cfeatures\u201d - like counting specific shapes or measuring certain properties. Deep learning, in contrast, learns these patterns automatically.  Figure 2: Self-driving car visualization showing feature extraction in action. The system identifies and tracks specific objects like cars, pedestrians, and lane markings. This represents the traditional approach of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, defined pieces. Let\u2019s use self-driving cars as an example. You could build it two ways: The feature engineering approach feels safer and more controlled. That\u2019s why it dominated early AI. But as George Hotz observed: \u201cif anything about the history of AI has taught us anything, it\u2019s that feature engineering approaches will always be replaced and lose to end-to-end.\u201d  Figure 3: Tweet from Sholto Douglas This connects directly to our discussion of AI products. Building vertical-specific tools is like feature engineering - you\u2019re deciding what information matters ahead of time. When you constrain a model\u2019s autonomy, you\u2019re doing the same thing. While this might work better today, history suggests betting on end-to-end approaches will win in the long run.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Before announcing his plan to resign come spring, Auden Schendler spent 26 years working as the vice president of corporate sustainability for Aspen One, which operates the world-famous ski resorts around the posh community on Colorado\u2019s Western Slope. His career led him to a tough lesson about his field: it\u2019s a failure that perpetuates the very systems driving global warming. In his new book, \"Terrible Beauty,\" Schendler argues corporate sustainability amounts to a set of small-scale fixes that distract the public from more effective solutions. Rather than gauge their carbon footprints and purify their recycling streams, it\u2019s time for climate-conscious companies to enter the political arena and fight the fossil fuel industry, Schendler said.  He insists the same lesson applies to individuals worried about rising global temperatures. It\u2019s easy enough to drive a hybrid or use paper straws, but if someone wants a better future for their children, they should fight for a carbon tax \u2014 even though Schendler fears that the ship has sailed (on rising sea levels). He says everything is worth a shot when the planet\u2019s at stake.  Schendler joined Colorado Matters to speak with Senior Host Ryan Warner about his new book, his career and why he hopes companies consider suing ExxonMobil. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. Ryan Warner: Let's start at the end of your book. The appendix is \u201cHow to sue ExxonMobil for Private Nuisance,\u201d and it embodies the kind of corporate action you apparently long for. So why isn't Aspen Skiing Company suing one of the largest oil companies in the world? Auden Schendler: Way to start at the hardest part. So my work and our work here at Aspen One, which used to be Aspen Skiing Company, has been asking the question, \u201cWhat would matter if you actually cared about climate change and what would be the things that drive change at scale, that move systems, that move policy and politics?\u201d One of the ideas that came to us, it wasn't our idea, was that a private corporation nor even a public corporation had sued a fossil fuel company for hiding science and preventing society from taking action on climate. So we actually tried this. We made a run at it pretty aggressively a number of years ago, and we weren't able to pull it off because when you suggest suing a giant corporation, there's all kinds of risk involved, including that they ask you, for example, for all your emails from the last 30 years. That's called legal discovery. So we weren't able to do it. But as you know from just following the news, there's a lot of legal action against the fossil fuel industry. And we think this is a pretty powerful leverage point to drive change. And so it's a good way to end the book because the book is all about \u201cwhat would you do if you really cared?\u201d Warner: So you're asking someone with a greater spine than Aspen One to do it? Schendler: I think that might be right. A company that has the specific interest in doing this\u2013 that is willing to take the risk, maybe isn't connected to other businesses. Someone's going to do it. We've done a lot of interesting and aggressive things in our work and this one didn't happen, but the idea was so good, someone's going to do it and we wanted to lay it out there. Warner: Aren\u2019t Boulder and San Miguel counties in Colorado suing ExxonMobil for burying scientific evidence of climate change? Schendler: Yes, and that's how this started. I got invited to join that suit and we didn't like exactly how that suit was framed, but that's what led us to this. The difference is there are many municipalities and governments\u2013 and even trade groups \u2013 suing ExxonMobil, but there hasn't been a corporation yet. Warner: Are there practical effects to the kind of suit you're calling for in the book? Schendler: One of the opposition points in that lawsuit was that lawyers told me, \u201cYou can't win the lawsuit and it would take 15 years anyway.\u201d And I said, \u201cWe're not trying to win it.\u201d When you sue ExxonMobil, it's going to be front-page news. It's a major assault to their license to operate, and it affects their public image. It's a PR hit. So there's all kinds of value in educating the public and influencing corporate practice just by filing the suit. And I think that was actually missed by a lot of the legal counsel we got. Warner: Your new book is part memoir, part tirade against the corporate climate movement, and part philosophy. What do you want people to take away? Schendler: The book is trying to get at this question of the gap between what people say they care about and what they do in response to a threat to all of it. If you ask the average American, \u201cWhat do you love? What do you care about?\u201d They'd say, \u201cMy family, my partner, my children, the natural world that I visit and recreate in\u2013 those things are important to me, my community.\u201d And then you say \u201cClimate change is a threat to all of those things. An existential threat. What are you doing about it?\u201d And the reality on the ground from the last election is people barely even vote. And when they take action, those actions tend to be token recycling, and they don't take the next step of saying \u201cwhat would really matter?\u201d So the takeaway from the book is that the beauty of the world, our families, the stories we tell about ourselves, these are so precious that they're worth protecting. I'm hoping that that love and that caring will propel people to do really meaningful work on climate change. Warner: Is love a better motivator than fear? Schendler: I think it is. Historically, we've made these arguments to work on climate: National security, energy security, protecting our economies. And the reality is that successful social movements never have a technical basis. That's not what gets humans fired up. If you think about the Civil Rights Movement, that was a moral movement. Even more modern movements like marriage equality\u2013 that was moral. So my thesis, and there's social science to back this up, is that people are going to be motivated by love and morality and ethics and humanity more than they are by a logical, technical or economic argument. Warner: You've spent 25 years at Aspen Skiing Company\u2013 now Aspen One\u2013 a lot of that time focused on carbon accounting, shrinking the company's footprint. But you write your initial enthusiasm became eventual disillusionment. How so? Schendler: A number of years ago, I was riding my bike at lunch (which you can do when you have a job like this) and this word kept popping into my head. The word was complicity. And I started doing a thought experiment, which was as follows, \u201cIf I were the fossil fuel industry and I wanted to ensure that corporations appeared to be taking meaningful environmental action, but not ever got in the way of the fossil fuel industry's ability to monetize $33 trillion in proven reserves, what would that program look like?\u201d The answer was \u201cit would look like corporate sustainability as currently practiced.\u201d That means taking blame for the problem, focusing on your own operations, committing to the free market, to voluntary reductions, but never supporting regulation. And being a member of a trade group that actually opposes these things while you're professing that you care about them. Warner: You're speaking of the US Chamber of Commerce there. Schendler: Correct. Using questionable tools like carbon offsets to try to address your own issues and really never doing anything scary or dangerous to a fossil fuel status quo economy. Warner: Is Aspen One a member of the US Chamber of Commerce? Schendler: No, we're not. Warner: You call a carbon tax in this book a political impossibility. Schendler: Yeah, I think a carbon tax is a necessary solution, and it's currently a political impossibility because taxation is so verboten. But think about this: Monday morning is trash day for us, and instead of taking my trash can out onto the street and having it picked up for which I pay about $250 a quarter, what if I just dumped the trash on the street and hoped and waited for my community to pick it up, or to just suffer from my trash? That's what we're doing with CO2 pollution. It's harmful. We know how it harms people, and we are allowed to dump it into the air every day, every week for free. There's nothing free-market about that. There's nothing Libertarian about that. We should have to pay for the impact of pollution. And we don't. Warner: Growing up in New Jersey shaped your personal environmental perspective\u2013 smoggy skies, water pollution\u2014 eventually addressed by big environmental regulations like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act. There is certainly the Inflation Reduction Act, which you extol throughout the book, but explain why you think this country doesn't pass these sort of sweeping environmental regulations anymore. Schendler: I was born in New Jersey in 1970, and as I say in the book, I played baseball on top of the Lincoln Tunnel, which is the main tunnel going into Manhattan. And there would be purple plumes of pollution billowing up from the cars going in, and we'd occasionally foul balls off into the traffic and nobody seemed to care. The baseball would drop 200 feet and could have killed somebody. But this was Jersey in the 70s and 80s. You had massive inflation. You had very, very high interest rates for homes. You had the South Bronx on fire, the Vietnam War just ending. It was a dismal place.  And I grew up always thinking, \u201cI hate New Jersey.\u201d And when I got older, I realized, no, the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, the Clean Water Act, 1972, and those were taking effect when I was young. And what I didn't like \u2013 what I hated \u2013 was America before environmental regulation. And so those regulations were profound, but they were also draconian. They really did change America. And part of what I posit in the book is that corporate America said \u201cThat was great, but we never again want to see that level of regulation.\u201d That was paired with a trend toward neoliberal free market thinking, which was really boosted by Reagan, who famously said, \u201cGovernment isn't the solution, it's the problem.\u201d Warner: I wonder if you're expecting too much from corporations. I mean, if a company is publicly traded, it has to turn a profit for shareholders. And I can imagine a CEO hearing this and thinking \u201cClimate activism's nice, but leave it to Greta Thunberg. My job is to worry about revenue in the next fiscal quarter or holding onto employees in the next three quarters.\u201d Schendler: I think that's right. And in the book, I say, \u201cCan we even count on business to be a part of this?\u201d And where I come down is I don't think that we should throw out this very powerful potential tool. I do think things are changing. You mentioned employee retention. One of the best things our business has ever done to retain employees is environmental work. We get constant comments from new and returning employees. \u201cI work for you because of that work. I came here because of that work.\u201d  And the other piece is I really do think we're at a fulcrum point where business is starting to say, \u201cYou know what? Our supply chains are getting hammered by climate events. Our customers are getting hammered, our local economies, our employees, their insurance rates. This has actually become a business issue, and it's going to be cheaper to address it than not to.\u201d The Inflation Reduction Act did not harm business in the United States. In fact, many businesses fought for it because it created jobs. Warner: There's Ben and Jerry's, Patagonia that are starting to get more involved in climate politics, not just their own environmental footprint. Do you think that those effectively confront the fossil fuel industry? I mean, it seems like a serious mismatch, and you even describe it, I think in the book as \u201casymmetrical warfare.\u201d Schendler: I think you're going to need a lot more power to drive change, but one of my theories\u2013 and I emphasize that it's a theory\u2013 is that once you have a business lead, and get perceived as a legitimate leader on climate, and achieve that level of brand recognition, other businesses are going to say, \u201cHoly cow, why wouldn't we do that too?!\u201d It's something that more and more modern and younger customers care about and want. There is a business case for it. There isn't a giant financial downside because a lot of what I'm asking is public voice from corporations that doesn't cost anything. You might lose some customers, but you're probably, on balance, gaining more customers\u2013 if you trust the polling of Americans, most of whom care about this issue. Warner: Leave us with what \u201cTerrible Beauty\u201d is\u2013 the title of your book. Holding your daughter as she's going off to college, that's terrible beauty. It's beautiful. And it's terrible because she's leaving. The mortality of your partner or spouse or child is terrible beauty. And the fact that the world, which is so profoundly beautiful, even in its semi-damaged state, is threatened even more by climate change\u2026 that's terrible beauty.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"In case you missed it: Mark Zuckerberg recently announced that Meta is ditching its fact-checkers (check out the video here). As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he casually mentioned that Meta is teaming up with Trump to fight EU regulations affecting their platforms.     The video itself is so absurd it feels like it could\u2019ve been written by J. Michael Straczynski for Babylon 5 \u2014 President Clark and Nightwatch vibes all the way. But nope, it\u2019s not sci-fi. It\u2019s our horrifying reality. And then there\u2019s Musk. Oh boy. These days, he\u2019s practically glued to Trump. Recently, he hosted a live chat on Twitter with Alice Weidel, the co-leader of Germany\u2019s AfD, a party flagged by the \u201cVerfassungsschutz\u201d as a far-right extremist group. The content? Let\u2019s just say it made me want to yeet my phone into the nearest ocean. How anyone can take that level of garbage seriously is beyond me. But hey, bubbles are cozy, right? (EDIT: Just one example: Alice Weidel claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was not \"right-wing,\" but a communist instead.)     Musk, Zuckerberg, and Trump \u2014 what a trio. Honestly, this could be the perfect setup for a dystopian sci-fi thriller. Except, spoiler alert: no happy ending here. Social media platforms have turned lowering moral standards into an Olympic sport. And boy, are they winning. Sure, companies need to make money. That\u2019s fair. But when they use every psychological trick in the book to keep you doom-scrolling for hours, it\u2019s time to ask some questions.     Add to that the constant stream of scammy ads, and you start wondering: \u201cDo these people have even a shred of decency left?\u201d  As a dad of two daughters, I see firsthand what these platforms are doing to young people. They communicate almost entirely through social media, which makes parenting (and schooling) a special kind of nightmare. Not that adults are any better, mind you. Studies have shown that excessive social media use can lead to anxiety, stress, and more. But do platform owners care? Of course not (Yes, they might say otherwise, but the reality is that it\u2019s just PR). The earlier and deeper they integrate into our lives, the harder it becomes to pull away. So, I quit. Twitter, TikTok, Facebook \u2014 all gone (EDIT: LinkedIn as well). It wasn\u2019t an easy choice, especially since I used these platforms to promote my games. Losing 16,000 Twitter followers? Ouch. And I got a ton of good feedback by posting content to TikTok and Facebook. It wasn\u2019t all bad: I discovered cool stuff, met great people. But at some point, enough is enough. And then thoughts came to my mind: What happens if I need to reach out to someone I haven\u2019t spoken to in a decade? Or what if my next trailer could\u2019ve gone viral? Oh, and where the hell do I even post about this blog post now? It wasn\u2019t just an emotional hurdle. Platforms like Facebook make the process a Kafkaesque nightmare. Hours spent wrestling with broken verification codes and other roadblocks. Coincidence? Doubt it. Their motto seems to be: \u201cMake it hard enough, and maybe they\u2019ll just stay.\u201dAnd let\u2019s not forget all the other accounts you signed up for using Facebook or Twitter. You know, the ones you now need to rescue before you accidentally lock yourself out of important stuff. Once the accounts were finally gone, I realized just how much of a grip these platforms had on me. The number of times I reflexively typed \"t\" or \"f\" into my browser bar (which autocompletes to twitter.com or facebook.com) was honestly terrifying. Waiting for assets to build? Hit Twitter. Software update running? Quick Facebook check.     It\u2019s like opening a bag of chips you swore you\u2019d save for later, only to find it empty five minutes later. Except here, instead of chips, you\u2019re losing hours of productivity. I knew it was a problem before, but only now do I see just how bad it was. Social media isn\u2019t all bad. But when people like Zuckerberg decide to throw their moral compass overboard, it\u2019s time to take a hard look at what we\u2019re supporting. So, here\u2019s my suggestion: think about whether you really want to stick around on these platforms. And if you decide to quit, stock up on snacks and patience \u2014 you\u2019re gonna need both. Honestly? No idea. Some friends recommended Bluesky, but I\u2019m holding off for now.     Maybe I\u2019ll go old-school and write more blog posts. Like back in the early 2000s, when you actually had to think before sharing your thoughts with the world. Sounds quaint, doesn\u2019t it? \u00a9 Copyright 2024 by Asylum Square Interactive GmbH.

With Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20th drawing near, all eyes are on how investors will react this week, as it carries its own significance with key earnings reports and the much-anticipated inflation data release, which is expected to stay high. Moreover, the recent job data was better than anticipated, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may postpone its decision to cut interest rates. These reports will provide a foundation for the Trump 2.0 era, as the latest inflation and employment figures will give insights into the economic challenges and opportunities that his administration will encounter. With that context, let\u2019s dive into what this week has in store. This week, the pace picks up in the second half with a flurry of banking earnings reports. On Wednesday, banking heavyweights like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), BlackRock (BLK), Citigroup (C), and others are set to release their earnings before the opening bell. Thursday will follow with reports from M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), Morgan Stanley (MS), and other financial giants. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) will unveil their financial performance on the same day, offering key insights into health insurance and chip sectors. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data will be released. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Additionally, the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book, a detailed compilation of economic conditions from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. This report often offers valuable clues regarding the Fed\u2019s stance on inflation, employment trends, and broader economic growth. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, initial jobless claims data will be released, providing a glimpse into the health of the labor market. Additionally, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will also be published. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other growth stocks. The latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025. Sanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made. Speaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market's performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are \"thinking about yields.\" She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward. Sanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out. The market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let's take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Analyst Upside as of January 10, 2025: 46% Number of Hedge Fund Holders:\u00a0 107 Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) ranks eighth on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Its primary offerings include memory and storage products for computers, consumer electronics, artificial intelligence use cases, servers, and automobiles. Over the past few months, the company has made significant progress on the AI front. Earlier in October 2024, MU was added to NVIDIA\u2019s recommended vendor list for its new data center SSDs, and in November, the company introduced the world\u2019s fastest SSD, with efficiency ramped up to 67%. More recently, in the first week of January, the company introduced expansions to its memory and storage portfolio, emphasizing its commitment to innovation and improved performance. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is shifting its complete focus to meeting the demands of artificial intelligence and data center customers, making it a solid choice for investors in 2025 and beyond. Very recently on January 8, MU established a packaging facility in Singapore, an impressive feat in improving its standing in the industry. Overall MU ranks 8th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Most readers would already know that Orgabio Holdings Berhad's (KLSE:ORGABIO) stock increased by 4.3% over the past three months. However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Specifically, we decided to study Orgabio Holdings Berhad's  ROE in this article. ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.  Check out our latest analysis for Orgabio Holdings Berhad  The formula for return on equity is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Orgabio Holdings Berhad is: 9.0% = RM5.1m \u00f7 RM57m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every MYR1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn MYR0.09 in profit. Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. At first glance, Orgabio Holdings Berhad's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.2%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Having said that, Orgabio Holdings Berhad's five year net income decline rate was 31%. Bear in mind, the company does have a slightly low ROE. Therefore, the decline in earnings could also be the result of this. However, when we compared Orgabio Holdings Berhad's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 19% in the same period. This is quite worrisome. Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P\/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Orgabio Holdings Berhad is trading on a high P\/E or a low P\/E, relative to its industry. Orgabio Holdings Berhad doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating. In total, we're a bit ambivalent about Orgabio Holdings Berhad's performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Wrapping up, we would proceed with caution with this company and one way of doing that would be to look at the risk profile of the business.  Our risks dashboard would have the 2 risks we have identified for Orgabio Holdings Berhad. Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

However, when multiple insiders purchase stock, like in Southern Palladium Limited's (ASX:SPD) instance, it's good news for shareholders. Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.  View our latest analysis for Southern Palladium  Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Non-Executive Director Lindiwe Nkosi-Thomas for AU$114k worth of shares, at about AU$0.44 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$0.56. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive. Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 496.50k shares worth AU$259k. On the other hand they divested 173.00k shares, for AU$104k. Overall, Southern Palladium insiders were net buyers during the last year. They paid about AU$0.52 on average. It's great to see insiders putting their own cash into the company's stock, albeit at below the recent share price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! Southern Palladium is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of under-the-radar companies with insider buying. Over the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider buying at Southern Palladium. In total, insiders bought AU$145k worth of shares in that time. On the other hand, Independent Non-Executive Director Robert Thomson sold AU$104k worth of shares. It is nice to see that insiders have bought, but the quantum isn't large enough to get us excited. For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 15% of Southern Palladium shares, worth about AU$7.6m, according to our data. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. Whilst better than nothing, we're not overly impressed by these holdings. Insider purchases may have been minimal, in the last three months, but there was no selling at all. That said, the purchases were not large. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. While we have no worries about the insider transactions, we'd be more comfortable if they owned more Southern Palladium stock. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Southern Palladium (including 1 which is concerning). If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt. For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests. Have feedback on this article?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE:BHC) stands against the other best medical stocks under $20. The medical industry plays a crucial role in ensuring the health and safety of populations. Driven by advancements in medical technology and an aging population, the medical and healthcare industry is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.

According to Deloitte\u2019s 2024 Global Healthcare Sector Outlook, the use of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) is rising in the healthcare sector. Healthcare providers and technology companies are introducing various kinds of AI tools that can help improve clinical outcomes. These technological advancements can streamline various administrative tasks while also enhancing the quality of care provided to patients. In the US, healthcare costs and spending have been rising. As reported by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, healthcare spending in the United States reached $4.9 trillion in 2023, reflecting a 7.5% increase from 2022. In 2023, the healthcare sector accounted for 17.6% of the US economy in 2023, up from 17.4% in 2022. Rise in private health insurance and Medicare were the two main drivers of this growth. Donald Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services, a role that covers various aspects of public health, including medical research and food safety. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee key agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In an NPR interview in November, Kennedy said that Trump had tasked him with eliminating corruption in health agencies, restoring evidence-based practices, and addressing the chronic disease epidemic. It\u2019s not clear how Kennedy\u2019s nomination could impact the healthcare sector as his specific policies are not yet clear and he has yet to receive confirmation by the US Senate. Chris Schott, JPMorgan\u2019s healthcare analyst, pointed out in a note to clients that the industry is currently experiencing \u201ca period of max uncertainty\u201d until the position is filled. However, Schott noted that this situation also means that the large-cap stocks are currently trading at a 35% discount to the S&P 500, presenting a significant opportunity for growth. Jared Holz, Mizuho\u2019s healthcare expert, said in a note to clients that he acknowledges some of Kennedy\u2019s concerns, such as America\u2019s obesity epidemic and the risks associated with ultra-processed foods. Holz noted that this is a complicated topic but emphasized that there is substantial room for improvement in public health. However, Kennedy is known as an anti-vaxxer and this has concerned some Wall Street analysts about his possible effect on the vaccine industry. He has also expressed skepticism about GLP-1s, which he believes are not the solution to the obesity problem. Additionally, Kennedy has advocated for stricter regulations on ultra-processed foods, which are linked to rising obesity rates in the country.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":" The first hiring of the NFL's 2025 coaching cycle is in the books with the New England Patriots reaching a deal with Mike Vrabel. That leaves five teams looking for a new coach: Chicago Bears, Jacksonville Jaguars, Las Vegas Raiders, New Orleans Saints and New York Jets. The Patriots were able to get a jump on the market because Vrabel was unemployed. He refrained from taking a full-time coaching opportunity after the Tennessee Titans fired him last offseason. A lot of the top candidates for other teams, however, are still working for their respective organizations with the playoffs ongoing. Interviewing them multiple times and performing the necessary due diligence will take time. Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, Washington Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, former Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll and Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy are among the most notable names on the board. Here are the landing spots that make the most sense for those five coaches.  There are obvious drawbacks to coaching the Chicago Bears. Since reaching the Super Bowl in 2006, the franchise has made the playoffs just three times and that kind of futility eventually reflects poorly on the ownership structure. When multiple coaching and front office regimes have been unable to deliver consistent success, the problems start at the top. Every coach hired after Mike Ditka has basically been left trying to chase his legacy, too. Still, there's enough to make Chicago an attractive place for Johnson, who's arguably now the most in-demand coaching candidate with Vrabel off the board. Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams showed progress in the second half of the year. Across his final seven starts, he threw for 1,525 yards and 11 touchdowns to one interception. In addition, general manager Ryan Poles has some cash to burn to help improve a porous defense. Chicago's $66 million in salary cap space is projected to be the seventh-most in the league. You wouldn't blame Johnson for spurning any advances by the Bears, but the opportunity to coach Williams and mold him into a true franchise QB would be tantalizing.  The New Orleans Saints will present a stiff challenge for whoever takes the job. General manager Mickey Loomis has persisted with trying to maintain a playoff contender since Drew Brees' retirement despite seeing diminishing returns on the field. Kicking the can down the road has only complicated the organization's long-term payroll situation as well. But Glenn would be arriving in the Big Easy knowing he'd likely have a lot of time to turn things around and see through any rebuild. That's a luxury he'd enjoy by playing for the Saints in 2008 and then working on the staff from 2016-20. The 52-year-old has also received some notable endorsements. If nothing else, the proof of concept is there in New Orleans from when the team was such a consistent winner with Brees and Sean Payton.  ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported Kingsbury is likely to be \"selective\" this offseason when it comes to any coaching vacancies. He seemingly reinforced that idea when he said he'd like to be an NFL head coach again \"at some point,\" which didn't reflect a burning desire to jump back in right away. Kliff Kingsbury, when asked if he wants to be a head coach again: <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/JbRUUF4cUL\">pic.twitter.com\/JbRUUF4cUL<\/a> In the case of Kingsbury, staying with the Commanders might be the smartest move. Look at the jobs that could plausibly become open next year based on the coaches who figure to be under some pressure in 2025. It's probably playoffs-or-bust for the Cincinnati Bengals' Zac Taylor. A second straight year of missing the postseason could turn up the heat on the Miami Dolphins' Mike McDaniel. How many more times do the Pittsburgh Steelers need to come up short when it matters under Mike Tomlin? Houston Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik is a bit of a cautionary tale for when you decline to strike while the iron is hot. Slowik stayed with the Texans last offseason amid outside interest, and his stock has dipped a bit after Houston's offense went backward. But Kingsbury has the advantage of having already been an NFL head coach, and his profile will grow further if he can help rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels take another step forward.  It's entirely likely Carroll is done in the NFL. He'll be 74 once the 2025 season is underway, so any long-term upside to hiring him is almost nonexistent. Bill Belichick's inability to get hired\u2014and an almost total lack of interest around the league\u2014points to how past success and accolades only go so far. An aging coach might be an especially bad fit for the Las Vegas Raiders when they're all but guaranteed to have a new quarterback, one with little experience, leading the offense. But Carroll's personality would mesh well with the Raiders' longstanding identity as rebels of the NFL and help them stand out in Sin City. As many predicted when the franchise first announced its relocation to Las Vegas, it hasn't always enjoyed a strong home-field advantage with rival fans either living in the city already or traveling in for games. The Raiders are badly in need of a culture reset, and Carroll might provide that even if he's only a stopgap in coaching terms.  NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Friday the Cowboys and McCarthy were \"expected to open talks today on a new contract to keep him in Dallas.\" On Saturday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the two sides hadn't held any \"substantial discussions\" about an extension. McCarthy's contract expires in a matter of days, at which point he'll be free to follow through on any interest from suitors outside of Dallas. As long as they'll have him back, the Cowboys are the best job out there. For all of their roster needs and the meddling of team owner Jerry Jones, they're the closest to playoff contention. Jones is also nothing if not patient with his head coaches. A different owner might've kicked McCarthy to the curb already after Dallas fell short of its preseason expectations. The same was true for Jason Garrett, who got 10 years before he was removed. And for as much as the Cowboys' reputation far outpaces what they have achieved in the last 30 years, being the guy to end their Super Bowl drought would almost single-handedly confer legendary status.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":" by Ben Cook on  Neither WordPress nor Automattic would be where they are today without the tireless efforts of Matt Mullenweg. I have personally benefited from his work and for that I\u2019m truly thankful. That said, it\u2019s time for Matt to resign from either the WordPress Foundation or Automattic. The reason is fairly simple, there\u2019s a glaring conflict of interest. Automattic is the for profit company Matt co-founded which provides several WordPress related services such as premium WordPress hosting, Akismet and VaultPress, a security and backup service for WordPress blogs. The company has raised over $30 million from investors and, as co-founder, Matt is ultimately responsible to make sure Automattic earns a profit for  those investors. Simply put, Automattic, like every other business, has  to make money and it\u2019s Matts job to make that happen. The WordPress Foundation, on the other hand, is a non-profit organization intended to  \u201cfurther the mission of the WordPress\u201d and \u201cbe responsible for  protecting the WordPress \u2026 related  trademarks.\u201d As Matt has admitted on several occasions it is not intended to fix the  \u201cMatt runs everything\u201d issue. However, the fact that even Matt acknowledges there is such an issue  should invoke memories of the \u201cDanger, Will Robinson!\u201d robot. While it might seem like a minor thing, controlling the trademark of several WordPress related terms makes the foundation a very powerful entity. Imagine if a company offering WordPress related services were prevented from using the phrase WordPress! Automattic has enjoyed a long run as a monopoly in several service  areas, but challengers are springing up all over as the number of WordPress users  continues to grow. Companies like Page.ly, for example, are now competing with WordPress.com in the premium WordPress hosting market. The BackupBuddy plugin by PluginBuddy offers many of the same features Automattic\u2019s newest service, VaultPress offers. Matt owes it to Automattic\u2019s investors to ensure new competitors like Page.ly don\u2019t cut into their profit margins. On the other hand, Page.ly is perfectly GPL compliant and a valuable resource to the community the WordPress Foundation is supposed to serve. Should Matt protect his investors and prevent Page.ly from using the  WordPress trademark or should the WordPress Foundation help promote the  valuable service Page.ly provides to the community? I don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to have to make that decision. Jane Wells, an Automattic employee caused an uproar earlier this week by declaring all \u201cnon-GPL-compliant people\u201d ineligible to sponsor, organize, or speak at WordCamp events. Since WordCamp is one of the trademarks owned by the WordPress Foundation, they can pretty much set any rule they want about who can and can\u2019t participate. Keeping only Automattic\u2019s goals in mind, it would be foolish to allow a competitor to gain publicity by organizing, speaking at, or sponsoring a WordCamp event. By contrast, it would an enormous disservice to the community if Matt used the WordPress Foundation\u2019s trademarks to prevent Automattic competitors from participating. Unfortunately for Matt, there are countless more perfectly plausible situations where Automattic and the WordPress Foundation\u2019s interests would conflict. In government there are rules and regulations to prevent conflicts of interest like  this from arising. When people write the rules for the industries and companies they\u2019re  financially invested in, we tend to wind up paying $30,000 for a toilet seat. I should note that Matt seems to have tip-toed across this ethical tight-rope  successfully \u2013 so far. But, as the old saying goes, absolute power corrupts absolutely and no one is perfect. Eventually Matt will find himself faced with a decision that will hurt either the community or his company\u2019s bottom line. I have no idea  which side he\u2019ll come down on but I do know one thing\u2026 He shouldn\u2019t be put in that position in the first place. It\u2019s time for Matt to do the right thing and remove himself from this obvious and dangerous conflict of interest.   { 26 comments\u2026 read them below or add one } You are a genuine *******. Simple and short. The whole blog is filled with Stupidity. Came here from a twitter link and wasted my 5 minutes. That\u2019s it. Ahmad, Are you denying that the conflict of interest exists or are you just blindly following Automattic and assuming they\u2019d never do anything that strictly benefits them and not the community? I disagree. Remember what happened when Mambo was forked to Joomla. If Matt  goes power crazy and acts against the best interests of the WP community, the non-automattic core devs would be able to fork WordPress as it is GPL. Lets cross that bridge when & if it arises. I doubt it will and hope it doesn\u2019t. Michael, the majority of core team is made up of Automattic employees who face the same conflict of interest although on a lesser scale since Matt wields the most power. And just because (in your opinion) it hasn\u2019t happened yet, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an acceptable situation. WordPress shouldn\u2019t have to be forked. It simply shouldn\u2019t be controlled by those who have Automattic\u2019s best interest in mind. This is the part of the show that all the other non-Automattic contributors to WordPress get upset and argue that Automattic isn\u2019t WordPress.org. We can argue that another day but there\u2019s no doubt that Matt IS the WordPress Foundation.  The conflict between that role and his role at Automattic is both blindingly clear, and completely unacceptable. He needs to do the right thing here. There\u2019s not a valid point anywhere in this post; utter waste of time. Ken, which points exactly aren\u2019t valid in your opinion? You don\u2019t think Matt is responsible for Automattic making a profit? Or can you never forsee a situation in which that would conflict with the best interests of the WordPress community? I really don\u2019t think there is a conflict of interests. Matt has been the driving force behind WordPress from day 1 and is still the guy pushing it forward. Not only that, he is the one who is pushing for the gpl license to be standard. I honestly don\u2019t think there\u2019s a conflict of interests here. @Kevin, Matt being the driving force behind WordPress has nothing to do with the discussion. The point is, his duties to Automattic expose him to direct conflicts of interest while running the WordPress foundation. Automattic is a business and it IS out to make billions of dollars. That\u2019s the point of it. If a company or decision about WordPress threatens to cut into Automattic\u2019s bottom line, Matt\u2019s responsibility to the company would demand that he try to prevent that. That is why he shouldn\u2019t be in the position in the WordPress Foundation to dictate decisions and rules. It\u2019s tantamount to allowing BP to set the regulations on oil drilling. I have to agree with previous posters that this post is a bit pointless, of course it\u2019s possible for Matt to do as he wishes, but he\u2019s not exactly going to start charging to use WordPress and make billions. This article is a bit of a fearmonger\u2026 Congratulations on achieving your desired result \u2013 plenty of exposure. 3.0 looks like an amazing update that will be taking WordPress to another level.  Why would we want the leader of an organisation that is moving forward to resign?  We are lucky to have Matt. @Robert, if Matt doesn\u2019t want to resign from the WordPress Foundation, he could also remove himself from his position at Automattic. I\u2019m not picky. Whether 3.0 is a great update or not (I\u2019m VERY excited about it) doesn\u2019t change the fact that an obvious conflict of interest exists. That conflict is what needs to be removed. @Ben I think it does have something to do with it. Matt is still pushing wordpress forward, still trying to make it a better script. If there was a real conflict of interests then he could not do this. But, in my opinion there\u2019s no conflict of interest here. Suggesting that he needs to quite WordPress is just ludicrous. p.s. WordPress 3.0 beta is already out (has been for a month or so). You can download and try it out @Kevin, do my examples not seem plausible? You seem to be suggesting that Matt could not make any decision that would be bad for the community since he\u2019s still pushing and promoting WordPress. Is that what you\u2019re saying? In some regards Automattic and the WordPress Foundation\u2019s goals line up well. For example, both entities benefit from having more WordPress users. Better features and an improved product further that goal for both Automattic and the WPF. However, something like preventing an Automattic competitor from sponsoring a WordCamp or having a theme or plugin in the repository wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in fewer WordPress users or impact the core features (thus harming Automattic\u2019s interests). However, it would still be doing a disservice to the community. @Kevin, yeah I\u2019ve downloaded it & played with it a bit. Will wait for official release before developing w\/ it though. >You seem to be suggesting that Matt could not make any decision that would be bad for the community It amazes me but it seems commonly accepted that it\u2019s not Matt is [not] in line with community, but actual inclusion in community is defined as fitting into Matt\u2019s views. Instead of accepting the fact that WordPress community is neither clearly defined or homogeneous it is being virtually split into \u201cgood community\u201d in line with Automattic and \u201charmful (in Matt\u2019s own word) community\u201d whose interests are evil and unworthy. Such split is clear sign that conflict of interests is not only possible but clearly happening for some time already. @Ben WordCamps already do get sponsored from a range of companies, so how can you say Automattic would stop it. Check out any wordcamp site to see this (e.g. http:\/\/wordcampfayetteville.com\/sponsors\/). The way I see it, Automattic owns and operates WordPress.com however they do contribute heavily to WordPress.org too. You need to remember WordPress.org is open source. @Kevin, I didn\u2019t say Automattic WOULD I said Matt COULD if he chose to do so. And yes, WordPress.org is open source, but as I mention in the article, this is about the WordPress Foundation which is run by Matt. I\u2019m sure there are valid arguments why Matt SHOULD wear both hats, I just haven\u2019t heard them expressed. Sorry but I don\u2019t find \u201cYou are a genuine *******\u201d, \u201cutter waste of time\u201d or  \u201cfearmonger\u201d to be very compelling arguments. @Ben haha what\u2019s the point in wondering about a \u2018hypothetical situation\u2019 like that. I could understand the question if WordCamp were only sponsored by Automattic but they are not. From the start they have been sponsored by many companies and there is nothing to suggest this is not going to continue. Yes Matt could choose to prevent other companies from sponsoring WordCamps. He could also choose to completely sack all of his employees,  sell Automattic to Google or quit the business and travel the world.  My point is, you can\u2019t say that he must resign because of hypothetical ifs and buts. I really don\u2019t think there is any conflict of interest however if there was, I don\u2019t think Matt has done anything in the past to suggest that him or his company would take advantage of it.  Take a look at http:\/\/wordpressfoundation.org\/. It clearly states that it is a charitable project. They also clearly state that they want all projects to be GPL, which isn\u2019t very commercial in my opinion. Is it? I\u2019m sorry. I really believe you are out of touch with this. Automattic have done wonders for the open source community. To sugest Matt needs to resign because Automattic want to expand and sell a few commercial products is absurd. @DWCourse A valid argument for why he should wear both hats? 1) He\u2019s good at what he does 2) It\u2019s his company, his decision. @Kevin Muldoon +1   @Ben Cook \u201cHowever, something like preventing an Automattic competitor from sponsoring a WordCamp or having a theme or plugin in the repository wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in fewer WordPress users or impact the core features (thus harming Automattic\u2019s interests). However, it would still be doing a disservice to the community.\u201d Really? Hasn\u2019t happened to date, and will not happen anytime soon. The only potential for being blackballed from a WordCamp is being non-compliant with GPL (Thesis supporters), and still unlikely. Worst case scenerio for a WordCamp organizer, is they don\u2019t get support from Automattic to run the event because they knowingly allow this to happen.  I would leave the hypothetical\u2019s on the shelf for now and speak to the facts. If the day comes that a true conflict of interest arises, and Matt goes bananas, re-release an edited version of your post, I\u2019ll retweet it. Admit it, your jealous and slightly clueless as to how business works. If you want to play sherrif, go start your own biz, become a charity and dartboard! See how you go. @Dre even if nothing has happened yet, it will at some point. The what ifs I put forward are perfectly reasonable scenarios that could easily happen.  Blindly sticking our heads in the sand and denying that anything could ever go wrong is idiotic and foolish. The potential to get blackballed from a WordCamp is infinite since the WordPress foundation can set any rules they want. So far they\u2019ve only gone after \u201cnon-GPL compliant people\u201d which I addressed in my post yesterday. However, if a serious competitor threatened Automattic\u2019s revenue streams, Matt wouldn\u2019t be doing his job for Automattic if he didn\u2019t consider any and all options to help combat that. It boils down to the fact that man cannot serve two masters. Either he\u2019s compromising the needs of one to serve the other, or he\u2019s not doing the most he can to serve either. @Ben next time try to even come close to addressing the topic at hand. It will help you avoid making an ass of yourself. Ben, When did I debate the scenarios you posed are unreasonable? I merely pointed out that your WordCamp what if is unlikely and you should stick to the facts.  We\u2019re not all foolish birds. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I think people are also aware that meteors can hit Earth and destroy our civilization as we know it. That doesn\u2019t mean we go around wearing tin foil hats in hopes that we\u2019ll be salvaged IF it happens (at least most of us don\u2019t.) Quit being so negative. Potential? Please reread my last paragraph. I will add one point \u2013 the percentage of risk can never be zero, and although things may be possible, they aren\u2019t always probable. Business will be is business, and I\u2019ve seen the kindest of intentions turn evil over night. We can imagine and speculate whatever we want, but at the end of the day Matt has done a great job making Automattic profitable, while simultaneously fostering  game changing growth for what\u2019s arguably the best publishing platform in existence.  I see no reason to look at things as if the glass were half empty. I hope you have a great weekend. Cheers, Fresh out of Aluminum You must have made something right if this caused so many \u201cangry\u201d reactions.  I can only assume that some people have a problem seeing  \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d strictly on topic and to openly talk about where conflict of interests can be or turn out. Every bit of serious information and discussion on this topic is worth to be made and provided. There are black and grey areas of larger size and when shed some light into you might see a shadow that looks like a cowering Matt. Will Matt take over WordPress? I do not know. Will WordPress take over him? Probably.

Share This LAist relies on reader donations to power our nonprofit newsroom's coverage of wildfire and breaking news. Support LAist by giving now. Rental housing prices in L.A. are spiking as historic fires burn in Southern California, forcing thousands of residents who\u2019ve lost homes to scramble to find a new place to live. LAist spotted one Zillow listing for a furnished home in Bel Air that was posted Saturday morning at $29,500 per month. That\u2019s a nearly 86% price hike from September 2024 according to the listing\u2019s price history, which shows the home previously listed for $15,900 per month. When an LAist reporter called the listing agent, Fiora Aston with Compass, she said dozens of prospective tenants who\u2019ve lost homes to the fires have been contacting her about this and other listings on L.A.\u2019s Westside. When LAist asked why the advertised rent for the Bel Air home had risen so sharply, she said she was getting another call and hung up. \u201cIt's crazy,\u201d Aston said, before ending the call. \u201cI've been in the business for 35 years. I've never seen anything like this. People are desperate. There\u2019s so many families without a house.\u201d LAist reached out to Compass\u2019 media relations team about the listing in Bel Air, but did not immediately receive a response. By Saturday afternoon, the listing had been removed. Aston texted later that afternoon that a family member had moved in. LAist asked to interview the family member and property owner, but Aston declined. Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency in connection with the Palisades Fire, which has already destroyed an estimated 5,000 structures in upscale neighborhoods near L.A.\u2019s coastline. The governor\u2019s emergency declaration includes a ban on price gouging, which is defined as any price increase of more than 10% compared to pre-disaster prices. California Attorney General Rob Bonta told LAist partner KCAL News earlier this week that the ban on price gouging applies to housing as well as other essential goods like food, transportation and medical supplies. Bonta said residents should report suspected price gouging through his office\u2019s website. \u201cIf prices look really out of whack \u2014 if they look like they've increased from what you're used to \u2014 report it to us,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cWe'll take it from there. We'll evaluate it. We'll hold folks accountable and enforce if necessary.\u201d  Journalists for other outlets have reported on listings where asking rents have jumped in the wake of the fires. The New York Times reviewed Zillow listings on L.A.\u2019s Westside and found asking rents rising between 15% and 64% since Tuesday. One agent reportedly lowered the asking rent on a property in Encino from $11,500 per month to $9,800 after a journalist with the Los Angeles Times asked why the asking rent had risen nearly 28% in recent days. UCLA urban planning and public policy professor Michael Lens said he expects L.A. rents \u2014 already considered unaffordable for many families \u2014 to be driven up by the immediate influx of people all looking for scarce housing at the same time. \u201cIt will put a squeeze, especially on the adjacent communities,\u201d Lens said. \u201cThat might be particularly acute from the Palisades effect on the Westside.\u201d  Located on Casiano Road in Bel Air, the four-bedroom home that was listed on Zillow at $29,500 was described online as a \u201cfully furnished, meticulously restored Mid-Century Modern home.\u201d That listing described the home as \u201cperched in a serene canyon setting\u201d with \u201cbreathtaking views of the surrounding landscape, including the iconic Getty Museum.\u201d The home is currently located in an evacuation warning zone due to the ongoing spread of the Palisades Fire. Aston told LAist the home was not being shown in person due to those warnings. \u201cWe decided we're not going to be doing any showing until next week,\u201d Aston said. She said the owner had taken it off the market a few months ago, but later decided to list it again. \u201cWhen this whole situation happened, I told her\u2026 people are desperate, and you can probably get good money,\u201d Aston said. \u201cShe has a second home, so she moved into her second home, and this house is for lease.\u201d After Aston disconnected the call, LAist texted her to ask if she was familiar with California\u2019s disaster-related price gouging law. She texted back, \u201cSorry can not talk right now,\u201d then mentioned another listing in Mar Vista where she said one person offered $10,000 above the $15,000 asking rent. She ended her text, saying, \u201cSupply & demand.\u201d _  If you have to evacuate If you have more time: Things to consider: Navigating fire conditions How to help yourself and others Understanding how it got this bad LAist is part of Southern California Public Radio, a member-supported public media network.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China. It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries. This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.  \"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.  Most said they only have one day off a month. The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.  We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws. These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory. But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.  Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange. Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.  Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China. The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance. It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\" Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.  Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers. The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections. As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun. But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor. \"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\" She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards. They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it. This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil. The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option. \"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents. \"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\" Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour. The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs. Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.  This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.  They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month. \"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\" The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons. While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.  And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms. In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote. Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative. The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.  They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street. \"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her. Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year. The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange. \"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\" One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.  Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied. The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.  \"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\" A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\" Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly. That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast. For workers in Guangzhou, this can be a challenge. \"Shein has its pros and cons,\" one factory owner told us. \"The good thing is the order is eventually big, but profit is low and it's fixed.\" Shein, given its size and influence, is a hard bargainer. So factory owners have to cut costs elsewhere, often resulting in lower staff wages. \"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\" When orders peak, however, it's a bonanza. The company ships around one million packages a day on average, according to data from ShipMatrix, a logistics consultancy firm. \"Shein is a pillar of the fashion industry,\" said Guo Qing E, a Shein supplier.  \"I started when Shein started. I witnessed its rise. To be honest, Shein is an awesome company in China. I think it will become stronger, because it pays on time. This is where it is most trustworthy. \"If payment for our goods is due on the 15th, no matter whether it's millions or tens of millions, the money will be paid on time.\" Shein, with its gruelling hours and sometimes lower wages, may not be a source of comfort to all its workers. But it is a source of pride for some. \"This is the contribution we Chinese people can make to the world,\" said a 33- year-old supervisor from Guangdong, who didn't want to give her name. It's dark outside and workers are filing back into factories after their dinner for the final stretch. She admits the hours are long, but \"we get on well with each other. We are like a family\". Hours later, after many workers head home for the night, the lights in several buildings stay on.  Some people work until midnight, one factory owner told us. They want to earn more money, he said. After all, in London, Chicago, Singapore, Dubai and so many other places, someone is hunting for their next bargain. A trade body calls the rise in alcohol tax a \"bitter blow\", but there is better news for pub-goers. The biggest names in fashion unveil their new collections, with a host of celebrities on hand. A survey in Hartlepool finds theft related abuse is a \"significant issue\" for retail staff. A spokesperson said changing shopping habits and rising costs had made the store \"unviable\". Shoplifters are carrying out brazen acts of theft because they 'do not fear any consequences'. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Fabrinet (NYSE:FN), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$271 and falling to the lows of US$215. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Fabrinet's current trading price of US$228 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Fabrinet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.  View our latest analysis for Fabrinet  The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 9.9% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Fabrinet today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $253.39, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Fabrinet\u2019s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 34% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Fabrinet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in FN\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on FN, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":" Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time PHILADELPHIA \u2014 In a move that will likely stun many, the plan to bring\u00a0a $1.3 billion arena to Market Street in Center City Philadelphia\u00a0has been abandoned. On Sunday, around noon, a union representative and city official confirmed with NBC10 that the team has worked out a new deal with Comcast Spectacor and has backpedaled on a plan that would have brought an arena to the area of the intersection of Market and Filbert streets at 10th and 11th streets. Ryan Boyer, president of the Philadelphia Building & Construction Trades Council, told\u00a0NBC10\u2019s Lauren Mayk\u00a0that instead, the team plans to demolish Wells Fargo Center and will eventually build a new arena in South Philadelphia for the team. \u201cWe actually get more jobs,\u201d Boyer said. \u201cFor the building trades, this is good news.\u201d However, Philadelphia City Councilmember at-large, Jim Harrity, said he was disappointed in the surprise move. In fact, he said, he felt \u201cbamboozled.\u201d \u201cI feel completely bamboozled,\u201d Harrity said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to forget this. ... I feel they not only bamboozled me but bamboozled the citizens of Philadelphia and I\u2019m not going to forget that.\u201d Harrity said he is upset that the city\u2019s schools won\u2019t get the promised money from taxes the new arena would bring. The plan had been approved by Philadelphia\u2019s City Council late last year. The plan had long been a contentious one, with many residents in communities closest to the project site protesting against it since it was initially proposed. In the late months of last year, in the run up to a City Council vote on the project, city officials \u2014 including Mayor Cherelle Parker \u2014 met with members of the community all across the city to determine the future of the project. Before City Council eventually approved the plan on Dec. 19, a main issue with the project was just how much funding would be included in community benefits agreement. Initially, developers proposed a $50 million agreement, but residents closest to the project called for more \u2014 as much as $300 million. Eventually, City Council approved the plan with a $60 million community benefits agreement. Developers had planned to begin development this year and open the arena in 2031. The specifics of the deal that lead to the decision to stay in South Philadelphia have not yet been provided by officials. But, according to a source with information on the situation, the Sixers and Flyers are expected to partner on a new arena in South Philadelphia with Comcast Spectacor. The Sixers and Comcast Spectacor will also work on a revitalization project for the Market East neighborhood in Center City Philadelphia, according to the source. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, which is the parent company of NBC News.) A press conference on the decision is expected to be held on Monday morning. Contacted on Sunday, officials with the Sixers, Comcast and the City of Philadelphia did not immediately return requests for comment. Hayden Mitman is a reporter for NBC Philadelphia.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. \u201cStocks don\u2019t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that\u2019s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it\u2019s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.\u201d If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it\u2019s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea \u201cbogus\u201d and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. \u201cThe simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they\u2019re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that\u2019s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,\u201d Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here). Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60 Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). Here is what he said: \u201cDell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) did not have a good quarter. It really was a disappointing quarter. I agree with people, even though I think the world of Michael Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). However, I think Dell\u2019s second half will be much better. I do not think much of its first half. If you have the patience to own the stock here, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of downside, and I think there\u2019s a lot of upside. However, we own other stocks in the portfolio that I think are better, even at this price. Do you know that I actually like Nvidia at 134 more than I like Dell? Just saying.\u201d In the most recently reported quarter, Dell\u2019s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)\u2019s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)\u2019s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter: \u201cDell Technologies Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company\u2019s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.\u201d Overall, DELL ranks 7th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":" The NFL offseason is once again setting up to be one of the busiest in recent memory, with a plethora of headline-making free agents who will not only set the bar for others at the position but also potentially force their incumbent teams to spend via the franchise tag. Two such players are Sam Darnold of Minnesota and Tee Higgins in Cincinnati. Both were essential to their teams in 2024 and, on paper, should be the first players either of those franchises talk to. Will they get tagged and continue with their current squads or will they move on, taking their talents to the highest bidder? And where do other, veteran competitors continue their careers amid expiring contracts? Find out with these early predictions for NFL free agency.  There is no way the Minnesota Vikings let Sam Darnold walk this offseason. The former No. 3 overall pick had an extraordinary season for the NFC North runners-up, compiling 4,319 yards, 35 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions while leading his team to a 14-win season that would have guaranteed a division title in any other year. With renewed confidence and a system under head coach Kevin O'Connell that suits his strengths, Darnold reminded everyone why he was considered such a hot prospect coming out of USC. While the Vikings did select Michigan's JJ McCarthy 10th overall in last spring's NFL Draft, there is plenty of opportunity for the former Wolverine to learn behind Darnold so that when his time comes to be the unquestioned starter, he can step in and be more prepared than he may have been otherwise. Or the team can explore a trade with a quarterback-hungry club. Whatever the case, expect the Vikings to exercise the franchise tag that OverTheCap.com estimates could land Darnold just over $41 million in 2025, which is far from a bad number for the organization if he can repeat his level of play from 2024. Prediction: Vikings tag Darnold  Joe Burrow sent a message to the Bengals front office with regards to wide receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, telling reporters after a Week 18 win over Pittsburgh, \"That's why you gotta do everything you can to get those deals done early.\" \"That's why you gotta do everything you can to get those deals done early.\" - Joe Burrow with another message to the Bengals' front office. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/ZwJ60jSDRz\">https:\/\/t.co\/ZwJ60jSDRz<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/W0hnj9DiL3\">pic.twitter.com\/W0hnj9DiL3<\/a> Higgins played 2024 on a franchise tag after the team failed to ink the dynamic wideout last offseason. Now, he is a free agent and Burrow has made it abundantly clear he wants to see him return to the team. After a season that saw him play in just 12 games due to injury while still amassing 73 catches for 911 yards and 10 touchdowns, it is not surprising to see why. The Bengals can, and likely will, tag Higgins for a second year, a move that will cost the team approximately $26 million. The question is whether the team can get a deal done before it has to apply the tag, potentially structuring it in a way that saves it some money in 2025 and allows the team to add necessary pieces to build on the momentum it had at the end of this season. Regardless of how it plays out, both because he makes the team's offense better and Burrow has been vocal about wanting to keep him with the team, Higgins feels like someone destined to wear the orange and black against next season.  Russell Wilson is an interesting case in that he played well enough to get another look from Pittsburgh in 2025 but not great enough to make anyone who supports the black and yellow believe he is the guy to get them over the hump and back to the Super Bowl. The veteran QB hurled 16 TDs and five interceptions for the team this season, hardly numbers that are going to generate excitement. He played well enough to guide the team to the playoffs but could not be the catalyst in reversing a four-game skid to end the regular season, nor in winning the team's first playoff game since 2016. The team can apply a transition tag to Wilson, which gives it the right to match any offer that comes his way. It is cheaper than applying a traditional franchise tag and allows the Steelers to explore other quarterback options. Especially with Justin Fields also hitting free agency this year. With no other obvious suitor for Wilson, the former Seattle Seahawk and Denver Bronco may be best off staying with Pittsburgh as the team at least has the look and feel of a playoff contender again next season. Prediction: Wilson stays in Pittsburgh on a transition tag  Chris Godwin is a beloved member of the Buccaneers locker room and one of the team's most popular players among fans, but he will hit free agency this offseason and could be one of the most coveted wide receivers available as long as his injured ankle heals. Godwin was in the middle of one of his best seasons to date, a potential Pro Bowl season that saw him catch 50 balls for 576 yards and five touchdowns before he suffered a devastating dislocated ankle on a Monday night against Baltimore. Tampa Bay has the money to pay Godwin ($22.6 million market value according to Spotrac) but one has to wonder if big contracts for Tristan Wirfs, Baker Mayfield, Antoine Winfield Jr., and Vita Vea have the team in a situation where they opt to let Godwin walk in hopes of freeing up space to address other needs. That could very well be the case and if so, Godwin will have no shortage of teams looking to add his talent. The Los Angeles Chargers, Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens, Pittsburgh Steelers, Buffalo Bills, and Green Bay Packers are just the playoff teams that could utilize a receiver of his caliber. Godwin doesn't drop the ball (just 22 since 2018) and was well on his way to his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season. Imagine what the Bills, a Super Bowl-contending team without him, could do with a stud receiver like the veteran wideout. Prediction: Godwin continues his career with a contender, but not in Tampa Bay","label":0}

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"TL;DR: If you're planning to pick up one of Intel's new non-overclockable (non-K series) Core Ultra 200-series desktop processors, you'll be getting a revamped stock CPU cooler included in the package. To complement the launch of its Core Ultra 200 chips, Intel has introduced updated versions of its Laminar cooler lineup.  While stock coolers tend to be fairly basic and underpowered affairs, Intel claims these new models offer some legitimate performance uplifts and aesthetic improvements over their predecessors. Leading the pack is the Laminar RH2, which comes bundled with Intel's Core Ultra 9 285. This cooler features an aluminum heatsink coupled with a copper base plate for improved heat transfer. Intel says it's rated for up to 65W TDP chips and touts \"near-silent\" operation at just 2.2 bels of sound power output. In addition to the performance promises, the RH2 gets some fresh style with integrated ARGB lighting in the form of an illuminated ring around the top. Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) Cooler Laminar RH2 \/ Laminar RM2 pic.twitter.com\/N3EJc8UVWR For users opting for one of the more affordable Core Ultra 5 models \u2013 such as the 225, 235, or 265 \u2013 you'll find the Laminar RM2 inside the box. This downsized variant foregoes the ARGB lighting and has a slightly louder noise rating of 3.6 bels. However, it retains the important copper base plate upgrade over its predecessor, the RM1. In terms of real-world performance, Intel's figures indicate that the RH2 operates at a reasonably quiet 23 decibels under load, while the RM2 produces slightly more noise at 30 decibels.  It's worth reiterating that these coolers are designed solely with stock, non-overclocked performance in mind. If you're looking to push your new Ultra chip to its limits with some heavy manual tuning, you'll need to spring for a bigger third-party air or liquid cooler. However, for the majority of users running their systems at standard clock speeds and power limits, the Laminar RH2 and RM2 offer a welcome upgrade over Intel's previous stock cooling solutions. The addition of a copper contact plate improves heat dissipation efficiency, and when paired with the updated designs, these coolers may provide a slightly cooler and quieter desktop experience right out of the box.

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Andersons, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANDE) stands against other best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Potash is a group of minerals and chemicals that contain potassium, a vital nutrient for plants and animals. The term refers to compounds including potassium sulfate, potassium-magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium carbonate, potassium oxide, and potassium chloride. Among these, potassium chloride (KCl), also known as muriate of potash (MOP), is the most commonly produced and used form of potash. Potash is primarily used to produce fertilizers, which are essential for plant growth and development. Fertilizers containing potash help to support plant growth, increase crop yield, and enhance disease resistance. Additionally, potash helps to improve water preservation, making it an indispensable supplement to the natural nutrient content of soils. Soils often lack these essential nutrients, or growing crops have depleted them, making potash a necessary addition to maintain soil fertility. With approximately 95% of potash being used in fertilizers, its role in agriculture cannot be emphasized enough. The remaining 5% is used in the production of potassium-bearing chemicals, such as detergents, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, water conditioners, and alternatives to de-icing salt.

Potash is mined from underground deposits, either through conventional underground ore mining or by injecting water into the underground ore body and extracting the resulting brine.\u00a0 According to a report by the Canadian Government, potash production was estimated at 67.5 million tonnes globally in 2023, with Canada contributing 32.4% of the global supply. Canada, Russia, and Belarus dominate global potash production and accounted for 65.9% of the total in 2023. Canada is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of potash, with 11 active mines in Saskatchewan, producing 21.9 million tonnes and exporting 22.8 million tonnes in 2023, which accounts for over 41% of global exports. Potash prices have fluctuated over the years, declining from 2013 to 2016 and remaining relatively low until 2020. However, in 2021, prices rose sharply due to strong demand, and the surge continued into 2022, peaking at $1,202 per tonne in April, driven by geopolitical tensions and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By June 2023, prices had fallen to $328 per tonne as global supply concerns subsided. Potash is a vital nutrient for plants and animals, and its importance in fertilizers cannot be overstated. As the world\u2019s population continues to grow, the demand for potash is likely to increase. A farmer driving a tractor over his field with a picturesque backdrop of the setting sun.

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE:IPI) stands against other best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Potash is a group of minerals and chemicals that contain potassium, a vital nutrient for plants and animals. The term refers to compounds including potassium sulfate, potassium-magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium carbonate, potassium oxide, and potassium chloride. Among these, potassium chloride (KCl), also known as muriate of potash (MOP), is the most commonly produced and used form of potash. Potash is primarily used to produce fertilizers, which are essential for plant growth and development. Fertilizers containing potash help to support plant growth, increase crop yield, and enhance disease resistance. Additionally, potash helps to improve water preservation, making it an indispensable supplement to the natural nutrient content of soils. Soils often lack these essential nutrients, or growing crops have depleted them, making potash a necessary addition to maintain soil fertility. With approximately 95% of potash being used in fertilizers, its role in agriculture cannot be emphasized enough. The remaining 5% is used in the production of potassium-bearing chemicals, such as detergents, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, water conditioners, and alternatives to de-icing salt.

Potash is mined from underground deposits, either through conventional underground ore mining or by injecting water into the underground ore body and extracting the resulting brine.\u00a0 According to a report by the Canadian Government, potash production was estimated at 67.5 million tonnes globally in 2023, with Canada contributing 32.4% of the global supply. Canada, Russia, and Belarus dominate global potash production and accounted for 65.9% of the total in 2023. Canada is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of potash, with 11 active mines in Saskatchewan, producing 21.9 million tonnes and exporting 22.8 million tonnes in 2023, which accounts for over 41% of global exports. Potash prices have fluctuated over the years, declining from 2013 to 2016 and remaining relatively low until 2020. However, in 2021, prices rose sharply due to strong demand, and the surge continued into 2022, peaking at $1,202 per tonne in April, driven by geopolitical tensions and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By June 2023, prices had fallen to $328 per tonne as global supply concerns subsided. Potash is a vital nutrient for plants and animals, and its importance in fertilizers cannot be overstated.

{"date":"2025-01-12","content":"Mark Zuckerberg is in the middle of a coordinated-if-haphazard heel turn, removing tampons from mens\u2019 rooms and welcoming slurs back to his platforms. This occurs while the neighborhood next to mine is still on fire, and his behavior stands in stark contrast to the imperative to love one another or die that is all around me. I connected with this take: [I]t is probably worth thinking about what is happening in Silicon Valley as a revolt of the bosses against their workers. none of this is rational. it is simply causing misery for the purpose of causing it.  @theophite.bsky.social  First of all, fuck anyone who is for what Zuck is up to, and may god give you blood to drink. I find the hateful nihilism in all of this quite depressing. But I guess I am not shocked to see it revealed that many industry leaders have invested in progressive causes transactionally, rather than out of solidarity, basic decency, and an ideological commitment to a brighter future in which the humanity of others is an end rather than a means to an end. That it is right to affirm the humanity of others should be the only reason one needs to do it. But we have just established that many powerful people are transactional, and not moved by morality. In the interest of working towards better outcomes, let me take on some of the labor of expanding upon why the boss revolt is not rational. Winning, fun, and positivity are correlated, and spiteful misery as a business strategy is very stupid. As the tech labor market has cooled off, skepticism about perks and positive vibes at work is a broad trend. Zuck\u2019s latest rollout is definitely on the more bigoted and mean-spirited end of it, but this has been going on for some time now. Let\u2019s play \u201cspot the logical error:\u201d Look, I have responded to production incidents whilst a founder played Guitar Hero (not even the good songs) on a projector directed two feet above my head. At times I have had to share an office with sales bells, round-the-clock ping pong tournaments, mechanical keyboards, kegerators, and a nontrivial fortune in DJ equipment. I have watched anti-footwear coworkers put bare feet on communal tables. One time a guy passed out in a boat that we had in the office for obscure reasons. While many of these things have a time and a place, let\u2019s say that it has not left me as a workplace hedonism maximalist. I am here to tell you that these sorts of workplace culture programs, which are all good and fun, are not that: These were all practices that got started in the middle 2000s, when startup funding was hard to come by and we needed to stretch our headcount as far as we possibly could. All of these have what might have been called \u201culterior motives,\u201d however that would be ahistorical since the motives were made explicit at the time. Hack weeks and bootcamps create new edges in your relationship graph, and spread knowledge. Slack time provides the fertile soil for those edges and that knowledge to bear fruit: serendipitous product, organizational efficiency, or what have you. All of this makes people want to keep working hard. Not for you, really, but for each other. To the extent we can still stomach identifying as \u201chackers\u201d in its original sense, we should seek clever, synergistic, joyful, high-leverage, and possibly subversive ways to get the outcomes we want. That\u2019s what all of this was about. Again, I view DE&I [2] as a moral imperative. But it can also be understood within the framework of this school of thought. We can find genius where society has overlooked it. And we should take seriously the project of creating the incentive and permission structures that allow these talented people we\u2019ve convinced to work here to contribute to their greatest potential. I wish I didn\u2019t feel so insane and frustrated while pointing this out. \u201cWinning is fun\u201d is a mantra I have deployed in the past, and I have meant it in the spirit of \u201cthe main thing that\u2019s gonna make people happy is if the product is making users happy.\u201d As is the way with these things, magical thinking can certainly take hold and we can get cause and effect mixed up. Fun is not a precondition for winning. But if you hope to win, you should expect to be having fun. This is all to say that if you are systematically eradicating fun things, using \u201canything that feels positive must be wasting time\u201d as a heuristic, you have thoroughly disappeared up your own ass. If you are committing willful acts of harm as Zuckerberg is, may an even darker abyss than that await you. Meta\u2019s size makes it de facto unkillable, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll exist in some form for centuries. But it\u2019s my hope that it will exist in the sense that IBM exists today. Theoretically you know it\u2019s out there, but it\u2019s very hard to grasp the point of it and it feels thoroughly irrelevant. Nobody remembers who started it or why. A healthy, happy, positive, spiritually fulfilled workforce is an end unto itself but yes, also a means to an end. Eventually, either our industry or an adjacent one will figure this out again [3] and the ironic points of light that constitute the historical tech workforce will go congregate there instead. Like this? I have a recent related talk called Egoless Engineering.          Google\u2019s 20% time in popular imagination is conflated with the idea that engineers will ship products on their own. That is typically a bad idea, because successful product launches take a village. I have no idea if that is really what that was about at Google, but unscheduled slack time in my experience has explicitly made that kind of outcome a non-goal. \u21a5         Noting that I am saying \u201cDE&I\u201d here and not \u201cDE&I programs\u201d is the moral imperative. I\u2019d like to defer to the experience of under-represented people in tech, many of whom have experienced the actually-existing programs as a sham. \u21a5         Barring positive black swan events that might come from organizing, or negative black swan events such as the return of indentured servitude. \u21a5 ","label":0}

We recently published an article titled These 10 Firms Led This Week's Rally.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Inari Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies finished stronger this week, outpacing the broader market thanks to a series of catalysts that lifted investor sentiment. On Friday, the Dow Jones recorded its largest weekly drop, falling 1.07%, while the S&P's main index and Nasdaq declined by 0.71% and 0.62%, respectively. Despite a lackluster performance from Wall Street\u2019s major indices, 10 companies demonstrated notable resilience. In this article, we will look at their past week's performance and the reasons that fueled their rally. To come up with this week's top gainers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A close-up view of a technician wearing protective gloves while installing a mechanical thrombectomy system. Despite dipping by a marginal 0.01 percent on Friday from Wednesday\u2019s trading, shares of Inari Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) soared by nearly 52 percent week-on-week to end at $79.29 apiece. Investor sentiment was buoyed by an announcement of a definitive agreement from Stryker involving the latter's acquisition of Inari Medical for approximately $4.9 billion. Inari Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:NARI) is expected to enhance Stryker\u2019s portfolio by expanding its treatment options for venous thromboembolism (VTE), a condition characterized by blood-vein clotting, and other venous diseases through clot removal without the use of thrombolytic drugs.
