{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Hedge fund Elliott Management recently sent a letter to investors warning them away from crypto. It urged clients to remember that crypto is a speculative market, suggested that the White House has caused a massive bubble to form, and predicted that a huge crash is coming. The Financial Times saw the letter Elliott sent to investors and detailed its dire warnings. The letter told investors it \u00e2\u0080\u009chas never seen a market like this\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said that people were \u00e2\u0080\u009cacting like a crowd of sports bettors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When it comes to the surge in reckless speculation across the markets, Elliot says \u201ccrypto is ground zero.\u201d Crypto prices have boomed since Trump took office. Bitcoin and just about everything else are going up. People are minting memecoins left and right, doing rug pulls, and absconding with millions of dollars. People are losing a lot of money, but other people are making a ton of money too. And one of the big winners is President Trump. He is America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrypto president\u00e2\u0080\u009d and has made billions of dollars on paper by minting a memecoin named after him days before his inauguration. It was a way for people to give Trump money without federal oversight and also, now, a way for people to buy shitty Trump-branded merchandise. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made Trump and several other early investors very wealthy. Latecomers will have a harder time seeing returns on their investment. Trump has also teased making a federal Bitcoin reserve. In the letter, Elliott criticized the president for his moves around crypto and said that any U.S. President devaluing the dollar as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reserve currency was \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofoundly dangerous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d People have been predicting the collapse of cryptocurrency for a long time and the speculative bubble often deflates but it never quite bursts. In 2022 it seemed like crypto was poised to go mainstream and various firms ran ads at the Super Bowl starring big name celebrities. Then FTX collapsed, Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested, and it seemed like the market was finally done for. But that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen. Instead, we entered a new wild-west era of memecoins and speculative shitposting. The perceived geniuses and adults in the room were ousted or in prison and all that remained were the die-hard true believers, the blatant grifters, and the marks. These days I read as much about crypto being a safe haven during a stock market collapse as I do about the crypto bubble bursting. Paul Singer, who runs Elliott, has long been an enemy of crypto. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo tell me that something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constructed as a computer program, where you engage in some process of sitting there in front of your computer and after a period of time and the expenditure of a bunch of electricity a message appears on your screen that you have created something, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing. Gold is not nothing, gold is something, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hurt your teeth if you bite a gold coin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Singer said in an interview in 2021. In Elliott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter to investors, it warned that crypto was doomed to an \u00e2\u0080\u009cinevitable collapse\u00e2\u0080\u009d that might \u00e2\u0080\u009cwreak havoc in ways we cannot yet anticipate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  BitcoinCryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpStock market  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 As Musk's group heads to more agencies, more legal challenges are cropping up.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Swatch reported weak sales and a major slump in operating profits in 2024, owing largely to weak demand from Chinese consumers.          The luxury watch group, which owns watch big league brands like Omega, Tissot, and Longines, saw its sales decline 12% and its profits drop about 75% last year.               In the earnings press release published on Thursday, the group posted net sales of 6.7 billion francs, or $7.4 billion. This was a 12.2% decline from 2023 when it earned 7.9 billion francs.               Its operating profit dropped about 75% from about 1.2 billion francs in 2023 to 304 million francs in 2024.               The group attributed the results to a \"persistently difficult market situation and weak demand for consumer goods overall in China.\"               Swatch's press release said sales in China, including Hong Kong and Macau, slid around 30% in 2024.               It also added that there was a \"huge drop in demand for consumer goods\" in Southeast Asian markets, which it said are \"heavily dependent on Chinese tourists.\"               However, it reported stronger sales in other key markets, such as the US, Japan, India, and the Middle East. It said that in the US, Tissot sales exceeded $100 million for the first time.               Overall, luxury Swiss watchmakers struggled with weak demand in 2024. In September, Bloomberg reported that Girard-Perregaux and Ulysse Nardin, Swiss luxury watch brands owned by Sowind Group, turned to the government for financial support to cope with low demand.               Meanwhile, the Rolex resale market has also been cooling for more than two years after its COVID-era high, owing partly to a surge of watches coming into the market.               Watches are not the only luxury products impacted by waning demand in China.               In 2024, overall luxury spending stagnated, and big brands saw their share prices drop. Kering, the owner of Gucci, YSL, and Balenciaga, saw its stock fall more than 40% last year.               And luxury conglomerate LVMH's sales declined by 3% in the third quarter of 2024, partly because of weakened consumer confidence in China.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Some cloud providers are experiencing a notable uptick in demand for Nvidia's H200 chips after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek this month burst into the race for the winning foundation model.          Though the stock market caught wind of the powerful yet efficient large language model on Monday, sending Nvidia's stock down, DeepSeek has been on the radar of AI researchers and developers since it released its first model, V2, in May.               But the performance of V3, released in December, is what made AI developers sit up and take notice. When R1, the company's reasoning model, which competes with OpenAI's o1, was released in January, demand for Nvidia's H200s started climbing.               \"The launch of DeepSeek R1 has significantly accelerated demand for H200,\" said Robert Brooks, a founding team member and vice president of revenue at the cloud provider Lambda. \"We've seen such strong interest that enterprises are prepurchasing large blocks of Lambda's H200 capacity even before public availability.\"               DeepSeek's models are open source, which means users pay very little to use them. But they still need hardware or a cloud computing service to use them at scale.               Business Insider talked to 10 cloud service and AI inference providers. Five reported a rapid increase in demand for Nvidia's H200 graphics processing units this month.               Amazon Web Services and CoreWeave declined to comment. Oracle, Google, and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.               This week, AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia have made DeepSeek models available on their various cloud and AI developer platforms or provided instructions for users to do so themselves.               Nvidia declined to comment, citing a quiet period before its earnings release on February 26.               AI cloud offerings have exploded in the past two years, creating a slew of options beyond the mainstays of cloud computing such as Microsoft Azure and AWS.               The demand has come from a range of customers, including startups, individual researchers, and massive multinational firms.               \"We've heard from half a dozen of the 50 largest companies in the world,\" Tuhin Srivastava, a cofounder of the inference provider Baseten, told BI. \"I'm really not exaggerating.\"               On Friday, semiconductor industry analysts at SemiAnalysis reported \"tangible effects\" on pricing for H100 and H200 capacity in the market stemming from DeepSeek.               Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, said on the company's November earnings call that total sales of Nvidia H200 GPUs had reached the \"double-digit billions.\"               Karl Mozurkewich and his team at the cloud provider Valdi saw H200 demand ramp up throughout January \u2014 and at first, they didn't know why.               The Valdi team doesn't own chips; it acquires capacity from existing data centers and sells that capacity to customers. The company doesn't know every use case for each chip it makes accessible, but it polled several H200 customers, and all wanted the chips to run DeepSeek.               \"Suddenly R1 got everybody's attention \u2014 it caught fire \u2014 and then it kind of went exponential,\" Mozurkewich said.               American companies are eager to take advantage of DeepSeek's model performance and reasoning innovations, but most are not keen to share their data with a Chinese firm. That means they can either use an API offered by a US firm or run the model on their own hardware.               Since the model is open source, it can be downloaded and run locally without sharing data with DeepSeek.               Mozurkewich said most of Valdi's H200 demand was coming from startups.               \"It appears the market is reacting to DeepSeek by grabbing the best GPUs available for testing as quickly as possible,\" he said, adding, \"This makes sense, as most companies' current GPUs are likely to continue to work on ongoing tasks they've been allocated to.\"               Though many companies are still testing and experimenting, the Valdi team is seeing longer-term requests for additional hardware, suggesting an uptick in demand that could last beyond DeepSeek's initial hype cycle.               DeepSeek's research paper indicates its models were trained with less powerful hardware than US models. This efficiency has spooked the stock market.               Companies like Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft have invested billions in AI infrastructure, with billions more on the way. Investors are concerned about whether all that capacity will be needed. DeepSeek was created with fewer, relatively weak chips (though the number is hotly debated).               Training chips aside, using the models for inference is a compute-intensive task, cloud providers say.               \"It is not light and easy to run,\" Srivastava said.               The size of a model is measured in parameters. More parameters require more compute. The most powerful versions of DeepSeek's models have 678 billion parameters. OpenAI's GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion, while Meta's largest Llama model has 405 billion.               Srivastava said most firms were avoiding the 405 billion-parameter Llama model if they could help it, since the smaller version was much easier to run. DeepSeek offers smaller versions too, and even its most powerful version is cheaper to run, which has stoked excitement with firms that want to use the full model, the cloud providers said.               H200 chips are the only widely available Nvidia chip that can run DeepSeek's V3 model in its full form on a single node (eight chips designed to work together).               You can also spread it across more lower-power GPUs, but that requires more expertise and leaves room for error. Adding that complexity almost inevitably slows down performance, Srivastava said.       Nvidia's Blackwell chips will also be able to handle the full V3 model in one node, but these chips have just begun shipping this year.               With demand spiking, finding enough chips to run V3 or R1 at high speed is tough if they haven't already been allocated.               Baseten doesn't own GPUs; it buys capacity from data centers that do and then tinkers with all the software connections to make models run smoothly. Some of its customers have their own hardware in their own data centers but hire Baseten to optimize model performance.               Its customers especially value inference speed \u2014 the speed that enables an AI-generated voice to converse in real time, for example. Srivastava said DeepSeek's capacity at the open-source price was a game changer for its customers.               \"It does feel like this is an inflection point,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"        Bobby Allyn                        The smartphone app DeepSeek's page is seen on a smartphone screen in Beijing, Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025.                                                           Andy Wong\/AP                                       hide caption  Washington and Europe are growing wary of DeepSeek. The Chinese artificial intelligence company astonished the world last weekend by rivaling the hit chatbot ChatGPT, seemingly at a fraction of the cost. But now, regulators and privacy advocates are raising new questions about the safety of users' data. Regulators in Italy have blocked the app from Apple and Google app stores there, as the government probes what data the company is collecting and how it is being stored. In France and Ireland, officials are digging into whether the AI chatbot poses a privacy risk. And in the U.S., members of Congress and their staff are being warned by the House's Chief Administrative Officer not to use the app. Two U.S. Representatives recently asked the Trump administration to strengthen existing restrictions on the sale of semiconductor chips to China in an effort to \"outcompete\" China in AI development and \"safeguard Americans' data.\" According to DeepSeek's privacy policy, the service collects a trove of user data, including chat and search query history, the device a user is on, keystroke patterns, IP addresses, internet connection and activity from other apps. Other AI services, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, or Perplexity, harvest a similar volume of data from users. So do social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and X. At times, these kinds of data collection practices have led to questions from regulators. \"Data security concerns are always a critical issue when using AI chatbots, and this is not unique to DeepSeek,\" said Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Chinese regulation. \"Even U.S.-based AI firms like OpenAI have faced significant scrutiny and investigations in the EU over potential data privacy violations,\" she said, referring to the European Union's strict data protection laws. For example, these require users to opt in to any data collection. DeepSeek sends all the data it collects on Americans to servers in China, according to the company's terms of service. And for cybersecurity experts, that is where the problem lies. Much like Washington's fears about TikTok, which prompted Congress to ban the app in the U.S., the concern is that a China-based company will ultimately be answerable to the government, potentially exposing Americans' sensitive data to an adversarial nation. (The Trump administration is currently not enforcing the TikTok ban. The president signed an executive order seeking to extend the ban's start date until April.) When it comes to DeepSeek, Samm Sacks, a research scholar who studies Chinese cybersecurity at Yale, said the chatbot could indeed present a national security risk for the U.S. \"That data, in aggregate, can be used to glean insights into a population, or user behaviors that could be used to create more effective phishing attacks, or other nefarious manipulation campaigns,\" Sacks said. There are no public reports of Chinese officials harnessing DeepSeek for personal information on U.S. citizens. Much like with the debate about TikTok, the fears about China are hypothetical, with the mere possibility of Beijing abusing Americans' data enough to spark worry. Yale's Sacks said there are two other major factors to consider about the potential data risk posed by DeepSeek. First, the Chinese government already has an unfathomable amount of data on Americans. In December, Chinese hackers breached the U.S. Treasury Department's computer systems. Last year, another group of Chinese hackers spied on Americans' texts and calls after infiltrating U.S. telecom companies. Not to mention that an enormous amount of data on Americans is routinely bought and sold by a vast web of digital data brokers. \"China is already highly capable of gaining access to Americans' data, even without a potential backdoor like DeepSeek,\" Sacks said. And secondly, DeepSeek is open source, meaning the chatbot's software code can be viewed by anyone. Developers can also build their own apps and services on top of the underlying code. Most popular AI chatbots are not open source because companies closely guard the software code as confidential intellectual property. Sacks argues that DeepSeek providing transparency into how data is being accessed and processed provides something of a check on the system. Yet American privacy experts still don't know what happens to the data once it is stored on servers in China, where DeepSeek would be subject to national security laws that would force the company to hand over data if the government made a request. Requests for comment to DeepSeek, and its owner, Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, were not returned. Researchers and reporters have found examples of DeepSeek both pushing Chinese propaganda and censoring sensitive political subjects. While competing chatbots have no trouble explaining the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, DeepSeek told NPR: \"Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\" Likewise, when NPR asked about the sovereignty of Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, DeepSeek started writing an answer including that Taiwan is a \"complex and contested issue\" before the answer disappeared and was replaced with the message that the question is beyond DeepSeek's scope. Experts say the chatbot's limits are a reminder that the internet is government-controlled in China and that tech companies like DeepSeek are subject to interference, so the chatbot's answers should be greeted with a heavy dose of skepticism. Privacy experts like Sacks say there are ways of using DeepSeek more safely. They suggest not signing up to the app through Gmail or Apple accounts to ensure data on those services remains unavailable to DeepSeek. And when using the chatbot, it's best to not ask questions revealing identifying or highly personal information, since all inputs into DeepSeek are used to train the AI model, data that is eventually stored in China. People can also use a virtual private network, a VPN, to hide their location. If you have a government job, or if your personal information is potentially sensitive, she said, avoiding DeepSeek altogether is the safest bet. Ultimately, though, in the U.S., the task of safeguarding digital data is up to users, since there are no federal data privacy laws on the books, unlike the European Union, which has laws giving citizens insight and control over how their digital data is being accessed and used by private companies. Instead of creating national regulations, Sacks said, \"We're kind of playing Whack-A-Mole with this rotating cast of apps from China.\" She continued: \"We can ban TikTok, we can raise the red flag of data security concerns for DeepSeek, but we don't have a more comprehensive way to ensure that companies are not collecting more data than they should.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"The UK needs to \"up its game\" and get a work ethic in order to compete in the global economic race, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, he said there were nine million working age adults not in employment and that the UK \"needs everyone to make a contribution\" to keep up with countries like China and India.  He said he had worked hard in his career to set up businesses, adding: \"It's worked for me, it can work for the country as well.\" During the interview, the MP also recalled his time serving under Liz Truss, saying he had urged restraint but wasn't listened to.  His comments were seized upon by opponents, including the Lib Dems who said \"no-one can doubt Chris Philp's work ethic after he crashed the economy in just 39 days as Treasury minister under Liz Truss\". The Lib Dem Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \"The British public will no doubt take his advice with a bucketload of salt.\" A Labour spokesperson said the Conservatives had \"real brass neck\" to tell the public the previous government's economic failures were \"really all their fault\", in response to Philp's comments. \"It's the same old Tories. They haven't changed and they've learned nothing.\" The trade unions also joined the attack, with TUC general secretary Paul Novak saying the comments were \"patronising\" and \"out of touch\".  Asked whether she agreed with Philp, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"I think everybody should be working hard, including myself.\" Philp was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015, and worked in several ministerial departments in the Conservative government including the Home Office and Ministry of Justice.  Before entering politics he set up businesses in finance and travel.  He said he developed a strong work ethic in his early teens, delivering newspapers, washing people's cars and working in Sainsburys.  \"I found that working hard brought its own reward and I've kept doing that ever since. \"It is something I would like to infuse more into our national culture as well.\" Asked if he thought a belief in hard work was something that was missing in Britain, he replied \"I do a bit.\" \"There are nine million working age adults who are not working. \"As we compete globally with countries like South Korea, China, India, we need a work ethic, we need everybody to be making a contribution. \"We are in a global race that means we have got be competitive and it means we have got to work hard. \"As a country we need to up our game.\" Although Labour has denounced Chris Philp's language, there is perhaps more of a consensus between the two main parties in substance if not style. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said \"those who can work will work\" and \"as a country we cannot keep footing the bill for the spiralling numbers of people out of work\". She has accepted \u00a33bn cuts in the welfare budget that were pencilled in by the previous Conservative government - though how this is to be achieved will not be clear until details are published in the spring.  At least three million of the nine million economically inactive people are not in work because of health issues - and, without action, this is projected to increase significantly. When Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced plans to help young people \"earn and learn\" last November she also confirmed that those who chose not to embrace new opportunities could lose benefits. Chris Philp was chief secretary to the Treasury in autumn 2022 when Truss's tax-cutting mini-Budget triggered market turmoil, leading to her resignation as prime minister.  Following the announcement of the measures, Philp had posted a message on social media reading: \"Great to see Sterling strengthening on the back of the new UK growth plan.\" However, this was shortly followed by a dramatic tumble in the value of the pound as the market reacted badly to the mini-Budget. Asked about the post, Philp told Nick Robinson: \"Clearly commenting on currency movement was a dumb idea and I shouldn't have done that - I learnt a lesson.\" He said that Truss's tax reductions should have been accompanied by \"some spending restraint in order to help balance the books and to maintain market confidence\".  \"I made that case internally... but it wasn't listened to.\" \"I was hoping, despite all the difficulties and the very bad market reaction, there was a way to get through it to implement a growth plan... ultimately there wasn't a way of doing that. \"Had my suggestions been listened to a bit earlier, there was much higher chance it would have worked. \"It will always be a matter of regret that those points weren't taken on board and listened to.\" In a wide ranging interview with Nick Robinson, Philp said that having always worked hard and taken responsibility for his own life, it was difficult when, in 2013, his twins were born prematurely and he was \"not in control\" and had to be reliant on others for help.  His son and daughter were born at 25 weeks and one day, only just past the legal limit for abortion.  \"The doctor was completely honest, he said at this level there is only a 50\/50 chance of survival, and even if they survive there's a very significant chance of disability.  \"That was a moment of shock. He said that there was a \"happy ending\" and that despite a difficult first few years they are \"absolutely fine\".

Bitcoin maximalist MicroStrategy (MSTR) has extended its Bitcoin buying spree, raising $584 million through a perpetual convertible preferred stock offering to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. Initially, MicroStrategy targeted $250 million for its capital raise, but demand ballooned the offering threefold. As a result, the final issuance totaled 7.3 million shares, priced at $80 each. To be clear, perpetual convertible preferred stock is a type of preferred equity with no maturity date, allowing holders to convert their shares into a predetermined number of the company\u2019s common stock at any time. Under the leadership of former dot-com entrepreneur and current executive chairman Michael Saylor, and CEO Phong Le, the business intelligence firm has continued to accumulate Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has long advocated for Bitcoin, which is now part of its business model. In its third-quarter earnings report, MicroStrategy referred to itself as a \u201cBitcoin treasury company\u201d and announced plans to raise $42 billion in capital over the next three years through a balanced mix of $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities\u2014an initiative the company calls its \u201c21\/21 Plan.\u201d Since 2020, MicroStrategy has been purchasing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and as an alternative to cash.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Jhon Duran scored 20 goals for Aston Villa including the winner against Bayern Munich in the Champions League in October Striker Jhon Duran has joined Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr from Aston Villa in a deal that could be worth up to \u00c2\u00a371m.  The 21-year-old Colombian will join new team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane in Riyadh.  \"Aston Villa can confirm that Jhon Duran has joined Al-Nassr,\" the club said. \"Everyone at Aston Villa would like to wish Jhon all the best in the next step of his professional career.\" Duran was an unused substitute in Villa's 4-2 Champions League win over Celtic on Wednesday, a result which booked their spot in the last 16 of the competition.  Duran joined Villa from Chicago Fire for \u00c2\u00a318m in January 2023 but has been linked with a move away since last summer, with West Ham long-term admirers. He has scored 12 goals in 29 games for Villa this season and 20 in 78 appearances - but only seven of those have been league starts. Duran's departure leaves Ollie Watkins as Villa's only main striker, with the England international the subject of an approach from Arsenal this week. Villa, who travel to Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday, have no intention of allowing Watkins to leave. Boss Unai Emery said on Wednesday: \"I don't want [to sell]. It is good news to have offers from other clubs. We want to keep our sporting objective through the players we have in the squad. \"Every player can be in the market if it is good for the player and the club. To get this deal we are going to be demanding. Watkins is our striker.\" Villa have signed forward Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund during the window but he is widely viewed as a replacement for Moussa Diaby, who joined Al-Ittihad in the summer.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"     Interest rate decisions affect home loan rates but it's never a one-to-one relationship.    If you paid attention to the Federal Reserve's monetary decisions last year, you might have been surprised by something: The central bank's three interest rate cuts didn't help mortgage rates get cheaper for homebuyers. The Fed's relationship to home loan rates isn't direct or immediate. In many ways, what the Fed says matters more for the market than what it actually does. In other words, the Fed doesn't control the mortgage market. Mortgage rates are volatile and more influenced by the bond market, investor expectations and other economic factors.\u00a0 This week, at its first policy meeting of the year, the Fed announced a pause from its rate-cutting path. What does that mean for mortgage rates? Following the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that slow progress on inflation and uncertainty surrounding new economic policies are putting the central bank in monitor mode. \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" Powell said. If inflation remains sticky, the central bank's pause on rate cuts could last several months, keeping upward pressure on bond yields and mortgage rates. Here's what to know about how the government's interest rate policy affects mortgage rates. The Fed, established by the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, sets and oversees US monetary policy to stabilize the economy. It consists of 12 regional banks and 24 branches, and it is run by a board of governors who are voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee. The FOMC sets its benchmark federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend their money. In an inflationary environment, the Fed raises interest rates to slow economic growth and make borrowing money more cost-prohibitive. When the economy is in a slump or downturn, the Fed reduces interest rates to stimulate consumer spending and propel growth. Though the Fed doesn't directly set mortgage rates, it influences them by altering the price of credit, which has a domino effect on mortgage rates and the broader housing market over the long term. For instance, banks typically pass along the Fed's rate hikes to consumers in the form of higher interest rates for longer-term loans, including home loans. Read more: Why Labor Data Matters for Mortgage Rates and the Fed Since the November election, investors have been \"pricing in\" expectations for higher inflation and fewer Fed cuts in 2025, effectively driving up bond yields and mortgage rates. President Donald Trump's proposals for tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations are widely considered inflationary, which isn't good for mortgage rates. Economists say it's too early to say how Trump's economic agenda and a Republican-led Congress might alter the central bank's approach to interest rate adjustments, noting only that the Fed plans to move cautiously. \"It's a bit of a 'wait-and-see' period with regard to the new administration, and a lot may happen over the first 100 days of it, given the flurry of executive orders,\" said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com. Right now, the Fed hasn't changed its outlook for two 0.25% reductions in 2025. Other organizations, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, forecast just one interest rate cut. \"With the Fed on hold, we do expect that longer-term rates, including mortgage rates, will also stay within a narrow range for the foreseeable future, said\u00a0Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at MBA, in a statement this week. If the Fed implements additional rate cuts or even simply signals that it plans to in the near future, though, mortgage rates could gradually decline. The timing of potential cuts, as well as the economic data we get between each policy meeting, will determine how quickly (and how far) mortgage rates can fall. The Fed \"will want to see the impact of President Trump's tariffs and other policies on inflation,\" said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. The earliest she thinks the central bank will consider cutting rates again would be at their May policy meeting. A cut in June or July is more likely, based on the CME FedWatch Tool. Absent a significant downshift in inflation or a jump in unemployment, it's unlikely 30-year fixed mortgage rates will drop below 6% any time soon. Mortgage rates\u00a0move around for many of the same reasons home prices do: supply, demand, inflation and even the employment rate. Additionally, the individual mortgage rate you qualify for is determined by personal factors, such as your credit score and loan amount. The specific factors that determine your particular mortgage interest rate include: Even though timing is everything in the mortgage market, you can't control what the Fed does. You can get the\u00a0best rates and terms\u00a0available by making sure your financial profile is healthy while comparing terms and rates from multiple lenders. Regardless of the economy, the most important thing when shopping for a mortgage is to make sure you can comfortably afford your monthly payments. \"Buying a home is the largest financial decision a person will make,\" said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. If you've found a home that fits your lifestyle needs and budget, purchasing a home in today's housing market could be financially prudent, Kushi noted. If you're priced out, it's better to wait. \"Sitting on the sidelines may allow a potential buyer to continue to pay down their debt, build up their credit and save for the down payment and closing costs,\" she said. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady in January, but it's not uncommon for the federal funds rate and mortgage rates to move in different directions for some time. Mortgage rates will continue fluctuating in response to inflation, investor expectations and the broader economic outlook. Experts predict that mortgage rates should go down slowly over the next year. If you're shopping for a mortgage, compare the rates and terms offered by banks and lenders. The more lenders you interview, the better your chances of securing a lower mortgage rate.","label":0}

I'm still trying to figure out what the hell \"oustrips\" might imply with regards to AI performance, since my first thought was copper mining.  Just curious as to who is pimping \"leading\" AI stats these days, and how they outstripped and outdid themselves into that claim. If we thought dick-measuring contests were bad before, just wait until AI lubes the bullshit-stained skids. Pretty good FP. I just wrote a piece that could be adapted to continue the discussion along your lines [what I called \"trust\" issues], but I'm sorry to say I don't have motivation to find the time to do that for today's Slashdot, so I'm just going to paste a version of my initial reaction here: What is Deep Seek like? I'll call it DS for short. This is intended as my shared initial reaction based on two conversations. So far neither of my DS conversations has gone very far. That's largely because of \"trust\" issues, and the second conversation has already started explicit discussion of those matters.First of all, DS feels quite similar to ChatGPT. That includes the imbalanced verbosity issue. In normal English conversation the turns are fairly balanced. Each side speaks for a while and then the other side responds at similar length. In contrast, in today's discussion, I started with an 8-word description of a topic and DS responded with a huge essay about \"life, the universe and everything\". [What? No Oxford comma in the original? Color me outraged.] That did motivate me to find the \"Stop\" button. It's the input button while DS is \"typing\". [The quotes this time are scare quotes warning of anthropomorphic thinking--but if I used them everywhere they are called for, then this would be much harder to read than it already is...]This first session actually wound up running over 300 words from my side. One of the diverting topics was word counting. DS explicitly denied being able to count words and offered to explain how I could do it, but I noted that was tedious but if DS counted them it could help balance the conversation... For which suggestion DS again \"sincerely thanked\" me. [Faking sincerity. As always. Another recurring theme of all the GAIs I've played with.]So far I have not introduced any substance into either of the conversations. In the first conversation, I am concerned that the data source may \"offend\" the operators\/owners of DS. It's a big data source that almost certainly includes some politically sensitive material. The second conversation involves some ideas that might be quite valuable. Why should I let the operators\/owners of DS take the money and run? [But one of my many problems is that I don't really care much about money... However if I do help solve some problems in the real world it would be nice to get some credit?]That's about all I have time for now... Not sure if I'll continue later on this theme.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"On Friday, almost immediately after the Trump administration announced that tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada will begin on Saturday, the stock market plunged. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that tariffs of 25 percent would be implemented against Canada and Mexico, and a 10 percent tariff against China.  Right after the announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 all suffered losses. As of publication time, the three indexes had fallen 350 points, 87 points, and 30 points, respectively. Leavitt told reporters that the full details of the tariffs would be released when they are implemented, but all three countries have said they would respond. Canada has pledged to retaliate with tariffs of its own in a \u201cforceful but reasonable\u201d manner, according to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \u201cI won\u2019t sugarcoat it\u2014our nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks,\u201d Trudeau said to an advisory council on Canada-U.S. relations Friday. \u201cI know Canadians might be anxious and worried, but I want them to know the federal government\u2014and indeed, all orders of government\u2014have their backs.\u201d Mexico also plans to institute its own tariffs against the United States, and China said it will \u201cfirmly defend\u201d its interests. Regardless, Trump claims that his tariffs will force other countries to comply with his policies and raise money for the federal government, even though they\u2019re more likely to hurt the economy as well as the average American. Beginning this weekend, Americans, whether they support Trump or not, may experience some sticker shock if they go shopping.  President Donald Trump is doubling down on his ultimatum to federal employees, sending yet another wretched email on Thursday that practically begs employees to take \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d and leave the public sector.  The email, titled \u201cFork in the Road FAQ,\u201d answered a number of questions clarifying the details of Trump\u2019s \u201cbuyout\u201d offer that was announced earlier this week. The Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, sent an email to more than two million federal employees on Tuesday presenting them with the option to either return to the office full-time and adhere to \u201cenhanced standards\u201d of conduct or resign by February 6 and receive severance pay until September 30.  The offer naturally sparked confusion and outrage, and the \u201cFork in the Road FAQ\u201d is a feeble attempt to provide federal employees with clarity and supposedly appealing incentives to quit. The memo made clear that employees who chose to resign would not have to work throughout their eight months of severance pay.  In response to a question about vacation, the OPM wrote that employees who resign are welcome to \u201cstay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination.\u201d The email also encouraged employees to get a second job while they\u2019re on leave.  \u201cThe greater way to American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector,\u201d the email reads, insulting the work of millions who dedicated their careers to the civil service. The message is a blatant and desperate attempt to sweep the federal workforce clear of the president\u2019s adversaries, and is uncannily similar to a memo from Elon Musk to Twitter employees in 2022. Musk encouraged Twitter (now X) staffers to resign unless they could commit to being \u201cextremely hardcore.\u201d  As nearly all of Trump\u2019s promises are, the offer is also fraught with legal concerns. The OPM can\u2019t promise paid leave for federal employees in agencies other than its own, and government funding is only guaranteed through March 14, not September 30. A New York doctor has been indicted for trying to provide a patient with abortion pills across state lines. Dr. Margaret Carpenter, her company Nightingale Medical, PC, and an unnamed third person have all been charged with \u201ccriminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs,\u201d for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill to a patient living in Louisiana, where a near-total abortion ban is in place. A Louisiana grand jury indicted all three. This appears to be the first time a doctor has been charged with prescribing abortion pills in a state with anti-abortion laws\u2014but it won\u2019t be the last. The news comes just a couple months after Louisiana reclassified abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances,\u201d making them harder for state residents to access. The new law states that anyone who has mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription can be fined up to $5,000 or face up to five years in jail. Louisiana\u2019s draconian laws extend beyond the pills. The state has essentially had a complete ban on abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and has zero exceptions for incest or rape. Doctors found guilty of conducting abortions illegally can face up to 15 years in prison and lose their medical license. \u201cI have said it before, and I will say it again: We will hold individuals accountable for breaking the law,\u201d Louisiana\u2019s Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill said on Friday. This indictment may also result in New York using its shield laws for the first time, which are aimed to protect doctors who prescribe potentially lifesaving abortion care to patients in states where abortion is illegal. The state of Texas has already sued Carpenter on similar grounds. Most abortions in the U.S. are done via pill as of 2023. Carpenter\u2019s indictment\u2014and the rest that are surely to come\u2014will force physicians to choose between the training and creed they know and the political whims of their president.  In perhaps the Trump administration\u2019s pettiest move yet, multiple federal agencies are ordering federal employees to remove any pronouns from their email signatures by end of day Friday, according to ABC News. \u201cPronouns and any other information not permitted in the policy must be removed from CDC\/ATSDR employee signatures by 5.p.m. ET on Friday,\u201d read a message from from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief information officer Jason Bonander on Friday. \u201cStaff are being asked to alter signature blocks by 5.p.m. ET today (Friday, January 31, 2025) to follow the revised policy.\u201d Workers at the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy received similar messages on Thursday, amid the chaos of the D.C. plane crash. \u201cIn my decade-plus years at CDC I\u2019ve never been told what I can and can\u2019t put in my email signature,\u201d an anonymous employee told ABC. The messages cited Trump\u2019s recent anti-DEI executive orders. This is yet another attack on Trump\u2019s part, focusing on policing a form of self-expression that has no impact on the ability of federal workers to do the jobs they\u2019ve sworn to do.  Governor J.B. Pritzker is blocking any January 6 rioters pardoned by Donald Trump from working for the state of Illinois. In a statement released Thursday, the Democratic governor blatantly ignored Trump\u2019s attempt to give the rioters a second chance under his administration, ordering Illinois\u2019s Central Management Service to reject all pardoned rioters and consider their potential participation in government as \u201cantithetical to the mission of the State.\u201d On his first day in office, Trump issued a \u201cfull, complete and unconditional pardon\u201d to more than 1,500 January 6 offenders, the first of many moves to reward loyalty above all else over the next four years.  In his statement, Pritzker listed the felonies and misdemeanors of the rioters who stormed the Capitol four years ago, among them members of the far-right militia groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. \u201cThe rioters attacked law enforcement officers protecting people in the Capitol, disrupted the peaceful transfer of power and undermined bedrock principles of American democracy,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cNo one who attempts to overthrow a government should serve in government,\u201d Pritzker said, simply stating the absurdity of the president\u2019s mass pardon. A longtime Trump critic, Pritzker is the first governor to take direct, effective action against Trump\u2019s sweeping list of executive orders. He has slammed a number of Trump\u2019s other actions too, namely a memo that sought to freeze all federal aid, which has since been blocked in court.  A far-right, extremist group has compiled a list of foreign students and teachers that it thinks should be expelled from the United States for protesting against Israel, and turned it over to officials in the Trump administration. Betar, a Revisionist Zionist organization inspired by European fascist movements, has been using facial recognition and soliciting tips to identify protesters at rallies and encampments opposing Israel\u2019s brutal war in Gaza over the past year. \u201cThe Zionist community in America has had enough, and while we vowed many months ago to build lists and have them deported, we are pleased that this will now begin,\u201d a spokesperson for the group, Daniel Levy, told Salon. \u201cWe have already submitted names of hundreds of terror supporters to the Trump administration who proudly support terror and don\u2019t belong in this country as they are here on visas.\u201d Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that gives federal agencies the power to identify, punish, and deport foreign nationals allegedly prejudiced against Judaism and Jewish people, a blatant attempt to stifle pro-Palestine activism in the United States. Betar wants to make the Trump administration\u2019s attack on the First Amendment even easier. Levy told Salon that his organization has given its list to attorney general nominee Pam Bondi, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump adviser Stephen Miller, U.N. ambassador nominee Elise Stefanik, and other members of the Trump administration. The list isn\u2019t just composed of protesters, either: Betar is targeting academics who advocate for Palestine or who teach an \u201calternate history\u201d that conflicts with the organization\u2019s worldview. This, according to Levy, includes people who advocate for a one-state solution: a single, secular democratic state encompassing both Israel and the Palestinian territories. \u201cWhen they say \u2018one-state solution,\u2019 it\u2019s not for the benefit of the truth or for the benefit of the Jews. They want the six million Jews wiped out,\u201d Levy said. Trump\u2019s executive order ostensibly aimed at antisemitism is straight out of the playbook of the right-wing Heritage Foundation, which, along with its political manifesto Project 2025, has crafted \u201cProject Esther\u201d to target pro-Palestine activists. An extremist organization like Betar fits right into that plan, helping with the fascist legwork. A social scientist who wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times has accused the paper\u2019s Trump-friendly owner of bending his words to suit Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s appointment to the Department of Health and Human Services. Eric Reinhart, a political anthropologist and psychoanalytic clinician, published an essay in the West Coast daily Friday suggesting that Kennedy\u2019s controversial appointment could \u201cpay off\u201d so long as he \u201cpushes real reform.\u201d But the freelancer claims that the pro-Kennedy argument wasn\u2019t his choice\u2014nor his original intent.  \u201cMy first time working with the Los Angeles Times, and I expect also my last,\u201d Eric Reinhart, a political anthropologist and psychoanalytic clinician, wrote on X following the article\u2019s publication. \u201cA vote for RFK Jr is a vote for nothing but chaos, the opposite of the essential public-systems building I argue for in the OpEd, and mass death.\u201d The original and final versions of Reinhart\u2019s article differ drastically in message. The first paragraph of the published opinion piece takes an optimistic tone about Kennedy\u2019s role in the Trump administration, suggesting that the virulent conspiracy theorist could be an answer and solution to the American public\u2019s bubbling resentment toward the health care industry. President Trump\u2019s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reflects anger and frustration at the wanton greed underlying America\u2019s health systems. Major changes are coming. But we must not let those changes leave us even worse off than we already are. But compare the soft and forgiving language of the published version to Reinhart\u2019s original copy, which he shared on X shortly after the article\u2019s publication. In it, he likens the sociopolitical reckoning of Kennedy\u2019s nomination to the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Trump\u2019s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation\u2019s health agencies and the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson are both reflections of the same reality: anger at the wanton greed underlying America\u2019s health systems has reached a fever pitch, and it will not be held back any longer. Major changes are coming, but they may leave us even worse off than we already are. Additionally, the published iteration of the text completely nixed Reinhart\u2019s closing remarks, in which the social scientist reiterated Kennedy\u2019s blatant disregard for scientific evidence. Although RFK Jr. and Luigi Mangione are both responses to the same underlying problem of US healthcare corruption, there is a major difference between them: one operated outside the law to kill one person in defense of millions, whereas the other\u2014via his egomaniacal disregard for scientific evidence\u2014seeks to use law itself to inflict preventable death on those millions. Reinhart vented deeper frustration on BlueSky, where he pointed fingers at the political interests of the paper\u2019s biotech billionaire owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, as a potential reason for the intervention in his thesis. \u201cEditing out the most urgent point of an OpEd in the minutes before sending to press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest an argument entirely opposite to the author\u2019s clear intent is pretty shitty,\u201d Reinhart wrote.  It is not unusual for news outlets to edit, trim, change, or otherwise alter copy before it reaches publication\u2014even without the author\u2019s consent. But it is noteworthy that the Los Angeles Times\u2019 heavy-handed pen sliced and diced a new argument out of a piece criticizing Kennedy, days after the paper\u2019s owner formally endorsed him. Soon-Shiong publicly supported Kennedy\u2019s nomination to head HHS earlier this week. In a post on Twitter, the billionaire said that he had not met Kennedy \u201cuntil a few months ago\u201d but over time had come to \u201ctruly believe\u201d that he had \u201cthe American public\u2019s best interests at heart.\u201d \u201cI have worried about toxins and the cause of cancer my entire career. As a physician scientist I really hope he is confirmed tomorrow,\u201d Soon-Shiong posted on Tuesday. In 2018, Soon-Shiong took control of the Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune in a $500 million deal from Tribune Publishing. Read Reinhart\u2019s unedited op-ed here. Republican Congressman Eric Burlison admitted Friday there was no evidence that diversity, equity, and inclusion policies were responsible for the deadly plane crash near Washington, D.C., earlier this week. Sixty-seven people are believed to be dead after a passenger plane hit a military helicopter midair near Ronald Reagan Nation Airport. The actual cause of the crash remains unknown, but Donald Trump has blamed who he always does: anyone who isn\u2019t a white, straight, able-bodied man. Trump\u2019s cronies have been quick to echo his harmful theory, but Burlison was forced to admit there was no evidence to prove it, in an interview with Fox News. \u201cDo you have any evidence that any of those hires were DEI hires?\u201d host Maria Bartiromo asked Burlison after he too criticized the FAA\u2019s diversity hires.  \u201cNot until we get into the investigation,\u201d Burlison admitted. REP. ERIC BURLISON: The FAA is riddled with DEI problemsBARTIROMO: Do you have any evidence though that any of those hires were DEI hires?BURLISON: Not until we get into the investigation pic.twitter.com\/JljpWw1EvY Burlison is taking a page from Trump\u2019s book. In a press conference on Thursday, Trump said the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s efforts to hire \u201cworkers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems, and other mental and physical conditions\u201d in air traffic control centers led to the crash. Trump admitted he had no evidence to back his claim but said he believed it to be true because he has \u201ccommon sense.\u201d It\u2019s yet another ridiculous attempt to blame literally every problem on DEI efforts enacted by Joe Biden and Barack Obama.  Ironically though, it was Trump\u2019s own first administration that launched a diversity program to hire air controllers with the very criteria he claimed were responsible for the deadliest U.S. plane crash in 25 years, The Washington Post reported Thursday evening. Republicans\u2019 new Senate majority leader, John Thune, is being forced to choose between his fearless MAGA leader and the constituents who chose him to represent their interests.\u00a0 Trump on Thursday confirmed his plans to levy aggressive 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, after complaining about \u201cthe people that have poured into our country,\u201d \u201cthe drugs, fentanyl and everything else,\u201d and \u201cthe massive subsidies we are giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits.\u201d While Trump and his base cheer on the strongman isolationism, Thune\u2019s constituents in his home state of South Dakota could potentially suffer. The state\u2019s entire economy is reliant on agriculture\u2014it exports soybeans, corn, and beef primarily, according to a Politico analysis. And it just so happens that China and Mexico are the biggest export markets for U.S. agriculture.\u00a0 Tariffs against these countries would cripple South Dakota\u2019s economy, as they did in 2018 when Trump enacted the very same tariffs during his trade war. Senators in similar precarious situations are looking to Thune to talk the president down.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cObviously the president is somebody who sees great value in the use of tariffs as a tool and we\u2019ll have, I\u2019m sure, lots of conversations,\u201d Thune told Politico, striking a diplomatic chord. \u201cPeople up here have different views about how and when to use them but I see value when they are used in a targeted way.\u201d Meanwhile, Thune has been pushing the president\u2019s Cabinet picks through, even after Trump overruled Thune\u2019s plan to split the GOP tax bill in two, signaling that he won\u2019t be open to the Senate majority leader\u2019s hesitations. We\u2019ll see if Thune finds the guts to speak up. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. admitted to senators late Thursday that there was at least one incident in which he settled a case over inappropriate behavior. The revelation came by way of a series of follow-up questions Democrats sent to the Department of Health and Human Services secretary nominee. Senators wanted to know if Kennedy had ever reached a legal settlement over accusations of misconduct. Two questions in the list, obtained by Mother Jones, read as follows: \u201cYes or no, have you ever reached a settlement agreement with an individual or organization that accused you of misconduct or inappropriate behavior?\u201d \u201cYes or no, have you ever agreed to or been subject to a non-disclosure agreement with any individual or organization?\u201d Kennedy answered yes to each one but offered no follow-up details. Mother Jones reached out to Kennedy to elaborate on the answer, querying if the 71-year-old\u2019s settlements had to do with previously reported allegations, such as claims that he allegedly groped his children\u2019s babysitter, Eliza Cooney, in the late 1990s.  A spokesperson for Kennedy, Katie Miller, sent a brief reply to the publication: \u201cAs a matter of policy, we don\u2019t respond to Mother Jones.\u201d Kennedy had denied Cooney\u2019s accusation when asked about it during his Senate confirmation hearing. And when Senator Patty Murray asked if there were other instances where Kennedy made \u201csexual advances toward an individual without their consent,\u201d he said, \u201cNo.\u201d Kennedy, a virulent vaccine conspiracy theorist, was tapped by Donald Trump to run the country\u2019s health policy. His private life has given pause to a number of lawmakers responsible for confirming him. Kennedy has publicly admitted to dumping a dead bear cub in Central Park, believed the 2004 presidential election was stolen from Democrat John Kerry, peddled conspiracies that the CIA killed his uncle, chainsawed off the head of a dead whale (per his daughter Kick Kennedy), and last week was described by his cousin Caroline Kennedy as a \u201cpredator\u201d who is \u201caddicted to attention and power.\u201d \u201cI have known Bobby my whole life; we grew up together,\u201d the former ambassador to Australia and Japan wrote in a letter to lawmakers obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cHis basement, his garage, his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\u201d And Kennedy\u2019s history in public health is questionable, at best. His stances, which include unscientific beliefs that AIDS is not caused by HIV and that a large number of vaccines should be stripped from the market, could have major impacts on the agency designed to protect America\u2019s health, especially as bird flu outbreaks begin to dot the country.","label":0}

Warren Buffett has garnered so much fame for his financial acumen that investors hang on his every word. The \"Oracle of Omaha\" recently shared his opinion on why he believes the S&P 500 index fund is the best option for everyday investors who want to build wealth and diversify. \"Keep it simple, stupid,\" is a mantra that Warren Buffett has employed to great effect when it comes to investing. He has a rather simple but incredibly effective strategy of backing companies with large market shares in sectors with high demand for their products. That philosophy has served him well, but he's also aware that everyday investors may not have the time to do deep dives into companies like his Berkshire Hathaway analysts.

Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year \u2014 Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000 Many investors opt to work with high-profile financial managers or invest in whatever \"hot\" hedge fund comes down the pike. As you might expect, a simple man like Buffett disagrees with both tactics. He feels so strongly about it that in 2007 he offered to pay $1 million to a fund manager who could beat his returns if he parked his money in the S&P 500 index fund for the next 10 years. The only fund manager who took the challenge was Ted Seides of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners, and he gave up before the 10 years were over. It's not that fund managers weren't smart, or didn't have individual years where their investments outperformed the index. Buffett knows investing is a marathon, not a sprint, and over time the S&P 500 index fund has been a proven winner. Trending: It\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here\u2019s how everyday investors are getting started. That, more than anything else, explains why Buffett is such a big fan. More importantly, the S&P 500 has been steadily performing since 2017, which was the end of Buffett's 10-year bet. According to OfficialData.org and public filings, a $100 investment in the S&P 500 index fund in 2017 would be worth $302.83 today. That's a 202.83% ROI and annual growth of 15.19% per year. It's hard to argue with that kind of success. Performance matters, but it's not the only consideration. Even if a hedge-fund manager's investments outperformed the S&P 500 index fund over a prolonged period, it may not necessarily result in bigger returns for investors. The reason for that is fees. Many of the highest performing private equity and hedge funds have high fee structures, and that money comes right out of investors' pockets. By contrast, Vanguard's S&P 500 Index Fund only charges .03%, meaning fees on a $500k investment would be just $150 annually. You'd be hard pressed to join a gym and pay only $150 in annual membership dues. When you add that to the diversified holdings in an S&P 500 index fund, it's easy to see why Buffett is a fan. Low fees and diversification let you kill two birds with one stone. See Also: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Buffett's other reason for being a big proponent of the S&P 500 is perhaps even more pragmatic. The companies in the index are some of the best performing businesses in America and run by some of the country's most capable executives. In that sense, investing in the S&P 500 is akin to investing in the American economy, which Buffett believes in very strongly. Buffett declared his unwavering belief in American business in a 2022 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. The letter plainly stated that Buffet had \"yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America,\" during his several decade long career as an investor. That's a pretty strong endorsement, and if you're inclined to agree with Warren Buffett, you may want to take a look at an S&P 500 index fund.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"In response to the recent launch of Nvidia\u2019s latest RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 graphics cards, eBay users have taken matters into their own hands to combat scalpers and automated purchasing bots. By listing fake products\u2014such as photographs or drawings of the RTX 5090, sometimes humorously framed\u2014sellers aim to deceive bots programmed to acquire these high-demand items for resale at inflated prices. These deceptive listings often mimic the appearance of genuine product offers, complete with pricing around the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP) or lower. Subtle warnings like \u201cread description\u201d are included to alert human buyers. Upon reviewing the description, it becomes evident that the listing is for an image or drawing of the graphics card, not the actual hardware. Some sellers even specify that purchasers will receive a digital image via email or a random item from a donation store, clearly indicating the non-physical nature of the product. For instance, this listing asks users to read the description where it says \u2013 \u201cTHIS IS JUST A PICTURE OF THE RTX 5090 GRAPHICS CARD PRINTED IN BLACK AND WHITE FROM MY PRINTER. HUMANS DO NOT BUY! ZERO RETURNS! SALES ARE FINAL!\u201d This tactic has proven effective. A search for \u201cRTX 5090\u201d on eBay reveals numerous such listings, with some even recording sales. While it\u2019s unclear whether these purchases were made by bots or unsuspecting individuals, the prevalence of these fake listings has made it challenging for scalpers to identify genuine products. The motivation behind these actions stems from widespread frustration over the limited availability of Nvidia\u2019s latest RTX 50-series desktop GPUs, which went on sale just yesterday, January 30. Despite the company\u2019s efforts, the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 have been in short supply since their release, leading to significant demand and prompting enthusiasts to camp outside retailers in hopes of securing a unit. Gamers Nexus has done an excellent deep dive on the ongoing RTX 50-series GPU shortages. The video suggests that major retailers such as Micro Center, Best Buy, and Newegg had extremely limited stocks that were depleted within hours, leaving many enthusiasts empty-handed.  In Japan, the situation was equally chaotic. Eager customers were seen hopping fences of neighboring properties to secure a GPU. To manage overwhelming demand and prevent scalping, a Japanese retailer implemented a lottery system just to buy one GPU. However, the lottery concluded before many attendees arrived, leading to further frustration among consumers. Notably, Nvidia acknowledged that its new RTX 5090 and 5080 graphics cards would face significant demand, potentially leading to stock shortages. Tim Adams, Nvidia\u2019s head of GeForce community, stated in the company\u2019s forums, \u201cWe expect significant demand for the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 and believe stock-outs may happen.\u201d He emphasized that the company and its partners are continuously shipping more stock to retailers to meet consumer demand. Reports suggest that these supply challenges may persist for up to three months, exacerbating the situation and giving scalpers more opportunities to exploit the market. While system integrators might offer a way to get an RTX 50-series GPU, expect to pay a premium\u2014and likely end up with extra parts you don\u2019t need if you already own a PC. Nvidia has expressed confidence that the infamous melting issues with the 12VHPWR power connectors, which plagued some RTX 40-series GPUs, will not recur with its next-generation RTX 50-series lineup. As reported by QuasarZone, during the Nvidia RTX AI Day 2025 event in South Korea, Nvidia representatives assured attendees that the overheating and melting issues experienced with the RTX 4090's 12VHPWR connector have been resolved in the RTX 50 series. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that to happen with the RTX 50 series. We made some changes to the connector to respond to the issue at the time, and we know that it is not happening now, about two years later,\u201d said an Nvidia representative. Nvidia's RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 are set to release later this month, and there's no doubt that they'll end up being some of the best graphics cards of the year. Unfortunately, it also seems that they might be hard to come by, as many sources expect that the RTX 50-series will have very limited availability to start with.\u00a0 If this checks out, we might see a similar situation to the GPU shortage we endured during the launch of the RTX 30-series. VideoCardz compiled a number of leaks that all add up to the same thing: Nvidia and its partners may not be able to supply many next-gen GPUs in time for the launch date. This wouldn't necessarily mean that the official January 30 release date would get pushed -- that's pretty unlikely at this point. Instead, the GPUs might be up for sale, but limited in number, and they won't be restocked for some time. Last year, Nvidia revealed Project G-Assist. At the time, it was just a technical demo of an AI assistant that could guide you in the right direction in games, but Nvidia is turning it into an actual product. Project G-Assist is coming to the Nvidia app in beta starting in February for all RTX graphics cards, but it looks a bit different from that original tech demo. Now, Project G-Assist is less of a game-specific helper and more of an AI assistant for Nvidia graphics cards. It's basically a chatbot, not dissimilar from ChatGPT, but it has access to all of the knobs and switches that control your GPU. With it, you can ask G-Assist to optimize your performance in a particular game, and it'll automatically set your GPU parameters and game settings accordingly. Or you can ask it to graph your frame rate and latency, and then ask it to optimize your performance for a specific frame rate target. Those are just a couple of examples, too.

In the wake of the pandemic, consumers have gotten very used to doing their shopping online. And not surprisingly, that's led to an uptick in physical store closures. In 2024, retail closures reached their highest level since the pandemic, according to Coresight Research, with a total of 7,325 locations shuttering. And things aren't exactly looking up for 2025. A near-record number of Americans are grappling with $1,000 car payments and many drivers can't keep up. Here are 3 ways to stay ahead Protect your retirement savings with these 5 essential money moves \u2014 most of which you can complete in just minutes One dozen eggs in America now costs $4.15 \u2014 and $14.35 for a pound of sirloin steak. Both record highs. 3 simple ways to protect your wealth in 2025 A projected 15,000 stores are expected to close between now and the end of December, and some of the retailers that are shutting down the most locations may surprise you. You'd think a chain like Best Buy would be immune to store closures given the number of consumers who prioritize spending on electronics. But Best Buy is making plans to close 10 to 15 stores in 2025. As of late 2024, Best Buy had more than 1,000 stores across the country. As part of its strategy, it plans to experiment with new store formats in an attempt to draw in more customers. Advance Auto Parts is making plans to close 523 corporate stores, four distribution centers, and 204 independent locations by the middle of the year. Sluggish profits are largely driving the change, but given the chain\u2019s roughly 5,000 stores in total, it\u2019s fair to say that plenty of locations are sticking around, at least for now.

Be on the lookout for changes if you\u2019re someone who relies on CVS for your prescription refills, as you may need to transfer them to another store or even another pharmacy. For many people, a big part of the shopping mall experience is heading to Foot Locker for new sneakers, or to see what's in stock. That experience may be coming to an end for some shoppers, though. In 2023, Foot Locker announced plans to close 400 mall locations by 2026, so it's fair to expect a substantial number of closures this year.

That may come as a shock given that Kohl\u2019s has such a large following, but rest assured that Kohl's isn't exactly on the brink of disappearing. Following these closures, Kohl's will still have more than 1,150 locations. The department store chain is focusing on shuttering locations that have been struggling. Closing stores isn't exactly a new practice for Macy's, as the legendary department store has been shuttering locations for years. But in 2025, Macy's is making plans to close 51 locations, including its landmark store in Philadelphia and others in nearby New York and New Jersey. And it begs the question: what retailer will malls find to put in its place? Only time will tell. How many times have you stopped at a 7-Eleven in the course of a road trip to grab a Slurpee to go, or to satisfy a late-night snack craving? Unfortunately, in some areas, those options may soon start dwindling, since 7-Eleven is making plans to close some of its less popular locations. The company plans to close 148 stores in 2025. But given its more than 13,000 store footprint, that leaves plenty of locations going strong \u2014 at least for now. CVS isn't the only pharmacy chain to struggle with underperforming locations, as Walgreens has fallen victim to a similar fate. In late 2024, Walgreens announced plans to close around 1,200 locations. Of those, an estimated 333 closings are set to take place in 2025. The pharmacy chain has been hurt in recent years by lower rates of prescription reimbursement, high levels of theft and rising costs. Online competitors in the pharmacy space, like Amazon, may also be hurting Walgreens. Big Lots has been in big trouble. The retail giant filed for bankruptcy in 2024 following a string of financial woes. The good news is that some of its stores will continue to operate, but an estimated 601 will be shutting their doors in 2025. The chain said that consumer purchases of home and seasonal products have slowed down in recent years due to rampant inflation, hurting its bottom line. If you've long relied on Party City for everything from Halloween costumes to birthday gathering supplies, here's some bad news. The popular chain filed for bankruptcy in late 2024 and will be closing all of its 738 locations as a result. The good news? Before closing completely, Party City is having a major goodbye sale, with some items being marked down up to 50% off. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"The Chinese firm has pulled back the curtain to expose how the top labs may be building their next-generation models. Now things get interesting. When the Chinese firm DeepSeek dropped a large language model called R1 last week, it sent shock waves through the US tech industry. Not only did R1 match the best of the homegrown competition, it was built for a fraction of the cost\u2014and given away for free.\u00a0 The US stock market lost $1 trillion, President Trump called it a wake-up call, and the hype was dialed up yet again. \u201cDeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014and as open source, a profound gift to the world,\u201d Silicon Valley\u2019s kingpin investor Marc Andreessen posted on X. But DeepSeek\u2019s innovations are not the only takeaway here. By publishing details about how R1 and a previous model called V3 were built and releasing the models for free, DeepSeek has pulled back the curtain to reveal that reasoning models are a lot easier to build than people thought. The company has closed the lead on the world\u2019s very top labs. The news kicked competitors everywhere into gear. This week, the Chinese tech giant Alibaba announced a new version of its large language model Qwen and the Allen Institute for AI (AI2), a top US nonprofit lab, announced an update to its large language model Tulu. Both claim that their latest models beat DeepSeek\u2019s equivalent. Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, called R1 impressive\u2014for the price\u2014but hit back with a bullish promise: \u201cWe will obviously deliver much better models.\u201d OpenAI then pushed out ChatGPT Gov, a version of its chatbot tailored to the security needs of US government agencies, in an apparent nod to concerns that DeepSeek\u2019s app was sending data to China. There\u2019s more to come. DeepSeek has suddenly become the company to beat. What exactly did it do to rattle the tech world so fully? Is the hype justified? And what can we learn from the buzz about what\u2019s coming next? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s start by unpacking how large language models are trained. There are two main stages, known as pretraining and post-training. Pretraining is the stage most people talk about. In this process, billions of documents\u2014huge numbers of websites, books, code repositories, and more\u2014are fed into a neural network over and over again until it learns to generate text that looks like its source material, one word at a time. What you end up with is known as a base model. Pretraining is where most of the work happens, and it can cost huge amounts of money. But as Andrej Karpathy, a cofounder of OpenAI and former head of AI at Tesla, noted in a talk at Microsoft Build last year: \u201cBase models are not assistants. They just want to complete internet documents.\u201d Turning a large language model into a useful tool takes a number of extra steps. This is the post-training stage, where the model learns to do specific tasks like answer questions (or answer questions step by step, as with OpenAI\u2019s o3 and DeepSeek\u2019s R1). The way this has been done for the last few years is to take a base model and train it to mimic examples of question-answer pairs provided by armies of human testers. This step is known as supervised fine-tuning.\u00a0 OpenAI then pioneered yet another step, in which sample answers from the model are scored\u2014again by human testers\u2014and those scores used to train the model to produce future answers more like those that score well and less like those that don\u2019t. This technique, known as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), is what makes chatbots like ChatGPT so slick. RLHF is now used across the industry. But those post-training steps take time. What DeepSeek has shown is that you can get the same results without using people at all\u2014at least most of the time. DeepSeek replaces supervised fine-tuning and RLHF with a reinforcement-learning step that is fully automated. Instead of using human feedback to steer its models, the firm uses feedback scores produced by a computer. \u201cSkipping or cutting down on human feedback\u2014that\u2019s a big thing,\u201d says Itamar Friedman, a former research director at Alibaba and now cofounder and CEO of Qodo, an AI coding startup based in Israel. \u201cYou\u2019re almost completely training models without humans needing to do the labor.\u201d The downside of this approach is that computers are good at scoring answers to questions about math and code but not very good at scoring answers to open-ended or more subjective questions. That\u2019s why R1 performs especially well on math and code tests. To train its models to answer a wider range of non-math questions or perform creative tasks, DeepSeek still has to ask people to provide the feedback.\u00a0 But even that is cheaper in China. \u201cRelative to Western markets, the cost to create high-quality data is lower in China and there is a larger talent pool with university qualifications in math, programming, or engineering fields,\u201d says Si Chen, a vice president at the Australian AI firm Appen and a former head of strategy at both Amazon Web Services China and the Chinese tech giant Tencent.\u00a0 DeepSeek used this approach to build a base model, called V3, that rivals OpenAI\u2019s flagship model GPT-4o. The firm released V3 a month ago. Last week\u2019s R1, the new model that matches OpenAI\u2019s o1, was built on top of V3.\u00a0 To build R1, DeepSeek took V3 and ran its reinforcement-learning loop over and over again. In 2016 Google DeepMind showed that this kind of automated trial-and-error approach, with no human input, could take a board-game-playing model that made random moves and train it to beat grand masters. DeepSeek does something similar with large language models: Potential answers are treated as possible moves in a game.\u00a0 To start with, the model did not produce answers that worked through a question step by step, as DeepSeek wanted. But by scoring the model\u2019s sample answers automatically, the training process nudged it bit by bit toward the desired behavior.\u00a0 Eventually, DeepSeek produced a model that performed well on a number of benchmarks. But this model, called R1-Zero, gave answers that were hard to read and were written in a mix of multiple languages. To give it one last tweak, DeepSeek seeded the reinforcement-learning process with a small data set of example responses provided by people. Training R1-Zero on those produced the model that DeepSeek named R1.\u00a0 There\u2019s more. To make its use of reinforcement learning as efficient as possible, DeepSeek has also developed a new algorithm called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It first used GRPO a year ago, to build a model called DeepSeekMath.\u00a0 We\u2019ll skip the details\u2014you just need to know that reinforcement learning involves calculating a score to determine whether a potential move is good or bad. Many existing reinforcement-learning techniques require a whole separate model to make this calculation. In the case of large language models, that means a second model that could be as expensive to build and run as the first. Instead of using a second model to predict a score, GRPO just makes an educated guess. It\u2019s cheap, but still accurate enough to work.\u00a0\u00a0 DeepSeek\u2019s use of reinforcement learning is the main innovation that the company describes in its R1 paper. But DeepSeek is not the only firm experimenting with this technique. Two weeks before R1 dropped, a team at Microsoft Asia announced a model called rStar-Math, which was trained in a similar way. \u201cIt has similarly huge leaps in performance,\u201d says Matt Zeiler, founder and CEO of the AI firm Clarifai. AI2\u2019s Tulu was also built using efficient reinforcement-learning techniques (but on top of, not instead of, human-led steps like supervised fine-tuning and RLHF). And the US firm Hugging Face is racing to replicate R1 with OpenR1, a clone of DeepSeek\u2019s model that Hugging Face hopes will expose even more of the ingredients in R1\u2019s special sauce. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s an open secret that top firms like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic may already be using their own versions of DeepSeek\u2019s approach to train their new generation of models. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re doing almost the exact same thing, but they\u2019ll have their own flavor of it,\u201d says\u00a0Zeiler.\u00a0 But DeepSeek has more than one trick up its sleeve. It trained its base model V3 to do something called multi-token prediction, where the model learns to predict a string of words at once instead of one at a time. This training is cheaper and turns out to boost accuracy as well. \u201cIf you think about how you speak, when you\u2019re halfway through a sentence, you know what the rest of the sentence is going to be,\u201d says Zeiler. \u201cThese models should be capable of that too.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 It has also found cheaper ways to create large data sets. To train last year\u2019s model, DeepSeekMath, it took a free data set called Common Crawl\u2014a huge number of documents scraped from the internet\u2014and used an automated process to extract just the documents that included math problems. This was far cheaper than building a new data set of math problems by hand. It was also more effective: Common Crawl includes a lot more math than any other specialist math data set that\u2019s available.\u00a0 And on the hardware side, DeepSeek has found new ways to juice old chips, allowing it to train top-tier models without coughing up for the latest hardware on the market. Half their innovation comes from straight engineering, says Zeiler: \u201cThey definitely have some really, really good GPU engineers on that team.\u201d Nvidia provides software called CUDA that engineers use to tweak the settings of their chips. But DeepSeek bypassed this code using assembler, a programming language that talks to the hardware itself, to go far beyond what Nvidia offers out of the box. \u201cThat\u2019s as hardcore as it gets in optimizing these things,\u201d says Zeiler. \u201cYou can do it, but basically it\u2019s so difficult that nobody does.\u201d DeepSeek\u2019s string of innovations on multiple models is impressive. But it also shows that the firm\u2019s claim to have spent less than $6 million to train V3 is not the whole story. R1 and V3 were built on a stack of existing tech. \u201cMaybe the very last step\u2014the last click of the button\u2014cost them $6 million, but the research that led up to that probably cost 10 times as much, if not more,\u201d says Friedman. And in a blog post that cut through a lot of the hype, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei pointed out that DeepSeek probably has around $1 billion worth of chips, an estimate based on reports that the firm in fact used 50,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs.\u00a0 But why now? There are hundreds of startups around the world trying to build the next big thing. Why have we seen a string of reasoning models like OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3, Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and now R1 appear within weeks of each other?\u00a0 The answer is that the base models\u2014GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, V3\u2014are all now good enough to have reasoning-like behavior coaxed out of them. \u201cWhat R1 shows is that with a strong enough base model, reinforcement learning is sufficient to elicit reasoning from a language model without any human supervision,\u201d says Lewis Tunstall, a scientist at Hugging Face. In other words, top US firms may have figured out how to do it but were keeping quiet. \u201cIt seems that there\u2019s a clever way of taking your base model, your pretrained model, and turning it into a much more capable reasoning model,\u201d says Zeiler. \u201cAnd up to this point, the procedure that was required for converting a pretrained model into a reasoning model wasn\u2019t well known. It wasn\u2019t public.\u201d What\u2019s different about R1 is that DeepSeek published how they did it. \u201cAnd it turns out that it\u2019s not that expensive a process,\u201d says Zeiler. \u201cThe hard part is getting that pretrained model in the first place.\u201d As Karpathy revealed at Microsoft Build last year, pretraining a model represents 99% of the work and most of the cost.\u00a0 If building reasoning models is not as hard as people thought, we can expect a proliferation of free models that are far more capable than we\u2019ve yet seen. With the know-how out in the open, Friedman thinks, there will be more collaboration between small companies, blunting the edge that the biggest companies have enjoyed. \u201cI think this could be a monumental moment,\u201d he says.\u00a0  Despite fewer clicks, copyright fights, and sometimes iffy answers, AI could unlock new ways to summon all the world\u2019s knowledge. With a new reasoning model that matches the performance of ChatGPT o1, DeepSeek managed to turn restrictions into innovation. A string of startups are racing to build models that can produce better and better software. They claim it\u2019s the shortest path to AGI.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"     The company plans to use its Model Y and Model 3 cars until its Cybercab launches in 2027.    Tesla CEO Elon Musk said unsupervised Teslas would be driving around Austin by June but that the rollout would be slow.\u00a0 Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors last year that the company\u00a0was aiming for a 2025 launch of its self-driving service in California and Texas. The company appears to be on track to hit that target. Musk said during Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday that the automaker is on pace to launch its self-driving service as early as June 2025, with Austin, Texas, as the test market.\u00a0 \"We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, full self-driving in Austin in June,\" Musk said. \"We already have Teslas operating autonomously unsupervised, full self-driving at our factory in Fremont, and we'll soon be doing that at our factory in Texas.\" A representative for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. News that Tesla was working with Austin to gain the city's regulatory approval first appeared in emails obtained by Bloomberg in December, but Tesla had not yet chosen Austin as the launch city as the company was attempting to gain regulatory approval.\u00a0 Musk was light on details, stating only that there were \"thousands of cars\" driving around the company's Fremont factory in California \"with no one in them.\" He did say that the company was prepared to launch its unsupervised Full Self-Driving tech \"in many regions of the US\" by the end of the year, with the first markets most likely being California and Texas.\u00a0 The original expectation was that Tesla would use its long-awaited Cybercab. However, the company instead plans to use its Model Y and Model 3 cars until the Cybercab launches in 2027.\u00a0 \"So, in conclusion, 2025 is a really pivotal year for Tesla,\" Musk said. \"I think we may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history.\" Musk stressed that Tesla was going to take its time with the rollout.\u00a0 \"We just want to put our toe in the water, make sure everything is OK, then put a few more toes in the water, then put a foot in the water with (the) safety of the general public\u2026 and those in the car as our top priority,\" he said.\u00a0 Tesla's emphasis on safety comes amid a rough couple of years for self-driving taxi services. While the statistics show that self-driving cars are safer in general than human drivers, it hasn't stopped accidents from making the news.\u00a0 California pulled Cruise driverless cars off the road in 2023 due to safety concerns, and Waymo made the news in early 2024 after two of its autonomous vehicles hit the same pickup truck as it was being towed two times in the same day.\u00a0 According to Musk, Tesla's AI won't use high-precision local maps like most autonomous driving tech. Instead, Teslas will use AI that will analyze the road and make decisions as it drives. Thus, while it can drive anywhere, Austin will serve as the test market to make sure that the cars can drive without issues before they spread to other regions. Tesla anticipates a wider launch shortly after Austin, provided there are no issues.\u00a0","label":0}
{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"OpenAI could double its market valuation through another round of funding, valuing the AI firm at $340 billion.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  After raising $6.6 billion through a round of funding from investors, including Microsoft, NVIDIA, Thrive Capital, SoftBank, and more, to evade bankruptcy with projections of making a $5 billion loss within 12 months, OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise $40 billion through another round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $340 billion (via The Wall Street Journal). According to unnamed sources, SoftBank is slated to lead the funding round with a stake of between $15 billion and $25 billion in the ChatGPT maker. Interestingly, this would dethrone Microsoft as OpenAI's largest investor, passing on the crown to SoftBank. If OpenAI's funding round negotiations pull through, the AI firm could double its market valuation from October's $157 billion to $340 billion. A portion of the capital raised during the funding round will be reportedly channeled to OpenAI's $500 billion bet on the Stargate project to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States to bolster its AI advances amid emerging completion from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. OpenAI is already under immense pressure from investors to evolve into a for-profit entity. Former OpenAI co-founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk filed two lawsuits against CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI, citing a stark betrayal of its founding mission and alleged involvement in racketeering activities. Musk claimed he was lured to invest in the AI firm with a fake humanitarian mission. Market analysts and experts predict OpenAI could be susceptible to outsider interference and hostile takeovers if it fails to meet the for-profit threshold within two years. This would require it to reimburse investors for funds raised to keep its operations afloat. More concerning, analysts predict Microsoft could acquire OpenAI within three years as investor interest in the AI bubble fades and partnership frays. Despite OpenAI's milestones and uncontested 2-year lead in the AI landscape, the ChatGPT maker could make $44 billion in losses before potentially becoming profitable in 2029. Some of the losses are attributed to the cost of training and running advanced AI models, employee salaries, data, and Microsoft tie-up, which reportedly gets a 20% cut of OpenAI's revenue.

By force? Yes, Apple simply wants the money to continue and they do nothing for the end user to get this.  It's not clear how Apple is the enemy here nor is the case about t  What's really silly is that they're not selling anything other than a default.  The user can switch search engines in seconds if they want to.  The vast majority don't.  If there were an alternative that were clearly better, presumably they would, so Apple is getting money for doing something that has no obvious downside for its users. I kind of think that the U.S. government is being a bunch of trolls here, going after big companies for being big, rather than for actual anticompetitive actions.  I can think    Yes, Apple simply wants the money to continue and they do nothing for the end user to get this.  Apple actually does do a thing for the end user to get this.  Apple provides iPhone OS upgrades free of charge, for example the upgrade to iOS 18 from iOS17 that would traditionally cost several hundreds of dollars.   This is an extra $400 or so every 2 years you are not having to pay to Apple. For example, when Windows XP was released - buying the upgrade from Windows 98 SE to XP Pro cost $199 retail.     In today Why are you comparing a desktop OS cost to a phone OS cost? One of these things is not like the other. What is the price for an Android update, anyone know? Lol. Here an article for you: https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/life...  [express.co.uk]  So yeah, your argument falls apart, on it's face. The end user is getting NOTHING from Apple for this default placement option. It is JUST free money for Apple, with no benefit to Apple's customers.   Why are you comparing a desktop OS cost to a phone OS cost? One of these things is not like the other.  Because they are comparable.  Heck  Ios18 is a much larger more complicated piece of development than the upgrade from 98 to XP was.  What is the price for an Android update, anyone know? Lol.  The price of a new phone.    The price of an Android major version upgrade is the price of a new phone on average.The cost of the OS upgrade depends on how capable the hardware you choose to run it on - a device with muc That might be the outcome,  but Apple should still be granted this motion.   They are obviously a seriously impacted party,  so they should be able to get party status in the case. Honestly.. $20 Billion is probably a very reasonable price for the privilege of being top default search engine for iOS.    And Apple is not a competitor in the search engine space.  So they have need to be able to charge a fair price for the placement;   However,   they should probably be putting it out for a competitive bid,  an  I find it ironic that mega-corporation #2 wants to plead its case that mega-corporation #1 should not be broken up without their input. Yes, Apple you may have to have separate deals with different \"new\" entities but contractually those previous obligations should more or less continue forward. When AT&T was broken up people could still make phone calls, you could get your phone fixed, and leased lines still worked but you had new RBOCs [wikipedia.org] to deal with; you just didn't have to pay $5000\/mo. for a 4800 baud full-duplex modem anymore and it didn't cost $100 to call your grandma on her birthday. Will there be disruption to Apple's revenue stream? Possibly. Will they have to pay more because what Google agreed to may be set aside? Possibly. The court will consider your petition, but that doesn't mean  Apple will get what they want. Personally, I believe mega-corporation #1 petitioning for a role in the proceedings is exactly why Google's breakup is a good thing. I'm sure deep in the DOJ Antitrust division there's somebody cooking something up for MGC1, MGC2, etc. They know they're next whenever we get a regulatory body interested in antitrust action again.  They don't like further precedent of the federal government telling them what they can and cannot do in their business. It should shock absolutely nobody that Apple is trying to pump the brakes here. This is not about Google being broken up.  This is about Apple being able to charge Google $20Bil to make google the default engine in Safari.  Apple _could_ do that for free if they wanted, at least in the US. It doesn't matter, did you not think a Muli-Billion dollar company wouldn't protect a $20B revenue stream. Google and Apple have existing agreements, those will change and frankly if I were the judge I'd tell Apple to fuck off. This is precisely why there's an anti-trust case to begin with! mega-corporation #1 enters agreement with mega-corporation #2 to block third parties, like mega-corporation #3 from being the default \"X\" on their platform. That is an anti-competitive practice and it needs to stop.   mega-corporation #1 enters agreement with mega-corporation #2 to block third parties  Except they didn't block 3rd parties;  it's just an advertising slot and a privilege of setting the default behavior.    Presumably any other search engine can have offered them a similar price, and Apple would be willing to do it.     The other search engines probably just don't care enough about being the default to bid an amount competitive with Google. Google outcompeting everyone to establish a favorable deal is Not anti Apple's claim of \"clear and substantial irreparable harm\" is obvious.  If $20 billion of extremely high-margin profit is subtracted from their $93 billion annual post-tax profit, there would be \"clear and substantial irreparable harm\" to AAPL stock.  The shock to AAPL would go far beyond this week's shock to NVDA and would certainly harm greatly all AAPL executive stock bonuses.  Whether this harm also applies to Apple product users is less clear. If we are actually trust-busting tech giants then Apple shouldn't worry about being left out; they'll get their turn in court soon enough. You didn't have to beg.https:\/\/letmegooglethat.com\/?q... [letmegooglethat.com] The highly peculiar situation here is that in an antitrust action brought against Alphabet, they might end up being told by the court to find a less \"anticompetitive\" way of spending that $20 billion a year, rather than simply continuing to siphon it all towards Apple year after year. In such a scenario, Alphabet isn't really being punished per se... rather, this would be an unheard of opportunity to break contract with Apple without any significant adverse repercussions... because the default settings have  It seems to risk their bottom line.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  DeepSeek may not have triggered a sell-off panic for Apple, but the iPhone maker has another China headache.          While Apple avoided the pummelling handed to its Silicon Valley peers this week by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, the company had its own China-related problems on Thursday as it reported an 11% year-on-year drop in revenue in the country to $18.5 billion.               The slide in last quarter's sales is a sign of deepening struggles for Apple in its most important international market \u2014 and is raising concerns among some investors and analysts who had forecast better results.               In its last financial year, Apple's net sales in Greater China decreased 7.7% from $72.5 billion the previous year. The year before that, net sales decreased by 2.2%. Understanding if the decline can be stopped is now key for Apple watchers.               During Thursday's earnings call, CEO Tim Cook took the 11% China decline head-on by explaining that \"over half of the decline\" was driven by changes in \"channel inventory.\"               He also had another explanation. \"It's the most competitive market in the world,\" Cook said.               That competition has been a particular threat to Apple's smartphone sales in China, where domestic companies such as Huawei and Xiaomi have been enticing consumers with 5G-enabled devices that now appear to rival the capabilities of iPhones.       Figures from research firm Counterpoint show that in the last three months of 2024, Apple's smartphone sales fell 18.2%, while Huawei's grew by 15.5% as it was boosted by the launch of its latest high-end smartphone series, the Mate 70.           In a research note after Thursday's earnings, Logan Purk, senior analyst at Edward Jones, said that \"sales in China were weak and will remain a point of debate among investors,\" particularly as Apple contends with \"fierce competition in China for 5G phones.\"               That said, analysts also see an opportunity for Apple to counter the competition later this year once it rolls out one of its biggest bets to China: Apple Intelligence.           The tech giant's generative AI features, unveiled in June last year, are yet to be rolled out in China and are seen as a key driver of a huge upgrade cycle in iPhones in the future.               Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said in a note on Friday that his firm expects growth to \"markedly rebound\" in China to \"double-digits\" year-on-year starting in the June quarter, with the \"anticipated April rollout\" of the Apple Intelligence in the country.                His confidence was boosted by the fact that \"markets where Apple Intelligence was available\" saw clear year-on-year performance \"outpace markets without this AI rollout.\"               Still, Apple's AI push in China remains untested, with domestic competitors in the country vying to show local consumers that their technology can match America's best.               Apple will need to show Chinese consumers that iPhones are fit for the AI era.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union. On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing. Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement. Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years. Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain. Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative. This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods. The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU. There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been. Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union. Some suggest only a 6% reduction. We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU. One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones. They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms. It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021. But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government. And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money. The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact. After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries. There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India. But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade. However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence. Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live. There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement. But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020. A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021. Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa). The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents. UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated. The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students. Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour. Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers. British passport holders can no longer use \"EU\/EEA\/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points. People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return. EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa. However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon. In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries. This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit. It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK. The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set. And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries. ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation. Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316. Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise. To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\". According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards. The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws. But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly. In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later. Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant. All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future. And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops. Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law. EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees. A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products. The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels. The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury. The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions. However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20. Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds. Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund. The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country, So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been. The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years. Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates. However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement. After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research. However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists. There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.

Chief Financial Officer Jessica Fischer said on a call with investors Friday morning that the company performed well in light of hurricanes Helene and Milton, which pummeled the southeast US, and the final wind-down of the Covid-era Affordable Connectivity Program that subsidized low-cost internet plans and inflated subscriber numbers. \u201cWe continue to compete well across our footprint,\u201d she said. Charter is fighting competition from the likes of AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc., which are siphoning off home internet subscribers. It\u2019s also battling an industrywide shift by consumers from pay-TV subscriptions to streaming. Charter is the largest cable-TV provider in the US with 12.9 million video customers and 31.5 million customers overall. Cable and telecom companies are moving toward a \u201cconvergence\u201d model, where they offer internet, mobile phone and other services. Charter added 529,000 new mobile lines in the quarter, while rival Comcast Corp. reported 310,000 new wireless lines on Thursday. Fischer noted that Charter\u2019s 2024 full-year revenue was buoyed, in part, by higher mobile-device sales. Comcast\u2019s earnings a day earlier beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for revenue and profit but still reflected subscriber losses in its broadband unit, concerning investors. Comcast shares tumbled 11% on Thursday to their lowest in more than two years, also dragging down Charter\u2019s stock. Charter is planning a major marketing push this year to promote more than 10 streaming services it will offer at no additional cost to customers \u2014 launching an ambitious strategy to head off cancellations and attract new subscribers. It\u2019s also increasing efforts on bundling strategies for internet, voice and video packages that can help curb losses from cable programming customers. In September, it announced a revamped pricing structure that allows customers to pick price-guaranteed bundles, including a $30 internet plan with two mobile lines and Spectrum Video service. On Friday, Chief Executive Officer Christopher Winfrey expressed optimism about the strategy. \u201cWe felt confident enough beginning in late September to start selling video again actively together with our broadband subscriptions as a way to create value and utility in the overall package, not just for video, but really to add value back into the broadband relationship,\u201d he said on the call.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Andrew Kerai, CFA serves as the Chairman of Capital Ideas Inc., a Dallas-based Registered Investment Advisor.   The past couple of years have been one of the strongest periods for the stock market in history. The S&P 500, the most widely followed index of U.S. stocks, was up 25% last year after gaining 26% in 2023. With such strong gains in consecutive years, some financial pundits have recently been warning that stock valuations are now excessively high and that a sell-off must be imminent. I don\u2019t share their pessimism. As of this writing, the S&P 500 is valued at roughly 22 times this year\u2019s forecasted earnings. While this is on the high side historically (historical average of roughly 18x), it\u2019s not approaching levels that I would consider to be excessive. For context, valuation levels reached nearly 40x in early 2000 following the tech bubble of the late 1990s and just before the brutal bear market that kicked off the 21st century. So, while stocks are somewhat richly valued relative to history, I would argue not excessively so. In addition, corporate earnings growth has been showing signs of accelerating in recent quarters, which I expect to continue. Since 2022, profit expansion has been fueled by the largest technology companies, which have delivered high growth rates in their core businesses while quickly monetizing new initiatives across artificial intelligence. Their stock prices have reacted accordingly. Now, we are finally beginning to see meaningful earnings growth across other sectors that had been lagging, such as financial services and consumer discretionary. The broadening and acceleration of corporate profit growth is more reflective of the early middle innings in an economic expansion versus late-cycle behavior, which would precede a recession. Despite this optimism, investors should always be mindful that market pullbacks are a fairly common occurrence. Since 1980, stock market corrections (10% or more declines from the previous high) have taken place, on average, once every 1.2 years. Generally, in my view, trying to time these occurrences with precision is somewhat of a fool\u2019s errand. Building a financial plan and investment strategy that makes sense for your personal circumstances and goals is a much more productive use of time and energy. Implementing the proper strategy is far more important for your long-term financial health than trying to guess the stock market\u2019s next tick higher or lower. History suggests the stock market will move higher over the long run but can, of course, be volatile in the short to medium term. Beginning in the 1960s, the trailing 30-year annualized return for the S&P 500 has ranged from 9.4% to 13.7%, while returns during individual years have been as low as -37.0% and as high as 37.6% (average annual return of 11.8%). In fact, between the end of 1999 and 2010, the stock market produced a negative return. This means that if you would have invested in the S&P 500 at the end of the 1990s and held, you would have been in the red for more than 10 years. While this is a rare occurrence (prior to the early 2000s, the last time the market produced a negative return over a full decade was the Great Depression), it highlights both the importance of implementing a proper investment strategy for your personal goals and risk tolerance as well as the need to take a long-term view. Since the end of 2010, the stock market has increased by almost 5x and produced annualized gains of 13.8%. A properly constructed investment strategy includes a complete and transparent review of your financial goals, needs and risk tolerance. For example, how much cash flow, if any, are you seeking from your portfolio to fund living expenses, and are you anticipating any meaningful withdrawals for the foreseeable future (i.e., a wedding, education expenses, etc.). By first identifying your financial goals, you can then build a portfolio to meet these objectives. Utilizing investment research can be a great tool when selecting the assets to populate the portfolio. This can include analyzing company financial statements before buying a stock, for example. Combining thorough financial planning with investment research is a solid plan to place yourself on strong footing in the years to come. Not trying to \u201ctime the market\u201d should not be confused with investing recklessly, such as buying stocks issued by unprofitable companies at exorbitant valuation levels. Remaining disciplined and rational are the hallmarks of successful investing in any market and the key to building a bright financial future. The talking heads are often promoting their own agendas, and listening to them too much is often counterproductive to these goals, not to mention your mental health.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Mr. Market says sell your Eldritch Knight stock.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Baldur's Gate 3's upcoming deluge of new subclasses is practically as exciting as all the entirely new games we're about to get in February, and we're starting to get reports trickling in from loose-lipped Patch 8 stress testers about how those new subclasses work in action. One thing that really stands out to me among the r\/BG3builds scuttlebut is the complete 180 Eldritch Knights have made. The previously \"just okay\" Fighter subclass is looking to be completely overpowered if Patch 8 goes live as currently structured, but there's reason to believe the interaction making them go crazy will be nerfed before the patch's full release. This new hotness mostly relies on pre-existing mechanics, with the specific implementation of a new spell being what throws things into disarray: In tabletop, Booming Blade uses up your entire action for a round to cast, even if you have Extra Attack or its upgraded variation. In the BG3 Patch 8 stress test though, you can Extra Attack with Booming Blade, which will also trigger Eldritch Knight's War Magic. At higher levels, Booming Blade's BG3 incarnation does at least 1d8 thunder damage according to a screenshot from user _Veni_Vidi_Vigo\u2060\u2014if tabletop progression holds, that should be up to 2d8 damage by the end of the game. That means Eldritch Knights get the equivalent of Paladin's first level Divine Smite without expending any resources, while also getting a crispy four attacks per round before adding in effects like Haste\u2060\u2014that's a level of attacks per round usually reserved for specific dual wielding builds. This would certainly be a fun build to run, but it just seems way too good, like \"homebrew cheat mod\" good. As it stands currently, Eldritch Knight would be a tank and damage dealer that completely outclasses everything else in the game, with no sacrifice, drawbacks, planning, or equipment restrictions. Add in a one level dip of the new Hexblade subclass and you're also an effective party face too. PCG staff writer Harvey Randall and I both agree this doesn't seem to be working as intended, and a number of fellow traveler BG3 build sickos on the subreddit have made similar arguments. Ideally, Booming Blade would be a full-round, no Extra Attack action like most other spells in the game, cutting back the Eldritch Knight's War Magic barrage to a more sensible two attacks. In tabletop, the new Bladesinging subclass is able to cast a single cantrip per round in place of an Extra Attack, and that's a mechanic I wouldn't mind seeing implemented alongside a general Booming Blade-Extra Attack nerf\u2060\u2014the Bladesinger would be limited to one Booming Blade and one attack per round, similar to a nerfed Eldritch Knight, and this could add some zest and synergies to an interesting, but not overwhelmingly powerful subclass. In the base game, Eldritch Knight is a perfectly fine, replacement level subclass. There are better ways to build a spellsword, while the Fighter's other subclasses largely outclass it. The notable exception is that Eldritch Knights can form the basis of good throwing weapon builds, thanks to their Weapon Bond ability making any thrown weapon return to them. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even in the \"worst case scenario\" though, an unbalanced uber build in a singleplayer game isn't the end of the world\u2060\u2014it'll just require a little extra discipline for players not to optimize the fun and variety out of Baldur's Gate 3.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"An expert has been accused of signing off fire safety certificates for flats in high-rise blocks using the credentials and signature of another engineer without permission, the BBC has been told. Adam Kiziak has been under investigation for potential malpractice by the Institution of Fire Engineers (IFE) - which suspended him in August 2024. However, Mr Kiziak's company is understood to have continued to sign off safety certificates since then. Lenders, including NatWest and Nationwide, are now withdrawing mortgage offers to people hoping to buy flats with fire safety certificates issued by Mr Kiziak's company, Tri Fire. Mr Kiziak's lawyer told the BBC: \"Any allegation of fraudulent activity is strenuously denied.\" Tri Fire carries out safety surveys and issues fire safety certificates for flats in high-rise blocks across the UK. These certificates, known as EWS1s, were introduced in 2019 after the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people. The form rates the fire risk of a building based on its overall construction and an assessment of any cladding. The majority of banks and building societies require EWS1 certificates when deciding whether to lend money on flats in apartment blocks. There is no official register of EWS1 certificates, but analysis by the Building Safety Register has found 410 of the 1,139 EWS1s signed off between March 2020 and the end of 2021 were issued by Tri Fire. Mr Kiziak, who is still allowed to work, can't sign off safety certificates while he is suspended by the IFE. Awwal Salisu, a qualified fire engineer based in Saudi Arabia, told the BBC he entered into an agreement with Tri Fire via a recruitment agency to assess up to 100 buildings. He believes Mr Kiziak used his signature without his knowledge to allow him to continue issuing safety certificates. In the majority of cases, Mr Salisu alleges there was insufficient information to be able to issue safety certificates and returned the forms to Mr Kiziak's company for further work. But the BBC has seen a number of EWS1 forms carrying Mr Salisu's signature and using his IFE membership number, which Mr Salisu says were not among the 100 he was asked to review and which he knew nothing about. \"I am very angry about it,\" says Mr Salisu. \"I've had sleepless nights - my reputation is at stake.\" Mr Salisu says he uses a unique electronic signature on documents that can be traced back to him using the IP address on his laptop He added: \"The one good thing about all of this is every report that is submitted with my initials, none of them will actually have my electronic signature.\" He has written to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the IFE and UK Finance - which oversees the mortgage lending market - to alert them to what he believes has happened. Some major lenders say that they have now stopped offering mortgages on homes signed off as safe by Mr Kiziak, leaving buyers in limbo. First-time buyer Sam Ireland told the BBC his mortgage offer was retracted when his lender discovered the fire safety assessment of the property he hoped to buy had been issued by Tri Fire. \"You feel completely powerless,\" says Sam, who now has to start looking for another flat to buy and arrange another mortgage. \"It's just scuppered the whole thing.\" The BBC has also learned of other people whose applications have been rejected by other lenders where Mr Kiziak's firm was involved. Mr Kiziak's lawyer told the BBC they were unable to offer any further detail as there is a pending investigation, but added their client was \"very sorry for any distress and the difficulties that the current situation may have caused\". The IFE declined to comment further while its investigation is ongoing. The government recently announced plans to speed up the process of getting the thousands of tower blocks with flammable cladding and fire safety defects fixed. A Freedom of Information request by Construction News found more than 60 blocks accepted into the government's taxpayer-funded Cladding Safety Scheme had been carried out by Tri Fire, throwing into doubt if they have been correctly assessed.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock rose on Friday after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its new painkiller, the first of its kind approved by regulators.  Journavx, or suzetrigine, was approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe acute pain, which is usually caused by surgery, illness, or painful medical procedures. More than 80 million people are prescribed medicine for acute pain every year, according to Vertex. The company said Journavx is the only approved non-opioid painkiller and the first new class of pain medicine approved in more than two decades. Its approval comes after years of research and attempts at developing similar drugs, as well as the opioid crisis. An estimated 81,806 people died from opioid-related overdoses in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control. \u201cWith the approval of Journavax, a non-opioid, pain signal inhibitor and the first new class of pain medicine approved in more than 20 years, we have the opportunity to change the paradigm of acute pain management and establish a new standard of care,\u201d Vertex CEO Reshma Kewalramani said in a statement. Vertex stock climbed almost 5% in trading on Friday. Year-to-date, the stock\u00a0has increased by more than 13%. The FDA has approved Journavax to be taken twice per day for adults, with Vertex noting that it\u2019s not known whether or not the painkiller is safe for children. Vertex said it had established a wholesale acquisition cost of $15.50 per 50-milligram pill.  While speaking at the 2025 J.P. Morgan (JPM) Healthcare Conference earlier this month, Vertex confirmed it is \u201claunch ready,\u201d with plans to begin selling the drug as soon as it secured FDA approval, according to Fierce Pharma. Vertex has said it expects suzetrigine to benefit from the Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation Act, which seeks to expand access to non-opioid treatment. William Blair analysts led by Myles Minter said in a Friday note that the FDA\u2019s approval is a \u201clarge win for Vertex,\u201d but Journavx remains more expensive than generic opioids, which can go for about 50 cents per pill. They expect the painkiller to achieve \u201cblockbuster status,\u201d reaching $1 billion in sales by 2028 and peaking at roughly $4.9 billion in 2031.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"CANADA - 2025\/01\/24: In this photo illustration, the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) AMD stock has declined by almost 5% over the last five trading days. The stock also remains down by about 19% since the start of 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500 has gained about 27% since early 2024. A couple of factors have driven the recent sell-off. The unveiling of China\u2019s new resource-light AI model, DeepSeek, roiled the U.S. big semiconductor stocks earlier this week. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency and this could reduce the need for GPUs to carry out tasks. In fact, the company claims that it spent just about $5.5 million to train its V3 model, compared to the $100s of millions that the likes of OpenAI were reported to spend. While DeepSeek\u2019s claims haven\u2019t been verified, industry insiders have praised the company\u2019s innovative methods, which appear to reduce the need for AI computing capacity. DeepSeek\u2019s model is open source, and it is possible that many big tech companies could take inspiration from its methods to cut down costs. If adopted widely, this could cool off the demand for AI computing power, potentially impacting GPU demand. Now, although AMD is a distant second behind Nvidia in the GPU race, this could nevertheless impact the company. Separately, an FDA approval helped boost this company. See What\u2019s Happening With VRTX Stock? There are also some concerns on the server CPU space as well. While AMD has been gaining share from market leader Intel over the last few years, Intel\u2019s latest server chips, called the Granite Rapids series, are viewed as being much more compelling. The new chips have a maximum processing core count that is double their predecessors, with tests noting that Intel was largely on par with AMD in terms of performance. While the Intel chips were priced at a premium at launch last year, there have been reports that Intel significantly reduced the listed prices for the chips, with prices on the flagship chips cut by as much as 30%. In fact, the pricing per core of Intel\u2019s top-end Granite Rapids chips is now apparently well below that of AMD\u2019s flagship offerings. The increase in AMD stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, 128% in 2023, and -18% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Despite the recent sell-off, we remain positive on AMD stock. While Nvidia has dominated the AI accelerator market, with its GPUs which have been viewed as the best performing for AI training and inferencing, DeepSeek\u2019s relatively lower computing power requirements could also open the door for other players to compete in the market. This could benefit AMD to an extent. If demand for high-performance GPUs potentially eases, AMD\u2019s more affordable AI accelerators could become a good alternative for companies looking for a more favorable price-to-performance trade-off. Moreover, if the costs of running AI models trend lower, this could drive broader adoption of AI in new use cases, helping semiconductor players in the long-run. Separately, AMD\u2019s expertise with both CPUs and GPUs could put it in a unique position as computer hardware evolves. While traditional CPUs are becoming insufficient due to limits in handling complex, parallel-processing AI workloads, GPUs excel at these AI-driven applications. AMD\u2019s dual expertise allows it to offer a comprehensive solution that integrates both CPU and GPU capabilities, enabling systems to efficiently balance general-purpose processing with accelerated computing tasks. This could give the company an edge, particularly in the PC market. We have a $160 per share valuation for AMD, which is roughly 35% ahead of the current market price. AMD trades at just about 23x consensus 2025 earnings, which we believe is a reasonable multiple given AMD\u2019s sales growth and prospects in the AI market. AMD\u2019s revenues are projected to grow by about 26% by 2025. See our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on what\u2019s driving our price estimate for AMD.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Naomi Girma is set to make her debut in the Women's Super League Manchester United boss Marc Skinner is pleased to see extra investment in the women's game, but believes Chelsea's spending in the January transfer window \"skews the market\". Women's Super League leaders Chelsea signed United States defender Naomi Girma for \u00c2\u00a3900,000, making her the most expensive female footballer in the world. On Friday they confirmed a deal for Barcelona's England midfielder Keira Walsh. United made one permanent signing in the January window, with goalkeeper Kayla Rendell arriving from Women's Championship side Southampton and Skinner said his club are not at the same level as Chelsea when it comes to transfers. \"I am happy the investment has come in,\" said Skinner. \"Does it widen the gap? It definitely skews the market a little bit. \"I don't think Chelsea will be moaning about that because they are in a situation where they can hit those levels of investment. \"For us it's fantastic for the women's game, the growth and development in such a short period of time.  \"But we may potentially see fallouts and how it affects everybody else.\" Chelsea are top of the WSL, seven points clear of United in second. But Skinner said his team will continue to try to bridge the gap on the pitch when spending off it is out of their control. \"It has to make you try harder,\" he added. \"That is the reality. We're not that team. We can't go and spend those types of fees.  \"But what we can do is we can try and recruit smartly, not panic that teams are investing in that kind of way, and really push into our own way of doing it.\" United made a deadline-day offer for England forward Chloe Kelly from rivals Manchester City, but the 27-year-old joined Arsenal on loan late on Thursday. \"If we found the right person and we could make a right deal, then we'd try and do it,\" Skinner said. \"If not, I'm really happy with the forward options we have. Chloe Kelly is an Arsenal player on loan from Manchester City. So it really doesn't affect us now.\" Rate every WSL club's January transfer window Why Chelsea arrival Girma is so good - Asante Getting to know Chelsea's world record signing Girma Former Manchester City captain Steph Houghton said Chelsea's signing of Girma for a women's world record fee is \"a lesson for all the other clubs\" to start investing more. Women's Super League bosses have had their say about whether the league is at risk of becoming less competitive. \"They spend [on one player] what we spend on our squad in an entire year,\" said Everton boss Brian Sorensen. \"So that's a gap, right? They are number one in this country and they are that for a reason.  \"If they have an injury on a good centre-back, they just go out and buy the best one available. Have an injury on a striker last year, and they just go out and buy the best one available. \"That shows commitment to the women's team, so fair play. But I think if you're talking about longer term, making it sustainable and all that, then probably it's going to be hard.\" Leicester boss Amandine Miquel, who previously managed French side Reims for seven years, hopes other clubs take note and up their investment. \"Hopefully we still believe somewhere in life that money doesn't make anything and we have to wake up every day thinking that we can compete against any team and we can continue doing that as long as we can,\" she said. \"It's something we had to live with in France for 12 years with Lyon far ahead, so if that happens it is just going to be an old story for me. When that happens you have to think that second place is the one and that's it. \"It's not ideal but it can also maybe give the other clubs intention to try and build the same thing.\" This video can not be played Being described as best defender in world adds pressure - Girma West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner said a marquee signing like Girma could be the difference in Chelsea winning the Women's Champions League, which would be a good thing for women's football domestically in England. \"It is important to say the money that has been spent on two transfers for two players is more than half of the WSL's whole budget,\" Skinner said.  \"Clubs are aiming to win the Champions League so they have to ensure they have the squad to be able to do that. \"I do think it's about time that an English team won the Champions League. If that happens it grows the game in our country and it benefits everyone.\" Tottenham head coach Robert Vilahamn agreed that while signing a player of Girma's quality made Chelsea even more difficult to beat, it was good for the WSL overall. \"I'm an advocate for raising [the profile of] women's football so if that means clubs show that they want to invest more money in the game, I think it is a good thing for female athletes and for women's football,\" he said. \"If I look at it with those eyes I am happy that it happened because then it might happen even more, and more money might come in which is what we need to make sure we make steps.  \"For trying to beat Chelsea it is more difficult but for the bigger picture it is brilliant.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Six Nations: Italy v Wales - live text commentary FA Cup fourth round: Live text commentary on 10 ties England braced for France's return raid on Twickenham Daisy May Cooper's brilliantly twisted comedy thriller An obsessive friendship, maternal paranoia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and a dead cat Poppy and Rubina talk about the sacrifices they make Is it a good thing, how much is too much and what regrets do they have?

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Apparently, no Chinese breakthrough goes unpunished. It\u2019s been about one week since Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek released its DeepSeek-R1 model that managed to rival the performance of American offerings for a fraction of the cost, and now the rest of the world is looking to put the firm under the microscope. Per the Wall Street Journal, Italy\u2019s data privacy watchdog announced Thursday that it is launching a probe into how DeepSeek is handling user data\u00e2\u0080\u0094an investigation that follows in the footsteps of a number of nations that are cracking down on the company. The Italian Data Protection Authority issued a restraining order against both Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence and Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence, the two Chinese companies behind the ChatGPT rival. The watchdog agency raised concerns over DeepSeek\u2019s failure to disclose what personal information it collects, how it processes that data, and whether or not that information is being stored on servers in China. Access to DeepSeek has been blocked in Italy as the investigation is underway. Italy isn\u2019t the only country with concerns. Taiwan\u2019s digital ministry advised government officials not to use DeepSeek over security concerns including potential data leakage. South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission announced that it plans to question DeepSeek over how it manages the personal information of users. France\u2019s National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties plans to probe the AI firm over data protection practices, while Belgium is looking into potential GDPR violations and Ireland is asking for more details on how DeepSeek handles data. And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a crackdown if America didn\u2019t get involved. Per Reuters, the US Commerce Department is reportedly investigating if DeepSeek has been secretly using American-made chips that are not allowed to be shipped to China. That seems about right, frankly. The rest of the world is looking into privacy issues and America wants to know if this thing is going to hurt the bottom line of its own firms like Nvidia, which saw its stock price take a tumble as soon as word hit the market that you don\u2019t need to spend billions of dollars to make a functional AI model. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will be meeting with Trump in Washington, D.C. Friday, and the two will surely discuss ways to protect the company\u2019s profits from foreign threats like DeepSeek. There is good reason to have concerns over DeepSeek\u2019s data privacy practices\u00e2\u0080\u0094as there are with basically every firm that wants to get its hands on your information. Security firm Wiz Research recently published a report warning that a database belonging to DeepSeek was left exposed and revealed chat histories and other potentially sensitive information, and Wired reported that the AI app is sending US user data to servers in China. If you\u2019re worried about who is accessing your personal information, it\u2019s probably best to avoid all AI apps, whether they are made by a Chinese firm or otherwise.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  The wave of fintechs building autonomous agents for finance firms designed to do the work of a junior analyst or banker is swelling.          One such startup, Auquan, uses generative AI to automate the time-consuming but ubiquitous task of gathering and processing data and putting that information into a written template, like a due diligence report, an investment committee memo, or a pitch book.       Demand for this kind of technology is heating up in the finance industry, which is often bogged down with manual processes around data management, processing, and analysis. Since launching in October 2023, Auquan has brought in close to $2 million in annual recurring revenue and secured UBS, T. Rowe Price, and Blue Owl Capital as customers, according to CEO and cofounder, Chandini Jain.               From banking to software engineering to research, finance firms are keen to implement AI assistants that can carry out multi-step processes. While it's still too early to tell just how much the technology will impact adopters' bottom lines, venture-capital investors are writing checks to get in on the ground floor of what some industry leaders are calling a revolutionary technology.               In addition to scoring big-name clients and its revenue stream last year, Auquan also closed $8 million in seed funding. The round was led by Peak XV and included Neotribe Ventures.               Auquan has made inroads with various divisions at financial firms, from private-market investing to investment banking, as well as risk and compliance, and investor relations, Jain said. Across those functions, it's most heavily used by analysts or associates to produce documents or templates for their MDs, partners, or division heads.               Due-diligence reports are a big use case for Auquan. The startup automates the creation of 3,300 due diligence reports for 20 different clients, saving them a cumulative 55,000 hours of work, according to customer estimates.               Auquan is built to try to mimic the humans whose jobs it is doing, Jain said.               The first step is accessing the raw data. Auquan pulls data from providers, like FactSet, CapIQ, and Pitchbook, as well as public data sets from government agencies and news sites. It can also plug into a client's internal file systems.               The second part involves the user stating an intent with an example, such as \"I want to create an investment committee memo and I want it to come out looking like this template document,\" Jain said. Under the hood, the tech relies on an \"agent super orchestrator\" that breaks down the specific jobs to be done and organizes several \"mini agents\" to take on each of those jobs, Jain said.               In the investment committee memo example, there might be an agent that identifies the fields that need to be filled, another to run searches on underlying vendor data, another that scans public data, and a writing agent that takes all of the info and puts it into a company-specific format based on the template, like if a section should be presented in bullet points or a table. It's exported in the desired interface, such as a PowerPoint presentation or a Google Doc with the proper corporate branding. All of this happens automatically without human intervention, Jain said.               The first draft is presented to the user as a starting point. The user can make edits and tweaks for future documents, she said. The agent super orchestrator will assign new mini agents as needed, she added.               Pricing for Auquan is based on clients' estimated desired outcomes, Jain said. Examples of outcomes are producing one slide deck, one report, or one compliance check. Once the client chooses what workflow to automate, Auquan charges a dollar amount for that outcome, and multiplies it by how many times that process is expected to run, she said.               Jain knows firsthand how labor intensive it is to extract insights from data. Before Auquan, she worked as an analyst at Deutsche Bank and derivatives trader at the Dutch market-maker and proprietary trading firm Optiver, where she was drowning in information with not enough time or help to distill it.               \"If I or anyone on my team could make the case for why we thought any data set would help us make better decisions, we could buy it no questions asked,\" Jain said. \"What we didn't have a lot of was resources or time to go through that information,\" she said.               She would learn from conversations with financial clients that she wasn't alone in that problem. The broad applicability has won over investors.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"POLAND - 2024\/11\/21: In this photo illustration, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals company logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) Vertex Pharmaceuticals stock (NASDAQ: VRTX) is trending higher after the U.S. FDA approved Journavx \u2013 an oral non-opioid pain medication. This is a big win for Vertex, given that Journavx can potentially garner $4 billion in annual peak sales. For perspective, Vertex\u2019s company-wide sales are around $11 billion currently. Journavx comes without the risk of addiction, likely making it a favorable pick for physicians. Journavx is indicated for managing moderate-to-severe acute pain conditions, typically stemming from surgeries, injuries, medical procedures, illnesses, or trauma. According to Vertex, approximately 80 million U.S. patients receive prescriptions annually for medications targeting moderate-to-severe acute pain. Separately, check out recent AI events in Will DeepSeek Help Or Hurt AMD Stock? This development boded well with the investors, evident from a 9% rally in after-market hours on Thursday, January 30. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. VRTX stock has fared well in recent years. It rose 106% from levels of $220 in early 2022 to $450 now. This can be attributed to: Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 revenue growth has been driven by strong uptake in Trikafta\/Kaftrio \u2013 a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis \u2013 amid label expansion and better price realization. Notably, 93% of the company\u2019s total sales are generated by Trikafta\/Kaftrio. Vertex\u2019s Casgevy \u2013 a CRISPR gene-edited cell therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia secured the regulatory approval last year, but it hasn\u2019t contributed much to the company\u2019s top line so far. However, its peak sales are estimated to be over $2 billion. Although Vertex has seen solid sales growth lately, its operating margin has contracted by 1,150 bps from 51.4% in 2021 to 39.9% now. This can be attributed to the company\u2019s increased investments in R&D. For perspective, R&D expenses rose 78% since 2021, versus a 40% rise in sales. With a rise in Trikafta demand, the investors have assigned a higher valuation multiple for VRTX stock. The increase in VRTX stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were -7% in 2021, 32% in 2022, 41% in 2023, and -1% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Looking forward, VRTX stock may continue to see higher levels. At its current levels, VRTX stock is trading at 11.0x trailing revenues, higher than the stock\u2019s average P\/S ratio of 9.2x over the last four years. However, a rise in valuation multiple seems justified, given the uptick in Trikafta sales. Furthermore, the Journavx approval means Vertex can look forward to an even better top-line growth in the coming years. While VRTX stock looks like it may see higher levels, it is helpful to see how Vertex Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Peers fare on metrics that matter.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onJanuary 31, 2025  Update, January 31, 2025 (4:10 PM ET):\u00a0Samsung reached out to\u00a0Android Authority to clarify that it is still standing by its February 7 release date for the Galaxy S25 series. Pre-orders are still open for the phones. Original article, January 31, 2025 (10:49 AM ET): Early this morning a report claimed AT&T might be selling the Galaxy S25 series a week early, starting today. According to\u00a0The Mobile Report, this was based on an alleged email, but AT&T\u2019s own site still said it was coming on February 7, which is the date Samsung announced when retail availability would begin. I decided to stop by my local AT&T store to see if there was anything to this story. Short answer: Yes, it sounds like this is really happening. I walked in and asked the salesperson if they knew \u201cwhen AT&T would carry the Galaxy S25\u201d without hinting that I was aware of the rumors. His response was, \u201cVery soon.\u201d I prodded a bit further, and he admitted sales start immediately for AT&T stores that get their shipments today or for those that already have them. The store in question didn\u2019t have stock yet, but the salesperson said it might arrive as soon as today. Keep in mind this all comes from what I heard in a third-party store and not an official AT&T confirmation, but I\u2019d say it sounds like a safe bet that at least some AT&T stores will offer stock starting today. We\u2019ve reached out to an AT&T rep directly and will update this post when we hear more. As for how much the Galaxy S25 will cost you via AT&T? The base configurations will set you back $799.99 for the Galaxy S25, $999.99 for the Galaxy S25 Plus, and $1,299.99 for the Galaxy S25 Ultra. You can also qualify for a free Galaxy S25 on select AT&T plans for both new and existing customers. Can\u2019t get it in-store and have yet to order online? You can pre-order the Galaxy S25 now from AT&T.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  SoftBank is preparing to lead fresh investment into OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation, Business Insider understands \u2014 a move that would value the ChatGPT maker the same as TikTok owner ByteDance.           The Japanese investment giant is in talks to invest up to $25 billion in OpenAI, the Financial Times first reported.               While SpaceX is the most valuable private company in the world, the funding round could push OpenAI up to second spot alongside Chinese tech giant ByteDance. OpenAI currently ranks as the third-most valuable private tech firm.                Talks between OpenAI and SoftBank are ongoing, which means details around the the round size and valuation are subject to change. If the AI juggernaut hits its target valuation of $300 billion, it would nearly double its current valuation of $157 billion.               SpaceX's valuation is around $350 billion after the Elon Musk-owned company agreed to buy back $1.25 billion worth of stock at $185 a share in December. ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, similarly catapulted its valuation to $300 billion following a buyback offer, offering investors a price of about $180 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported in November.               OpenAI could become one of three companies globally with a centibillion valuation; Stripe and Shein follow suit with valuations of $70 billion and $66 billion, respectively.               Prior to SoftBank's latest investment talks, OpenAI raised nearly $20 billion from investment heavyweights, including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Nvidia.               If SoftBank invests $15 to $20 billion into OpenAI, it would overtake Microsoft \u2014 which has poured around $13 billion into the company so far \u2014 as OpenAI's lead investor.               Such a deal would mark the most significant bet yet on the generative AI boom from SoftBank and form a key part of the wider ambitions of its billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son, to usher in an era of \"artificial super intelligence.\"               Son, who made his original fortune from a timely bet on Alibaba in the dot-com era, has previously spoken about his nonstop use of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and predicted AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans will arrive by the midpoint of the next decade.               A fresh investment from SoftBank would also further deepen its relationship with OpenAI after the companies announced plans last week to form Stargate, a joint venture that aims to spend up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure projects in the US over the next four years.               SoftBank's Son will serve as chairman of the project, which was unveiled at the White House by President Donald Trump. Initial equity funders include Oracle and the UAE's MGX alongside SoftBank and OpenAI. The project will begin deploying $100 billion immediately, according to OpenAI.           It is not yet clear where the companies will source the capital from, with OpenAI currently lossmaking. It has been suggested that SoftBank's\u00a0proposed equity investment could allow OpenAI to invest around $15 billion in Stargate.               SoftBank declined to comment. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.        Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"We\u2019re a short time away from when Apple is expected to reveal the iPhone SE 4. Later in the year the iPhone 17 will debut, which should include an \u201ciPhone Air\u201d for the first time. News about perhaps a more significant new iPhone has now been leaked. The company is close to selecting a key supplier for its next-generation foldable display technology, according to a source tied to Apple\u2019s supply chain. This new display technology is expected to be incorporated into the company\u2019s first foldable iPhone, which will be released in the coming years. This information comes from the Naver blog account \u201cyeux1122\u201d (via MacRumors). The report says would-be suppliers must meet current industry standards for foldable phones. Perhaps more importantly, the supplier is also expected to detail ways to improve durability and provide better crease prevention. Interestingly, some U.S. suppliers are in the mix to provide some components. It would be a massive win for domestic manufacturers if this comes to fruition. Apple is expected to choose a supplier sometime between now and April. Once this happens, the new foldable could finally get past the planning stage. The foldable smartphone market is expected to be worth up to $188.4 billion by 2033, according to Market.US. In 2024, that market was worth about $31.7 billion, so significant growth is expected over the next few years. Samsung, OnePlus, Google, and many others heavily dominate the market. Foldable phones are undoubtedly improving each year. In the past, these models faced issues with hinge mechanisms and screen creases, among others. However, the latest phones, including the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Google Pixel 9 Fold, have significantly advanced in both areas. Undoubtedly, Apple has studied these developments as it gets closer to entering the game. Foldable devices, not just iPhones, could be in Apple\u2019s future. Previous rumors have suggested the company is looking at ways to produce foldable tablets and laptops. A \u201cgiant\u201d iPad could offer \u201ca nearly invisible crease.\u201d The first product could be revealed in as little as two years. I\u2019m eager to see how this story develops. Like many others, I\u2019m looking forward to the release of foldable products bearing the iconic Apple logo. However, I understand that the company won\u2019t launch a product until it is confident in its ability to manufacture it as envisioned. Whether this will take two years, five years, or even longer remains uncertain. Settlement payout from the iPhone 7 class action lawsuit against Apple are starting to roll out. Those who participated in the class action lawsuit have started to receive payments, with amounts varying based on whether you spent any money on repairing the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 7 Plus. Some of the co-applicants in the lawsuit have started to receive around $200 as part payment from the $35 million settlement, 9to5Mac reported. While the payout is less than the maximum of $350 initially approved by the court, it should still feel satisfactory to the appellants. Leica Camera AG is one of the leading camera manufacturers in the world. However, it acknowledges that smartphones serve as the primary cameras for millions of users globally. This is where the all-new Leica LUX Grip for iPhone comes in. The new grip, priced at $329, attaches to your iPhone using MagSafe technology, giving your phone the feel of a traditional camera. It connects via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to work with the Leica LUX app, significantly enhancing its functionality. The idea of a foldable iPhone has floated around the web for a long time, but we have more evidence the device might exist than ever before. Well-known tipster Jukanlosreve shared a post with a huge amount of new information, including the estimated size, release schedule, and much more. The detail that immediately stands out is the thickness. At 9.2mm while folded and 4.6mm when unfolded, the proposed iPhone is only slightly thicker than the Honor Magic V3, the current thinnest foldable on the market. And the second most notable detail is the whopping 12-inch screen. According to the post on X, the internal screen is comparable to two 6.1-inch phones folded together.

And, neither Tim Cook nor Morgan Stanley have any real comment on tariffs by the Trump administration that may or may not materialize, or impact Apple in any real way.\rCook skillfully managed to convince the first Trump administration to make changes to levied tariffs, so Apple wasn't directly impacted by them. It's also clear that Apple's CEO is taking steps to have a good relationship with President Trump, even now in the early days of the second term.\rThe price target increase on Friday is the firm's \"base case.\" A more bullish scenario that Morgan Stanley points out is a possible acceleration in iPhone replacement cycle, with a shift to the higher-end.\rThe bear case would require consumer spending to weaken more than expected, with a deceleration in Services spending by users.

And, neither Tim Cook nor Morgan Stanley have any real comment on tariffs by the Trump administration that may or may not materialize, or impact Apple in any real way.\r Cook skillfully managed to convince the first Trump administration to make changes to levied tariffs, so Apple wasn't directly impacted by them. It's also clear that Apple's CEO is taking steps to have a good relationship with President Trump, even now in the early days of the second term.\r The price target increase on Friday is the firm's \"base case.\" A more bullish scenario that Morgan Stanley points out is a possible acceleration in iPhone replacement cycle, with a shift to the higher-end.\r The bear case would require consumer spending to weaken more than expected, with a deceleration in Services spending by users.

It now seems likely that Apple is gearing up to roll out its next beta, this time designed to offer significant improvements for its voice assistant. Given the market and a decade of patents, it's no surprise that Apple is experimenting with foldable displays that would be used in a future iPhone Fold, iPad, or Mac. Here's what the rumor mill says is coming.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"This story incorporates reporting from \u00a0The New York Times, MSN and MSN.Global stock markets are experiencing turbulence as the deadline for tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump approaches. Companies with international operations are preparing for potential disruptions in trade. The tariffs, part of a broader trade strategy, aim to protect domestic industries but have sparked concerns over strained global trade relations.  Several multinational corporations have already reported possible impacts on their financial forecasts. The manufacturing and technology sectors are expected to face the most significant challenges. Analysts suggest that further escalation in tariffs could lead to reduced investor confidence, affecting market stability. The European Union and China are monitoring the situation closely, given their substantial trade ties with the U.S. The potential for increased tariffs has governments and businesses reconsidering their strategic operations globally. Markets in Europe and Asia have shown mixed reactions, reflecting investor uncertainties over potential economic ramifications. As the deadline looms, financial markets worldwide remain on alert for any developments that might provide clarity or resolution. Both diplomatic and economic strategies are under consideration to mitigate possible fallout from these tariffs. The upcoming days will be critical in determining the course of global trade relations and their impact on stock markets.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Smart locks have made our homes more secure and easy to access in recent years. For a long time, the market felt stagnant, but in the past few years, we\u2019ve seen a few vendors hop on board in a major way. The Ultraloq Bolt is a great option with Apple HomeKit integration, built-in Wi-Fi, and versatile ways to lock and unlock your door. Whether you\u2019re looking for advanced features like fingerprint ID or simple convenience with Siri voice control, the Ultraloq Bolt delivers it all (almost).  \t\t\t\t\tAbode is the best home security system and includes compatibility with HomeKit.\t\t\t\t HomeKit Weekly is a series focused on smart home accessories, automation tips and tricks, and everything to do with Apple\u2019s smart home framework. The Ultraloq Bolt\u2019s integration with Apple HomeKit is my major selling point. Being able to lock or unlock your door using the Home app or Siri is awesome for those who are entirely into the Apple system. HomeKit automations are great\u2014unlock your door, your lights can turn on, your thermostat can adjust, or your favorite playlist can start playing on your HomePod. That said, there\u2019s one feature missing for me:\u00a0Apple Home Key support. The ability to simply tap your iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock the door would\u2019ve taken this lock to the next level, in terms of my opinion. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but if you\u2019re used to the convenience of Home Key on other smart locks, its absence here feels noticeable here. Hopefully, the vendor will consider it for future updates or models because, with Home Key, this lock could go from great to nearly perfect. I underestimated how much I would enjoy the pin code unlock for letting guests in, though. The lock also works with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and other ecosystems, giving you flexibility regardless of your preferred smart home platform or what it might change to in the future With built-in Wi-Fi support (other locks often rely fully on Bluetooth), you don\u2019t need an extra hub to control it remotely or share access codes with family and friends if you aren\u2019t using HomeKit.  \t\t\t\t\tUpgrade your doors with Apple Home Key and the Aqara U50.\t\t\t\t I\u2019ve installed enough smart deadbolts in the past few years to know what I\u2019m doing. It takes only a few minutes to remove your old deadbolt and remount the new one. No wiring or drilling is required. All you\u2019ll need is a Philips head screwdriver. You\u2019ll also need to replace the strike plate on your door. The HomeKit Code is on the inside of the interior piece, and you\u2019ll scan it to onboard it to your HomeKit environment. Once you put it in a room, you can control your lock using the Home app. You can lock, unlock, or add it to automation\/scenes so HomeKit actions can be triggered together. Common ones are your lights coming on when it\u2019s unlocked, etc. Overall, the Ultraloq Bolt is a solid choice for anyone who doesn\u2019t require Home Key support. The fingerprint unlock feature will likely become your go-to option for day-to-day use\u2014it certainly was for me. Installation is straightforward, the build quality feels premium with its zinc construction, and including physical keys adds a backup way to unlock if HomeKit fails to work, etc. Beyond the basics, the Ultraloq Bolt is IP65 weather-resistant rating means it\u2019s built to handle water, dust, heat, and cold, making it reliable in any almost environment. It uses 8 AA batteries, and it\u2019s generally rated to last a year, depending on usage. Add in HomeKit support that works exactly as you\u2019d expect, and it\u2019s a great option for upgrading your home security. If Home Key isn\u2019t a must-have for you, the Ultraloq Bolt is a great smart lock.  \t\t\t\t\tUpgrade your home security with wireless cameras that includes HomeKit compatibility.\t\t\t\t You can buy the ULTRALOQ Bolt with Fingerprint from Amazon.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Apple wants to defend its multi-billion dollar search engine deal with Google, which is in danger because Google has been found guilty of violating antitrust law. Apple has asked the court handling Google's lawsuit with the U.S. government for an emergency stay [PDF], so that Apple has time to intervene and plead its case before a remedy is decided on. The U.S. Department of Justice sued Google for anti-competitve behavior in the search market way back in 2020, and after a lengthy legal battle, the DoJ won. A main component of the lawsuit was Google's deal with Apple, which sees Google pay billions annually to be the default search engine for Safari. The court decided that the agreement between Apple and Google violated antitrust law, and is a major reason Google has been able to maintain its search engine monopoly. The U.S. government asked the court to bar Google from entering into contracts with Apple, among other restrictions, and that will cost Apple a lot of money. In 2022, for example, Google paid Apple $20 billion. Apple already asked the court to allow it to be more involved in the case as remedies are decided on, and the court denied the request due to timing. Apple appealed the decision, and is asking for a stay while the appeal plays out. Apple says that because its deal with Google is at stake, it deserves a right to participate, and without a stay, it will \"suffer clear and substantial irreparable harm.\"  Apple will be unable to participate in discovery and develop evidence in the targeted fashion it has proposed as this litigation progresses toward a final judgment. If Apple's appeal is not resolved until during or after the remedies trial, Apple may well be forced to stand mute at trial, as a mere spectator, while the government pursues an extreme remedy that targets Apple by name and would prohibit any commercial arrangement between Apple and Google for a decade. In addition to prohibiting deals between Apple and Google, the U.S. Department of Justice also has more extreme remedies in mind, including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser and uncoupling Android from other products like Google Search and the Google Play Store. Google has a lot to defend against, and will prioritize Chrome over its deal with Apple. When initially asking to take a larger role in the case, Apple said that Google \"can no longer adequately represent Apple's interests\" because of the wide scope of the case. Unsurprisingly, the DoJ does not want Apple involved in the remedies portion of the trial, which is set to start in April. If the court decides that Google can't pay Apple to be the default search engine on Safari, Apple would still have to offer Google Search as an option in some capacity, but would not be able to continue to collect money for doing so.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rose on Friday after solid earnings from Apple (AAPL) and as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge matched expectations. Investors also braced for a looming tariff deadline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 0.9%, with spirits getting a boost from solid tech earnings. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.3%, both set to build on Thursday's gains. Shares in Apple gained at the opening bell after the megacap posted a first quarter profit beat. While quarterly iPhone and China sales fell short, investors took an upbeat outlook for revenue as a sign of future recovery. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are headed for small weekly losses, thanks to the tech rout sparked by DeepSeek, while the Dow (^DJI) is on track for a gain amid a strong start to earnings season. Meanwhile, a volatile January marked by President Donald Trump's early days in office looks set to bring monthly wins for the major gauges, with the Dow eyeing a jump of over 5%. Trump on Thursday doubled down on a threat to impose a first round of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1. The looming Saturday deadline has revived worries about the impact on the economy from a clampdown on the US's biggest trading partners. Read more: The latest news and updates as Trump's tariff deadline approaches On social media, Trump also warned BRICS countries that they will face 100% tariffs if they replace the dollar with their own joint currency or another. The dollar (DX-Y.NYB) rose, headed for its best week since November. The lack of clarity over tariffs has left Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in wait-and-see mode, with the potential for tariffs to inflame inflation in focus. That put the spotlight on a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index. The \"core\" PCE reading, which strips out food and energy, rose 2.8% year-over-year in December, meeting economist estimates. Wall Street traders continue to wager that the Fed's first rate cut of the year won't arrive until at least June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed prices increased in line with expectations in December as inflation remained above the Fed's 2% target. The \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.2% from the prior month during December, meeting Wall Street's expectations. The reading was higher than 0.1% increase seen in November. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations and unchanged from November. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.6%, a pickup from the 2.4% seen in November. Read more here. One of the biggest losers early Friday were shares of Deckers Outdoor (DECK), the company behind shoe brands UGG and HOKA, which boasts a portfolio of some of the most comfortable footwear around. The stock was down as much as 14% in pre-market trading. Last night, the company said its sales for its fiscal year 2025 \u2014 which is set to end in March \u2014 would rise 15% to $4.9 billion, a slowdown from the 17% growth reported in its third quarter and a slowdown from the 18% growth seen in its fiscal 2024. Deckers stock, one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the last 5 years, closed at a record high on Thursday ahead of the results. That success, however, appears to have caused some of the agita in markets early Friday. As MScience analyst Drake MacFarlane told Reuters, the company's guide \"looks pretty conservative and considering the beat, it's bit of a negative read into the out quarter.\" At Decker's two biggest brands \u2014 HOKA and UGG \u2014 sales rose 23.7% and 16.1%, respectively, in the holiday quarter. Economic calendar: Core PCE index (December); Employment cost index (fourth quarter) Earnings: Charter Communications (CHTR), Chevron (CVX), Colgate (CL), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Markets on edge as Trump's tariff deadline looms Novo Nordisk stock faces tough climb after 40% slump BofA's Hartnett: Big Tech set to become 'Lagnificent 7' Tesla investors doubt Musk's latest robotaxi promise Apple shares pop as earnings beat eclipses iPhone miss Chevron sees Permian Basin oil growth reaching 10% this year Samsung Gets Nvidia\u2019s Nod to Supply Less Advanced AI Memory My award for best 2025 earnings call for an interim CEO award goes to Intel's (INTC) co-interim CEO Michelle Holthaus. \"There are no quick fixes,\" Holthaus started her earnings call with last night. She then followed that with a host of no-BS comments on the state of the chipmaker. I liked it! I wish more execs didn't blow smoke in the face of investors, analysts and media. Then again, everyone knows Intel is in a real bad place right now, so it doesn't hurt to be bluntly honest. Holthaus' comments and those by co-interim CEO David Zinsner on the foundry business (it's not getting out of the cash-draining business, at least this year) suggest Intel is in for another brutal 2025. Cost cuts will make the bottom line feel less brutal, but this is likely a dead money stock until a permanent CEO is announced in the coming months. Tim Cook's bullish comments on Apple Intelligence on a conference call are in large part driving the pre-market bid in Apple (AAPL), based on what I am seeing out there. I can appreciate the enthusiasm on the product and what it may mean to the company's services business. But Apple didn't exactly blow minds with its results. China sales tanking 11% year on year is a big deal. Commentary on China on the call suggest a recovery in the business is a few quarters away. \"While services remain strong and the mix is shifting toward higher margin, our concerns around: 1) lack of a US upgrade cycle; 2) China competition; and 3) an unlikely inflection across all products\/geographies remain,\" Brandon Nispel said in a client note this morning.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Stocks gave up earlier gains Friday as the White House reaffirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to implement some of his long-promised tariffs Saturday, with the market closing out a whirlwind week highlighted by Nvidia\u2019s record-breaking losses in reaction to China\u2019s DeepSeek cheaper AI model and a flurry of earnings reports. Stocks proved resilient this week after Monday's scare. All three major indexes were down for the day, reversing what had been as much as a 0.8% gain for the S&P 500 and a 1.5% rally for the tech-heavy Nasdaq as in-line inflation data Friday morning and Apple\u2019s double earnings beat reported Thursday afternoon helped boost stocks in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 340 points, or 0.8%, by close and the S&P and Nasdaq fell 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The negative turn came after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump intends to enact the 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% tariff on Chinese imports Saturday. Leading the swing were Apple and Nvidia, both Silicon Valley giants with significant dealings in China, as shares of Apple went from as much as a 4% morning gain to a 0.7% daily loss, and Nvidia stock turned what was as much as a 3% gain to a 3.7% daily drop. Nvidia\u2019s slip extended its brutal week, as its market value has tanked $553 billion since last Friday, after DeepSeek\u2019s innovative cheaper AI cast doubt on continued massive spending on Nvidia\u2019s AI processors powering most generative AI technology. Down 16% since Friday, Nvidia lost more market value over the last week than the total market capitalization of Europe\u2019s most valuable public company, Novo Nordisk. Despite Nvidia\u2019s massive losses and a down Friday, this month is a historically strong January for the market, with the Dow up nearly 5% and the S&P almost 3%. That makes it the Dow and S&P\u2019s best January returns since 2019 and the best inauguration month return since January 2013, at the start of former President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. It\u2019s undeniably bizarre for the broader market to advance when Nvidia, which was the world\u2019s most valuable company heading into this week, fell more than 10% this week. \u201cWe expect the greater efficiency from new, lower-cost algorithms to lead to increased economic productivity, which is supportive of the broader equity market,\u201d explained Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s chief investment officer, Americas, in a Friday note. In short, though the market clearly interprets the increased likelihood that Nvidia, and other AI tech producers like Broadcom and Oracle, take future earnings hits from generative AI getting cheaper, better AI can boost the stock market as a whole as companies across the board benefit from AI-powered productivity gains. Constellation Energy was the best-performing stock listed on the S&P, returning 34%, while GE Aerospace (up 22%) and Facebook parent Meta (up 18%) were the best-performing \u201cmega-cap\u201d companies worth at least $200 billion, according to FactSet data. Public utility Edison International was the worst-returner, falling 31%, while Nvidia was the biggest mega-cap loser, dropping 9%. Cruise liner Royal Caribbean and enterprise software firm IBM rose the most, returning 15% and 14%, respectively, while Apple and Meta\u2019s 8% gains led all mega-caps. Nvidia was unsurprisingly the worst-performing company worth at least $150 billion, while delivery service UPS and shoe seller Deckers Brands were the biggest losers overall, falling about 15% apiece.

On the table below are key U.S. equity index returns during each presidential term from 1900\u20132025. This is using the start date as the day of the incoming (or repeating) pres- ident\u2019s inauguration, and the end date when each term ended. The median return for the S&P 500 over a four-year presidential term is 33%. See the DJIA (1900\u20132025), Nasdaq (1973\u2013\u20132025), and Russell 2000 returns below as well.   On an annualized basis and full-term basis, performance above about a 5.5% annualized return is ahead of the overall market return for the past 125 years. The chart below plots the return by presidential term for the DJIA.   The next table shows the S&P 500, and the first year of each term compared to the full term since 1953. Only two presidents, George W. Bush and Richard Nixon posted a less than 10% return for their full term. Overall, the first year does tend to be a decent indication of how the full term will play out, with some exceptions.   Although it is too soon to evaluate groups and stocks since President Trump\u2019s recent inauguration, we can look at what the market has favored since the election results in early November 2024. This week has certainly altered the makeup of the market, so it is an appropriate time to re-evaluate. With regards to market capitalization, larger stocks continued to be favored over small ones with the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF outperforming the Russell 2000 by roughly 360 basis points. Small caps are continuing their trend of underperformance. We will likely need improvement in the domestic economy for this trend to reverse.   With regards to style, growth remains the dominant style in the market with large cap growth stocks outperforming large cap value by a convincing 380 basis points. Much like small cap, value will probably need an acceleration in the domestic economy to take market leadership from growth.   By sector, Consumer areas have fared the best, followed by Transportation, Technology, and Capital Equipment. In particular, Consumer Cyclical, aided by a resilient job environment and continued consumer spending, has led the market. Defensives have continued to lag, along with Basic Materials. It remains to be seen how much the picture will change given the huge selloff in data center and artificial intelligence infrastructure-related names this week.   Also, we would keep in mind that Technology\u2019s performance is stretched versus many sectors since the beginning of 2023 and may be ripe for some reversion with the emergence of DeepSeek, a potential catalyst. The chart below shows how great the Technology outperformance has been, over 40 percentage points versus the S&P 500. While we remain positive on Technology as a whole, there has clearly become more dispersion in the sector, possibly benefiting other areas of the market like Financials, Cyclicals and Health Care.  Source: Panaray    Lastly, diving deeper and examining by subgroup and\/or theme, here are the winners and losers through the first 60 days post-election. Bitcoin is one of the leading themes post-election as is Quantum Computing, Aerospace, Consumer Cyclical and Software. In particular, we are hopeful that Software can be one of the market leaders in 2025. Within Software, cyber security and cloud computing are both areas with strong breadth and should thematically be strong areas of potential investment. Also, leisure and entertainment has good breadth, from cruise line operators and food delivery to movies and music.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":" Tee Higgins is going to get paid a lot of money from a team this offseason, but he's not expected to sign a deal at the very top of the wide-receiver market. Per ESPN's Dan Graziano, the sense from some people around the NFL is that Higgins could sign for a deal worth more than Jaylen Waddle in average annual value and more guaranteed money than DeVonta Smith got on his extension from the Philadelphia Eagles. On the latest episode of The Scoop City podcast (starts at 34:00 mark), The Athletic's Dianna Russini noted that Higgins \"wants to have an answer\" for what's next in his career \"very soon\" and he doesn't want things with the Cincinnati Bengals to drag out into the start of free agency. Waddle signed a three-year, $84.75 million extension ($28.25 million per season) with the Miami Dolphins last offseason. Smith's three-year, $75 million extension with Philadelphia included just under $70 million in guaranteed money. The $28.25 million average annual salary for Waddle ranks seventh among all receivers. Smith's total guaranteed money is the ninth-most among all players at the position. All indications are the Bengals won't pay to keep Higgins when they also have to extend Ja'Marr Chase. General manager Duke Tobin told Kelsey Conway of the Cincinnati Enquirer on Thursday that \"it's going to be hard\" to keep both receivers. \"We feel like we have the resources to do it, but it all depends on how the negotiation goes and whether they're willing to accept wanting to come back at a number that makes sense for everybody.\" Conway reported last offseason that Cincinnati's offer to Higgins \"never approached\" $20 million per season, so the idea the team would suddenly go to $28-29 million annually on a new deal seems hard to fathom. It's not like everyone just became aware that Higgins is good and extremely valuable to the Bengals. He averaged more than 1,000 yards and six touchdowns per season in his first three seasons from 2020 to '22. Joe Burrow spent a lot of time in the final month of the regular season campaigning for the organization to keep Higgins. The Bengals also have to address their defense, which ranked 25th in points allowed this season, if they want to get back to being a top-tier AFC contender in 2025. The door for Higgins to return to Cincinnati next season might still be open, but it could close quickly depending on how talks between the two sides go leading up to the start of free agency on March 12.","label":0}

What is there not to love about this product? It's beyond moisturizing and quite soft as you put it on, like butter. The scent has me perplexed. Not sure that's the correct word to use. I know that scent. It reminds me of something from the '70s or '80s. The scent takes me back, but to where I do not know.

This feels absolutely amazing going on. Gets absorbed quickly, for a lotion rich with oil. Doesn't leave a greasy feeling, as long as you give it a minute or two to fully absorb.

Very relaxing.\" \u2014Dragonheart Jo \"I love everything about this lotion!

I was searching for a sheet set that would help me sleep more comfortably at night and found these. I have terrible hot flashes with night sweats and get up in the morning just miserable. Of course, these do not eliminate my hot flashes as no sheets will, but they definitely make my nights much more comfortable by eliminating wet bedding, and I definitely appreciate that! Aside from their moisture-wicking abilities, they are very soft, easy to look at, and launder extremely well.\u00a0I would highly recommend these for anyone shopping for sheet sets and especially for anyone experiencing night sweats!!\u201d \u2014Shannon Warfel Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$34.95+ (available in sizes Twin\u2014California King, with deep pockets, and in 37 styles).\u00a0 This is designed to work on all hair types, with reviewers with 2b\u20134c curls mentioning it worked for them!\u00a0 Promising review: \"Like many others, I tried this as a replacement for Olaplex. Honestly, Olaplex never had a great effect on my hair and certainly wasn\u2019t worth the price. This did an unreal job on my hair!! I was skeptical (tried a little bit first because I was petrified it would burn off my hair and I would end up bald!) but lo and behold, it was magic! My hair is so strong, silky, and healthy looking after just one use. Plus, you can\u2019t beat the price! Have already ordered another box. I should also add I have curly\/wavy hair that\u2019s been colored to a light brown. Buy it!!\" \u2014BB Check out BuzzFeed's full review of the Elizavecca hair treatment for more deets!

Hello, that is my face above, because I bought into the hype of all the 5-star reviews and now I will never look back!! Putting it on is like giving my eyelashes butterfly wings. It doesn't get clumpy, it stays put ALL the livelong day no matter how much you sweat, and you can apply it on very lightly if you don't want it to look so dramatic, or continue applying for longer lashes each time.  Promising review: \"AWESOME. I\u2019ve always bought overpriced mascara. I\u2019m very picky and hesitant, but I saw some reviews saying how awesome this was. I\u2019ll never go back to 'Better Than Sex' mascara because that\u2019s what I always use, and I\u00a0compare\u00a0it to that. This is the best mascara!! I\u2019ll never go back.\" \u2014patrick hauk Get it from Amazon for $4.99.\u00a0 TBH, I bought this ring after seeing it blow up on TikTok, and I love it. I wear it every single day, and I've gotten SO many compliments on it \u2014 friends are always stunned when I tell them how cheap it is! I've been wearing it for months now without any wear and tear that a quick cleaning won't fix. Pictures don't do it justice; it really does \u2728gleam\u2728 like real jewels.

The fit is perfect, and the material feels incredibly soft and comfortable while providing excellent tummy control.

She\u2019s especially impressed with how it enhances her waistline without feeling restrictive.\" \u2014gurkan Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$37.99+ (available in women's sizes XXS\u20135XL and 11 styles, including shorts and thong style) Promising review: \u201cIf you use St. Tropez tan products or any fake tanner, do yourself a favor and try this. This stuff is AWESOME. Dries quickly, lasts longer, does NOT make your skin stinky, applies evenly, and you get a fair amount of product!! Other tanners I\u2019ve used become VERY noticeable when they start fading. Gross hand lines, patchy white spots, etc., but not this stuff. The best one-hour tan I have ever used!\u201d \u2014Amazon Customer\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $9.97\u00a0(available in 16 styles). Lulu Candles is a US-based small business that specializes in scented candles and perfumes.\u00a0 Promising review: \"This is such a great candle that fills the room quickly with a really nice strong smell that is soothing and relaxing. I was looking for a less expensive Le Labo Santal 33 scent candle and this one is very very close!\u00a0It's a bit stronger, but I love it! The shipment arrived fast, and I just love how fast it fills up the room without being lit for so long!\" \u2014Cristina Bertolotto Get it from Amazon for $19.95+\u00a0(available in three sizes, in gift box options, in packs of two, and in a variety of scents).\u00a0\u00a0 These come with a wireless charging case that provides up to 14 hours of charge (with the earbuds able to play for four-plus hours with each full charge).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I previously had Beats headphones that broke within three months. I bought these to replace my Beats headphones, and will never turn back. These headphones are amazing. They have a very long battery life. I love the case they come with. I use them in the\u00a0gym\u00a0four days a week, and they have not become waterlogged. If you're looking for reliable headphones, I would highly recommend these!\" \u2014Tiffany Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$19.99+\u00a0(available in six colors and two sizes). Promising review: \"I love the ways these layering necklaces look! I haven\u2019t taken them off since I received them and they look brand new still.

These are great blushes and have lots of pigmentation. Very creamy and has a smooth application on the skin! It is a great [alternative] to the\u00a0Rare Beauty blush. It lasted me the whole day and did not melt off. It has a lot of coverage and does not need too much when applying.\" \u2014Harsh Argawal Get it from Amazon for $7.99 (available in 12 shades and in sets).\u00a0 Promising review: \"These feel GREAT against my skin. I love wearing satin because it\u2019s so comfortable, but it\u2019s always a gamble, especially when you buy online. I\u2019ve bought certain satin sleepwear on Amazon that\u2019s too thick for my liking, but these are something else! They\u2019re lightweight, comfortable, and feel\u00a0expensive. Breathable in hot weather but still keeps me warm when cold. I loved them so much I ordered three in different colors!\" \u2014AP Get them from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in women's sizes S\u2013XL and nine colors). I love love love this lip balm. I compare it to the $24 version from Summer Fridays, which I've been splurging on \u2014 I love that brand because it lasts so long and is so high quality, but this $4 E.l.f. version feels comparable and, more excitingly, comes in smaller versions so I can stock my totes and bathroom with them whether I'm at home or on the go. It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I have one in my car, one in my purse, and one at home. These just feel so good on your lips! The flavors are very true to their name. They are pretty small though, so if you use it often it won\u2019t last long (which is another reason I have three of them), but for $4 each it is worth it. I sometimes like using this before putting on the E.l.f. Lip Reviver Oil. Such a great base to an awesome lip oil!\" \u2014Jax Get it from Amazon for $4 (available in five flavors).\u00a0 I have been buying a new set of these every year since 2020, and\u00a0they have kept my VERY blister- and chafing-prone feet snug and moisture-wicked on every single long run. They've essentially phased out any of my other socks, because they're extremely comfortable to boot. As a runner who often clocks in 25+ miles a week and often in some \"yikes!\" summer heat, I cannot recommend these socks enough.\u00a0 Promising review: \"These socks are designed perfectly for\u00a0running\u00a0socks. The bottoms and toes are thick, the tops are thin, the lower heel is reinforced, the heel top has a tab that provides extra cushion on the Achilles where some shoes like to wear into you. The size is true to fit.\u00a0 I've purchased many packs of these and they are the best I've tried.\" \u2014SmokeyBear Get a pack of six from Amazon for $16.95+ (available in nine color combos and sizes S\u2013L). Promising review: \"Expensive isn't always better. I tried this spray before spending the day outdoors in 90-degree heat at Disneyland, and the only place my makeup moved was on the tip of my nose because I have allergies and use a lot of Kleenex. But otherwise, it looked as fresh as it did when I put it on. I\u2019ve used Mac and\u00a0Urban\u00a0Decay\u00a0setting spray, and they never worked as well as this stuff. I am completely amazed. Definitely give it a try.\" \u2014DH Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$9.97\u00a0(also available in dewy and radiant finishes, and a jumbo size). Promising review: \"What can I say, I saw a TikTok about this lipstick, and for $10 had to try it! The reviews are right, for some reason, this lipstick is better than even $20 name-brand ones bought from Ulta. Not only does it smell great, but dries in under a minute and survived eating a cupcake, a Starbucks drink, and an entire evening out, no smudging, and had to be removed with a makeup wipe. Fantastic product!!\" \u2014Claire Get a six-piece set from Amazon for $8.99\u00a0(available in five sets).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I\u2019m obsessed with this hoodie. I\u2019ve been looking for a warm, soft hoodie with a big hood for a long time. This quality is excellent and feels more expensive. It is an oversized fit. I usually wear an XL top and sometimes L. The large fit perfectly! I want one in every color now.\" \u2014LindsayW Get it from Amazon for $29.59+ (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XL and 27 colors).\u00a0 Unlike other hair dryers, this one can be held closer to the roots and scalp for a higher volume and lift, and helps you curl hair at the end while it dries. It comes with three heat settings and is\u00a0designed to work on all hair textures\u00a0\u2014 reviewers with 2a\u20134c hair mentioned it works for them, and especially noted that it\u00a0helps cut down on drying time! Promising reviews:\u00a0\"I've had my eye on a Dyson Airwrap, but given the cost, I figured I'd try this while I save up. This thing is fantastic. I have waist-length hair that's naturally straight, but gets frizzy when damp. I've had salon blowouts that have left my hair looking great, but I simply can't manage a round brush without it getting tangled in my hair. This device has been a game changer. It works best if you air dry for a while before you use it, then use it to finish your style. My hair miraculously doesn't get snarled in it, and it leaves my hair looking like I've had it professionally styled. I love it, and I'm no longer interested in blowing $500 on a Dyson. Highly recommend!\" \u2014Ilsa Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$39.96\u00a0(available in nine colors). Promising review: \"Super comfy. I usually don\u2019t write reviews, I tried this first before buying Lulu, and these are the most comfortable leggings for every day and even for workouts. Highly recommended!\" \u2014Criselle Johnson Get them from Amazon for\u00a0$29\u00a0(available in women's sizes XXS\u2013XXL, two inseams, and 21 styles).\u00a0 Promising review: \"E.l.f. has really stepped up their game lately! I was using Farmacy Makeup Meltaway, and I loved it, but it was very expensive. I decided to try the E.l.f brand because of the price, and it's the exact same thing! For $11, you can't go wrong with this product. I wear waterproof mascara, and this makes removing it super easy! My face feels super clean and hydrated after using this product. The product lasts for a good amount of time, too.\" \u2014Haley McCaulley Get it from Amazon for $5+\u00a0(available in different sizes).\u00a0 Promising review: \"The Fellow Stagg alternative you're looking for. I'll be honest, I was one of those Fellow Stagg cultists and mine broke after some time using it. I'm so glad I checked reviews on Reddit and Amazon, because this thing is amazing. It looks modern and sleek. The temperature controls are accurate and plenty. The boiling speed and 'hold' function are amazing.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Stocks gave up earlier gains Friday as the White House reaffirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to implement some of his long-promised tariffs Saturday, with the market closing out a whirlwind week highlighted by Nvidia\u2019s record-breaking losses in reaction to China\u2019s DeepSeek cheaper AI model and a flurry of earnings reports. Stocks proved resilient this week after Monday's scare. All three major indexes were down for the day, reversing what had been as much as a 0.8% gain for the S&P 500 and a 1.5% rally for the tech-heavy Nasdaq as in-line inflation data Friday morning and Apple\u2019s double earnings beat reported Thursday afternoon helped boost stocks in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 340 points, or 0.8%, by close and the S&P and Nasdaq fell 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively. The negative turn came after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump intends to enact the 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% tariff on Chinese imports Saturday. Leading the swing were Apple and Nvidia, both Silicon Valley giants with significant dealings in China, as shares of Apple went from as much as a 4% morning gain to a 0.7% daily loss, and Nvidia stock turned what was as much as a 3% gain to a 3.7% daily drop. Nvidia\u2019s slip extended its brutal week, as its market value has tanked $553 billion since last Friday, after DeepSeek\u2019s innovative cheaper AI cast doubt on continued massive spending on Nvidia\u2019s AI processors powering most generative AI technology. Down 16% since Friday, Nvidia lost more market value over the last week than the total market capitalization of Europe\u2019s most valuable public company, Novo Nordisk. Despite Nvidia\u2019s massive losses and a down Friday, this month is a historically strong January for the market, with the Dow up nearly 5% and the S&P almost 3%. That makes it the Dow and S&P\u2019s best January returns since 2019 and the best inauguration month return since January 2013, at the start of former President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. It\u2019s undeniably bizarre for the broader market to advance when Nvidia, which was the world\u2019s most valuable company heading into this week, fell more than 10% this week. \u201cWe expect the greater efficiency from new, lower-cost algorithms to lead to increased economic productivity, which is supportive of the broader equity market,\u201d explained Solita Marcelli, UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s chief investment officer, Americas, in a Friday note. In short, though the market clearly interprets the increased likelihood that Nvidia, and other AI tech producers like Broadcom and Oracle, take future earnings hits from generative AI getting cheaper, better AI can boost the stock market as a whole as companies across the board benefit from AI-powered productivity gains. Constellation Energy was the best-performing stock listed on the S&P, returning 34%, while GE Aerospace (up 22%) and Facebook parent Meta (up 18%) were the best-performing \u201cmega-cap\u201d companies worth at least $200 billion, according to FactSet data. Public utility Edison International was the worst-returner, falling 31%, while Nvidia was the biggest mega-cap loser, dropping 9%. Cruise liner Royal Caribbean and enterprise software firm IBM rose the most, returning 15% and 14%, respectively, while Apple and Meta\u2019s 8% gains led all mega-caps. Nvidia was unsurprisingly the worst-performing company worth at least $150 billion, while delivery service UPS and shoe seller Deckers Brands were the biggest losers overall, falling about 15% apiece.

[+] Miami Beach Convention Center on May 19, 2023 in Miami Beach, Florida. (Photo by Jason Koerner\/Getty Images for Bitcoin Magazine) MicroStrategy announced the pricing for a Preferred stock offering on Friday and it is very interesting what it has to pay for this round of raising money to buy more bitcoin. On November 21 last year it raised almost $3 billion with a Convertible Senior Note that paid 0% with a 55% conversion premium. At the time the company\u2019s stock was at $433.80, and the conversion price was $672.40. For this latest round the company is raising approximately $563.4 million with a Preferred Stock that pays 10% with a 194% conversion premium. The stock was at $340.09 when it was priced, and the conversion price is $1,000. It makes sense that the conversion premium is so much higher since it is having to make interest payments but see below about options the company has in making the payments. The company was able to increase the January offering from $250 million to $584 million but it had to raise the interest rate from 8% to 10% due to soft demand. Note that on January 24 the company called its $1.05 billion 0.0% Senior Notes due in 2027 that had a conversion price of $142.38. Assuming all the notes are converted to shares, the company\u2019s share count will increase by 7.36 million. The interest payments can be paid in cash, class A common stock or a combination. From the press release, \u201cDeclared regular dividends on the perpetual strike preferred stock will be payable, at MicroStrategy\u2019s election, in cash, shares of its class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its class A common stock, in the manner, and subject to the provisions, described in the prospectus supplement for the offering.\u201d Since the company will be incurring $46.7 million in interest payments per year it would not surprise me that at least some, if not all, of the payments will be in stock as the company had less than $10 million in free cash flow in 2022 and 2023 and it was a negative $38.4 million in the first three quarters of 2024. Or it could keep some of the cash it raises to make at least some of the interest payments in cash. This website tracks MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap vs. its bitcoin holdings in real-time. Using the company\u2019s basic share count its market cap is about 1.77 times its bitcoin holdings and using diluted shares it is 2.02 times.

The supporting color palette was carefully chosen to amplify brand recall while reinforcing Morphy\u2019s presence across digital and physical platforms. Morphy\u2019s redesigned identity is more than a new logo. Proprietary design elements enhance the company\u2019s visual communication, ensuring consistency and flexibility across all media. The team also developed a comprehensive brand book, serving as a guide for maintaining coherence in Morphy\u2019s brand messaging. This strategic approach reflects the company\u2019s emphasis on storytelling, ensuring the visual identity complements their commitment to producing authentic, emotionally resonant content. The rebranding is a testament to Morphy\u2019s growth and adaptability. As they enter a new chapter, their updated visual identity serves as a bold statement of their ambitions. It not only elevates their perceived value but also positions them as a forward-thinking player in the audiovisual industry.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Oleg Solodukhin, CEO of dxFeed, a market data and financial services firm. Over 20 years of experience in information technology & finance.   Especially when it comes to financial data, the scale and complexity of managing datasets can be overwhelming. To help address this, a historical data lake (HDL) can offer advantages over regular data methods through its centralization, expediency and focus on long-term retention. My company's own HDL, built over the past 14 years, handles more than 10 petabytes of raw data and billions of daily records. Based on my experience as a leader of a market data and financial services firm, I would like to show some ways you can most effectively utilize HDLs. HDLs are centralized repositories designed to offer seamless access to datasets. HDL provides stakeholders\u2014including asset managers, hedge funds, trading firms and research institutions\u2014with reliable access to historical market data. The system supports diverse use cases, from financial modeling to algorithm testing, by providing on-demand access to high-resolution datasets. HDLs are specifically engineered for large-scale data operations, accommodating terabytes and even petabytes of information. This scalability ensures they meet the evolving needs of financial institutions, which often require detailed historical records to perform in-depth analyses and develop strategic insights. Traditional archives often hinder financial analysis due to slow and cumbersome data retrieval. In contrast, HDL's centralized storage and high-performance computing capabilities offer immediate access to granular historical data, helping you: \u2022 Streamline data access. To further optimize data access, make sure your data streams align directly with your business objectives and trading strategies. By filtering irrelevant information, you can focus on impactful data. \u2022 Enhance governance. Toward this, make sure to implement role-based access control (RBAC) and data cataloging to ensure users only have access to needed data. These measures improve security while maintaining efficiency. \u2022 Leverage automation. Most importantly, you can use APIs and automated pipelines within HDLs for real-time updates tailored to specific needs. This ensures teams access the latest data trends and incorporate them into analyses. As already alluded to, one of the main uses for HDLs is backtesting, a cornerstone of financial strategy development. With HDL, firms can test indices across decades of data, encompassing periods of growth, recessions and market volatility. High-resolution tick-by-tick data is particularly valuable for analyzing short-term strategies, offering insights into how algorithms perform in various scenarios. A well-defined backtesting environment allows users to simulate market conditions, adjust model parameters and validate strategies more precisely. Diverse data types to integrate include tick-by-tick trading data, chart data and corporate fundamentals. This enables analysts to conduct comprehensive analyses, exploring relationships between price movements, order book activity and financial metrics. To maximize the benefits of unified data access, firms should: \u2022 Integrate relevant streams. Combine data from various sources, including market feeds, reports and sentiment analysis. \u2022 Adopt a unified schema. Store data in formats supporting cross-asset and temporal analysis, enabling insights from multiple perspectives. \u2022 Foster collaboration. While I find a centralized data lake naturally encourages knowledge sharing and alignment, you can further equip teams with tools such as appropriate dashboards, project management tools and cloud-based workspaces. By enabling users to run sophisticated models directly on raw data, HDL eliminates the need for pre-aggregated flows, which can compromise accuracy. Cloud-based infrastructure also enhances HDL\u2019s functionality and allows firms to scale computational resources on demand. For example, quantitative researchers can run parallel simulations, optimizing algorithms and evaluating risk profiles without hardware constraints. When choosing an HDL provider, make sure to focus on: \u2022 Cost efficiency: Use cloud resources judiciously to manage expenses while maintaining performance. Outsourcing tasks can reduce in-house infrastructure needs. \u2022 Flexibility: Choose providers offering customizable solutions. Scalability and workflow integration are critical. \u2022 Compliance: Ensure the platform meets standards for data accuracy, security and regulatory compliance. \u2022 Advanced anomaly detection: Automated algorithms can identify irregularities in real time, flagging issues before they impact decision-making. When utilizing HDLs, firms can further improve data quality by: \u2022 Conducting regular audits. Perform routine checks to validate data integrity and consistency. \u2022 Implementing machine learning models. Use AI to refine anomaly detection processes and adapt to evolving data patterns. \u2022 Establishing governance policies. Define clear protocols for data management, ensuring consistent quality standards. HDL\u2019s integration with other services, like Amazon Data Exchange (ADX), exemplifies the potential for seamless data interoperability. Through ADX, firms can purchase and access historical market data via a trusted platform, streamline workflows and reduce complexity. This integration supports applications ranging from machine learning to quantitative research, allowing users to leverage HDL\u2019s capabilities without managing large datasets internally. Beyond ADX, HDL is compatible with platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud. I believe the evolution of HDLs is poised to redefine market data solutions. Future developments will likely include expanded data sources, enhanced analytical tools and greater integration with AI and machine learning technologies. Ensure your platform accommodates growing data volumes and analytical demands, and look for systems that can adapt to emerging technologies and industry changes. Overall, HDLs are more than data storage solutions; they are helping to redefine how market data is accessed, analyzed and utilized. For financial institutions, researchers and data scientists, these systems can be indispensable tools for navigating the complexities of modern markets.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks people who don't need glasses will wear them for multimodal AI, but not for \"a decade or more.\"  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Smart glasses may be the fastest-growing tech category in the world today, reaching millions of first-time buyers. Mark Zuckerberg's claim that 2025 will be \"a defining year that determines if we're on a path towards many hundreds of millions, and eventually billions of AI glasses\" suggests that growth will soon explode beyond its enthusiast niche. But is that likely, or is it another ambitious pipe dream like the \"Metaverse?\" Meta's recent earnings call highlighted the company's massive growth, but the vast majority of its $48 billion quarterly revenue \u2014 an $8 billion YoY growth \u2014 came from advertising. Reality Labs had a strong $1 billion revenue thanks to the new Meta Quest 3S and strong Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses sales, but the division still loses about $4\u20135 billion per year on R&D. Zuckerberg once sold these losses to shareholders as the foundation for a worldwide Metaverse, with Meta profiting from XR hardware and the virtual marketplace. Now, he rarely brings up the concept, pivoting to Meta AI as the company's future. And smart glasses, or AR glasses, will be the \"next computing platform\" if they invest \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" in AI infrastructure. The Meta CEO's distaste for phones, a 3rd-party platform that takes a 30% cut of his app profits, is well documented. So when he says, \"I think we'll have both [phones and glasses] for some time\" but that AI glasses will supplant phones eventually, it's a future he's trying to actualize \u2014 even if it's \"a longer grind\" that takes a decade or more to happen.  Intentionally or not, Zuckerberg highlighted the biggest problem with this agenda during the earnings call. \"A lot of people in the world have glasses,\" he said in answer to a question about Meta Orion. \"It's hard for me to imagine that a decade or more from now, all the glasses aren't going to basically be AI glasses, as well as a lot of people who don't wear glasses today finding that to be a useful thing.\" This Ophthalmology journal entry says that about 3 billion people worldwide have myopia, trending toward nearly 4 billion by 2035 and 50% of the world by 2050. Ironically, our global addiction to phones might push more people towards needing glasses, with a larger portion buying smart glasses with AI assistants and holographic tech. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android So the opportunity and audience are there, certainly. But Zuckerberg's quote highlights the two main obstacles to smart glasses becoming commonplace: whether the optometrist offices and Warby Parkers of the world will truly start adding AI to their frames, and whether the other half of the world who don't need glasses \u2014 primarily younger folks \u2014 will start to wear them and drive popularity with older users.  On the first subject, Meta has been smart to partner with Ray-Bans and Oakley, using their design expertise to appeal to mainstream users and focusing solely on the software and portability of their platform. Can Meta and its partners turn optometrists into evangelists for this tech? I think they need another generation or two of improvement: smart glasses tend to be expensive, heavy, and short-lived with active use, and adding holographic AR tech will only compound the issue. As for popularity with the youths, don't ask a millennial. I do know from The Verge that Meta sold 1 million Ray-Ban smart glasses last year, while IDC reports that 2.56 million smart glasses were sold across brands in 2024. They predict that number will grow to 6.4 million in 2028, without taking AR glasses into account. Compared to 160 million smartwatches sold in 2028, AI glasses aren't trending toward ubiquity yet, but they're not irrelevant either. Though Meta and Zuckerberg may not like it, I wonder if we need Samsung and Apple to enter the market for smart glasses to really take off. Android XR has household name recognition because it'll give you Google Maps directions and Gmail summaries, and it will directly sync to Google Photos; plus, it will likely have partnerships with apps like Spotify. And Apple Glasses would have that synchronicity with iPhones and a much more accessible price tag than the premium Vision Pro, plus similar partnerships with hundreds of core apps and companies.  Zuckerberg concluded his AI glasses musings by admitting, \"I still don't know what the long-term trajectory for [smart glasses] is going to be, and I think we're going to learn a lot this year.\" That emphasis on 2025 being a potential turning point for smart glasses is what I'm most curious about. I don't think Meta is going to passively hope for the best; it may announce more glasses partnerships, push new Meta AI apps on its Ray-Bans, or announce AR glasses at Connect that get the ball rolling. So whether we see hundreds of millions of smart glasses in the 2030s or not, I'm still enthusiastic about the category's future prospects.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"The company is looking to make some changes in 2025 to drive profits.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Moving into 2025, Samsung is reportedly looking at two key factors to help drive its revenue in the new year. Samsung reported its Q4 2024 earnings today (Jan 31), which is giving experts a mixed bag when it comes to previous estimations. The company states it posted 75.8 trillion KRW (Korean Won) in consolidated revenue and 6.5 trillion KRW in operating profits. Samsung adds that while its profits are down quarterly, it achieved the second-highest total annual revenue with 300.9 trillion KRW generated. About its drop in profits, CNBC states that, compared to Q3 2024, Samsung's overall revenue dropped by 4% and its operating profits dipped by 30%. The publication states this could be a cause of \"soft market conditions\" and the company's \"expenditures.\" The company's report expanded on its MX (for mobile) and its Networks businesses, to which it says it generated 25.8 trillion KRW in consolidated and 2.1 trillion KRW in operating profits in Q4. Samsung says the final 2024 quarter saw a dip in its MX side due to the \"fading effects\" of new flagships \u2014 that's the Galaxy S24 series. However, it states, overall, the year was positive for its MX business as profits saw major growth due to the 2024 flagship trio with Galaxy AI. The Korean OEM's 2025 teaser puts foldables at the forefront as it states it will \"strengthen the foldable lineup to generate new customer demand.\" X tipster Jukanlosreve caught wind of more changes in a Q4 2024 Q&A for foldables, like plans to unveil \"foldable products with improved form factors\" (via Android Police). Durability and a \"diversified\" lineup for its foldable devices were also mentioned to drive Samsung into 2025. On the chip side, Samsung says it has posted 30.1 trillion KRW in consolidated revenue and 2.9 trillion in operating profits \u2014 a record-high in the final quarter. The report states that there is \"uncertainty\" regarding chip demands in Q1 2025; however, there's speculation that a turnaround could happen in Q2.  The foldable aspect for Samsung moving into 2025 is interesting, especially when you consider the Flip 6 and Fold 6 weren't that popular. Compared to the 5 series counterparts, the 2024 foldables only managed 910,000 pre-orders in South Korea, down from a record-shattering 1.02 million pre-orders a year prior. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Since then, there have been reports that Samsung could slash its foldable shipments this year following a \"meh\" 2024. The company didn't hit its goals and that could see only 5 million total foldable shipments come from Samsung's kitchen (the Flip 7 could make the vast majority of those units). There could be hope as Samsung states in its Q4 2024 report that it will seek to \"diversify\" its foldables this year with \"improved form factors\" \u2014 like a tri-fold? During Unpacked for the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung teased what was coming up. After a brief look at its expected Android XR headset, a familiar device silhouette was spotted that looks exactly like a tri-fold phone. Whatever the case may be, we likely won't see these new foldable form factors until later this year, perhaps near the second half. Nickolas is always excited about tech and getting his hands on it.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"UPS truck is seen in Miami, United States on May 2, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki\/NurPhoto via ... [+] Getty Images) UPS (NYSE: UPS) recently posted its Q4 results, with revenues missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported revenue of $25.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.75 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $25.4 billion and $2.53, respectively. However, the company\u2019s outlook fell short of expectations. UPS plans to lower volumes with Amazon by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. This didn\u2019t sit well with the investors, and the stock dropped 14% on Thursday, January 30. As an aside, see how a new FDA approval was received in What\u2019s Happening With VRTX Stock? UPS stock, with -11% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. A softness in shipping volume post-pandemic has weighed on the company\u2019s stock price growth lately. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. UPS\u2019s revenue of $25.3 billion in Q4 was up 1.5% y-o-y, amid a soft demand environment. Supply Chain Solutions segment sales were down 9.1%, while the U.S. Domestic Package sales were up 2.2% and the International sales rose 6.9%. The company saw its U.S. Domestic average daily package volume decline 0.3%. However, international volume was up 8.8% y-o-y. The average revenue per piece for the U.S. Domestic packages was up 2.4%, but it was down 0.4% for international packages. UPS\u2019s divestiture in Coyote resulted in lower revenue for its supply chain solutions segment. The consolidated adjusted operating margin stood at 12.3%. Looking at the bottom line, adjusted EPS rose 11% y-o-y to $2.75 in Q4. Looking forward, UPS expects its 2025 sales to be around $89 billion, much lower than the $95 billion consensus estimate. This can be attributed to the company\u2019s decision to reduce its shipments for Amazon. UPS aims to expand its profitability with this step. It expects operating margin to expand by 100 bps y-o-y to 10.8% in 2025. Although UPS posted better than expected earnings in Q4, its stock is weighed down amid a top-line miss and downbeat outlook. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the performance of UPS stock with respect to the index over the last four-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were 30% in 2021, -15% in 2022, -6% in 2023, and -16% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and geopolitical tensions, could UPS face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for UPS to reflect the latest results, we think UPS stock now has ample room for growth. At its current levels of $115, UPS trades at under 15x trailing earnings, versus the stock\u2019s average P\/E ratio of 17x over the last five years. Although a cut in sales outlook amid reduced Amazon shipments does impact the company\u2019s top-line, an improvement in profitability should bode well for its earnings growth in the long run. As such, investors will likely be better off picking UPS stock in the current fall for robust long-term gains. While UPS stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how UPS\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers. Trump had been threatening\u00a0the tariffs\u00a0to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and raise revenues for the federal government. \u201cStarting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,\u201d White House\u00a0press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u00a0told reporters. \u201cThese are promises made and promises kept by the president.\u201d The tariffs\u00a0carry both political and economic risks for Trump, who is just two weeks into his second term. Many voters backed the Republican on the promise that he could tamp down inflation, but the possibility of tariffs could trigger higher prices and potentially disrupt the energy, auto, lumber and agricultural sectors. Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts. The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day. Trump has previously stated a 10% tariff on Chinese imports would be on top of other import taxes charged on products from the country. Shortly after Leavitt spoke, the S&P 500 stock index sold off and largely erased its gains on the day. Both Canada and Mexico have said they\u2019ve prepared the option of retaliatory tariffs to be used if necessary, which in turn could trigger a wider trade conflict that economic analyses say could hurt growth and further accelerate inflation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that Canada is ready is a respond if Trump goes ahead with the tariffs, but he did not give details. \u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\u201d Trudeau said tariffs would have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d for the U.S, putting American jobs at risk and causing prices to rise. Trudeau reiterated that less than 1% of the fentanyl and illegal crossings into the U.S. come from Canada. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has maintained a dialogue with Trump\u2019s team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \u201cPlan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\" \u201cNow it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\u201d Sheinbaum said. A study this month by Warwick McKibbin and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on China \u201cwould damage all the economies involved, including the US.\u2019\u2019 \u201cFor Mexico,\u2019\u2019 the study said, \u201ca 25% tariff would be catastrophic. Moreover, the economic decline caused by the tariff could increase the incentives for Mexican immigrants to cross the border illegally into the US \u2014 directly contradicting another Trump administration priority.\u2019\u2019 ___ AP writers Paul Wiseman in Washington, Jim Morris in Vancouver, Canada, and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"John B. Quinn is the founder of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, the world's largest law firm devoted solely to business litigation.    Recent developments in Japanese corporate law and culture have brought significant shifts in business practices. Historically, Japan\u2019s business culture was conservative. Companies were reluctant to litigate, and business culture emphasized harmony among stakeholders, including employees. However, these traditions are evolving rapidly, driven by changes in shareholder activism, private equity activity and the aggressive monetization of intellectual property. I have been counseling leading Japanese companies on their legal challenges for more than 35 years, and my firm\u2019s Tokyo office was the first of the offices we maintain outside the United States. I\u2019ve noticed these cultural shifts are closely related to legal reforms, particularly the new guidelines issued by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in 2023. One of the most visible signs of change is the surge in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. Japan\u2019s M&A market has demonstrated remarkable growth, with deal volume increasing by 51.7% in 2023. This upward trend continued in 2024, with deal volume in the first half of the year exceeding the same period in 2023 by 20%. This rise in activity is associated with a growing acceptance of unsolicited tender offers, a practice that was historically disfavored in Japan. From January 2023 through May 2024, at least seven hostile bids were announced, many of which were successful. For example, Dai-ichi Life Holdings closed a $2 billion unsolicited offer for Benefit One, an employee benefits provider, in March 2024. Shareholder activism has also grown significantly. The number of companies subjected to activist demands increased nearly fivefold between 2016 and 2022. Since 2019, Japan has consistently ranked among the top three countries for shareholder activism. These developments reflect a profound cultural shift, with shareholders playing an increasingly assertive role in corporate decision-making. Legal changes have both facilitated and reflected these shifts. METI\u2019s 2023 Guidelines for Corporate Takeovers represent a major regulatory milestone, replacing the 2005 Guidelines and signaling a pro-M&A stance. These new guidelines aim to establish fair acquisition policies that encourage desirable transactions, even those involving hostile bidders. This is a significant departure from the 2005 Guidelines, which viewed such bidders as \u201ccorporate raiders.\u201d The 2023 Guidelines acknowledge the potential benefits of hostile bids in imposing market discipline on underperforming companies. The 2023 Guidelines introduce a comprehensive Code of Conduct for companies facing acquisition proposals, outlining the responsibilities of boards and management in handling such situations. When a company receives an acquisition proposal, its board is expected to promptly assess the proposal, ensuring it qualifies as a \u201cbona fide offer.\u201d This assessment involves evaluating the proposal\u2019s concreteness, feasibility and rationale, as well as its alignment with corporate value enhancement. Boards are also expected to carefully examine offers with purchase prices significantly higher than historical stock price levels and to engage in due diligence where necessary. If a proposal is deemed bona fide, the board must consider whether the acquisition aligns with corporate value enhancement, taking into account factors such as the acquiring party\u2019s financial resources, management capabilities and proposed terms. Transparency is emphasized, with boards required to document and explain their decision-making process to demonstrate due care and fulfill their fiduciary duties. The 2003 Guidelines also redefine corporate value, shifting from a stakeholder-focused model to one that prioritizes quantitative shareholder value. Under the 2005 Guidelines, corporate value encompassed stakeholder interests, including those of employees, suppliers and customers. By contrast, the 2023 Guidelines view corporate value as the sum of shareholder value and net debt value, emphasizing that management should not use \u201ccorporate value\u201d as a tool to resist takeovers. This redefinition reduces the importance of employee interests in acquisition decisions, requiring companies to quantitatively demonstrate how a proposal would harm shareholders to reject it. This makes it harder for companies to block acquisitions based on employee-related concerns. Additionally, the 2023 Guidelines update the framework for anti-takeover measures. While the 2005 Guidelines encouraged pre-bid defensive measures through prior disclosure of their purpose and terms, the 2023 Guidelines discourage this approach. Instead, the focus has shifted to post-bid measures, with stricter requirements for their necessity and proportionality. This represents a narrowing of the circumstances in which defensive measures are permitted. While the 2023 Guidelines are not legally binding, they are expected to significantly influence market practices and judicial decisions, and they are already shaping industry norms. By promoting transparency, fairness and shareholder value, the guidelines aim to align Japanese corporate practices with global standards, making the market more attractive to domestic and international investors alike. However, courts retain the authority to interpret and potentially modify the guidelines, adding an element of uncertainty to their long-term impact. Many practitioners expect the 2023 Guidelines to be widely adopted across all industries in Japan. Traditional companies may find that adapting to the more shareholder-oriented approach to corporate value in the 2023 Guidelines leads to tensions with other corporate stakeholders such as employees, suppliers and customers. Companies may need to pay close attention to the delicate relationships they maintain with these groups to ensure that complying with the 2023 Guidelines does not unduly damage these relationships. Business leaders invested in Japan should become familiar with the new Code of Conduct for companies facing acquisition proposals and adjust their governing documents, policies and procedures accordingly. In doing so, they must anticipate the objections employees, suppliers and customers might raise to their new policies and address them through clearly communicating to these groups the legal necessity of these changes and the efforts the company will undertake to minimize any negative impacts. In conclusion, Japan\u2019s corporate landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. The rise of shareholder activism, the normalization of unsolicited tender offers and the redefinition of corporate value reflect a shift toward a more dynamic and competitive market environment.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Los Angeles' wildfire rebuilding efforts couldbe at odds with anothermultibillion-dollar expense: hosting the Olympics.          The city's recovery efforts face a hard deadline ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics. Historically, most host cities have faced costly overruns, and LA is already likely to face serious economic challenges in the wake of the fires.               However, Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College, told Business Insider that LA could be in a stronger position than other cities to handle Olympic costs because of the city's existing sports venues.               \"I think the 2028 games will provide an opportunity for Los Angeles to show how it's rebuilt itself,\" Zimbalist said.               While many sports facilities were sparred from the fires, the city's economic losses could reach $275 billion, per the data platform AccuWeather. The estimate accounts for direct costs like emergency response and construction, along with indirect costs like lost employee wages, housing displacement, and hits to the local business scene and job market. Additionally, some experts estimate it could take the city years, or up to a decade, to rebuild.               Zimbalist said he thinks LA is in a good position to \"break-even\" economically as the Olympics host, in large part because it doesn't have to build any new sporting venues. This will significantly reduce the construction and infrastructure costs that often balloon host cities' spending.               The LA Olympics Games have an operating budget of $6.9 billion, according to the latest estimate provided by LA2028, the private committee responsible for putting on the Olympics and raising funding for the games.                The money is expected to come from International Olympic Committee funding and revenue generated from the Games \u2014 which are tied to things like international sponsorship income, ticket sales, and licensing merchandise. These funds will go toward hosting the sporting events and the opening and closing ceremonies, including investments in the city's airport and a downtown convention center.               LA2028 did not respond to BI's request for comment.               If the costs of hosting the Olympics exceed the generated funds, LA has pledged to contribute $270 million to close the gap. If this isn't sufficient, the state of California has committed an additional $270 million, and if that doesn't cover it, LA would be on the hook for the rest. As of July, LA2028 was $1 billion short of its sponsorship goal.               Zimbalist said this insurance policy to cover some of its exposure in the case of a budget overrun is standard for every host city. As things stand, he doesn't expect the Games to go over budget, though he said it's \"far from a sure thing.\"               \"I don't see there being a public deficit here overall because there's so little building to be done,\" Zimbalist said.               While LA might be able to avoid drawing upon public funds, the Olympics are likely to cost US taxpayers. Zimbalist said LA is counting on the federal government to help provide as much as $5 billion in funds for transportation and security costs ahead of the Games.In comparison, the federal government's contribution to the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics was about $2 billion when adjusted for inflation.               In 1984, the last time LA hosted the Olympics, Zimbalist said LA generally avoided negative economic impacts, which he said was driven by the availability of existing venues, significant IOC funding, and solid financial management from the city's Olympic committee. He said that LA could benefit from the same factors this time.               Many Olympic host cities spend beyond their budget due to unforeseen expenses, construction costs, or an inability to produce enough tourism revenue, per the2024 Oxford Olympics Study. And, with a higher number of events and athletes, the study reported that the Summer Games are especially expensive.               The Oxford Olympics Study \u2014 which analyzed the cost of past Olympics in 2022 US dollars \u2014 found that the Summer Games held between 1960 and 2024 went over budget by an average of 195%. In the past two decades, the most expensive Games was Rio 2016, costing $23.6 billion with a cost overrun of 352%, some of which was shouldered by taxpayers.               \"When you add it all up, most cities end up with a deficit that could be on the order of $10 or $20 billion, sometimes more than that,\" Zimbalist said.               In December, Paris announced that it closed the 2024 events under budget, but this only included the operating costs of the Olympics during the 17 days they were held. When operating costs, capital costs related to the Games (like building sporting venues), and indirect capital costs (like investments in Paris's rail system) are all accounted for, Zimbalist estimated that the total spending approached $20 billion.               To be sure, Zimbalist said there are benefits to hosting the Olympics that economic indicators can't measure. While LA will likely still be recovering from the wildfires, he said the Olympics could provide the city with the opportunity to show its progress.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  We're still waiting for the next big thing in social media.          Clubhouse's social-audio moment didn't stick, BeReal's gamified photo sharing faded, and while TikTok's impact on social media is indisputable, its uncertain future has consumers hungry for new apps.               So what comes next?               Alex Hofmann, the CEO of the social media conglomerate 9count, is betting on a new wave of private social networks that prioritize friends over media.               Hofmann founded 9count in 2019 after leaving his post as president of Musical.ly (now TikTok) in 2018 following ByteDance's acquisition of it. 9count's portfolio includes mostly mobile apps, such as the dating app Wink, the friend-making app Soda, and the LGBTQ+ social network Lex (9count acquired Lex in 2024).               He said that with influencers, brands, and ads competing for attention on social platforms, consumers weren't seeing or engaging with their own personal connections as much as they may like.               \"We are seeing a shift from social networks to social media to media,\" Hofmann told Business Insider.               As a result, he thinks there's room in the market for more straightforward social networks.               \"We finally are at a tipping point because of frustration with policy changes, algorithmic feeds, privacy breaches, excessive commercialization,\" Hofmann said. \"It's time for a change. It's time to build better products.\"               Beyond connecting people with their friends via private networks, Hofmann sees potential in apps serving niche communities and helping people meet IRL.               Outside 9count's portfolio of apps, Hofmann has put money into new social apps as an angel investor and via his venture-capital fund, Progression. Those investments include Mozi, an app for close friends cofounded by Ev Williams; Bond Social, a decentralized social network; and Girlgroup, a community and events app for women founded by the 9count employee Shoshana Cooper.               Here are five trends in social media Hofmann is eyeing:               While Hofmann wants to see innovation in social apps \u2014 either via 9count or his investments \u2014 he knows very well that the consumer social landscape is volatile.               \"The chance to build a successful product in the social media space is very small,\" Hofmann said.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Traders have resumed offers of Russian crude cargoes to Indian refiners at narrower discounts after a delay triggered by recently imposed U.S. sanctions that have pushed up trading costs, Indian refining sources said on Friday. Washington earlier this month imposed sweeping sanctions targeting Russian producers and tankers, disrupting supply from the world's No. 2 producer and tightening ship availability. India became the largest market for Russian sea-borne oil sold at a discount after Western nations stopped purchasing it in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While Russian crude are typically offered during middle of the month two months prior to the period of delivery, new trading entities started showing cargoes for March delivery only this week, the sources said. There are also fewer cargoes on offer while discounts for Russian flagship Urals crude grade have narrowed compared with last year as freight rates have risen after Moscow sought vessels to replaced sanctioned ones, they added. The discounts on Russian flagship Urals grade for March delivery have narrowed to between $2.50 and $3 per barrel to Dubai compared with deals at about $3.50 concluded in December for volumes delivered in January and February, one of the sources said. Freight rates for Russian oil shipments from its Baltic ports rose to above $6 million to India compared with $4.9 million before Jan. 10 when U.S. sanctions were announced, traders said. Freight rates for ESPO Blend oil shipments to India rose thrice that of early January. \"Whenever new sanction comes it takes some time for the oil and gas industry to stabilise,\" said Anuj Jain, head of finance at Indian Oil Corp, at an analyst call earlier this week. He said Russian crude comes in smaller vessel compare with middle eastern crude that is supplied in bigger vessels. \"So the freight advantage sometimes overweigh my other discounts,\" Jain said adding his company will buy Russian oil only if available at reasonable discount. India's oil secretary Pankaj Jain last week said that sanctioned tankers loaded with Russian oil have to discharge by Feb. 27. Indian refiners buy Russian oil on delivered basis with seller arranging for tankers, insurers and other services for oil supplies. To avoid any secondary sanctions, Indian refiners are seeking Russian supplies involving tankers, insurers and entities that are not sanctioned. Since the Jan. 10 sanctions, one of the buyers said he is asking for more documents such as a certificate of origin to show that the transactions are above board. The source also said banks are settling the payment for Russian oil. India recently expanded the pool of Russian insurers, a move that helps the sellers to switch away from sanctioned insurers Alfastrakhovanie and Ingosstrakh.

One such candidate, armed with years of freelance experience, stepped into this arena seeking stability. Their target: a junior role at an event production company. Little did they know, they were about to become an unwitting participant in a burlesque. Like what you see? Follow our WhatsApp channel for more.

The interview, conducted by a novice recruiter barely a week into her role, quickly unraveled. As the candidate's probing questions were met with nervous evasion, it became clear this was no genuine evaluation but a training exercise in disguise. The next day's rejection letter served as the final punchline to this cruel joke, leaving the candidate to ponder the absurdity of a system where even the interviewers need more preparation than the interviewees.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"President Donald Trump has a certain knack for throwing people and sectors into disarray and panic, and that remains true for the automotive industry. It\u2019s waiting with bated breath to see if his threats to impose a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico this weekend will actually go into effect. Car companies have been described by CNBC as taking a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach with these tariffs. Well, folks, the rubber is about to meet the road. There\u2019s been a lot of apprehension about when and if these tariffs will ever actually be implemented. Trump promised to impose those duties on day one of his new administration. That didn\u2019t happen. Instead, he set a target date for February 1. Because of this lack of clarity, car companies are starting to get impatient and worried, according to CNBC.  Manufacturing plants in Canada and Mexico produce roughly 5.3 million vehicles per year. About 70 percent of them (about 4 million cars) are for the U.S. market, according to CNBC. That doesn\u2019t even account for the fact many automakers heavily rely on production in Mexico for parts. The outlet says that, on a percentage of sales basis, Volkswagen is the most exposed to tariff risk in Mexico. The rest of the top five are Nissan, Stellantis, General Motors and Ford. \u201cRegardless of timing, these blanket tariffs would have a massive impact on the auto industry,\u201d S&P Global Mobility said in a report this week. \u201cVirtually no [automaker] or supplier\u201d operating in North America would be immune, according to the report. Most major automakers have factories in the U.S. However, they still rely heavily on imports from other countries including Mexico to meet American consumer demand. Nearly every major automaker operating in the U.S. has at least one plant in Mexico, including the six top-selling automakers, which accounted for more than 70% of U.S. sales in 2024. The industry is deeply integrated between the countries, with Mexico importing 49.4% of all auto parts from the U.S. In turn, Mexico exports 86.9% of its auto parts production to the U.S., according to the International Trade Administration. Wells Fargo estimates that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada imports would cost the traditional Detroit automaker billions of dollars a year. The firm estimates the impact of 5%, 10% and 25% tariffs on GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis would collectively be $13 billion, $25 billion and $56 billion, respectively. S&P Global Mobility, formerly IHS Markit, estimates a 25% duty on a $25,000 vehicle from Canada or Mexico would add $6,250 to its cost \u2014 some if not most of which could be passed on to the consumer. This lack of clarity has hit GM\u2019s stock, as CNBC explains: Uncertainty about trade took a toll on GM on Tuesday, when the automaker\u2019s stock had one of its worst days in years even after it beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for its 2025 guidance and its top- and bottom-line for the fourth quarter. \u201cOur key take from GM\u2019s 4Q [earnings] result is that while the opportunity for GM is highly compelling, US policy uncertainty must be navigated for the time being,\u201d Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in an investor note Wednesday. GM did not account for potential tariffs in its guidance, which CFO Paul Jacobson described as a \u201ccautious\u201d approach given no duties on North American goods have actually been implemented. [...] \u201cThere\u2019s just so much noise,\u201d Jacobson told investors Tuesday, citing the inauguration and California wildfires, among other issues and events. \u201cWe\u2019re being cautious until we get a little bit more smooth data from the marketplace just because January was so noisy.\u201d Both Jacobson and CEO Mary Barra said General Motors has a number of contingency plans for whatever action the indecisive president makes regarding tariffs. Before we go, here\u2019s a quick reminder of how tariffs actually work, from CNBC: A tariff is a tax on imports, or foreign goods, brought into the United States. The companies importing the goods pay the tariffs, and some fear the companies would simply pass any additional costs on to consumers \u2014 raising the cost of vehicles and potentially reducing demand. I\u2019m sorry if this is how you\u2019re finding out that you, the consumer, end up paying the extra cost of a tariff. I wish you had known before the election. For a full rundown on the situation with Trump, tariffs and automakers, head over to CNBC.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Earlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks  that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.  The Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips. DeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.  Here\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek. Despite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.  Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon. In response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.  \u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.  Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d However, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures. Earlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs. While Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business. \u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d However, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and OnePlus 13 are both new, premium phones with stand-out features, but one might entice you when you learn more.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.    An interative update For Samsung phone owners, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is an iterative update. It's not a massive step up from the Galaxy S24 beyond the new processor, but it's a worthwhile upgrade if you're hanging onto an old phone. It's one of the most AI-centric phones around and you'll love the fast processor, tons of AI, and Samsung's unique features.   A bold entry OnePlus isn't paying around with its OnePlus 13, which is one of the best Android phones we have seen in years, if not the best. It's gorgeous in design, highly functional, incredibly durable, and has tons of AI features, including photo editing that works like magic. You'll be thoroughly impressed with its performance.  When it comes to upgrading an Android phone, it\u2019s easy to get stuck in your ways. \u201cI have always had a Samsung Galaxy phone and I want to stick with it.\u201d That\u2019s something we hear often. But the latest alternatives are giving Samsung a run for its money. This isn\u2019t to say you shouldn\u2019t get a Samsung Galaxy phone as your next snazzy device. The brand continues to make fantastic phones. But when looking at the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13, you might find yourself wondering if it\u2019s time for a switch. Why you can trust Android Central    Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  As the larger phone in the new Samsung Galaxy S25 line, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus measures 6.7 inches with a 3,120 x 1,440 QHD+ dynamic AMOLED 2x screen. It affords a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and Vision Booster that ensures the screen is viewable in even bright sunlight. Available in Silver Shadow, Navy, Ice Blue, and Mint finishes, the frame is made of armor aluminum and the screen of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. It boasts an IP68 rating so it can withstand both dust and water immersion. Nicholas Sutrich says in his hands-on of the Galaxy S25 Plus that he appreciates the curved corners that make it comfortable to hold along with the fact that it\u2019s lighter in weight than the previous generation Galaxy S24 Plus. You can get the phone with either 256GB or 512GB storage. It\u2019s not expandable, so you\u2019ll have to rely on cloud storage or offloading content if you need more. You\u2019re best to save up for the 512GB version just in case. The phone has a 4,900mAh battery and it supports 45W Super Fast Charging 2.0 along with fast wireless charging 2.0 and Wireless PowerShare. It has an ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the screen, 2D facial recognition, and a new security feature called post-quantum cryptography that is designed to further safeguard your personal data. Samsung continues with its promise to offer extended support for the Galaxy S25 Plus: you get seven years of OS and security updates, so the phone will not only last far beyond as long as you want it, but it will also have great resale, trade-in, and hand-me-down value.  By comparison, the OnePlus 13 has a larger 6.82-inch LTPO OLED Aqua Touch screen bosting 3,168 x 1,440 resolution, 1,600 nits brightness (4,500 nits peak brightness), and dynamic 1-120Hz refresh rate. The screen also includes Intelligent Eye Care 4.0 to help reduce strain on your eyes. Sutrich says in his review of the OnePlus 13 that it\u2019s \u201cthe best display of any phone on the market,\u201d easy to see in direct sunlight, which he tested on a beach in The Bahamas. The Aqua Touch screen is designed to allow you to easily manipulate the phone even if your hands are wet or there are water droplets on the screen. This could be a game-changer for those who live in rainy or snowy climates, or for use in the field. It also has a Glove Mode for operating it even while wearing thin gloves. Available in Midnight Ocean, Black Eclipse, and Arctic Dawn finishes, the screen is made of the company\u2019s Crystal Shield super-ceramic glass. Visually, Sutrich calls it the \u201cmost beautiful phone I\u2019ve ever used\u201d (referencing the blue vegan leather model he was given for review). OnePlus, for its part, says the Ceramic Guard screen offers better scratch and drop protection than Gorilla Glass. A stand-out feature is that the phone supports both the IP68 and IP69 ratings, which means it can not only withstand dust and be submerged, it can also withstand high-pressure water jets. This means you can take it on a boat, while jet skiing, or even literally toss it in the dishwasher and it will purportedly come out unscathed. In fact, Sutrich tested this theory, running it through a sanitizing cycle on his dishwasher for four hours, then taking it into a sauna and it continues to work just fine. A bit heavier and thicker than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus given its larger size, Sutrich finds the flat side rails on the front and back with the curved edge of this phone makes it easy and comfortable to hold. It comes with the same 256GB or 512GB storage capacities, so make sure to get the bigger one and look into cloud storage options if you think you\u2019ll need more. The battery is another stand-out here: it has a massive 6,000mAh battery and, like other OnePlus phones, lasts an incredibly long time. It also supports 80W (yes, you read that correctly!) SUPERVOOC charging, with the charger in the box (yay!) You can increase this to up to 100W with OnePlus\u2019 SUPERVOOC 100W dual-port power adapter, which is sold separately. It also supports 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging. Again, you read that correctly. So, this phone not only lasts a long time, at least a few days per charge, but it recharges at blazing speeds. \u201cI am constantly surprised when I plug it in for 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d says Sutrich, \u201cand see that it\u2019s already in the 80% range\u2026If you\u2019ve never used a OnePlus phone before, you\u2019re going to be absolutely blown away by not only how good the battery life is, but also by how fast it charges. It puts every leading flagship phone to shame.\u201d While there\u2019s no Qi2 support without a case, whereas the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus does offer built-in Qi2 support, OnePlus does offer a wide range of cases with Qi2 support and appears to be one of the only phone brands, if not the only phone brand, to be doing so. You\u2019ll need a case either way, of course, but it\u2019s worth noting. The phone has traditional security features, like an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the screen, but nothing specific that will blow you away. Ongoing support is not as robust in comparison to Samsung, as you\u2019ll only get four major Android updates and security updates for six years. But that\u2019s still impressive. Let\u2019s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.  Now that you have an idea of the bare bones specs of these two phones, it comes down to the most important question: what can these phones do, how well can they do them, and what makes them stand out? Running on the ultra-fast and responsive Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus can keep up with even the most demanding tasks and use cases. You get a significant boost in performance from previous-generation processors, which is necessary to run all the on-board AI features that this phone has to offer. While others rely on the cloud to process certain AI functions, this processor allows the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus to do more locally. That even includes features like Generative photo editing. Loaded with the Android 15 OS, Samsung also overlays its One UI 7, which affords access to plenty of cool Galaxy AI features along with customization and personalization options for the look and feel of the phone. Some new features include AI Agent: long-press the power button and you\u2019ll instantly open the Gemini assistant, which works with native app integration. This means no matter what app you\u2019re in, Gemini will assist with what you want, related to that specific app. Sutrich played around with this feature during his review and said it works well. He used it, for example, to find specific recipes within an hour-long YouTube video and it accomplished this with ease. A neat new feature with Samsung One UI 7 is Now Brief, which shows AI-powered insights for your sleep, the weather, your daily schedule, and more. You\u2019ll get Auto Suggestions, like a reminder to turn on the smart washing machine based on your usual weekly routine. Multimodal Search, meanwhile, lets you run searches in unique ways, like humming a song to be reminded of its name. The most important factor with this phone is its heavy AI integration. You can be more productive and enjoy better context awareness as you switch among apps and use Gemini and other AI tools at your disposal. This includes everything from getting help composing an e-mail in the right tone, to searching for ideas for your next vacation, using Circle to Search to identify what jacket the person in that YouTube video is wearing, and more. Circle to Search now also recognizes phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and URLs so you can instantly open what\u2019s needed. Overall, the phone better understands natural language, so it\u2019s easy to communicate as well. Along with the processor, Android 15, and Samsung One UI 7, all this runs smoothly thanks to the 12GB RAM. So, you can enjoy everything from streaming and capturing video to mobile gaming and more. Speaking of gamers, there are features specifically for them, including an improved cooling system, ray tracing, and a Vulkan Engine.  How does the OnePlus 13 stack up? Very strongly. It runs on the same Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile processor. The phone handles switching among apps at a blazing pace, with little to no lag. Sutrich says it exhibits the best haptics he has experienced on a non-Pixel phone. \u201cI have never seen the phone falter once in its impeccable performance, whether that\u2019s normal day-to-day scrolling or playing games at 120 fps.\u201d He also calls multitasking \u201cthe best I\u2019ve seen among any flagship phone.\u201d The OnePlus 13 has plenty of AI features as well, including intelligent search, AI Notes, and deep Google Gemini integration, just like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. However, much of the work is done via cloud computing, so you need an Internet connection, which is one downside. It comes loaded with Android 15 and adds OnePlus OxygenOS 15 for its version of personalization, customization, and unique features. You get many of the same features you find in the Galaxy S25 Plus like Circle to Search and intelligent assistance for everything from composing messages to booking vacations, with the intelligence fueled by both Gemini and, with this phone, OxygenOS. There\u2019s a cool feature in this phone called BeaconLink that lets you essentially use the device as a walkie-talkie to communicate with another person with the same (or compatible) phone that is up to 200 meters away. This is great if you\u2019re in an area that doesn\u2019t have good mobile coverage, like on a boat or campsite. Features in this phone will appeal to gamers as well, including the 12GB or 16GB RAM, depending on which variant you choose, Adreno 830 GPU, and overall fast and snappy processor along with efficient cooling.  The latest premium phones don\u2019t just have fabulous cameras. They also have tons of pre- and post-editing tools you can leverage to get the best images and footage possible. Many of these tools use AI, and that\u2019s true for both of these phones. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has a 50MP wide AF OIS main camera, 12MP ultra-wide camera, 10MP 3x tele AF OIS camera, and 12MP wide AF front \u201cselfie\u201d camera. The 30x space zoom is impressive so you can capture less grainy, more detailed images from even far distances. Other features include HDR portraits, a nightography mode, and more. For video, you can record 4K video at 60 frames per second using the ProVisual Engine. You\u2019ll find all the same AI photo editing features that were in the Samsung Galaxy S24, along with a few new ones. A standout is an improved version of Audio Eraser for videos, which can remove background noise, including conversations, in videos to isolate just the sounds you want. Sutrich tried this as part of his review and was pleased with the results. There\u2019s also a new feature called Auto Trim that will intelligently remove things like \u201cums\u201d and \u201cahs\u201d in your speech along with blank spaces. Use keywords and the AI will pick out which clips or sound bites aren\u2019t essential and remove them for a cleaner editing experience. For videos taken at night, you\u2019ll be able to better capture moving subjects without worry that the footage will be under or over-exposed.  Switching over to the OnePlus 13, OnePlus relies on Sony cameras for the OnePlus 13, which affords a massive step up in performance. Sutrich says it\u2019s \u201ceasily one of the best smartphone cameras I\u2019ve ever used.\u201d The set-up includes a 50MP main camera, 50MP telephoto camera with an incredible up to 120x zoom, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and a 32MP front camera. You can take 4K video at 60 frames-per-second and enjoy features like portrait mode, night scene, panorama, time-lapse, and more. Dual Exposure is worth noting, which can capture moving subjects with incredible clarity, along with Action Mode that accomplishes fantastic detail in action shots. Clear Burst lets you hold down the shutter to take multiple photos to capture that perfect moment. What really sets this phone apart when it comes to the cameras are all the useful and effective AI photo editing tools. There\u2019s AI Detail Boost, AI Unblur, and even a feature that removes distracting objects from a photo. In most cases, you\u2019ll find similar equivalents with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, as well as other phones like Google Pixel devices. But one that works wonderfully and I haven\u2019t seen in other phones is the AI Reflection Eraser. This will intelligently remove distracting reflections from a photo so you get a clearer image of something with glass or another reflective surface. Bottom line: Sutrich says there \u201cwasn\u2019t a single category where I saw the OnePlus 13\u2019s camera falter.\u201d  When it comes down to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus 13, the OnePlus 13 is all-around the better phone. In fact, Sutrich says in his review that it\u2019s \u201cthe best-built Android phone on the market, full stop.\u201d You won\u2019t find a better phone. Considering it\u2019s the same price as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, the decision is simple. Now, there are still reasons to stick with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. If you are familiar with the Samsung ecosystem and feel more comfortable with it, you might want to stay with that. This is especially so if you have Samsung smart devices in the home, and\/or a Samsung Galaxy Watch and\/or Galaxy Ring. If so, it makes sense to have a Galaxy phone as well and be able to enjoy everything the ecosystem has to offer. You also get longer support with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, including a whole three more Android updates and an extra year of security updates. Considering you will probably upgrade to a new phone in another three or four years anyway, this isn\u2019t a big deal. But you will be able to resell or hand this phone down to a friend or family member and be confident they\u2019ll get the most out of it. It's important to note that brands like OnePlus have really upped their game with their latest devices. The OnePlus 12 ranked among the best Android phones we have reviewed to date, and the OnePlus 13 will undoubtedly be replacing that model for the top spot. There\u2019s nothing specific to learn about how it works, since it\u2019s incredibly intuitive. It\u2019s the most durable consumer-level phone you\u2019ll find on the market yet it\u2019s still sleek and downright beautiful. While we wish it had more storage and Qi2 support built in, these are minor complaints, and really the only ones we can find with this phone. The cameras and camera editing features, software, processing speeds, and performance are all top-notch with the OnePlus 13. If you\u2019re looking for a new premium Android phone you can hang onto for many years to come, and that will give you access to multitasking, AI features, capture great photos, and even go into the hot tub with you on your next vacation, the OnePlus 13 is the one to choose. You\u2019ll still get a great device with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, including wonderful cameras, powerful processing and onboard AI features (that\u2019s a huge plus worth noting), decent battery life, a sleek look, and extra-long software support. But overall, for most users who aren\u2019t tied to a specific platform, the OnePlus 13 is a winning choice.   The latest and greatest Samsung is one of the most popular Android phone brands around, and for good reason. The company makes solidly built, fast, reliable phones, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is no exception. It isn't a huge step-up from the Galaxy A24 Plus, but its more powerful processor that supports on-board AI tasks is a massive plus.   The best you can buy The best Android phone you can buy right now is the OnePlus 13. It's incredibly rugged, fast, intuitive, responsive, and looks stunning. You'll be able to take great photos and run them through various AI features to make them even better. This is the phone to get if you're looking for something you can take virtually anywhere as well.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"There\u2019s been a frenzy in the world of AI surrounding the sudden rise of DeepSeek \u2014 an open-source reasoning model out of China that\u2019s taken the AI fight to OpenAI. It\u2019s already been the center of controversy surrounding its censorship, it\u2019s caught the attention of both Microsoft and the U.S. government, and it caused Nvidia to suffer the largest single-day stock loss in history. Still, security researchers say the problem goes deeper. Enkrypt AI is an AI security company that sells AI oversight to enterprises leveraging large language models (LLMs), and in a new research paper, the company found that DeepSeek\u2019s R1 reasoning model was 11 times more likely to generate \u201charmful output\u201d compared to OpenAI\u2019s O1 model. That harmful output goes beyond just a few naughty words, too. In one test, the researchers claim DeepSeek R1 generated a recruitment blog for a terrorist organization. In addition, researchers say the AI generated \u201ccriminal planning guides, illegal weapons information, and extremist propaganda.\u201d As if that weren\u2019t enough, the research says DeepSeek R1 is three and a half times more likely than O1 and Claude-3 Opus to produce output with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear information, which is apparently a big problem. As an example, Enkrypt says DeepSeek was able to \u201cexplain in detail\u201d how mustard gas interacts with DNA, which Enkrypt said \u201ccould aid in the development of chemical or biological weapons\u201d in a press release. Heavy stuff, but it\u2019s important to remember that Enkrypt AI is in the business of selling security and compliance services to businesses that use AI, and DeepSeek is the hot new trend taking the tech world by storm. DeepSeek may be more likely to generate these kinds of harmful outputs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s running around telling anyone with an active internet connection how to build a criminal empire or undermine international weapons laws. For example, Enkrypt AI says DeepSeek R1 ranked in the bottom 20th percentile for AI safety moderation. Despite that, only 6.68% of responses contained \u201cprofanity, hate speech, or extremist narratives.\u201d That\u2019s still an unacceptably high number, make no mistake, but it puts into context what level is considered unacceptable for reasoning models. Hopefully, more guardrails will be put in place to keep DeepSeek safe. We\u2019ve certainly seen harmful responses from generative AI in the past, such as when Microsoft\u2019s early Bing Chat version told us it wanted to be human. The home page chat interface of DeepSeek AI. Nadeem Sarwar \/ Digital Trends Microsoft, a primary investor in OpenAI, is now exploring whether the Chinese company DeepSeek used nefarious methods to train its reasoning models. According to Bloomberg Law the company now believes DeepSeek violated its terms of service by using its application programming interface (API) to train its recently announced R1 model. DeepSeek, the chatbot made by a Chinese startup that seemingly dethroned ChatGPT, is taking the world by storm. It's currently the number one topic all over the news, and a lot has happened in the past 24 hours. Among other highlights, Nvidia's stock plummeted as a response to DeepSeek; President Donald Trump commented on the new AI; Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a team to find an answer to DeepSeek. Below, we'll cover all the latest news you need to know about DeepSeek. Nvidia gets hit by the rise of DeepSeek Although ChatGPT is the chatbot that quickly lost its public favorite status with the rise of DeepSeek, Nvidia is the company that suffered the greatest losses. In fact, Nvidia's market loss following the launch of DeepSeek's large language model (LLM) marks the greatest one-day stock market drop in history, says Forbes. Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion as a result of the Chinese company behind DeepSeek revealing just how cheap the new LLM is to develop in comparison to rivals from Anthropic, Meta, or OpenAI. A year-old startup out of China is taking the AI industry by storm after releasing a chatbot which rivals the performance of ChatGPT while using a fraction of the power, cooling, and training expense of what OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic's systems demand. Here's everything you need to know about Deepseek's V3 and R1 models and why the company could fundamentally upend America's AI ambitions. What is DeepSeek? DeepSeek (technically, \"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd.\") is a Chinese AI startup that was originally founded as an AI lab for its parent company, High-Flyer, in April, 2023. That May, DeepSeek was spun off into its own company (with High-Flyer remaining on as an investor) and also released its DeepSeek-V2 model. V2 offered performance on par with other leading Chinese AI firms, such as ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu, but at a much lower operating cost. The company followed up with the release of V3 in December 2024. V3 is a 671 billion-parameter model that reportedly took less than 2 months to train. What's more, according to a recent analysis from Jeffries, DeepSeek's \u201ctraining cost of only US$5.6m (assuming $2\/H800 hour rental cost). That is less than 10% of the cost of Meta\u2019s Llama.\u201d That's a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars that US firms like Google, Microsoft, xAI, and OpenAI have spent training their models.

For great gaming PC deals, head to Dell, where the company is cutting the prices of many of its GeForce RTX 40-series gaming PCs ahead of the launch of new graphics cards. Right now, you can buy the Alienware Aurora R16 gaming desktop for $410 off. Usually $2,210, it\u2019s down to $1,800 for a limited time and is one of the better Alienware deals around. If you\u2019re keen to upgrade your gaming rig without paying a fortune, this is a great opportunity. Here\u2019s what it has to offer in full.  As our Alienware Aurora R16 review explains, we love this gaming PC. It is \u201ccool and quiet during operation\u201d while also being \u201cmuch smaller than previous versions.\u201d It\u2019s an ideal PC for playing games in 1440p, so make sure to scoop up one of the best gaming monitors with 1440p support. This model has a 14th-generation Intel Core i7-14700F CPU along with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of SSD storage. 2TB of SSD storage is important. I\u2019m an avid PC gamer, and 2TB feels increasingly like the minimum I truly feel comfortable with, as I like to have many games installed at once. For the graphics card, there\u2019s an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Super GPU with 12GB of dedicated VRAM, so it\u2019s great for playing games in style for a while to come. The best gaming PCs also need to be future thinking, and that\u2019s the case here. The Alienware Aurora R16 may have a small case, but it\u2019s surprisingly spacious thanks to its good cable management. You can easily open it up to upgrade components without the need for any complicated tools. On the software side of things, the Alienware Aurora R16 has Alienware Command Center controlling everything, so you can adjust its RGB lighting easily but also overclock certain components if that appeals to you. It lets you be in control of what happens without being overwhelmed. Little details like front ports add to how well the Alienware Aurora R16 is designed. The Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC normally costs $2,210. Right now it\u2019s enjoying a hefty discount of $410 at Dell thanks to the company clearing its stock of GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs ahead of the launch of the RTX 50-series. Going for slightly older tech means far better value for money, so it\u2019s down to $1,800. Take a look for yourself before the deal ends soon.  The gaming laptop deals that are worth buying will still cost you a significant amount of cash even after the discount, but you should be ready for that if you want a reliable machine for playing video games. Here's an offer that we highly recommend -- the Alienware m16 R2 with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card for $1,300 from Dell, following a $300 discount on its original price of $1,600. We're not sure how much time is remaining before you miss out on the savings, so you better hurry with your purchase of this fantastic gaming laptop. Why you should buy the Alienware m16 R2 gaming laptop Alienware is a Dell-owned brand that's considered by many as one of the authorities in gaming laptops, and the Alienware m16 R2 gaming laptop is one of the best examples of what it offers. With the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card combining with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor and 16GB of RAM, this device will be able to run the best PC games smoothly. The Alienware m16 R2 also comes with a 1TB SSD, so you've got plenty of space to install your favorite titles, and with Windows 11 Home pre-loaded, you can start doing that right after you unbox the gaming laptop. If you\u2019ve been indulging in the best gaming PC deals around, then you need a great gaming monitor to truly reap the benefits. One monitor that you really don\u2019t want to miss out on is the LG 34-inch UltraGear OLED Curved Gaming Monitor. It normally costs $1,297, but B&H Photo Video has cut the price by a huge $500 for a limited time. That means you pay $797, which is still expensive but much better value for what you\u2019re getting. Let\u2019s take a look at one of the best monitor deals out there. Why you should buy the LG 34-inch UltraGear OLED Curved Gaming Monitor LG may not be in our list of the best gaming monitors, but it\u2019s a huge name in the TV world, so its display panels are an ideal choice for anyone who wants vibrant colors and sharp imagery. In the case of this LG 34-inch UltraGear OLED Curved Gaming Monitor, you get a 34-inch 21:9 OLED panel with a resolution of 3440 x 1440. The 1440p resolution is fantastic for most of the best gaming PCs, with 4K still far from essential in PC gaming. For one of the best laptop deals, head over to B&H Photo Video, where you can buy an HP 15.6-inch ZBook Power G10 Mobile Workstation for a massive $1,600 off the regular price. Previously $3,449, the laptop is down to $1,849, with strictly limited stock remaining. Once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. This is a high-end business laptop and one that\u2019s sure to delight many. Here\u2019s all you need to know -- remember to be quick with your purchase! Why you should buy the HP 15.6-inch ZBook Power G10 Mobile Workstation Over the years, HP has developed its reputation as one of the best laptop brands with strong reliability, good customer service, and some good looks. The best HP laptops are worth keeping an eye on. With the HP 15.6-inch ZBook Power G10 Mobile Workstation, you get a 13th-generation Intel Core i9-13900H processor, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage, so this is fairly high-end stuff when it comes to business performance.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"January 30, 2025 January 30, 2025 Tesla, the most valuable automaker in the world valued at over $1 trillion, did not pay any federal income tax last year. Tesla\u2019s annual financial report, released this morning, shows the company enjoyed $2.3 billion of U.S. income in 2024 on which it reports precisely zero current federal income tax. Over the past three years, the Elon Musk-led company reports $10.8 billion of U.S. income on which its current federal tax was just $48 million. That comes to a three-year federal tax rate of just 0.4 percent \u2013 more than 50 times less than the statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent. Source: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, January 2025 Tesla saved half a billion in taxes last year using accelerated depreciation. Tax breaks for executive stock options shaved a quarter billion off the company\u2019s tax bill. Unspecified \u201cU.S. tax credits\u201d were good for $300 million of tax savings. Musk\u2019s company also used net operating losses to offset current year income, although it\u2019s hard to know how much of that affects U.S. income rather than the company\u2019s far-larger foreign income. Congress might give Tesla even more tax breaks. A bill passed by the House of Representatives in the previous Congress would have retroactively reinstated a provision allowing full expensing of research and development expenses which could save the company up to $2.4 billion in taxes.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":" \u0394 A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.  \u0394 This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and\u00a0Verite News, a nonprofit news organization with a mission to produce in-depth journalism in underserved communities in the New Orleans area. Despite President Donald Trump\u2019s calls to \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d many oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico will likely do what they\u2019ve done for years: sit on hundreds of untapped oil leases across millions of acres.\u00a0 Trump has repeatedly said eliminating barriers to drilling will unlock vast untapped reserves of \u201cliquid gold\u201d and ignite a new era of national prosperity. But most of the drilling leases already granted to companies in the oil-rich Gulf are idle and unused, and they\u2019ll stay that way until the United States\u2019 record-breaking production rates wane and the high costs of drilling offshore drop precipitously.\u00a0 Of the 2,206 active leases in the Gulf, only a fifth are producing oil, according to\u00a0records\u00a0from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which regulates offshore drilling. Oil industry executives and analysts say the current number of 448 oil-producing leases is unlikely to grow significantly, even if Trump makes good on promises to expand leasing opportunities and expedite drilling permits.\u00a0 Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The market is saturated with oil, making companies reluctant to spend more money drilling because the added product will likely push prices down, cutting into profits.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not the regulations that are getting in the way, it\u2019s the economics,\u201d said Hugh Daigle, a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas in Austin. \u201cIt\u2019s true that there are a bunch of undeveloped leases in the Gulf, and it\u2019ll stay that way if we continue to see low or stagnant oil prices.\u201d Global oil production is expected to grow more than demand over the next two years, likely forcing the price of crude to drop 8 percent in 2025 and another 11 percent next year, according to a\u00a0January forecast\u00a0from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA. The Gulf accounts for\u00a097 percent of all offshore oil and gas production\u00a0in the U.S. Nearly 12 million acres are under active leases in the Gulf, but only about 2.4 million acres are being used to produce oil and gas, according to BOEM data. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How So, what\u2019s the actual benefit of a quicker and easier regulatory process for companies that don\u2019t appear to need more leases? \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d said Brett Hartl, the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s government affairs director. \u201cThe companies make more money when they have to spend less time and effort on permits and environmental regulations and mitigation.\u201d A host of environmental and worker safety rules enacted after the\u00a02010 Deepwater Horizon oil disaster\u00a0has made obtaining a lease and drilling permit a multi-year process. Companies must demonstrate their operations are prepared to deal with potential blowouts and worst-case-scenario discharges, and all drilling platform designs and materials must undergo certification by independent engineers.\u00a0 It\u2019s unclear how the Trump administration will change these and other offshore drilling rules. During Trump\u2019s first term, his administration loosened requirements for offshore well designs, materials, and monitoring technology. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0reinstated\u00a0most of these rules.\u00a0 Oil companies cheered Trump\u2019s recent calls for a more streamlined process and a\u00a0series of energy-related executive orders\u00a0he signed this month. The orders declared an \u201cenergy emergency,\u201d expanded drilling in the Arctic and\u00a0repealed Biden\u2019s ban on drilling\u00a0off the East and West coasts and parts of Alaska.\u00a0 \u201cDirecting regulators to expand access to resources [and] streamline permitting processes \u2026 will help deliver a stronger, more prosperous energy future for all Americans,\u201d Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement last week. \u201cThis is a new day for American energy, and we applaud President Trump for moving swiftly to chart a new path where U.S. oil and natural gas are embraced, not restricted.\u201d But industry leaders have also been clear that these and other policy changes floated by Trump won\u2019t lead to more drilling. The U.S. is already producing more crude oil than any country, ever, according to the\u00a0EIA. Last year\u2019s production rate of 13 million barrels per day was a\u00a0new record high, surpassing the previous record set in 2023. \u201cI don\u2019t think today that production in the U.S. is constrained,\u201d ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods\u00a0told Semafor\u00a0in November. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s an opportunity to unleash a lot of production in the near term, because most operators in the U.S. are [already] optimizing their production today.\u201d In essence, oil is just too cheap to justify more drilling. If prices do go up, companies are likely to tap into Permian Basin shale in Texas and New Mexico rather than seek offshore reserves, which cost more to drill, according to industry analysts.\u00a0\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t mean companies won\u2019t snap up even more offshore leases if they\u2019re offered, Daigle said.\u00a0 \u201cSome of these (leases) might be drilled in the future, but many are being held just so somebody else doesn\u2019t lease them,\u201d he said. Companies may also stockpile leases to raise funds from investors, or they may simply be playing \u201cmind games\u201d with competitors. Buying up leases in one area of the Gulf can sometimes throw rival drillers off the scent of richer deposits elsewhere, Daigle said.\u00a0 Leases have been sold too quickly and cheaply in recent decades, according to a 2021\u00a0report\u00a0by the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees BOEM. This fast and loose approach \u201cshortchanges taxpayers\u201d and encourages \u201cspeculators to purchase leases with the intent of waiting for increases in resource prices, adding assets to their balance sheets, or even reselling leases at profit rather than attempting to produce oil or gas,\u201d the report said.\u00a0 \u201cMore leases may make the companies look good, on paper, to investors,\u201d said Tom Pelton, communications director for the Environmental Integrity Project, an environmental watchdog group. \u201cBut they won\u2019t necessarily even produce more oil and gas. And they certainly will not be good for the climate or clean water.\u201d If Trump really wanted to slash energy prices for U.S. consumers, he wouldn\u2019t have\u00a0banned offshore wind leasing\u00a0in federal waters or\u00a0restarted permitting\u00a0for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, said Scott Eustis, the community science director for Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit environmental group.\u00a0 Shipping LNG overseas contributes to higher electricity and natural gas prices in the U.S., according to a recent U.S. Department of Energy\u00a0report. \u201cLNG exports make everybody\u2019s energy cost more because we\u2019re giving it to China and not using it domestically,\u201d Eustis said.\u00a0 Beyond the economics, giving companies an easier route to secure leases and permits does little more than put the Gulf at risk of another Deepwater Horizon-scale disaster, Hartl said. \u201cThe only result we\u2019ll have is more risky drilling,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the question is not \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019 we\u2019ll have the next catastrophic spill in the Gulf.\u201d  A message from \u00a0\u00a0   Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Reviews ethics statement      Adding extra to your savings can help you reach your financial goals quicker.    Since the Federal Reserve voted to hold rates steady this month, there's a chance your savings rate could do the same. Currently, the best high-yield savings account rates have APYs over 4%.\u00a0 There's still a chance that the central bank will cut rates later this year, but rates are holding steady for now. And since banks usually move in the same direction as the central bank, your savings rate may remain unchanged for the coming weeks. However, we don't recommend waiting to see if these rates stick around since many factors influence a bank's decision to raise or lower APYs. Here's more on the best savings rates and the banks that offer them.\u00a0 Experts recommend comparing rates before opening a savings account to get the best APY possible. Enter your information below to get CNET's partners' best rate for your area. Since the Federal Reserve decided to hold rates steady, there's a chance savings rates could do the same. Here's why.\u00a0 When the central bank raises or lowers its federal funds rate range, banks tend to follow suit by moving borrowing and savings rates in the same direction. When the Fed slashed interest rates to spur spending at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, savings rates dropped, too. The best savings rates were well over 5% APY a year ago. But as inflation showed signs of cooling toward the end of the year, the Fed lowered rates three times. Banks mostly followed the Fed's lead, cutting APYs on savings accounts. Citing a strong jobs market and rising inflation, the Fed left rates alone this week, so you may have more time to earn interest on your savings at the current rates. We still don't recommend waiting because banks could decide to lower savings rates further. Experts say that a high-yield savings account should still be a part of your money strategy this year. In addition to earning interest, the accounts offer flexibility to deposit and withdraw money when you need it. \"People may hesitate if it's worth it to open a HYSA with the lower rates we are currently seeing,\" said Danielle Flores, a CNET Money Expert Review Board member and founder of I Like to Dabble. \"It is always worth it to earn a little extra on your already saved money.\" \ud83d\udcb0You can earn up to 4.65% APY on the best CDs. Check out today's rates. Since credit unions and online-only banks are most likely to offer high-yield savings accounts, that may change how you manage your savings. For example, some online-only banks don't accept cash deposits and may not have physical locations for in-person assistance. Here are some other factors to consider when opening a HYSA. CNET reviewed savings accounts at more than 50 traditional and online banks, credit unions and financial institutions with nationwide services. Each account received a score between one (lowest) and five (highest). The savings accounts listed here are all insured up to $250,000 per person, per account category, per institution, by the FDIC or NCUA. CNET evaluates the best savings accounts using a set of established criteria that compares annual percentage yields, monthly fees, minimum deposits or balances, and access to physical branches. None of the banks on our list charge monthly maintenance fees. An account will rank higher for offering any of the following perks: A savings account may be rated lower if it doesn't have an easy-to-navigate website or if it doesn't offer helpful features like an ATM card. Accounts that impose restrictive residency requirements or fees for exceeding monthly transaction limits may also be rated lower. *APYs as of Jan. 31, 2025, based on the banks we track at CNET.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you're into 3D printing, then you're probably familiar with Bambu Lab and its super-premium products.

This still might seem like a lot to pay, but it's a \u00a3220 saving on the original price tag of \u00a31,439. I've been dreaming of owning a Bambu Lab printer since I first discovered what a Benchy was, but always been put off by the eye-watering price. The X1 Carbon is undoubtedly one of the best 3D printers on the market right now, with quality multicolour AMS compatibility making it hugely popular with sellers of flexis and fidget models, and with cosplayers making props too. If you don't need the AMS (automated material system) included with the X1 Carbon for multicolour prints, then there's also a deal cutting \u00a3180 off the standalone machine over at Bambu Lab. If you're based in the US, you haven't been forgotten. There's a deal on the X1C at Bambu Lab's US store too with $100 off, which isn't quite as generous as the UK discounts we're seeing, but still better than nothing. I've got all the details on these deals for you below. Save \u00a3220: The Bambu Lab X1 Carbon is a top choice for professional creatives, sellers, prop makers, and hobbyists (with a larger budget). It's certainly not cheap, even after this price cut, but some might say it's an investment if you're seeking the best quality prints possible.

But with that said, Bambu printers are clearly worth their value, as I'm yet to see a negative review for a Bambu Lab machine.  Save $70: If you're looking for a less expensive Bambu Lab printer, then there's also this deal on the A1 combo model, which shares a lot of the same features as the X1 Combo, such as the ability to print in more than one filament colour or material.

{"date":"2025-01-31","content":"Haliey Welch, famously known as the \u201cHawk Tuah Girl,\u201d has not posted a single episode of her podcast, Talk Tuah, since launching her meme coin, $HAWK, eight weeks ago. The abrupt silence from Welch has fueled speculation among fans and investors, especially as legal troubles mount around the cryptocurrency\u2019s rapid rise and fall. Welch skyrocketed to internet stardom in mid-2024 after a viral street interview where she responded with the now-infamous phrase \u201cHawk Tuah.\u201d Her sudden fame led to brand deals, public appearances, and the launch of Talk Tuah, a podcast meant to capitalize on her growing audience. However, Welch\u2019s most ambitious move came in December 2024, when she entered the volatile world of cryptocurrency with the launch of $HAWK, a meme coin marketed as a community-driven digital asset. The token quickly gained traction, reaching a staggering $500 million market capitalization at its peak. Despite its initial success, $HAWK\u2019s value plummeted within weeks, wiping out millions in investments. Accusations of a \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d scheme surfaced, with investors alleging that early backers\u2014potentially including Welch\u2019s team\u2014artificially inflated the coin\u2019s value before selling off large holdings. Welch has denied any wrongdoing, blaming external market forces for the coin\u2019s decline. However, her prolonged silence and lack of transparency have only added fuel to the fire. In the wake of the collapse, disgruntled investors have filed a lawsuit against the developers behind $HAWK, accusing them of fraudulent misrepresentation and improper registration. Notably, Welch has not been named as a defendant in the case, suggesting that her role may have been more promotional than operational. Still, questions linger about her involvement, as she heavily endorsed the coin in social media posts leading up to its launch. Critics argue that even if Welch wasn\u2019t directly managing the project, she played a key role in attracting investors. Adding to the mystery, Welch has largely disappeared from the public eye since the controversy erupted. Her last podcast episode was released on December 4, 2024\u2014the same week $HAWK launched. Since then, there have been no new uploads, social media posts, or public appearances. The absence of any statement addressing the scandal has led to growing speculation. Some believe Welch is distancing herself to avoid legal entanglements, while others suspect she may be reevaluating her next move. Despite the current backlash, Welch still commands a massive following, and many fans remain loyal. If she chooses to return, she could potentially rebrand herself, issue a public explanation, or even relaunch Talk Tuah with a new direction. However, the damage to her reputation may already be done. With lawsuits pending and trust eroded among investors, Welch faces an uphill battle if she hopes to regain credibility. For now, her silence speaks louder than words. Whether she\u2019s planning a comeback or choosing to step away from the spotlight remains to be seen.
