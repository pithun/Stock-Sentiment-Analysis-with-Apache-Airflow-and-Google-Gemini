{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Business Insider Edition  Phil Levin got an idea that would later inspire his next business venture when he and his wife, Kristen Berman, decided to move out of their San Francisco group home to have more space for kids.          One big hangup was that the real estate founder and behavioral scientist couple didn't want to leave the friends with whom they shared their lives.               Suspecting others felt the same, they founded a compound in Oakland, California, named Radish, where they live with about 20 adults and several babies in a variety of houses and apartments on a one-third-acre lot. They share an outdoor space, hot tub, trailer for guests, and a few communal indoor spaces. The friends watch each other's kids, cook together, and just hang out.               That personal experiment inspired Levin to start a company called Live Near Friends, which helps clients who want to live closer to family and friends find suitable real estate, such as a duplex or a lot that can house multiple small homes.               Levin is convinced that having a support network within a five-minute walk is the key to a happy life.               It might also be the key to more affordable housing. States and cities nationwide have legalized so-called \"missing middle housing,\" which includes duplexes, townhomes, small apartment buildings, backyard tiny homes, and converted garages, creating a business opportunity for entrepreneurs like Levin.               These diverse housing types offer cheaper options and more housing diversity \u2014\u00a0and they're more conducive to communal living than the detached single-family homes on large lots that dominate the American urban landscape. This can help urban dwellers stay in their neighborhoods rather than being priced out of the city to isolating suburban subdivisions.               \"We're sort of opening up these new categories and types of real estate for people and trying to show them how they apply them to their own fantasy of living near friends and family,\" said Levin, who previously co-founded a car-free real estate development company called Culdesac. He connects his clients with real estate agents, developers, and architects, who can bring their vision to fruition.               Levin says he wants to show developers and city planners that there's growing demand for more community-oriented, medium-density housing. He compares his business model to Airbnb, which has aggregated and juiced the demand for short-term rentals and reshaped housing markets around the world.               \"We want the people that build real estate and actually determine the physical form of our built environments\" to think of housing and neighborhoods \"as a web of social connection, rather than just a bunch of isolated, atomic housing units,\" he said.               A family in Fremont, California, is taking advantage of the new state laws to keep their multigenerational household together. Anjan, a Silicon Valley software engineer, wanted his parents as close as possible, so he and his wife are building a second home on the same lot their single-family house sits on so his parents can live steps from their two grandchildren.               Having his parents so close \"makes a huge difference in the quality of life,\" said Anjan, who asked to go by just his first name to protect his privacy. \"It really does help having the person close by or live right next to you.\"               Catherine Woodiwiss is evidence of that demand. The 38-year-old design researcher spent her 20s and early 30s living in a series of group houses with fellow creatives and do-gooders in Washington, DC. When she moved to Austin for graduate school, she built her new community around another shared house. It was more affordable to live with housemates, but it was also fun and supportive, she found. She built some of her closest relationships with her housemates and collaborated on projects like activist trainings and music nights.               \"I made friends with people I never would have found or made friends with otherwise,\" she said.               But that came to an abrupt end in 2023 when Woodiwiss' Austin group house disbanded. She wanted to stay in her neighborhood, but there were few affordable options outside of an apartment designed for one.               For the first time, Woodiwiss moved into her own place \u2014 a smaller apartment in a large building. There are perks of living alone that she's since grown to appreciate, chiefly the time, energy, and \"headspace\" she's reclaimed. But 18 months in, she still doesn't know the names of anyone in her building, as she said her new neighbors keep to themselves and the building lacks spaces that could foster casual social interactions.               Recently, Woodiwiss visited friends who live at Radish. The community offers the kind of casual, but structured connection she craves.               \"I'm both really happy with where I am and can feel that there is a level of commitment and a level of intentional community or intentional collective living that I still really long for,\" she said.               In recent years, California has loosened zoning restrictions to facilitate more infill housing across the state as part of its effort to address soaring home prices and rents caused by a housing shortage.               Some real estate companies and developers are already responding to the demand \u2014 and the changing laws. The Oakland-based firm BuildCasa was founded in 2022 in response to a California law making it easier to subdivide lots and build additional homes on them. The company works with homeowners \u2014 including Anjan \u2014 who want to split or purchase lots, and with developers who want to build starter homes and other infill housing.               The houses and condos built on properties like Anjan's tend to be between 800 and 1,200 square feet and sell for between 30 and 40% less than the average single-family home in the same neighborhood, said BuildCasa's co-founder and CEO, Ben Bear.               BuildCasa co-founder and architect Paul Steidl grew up in an old mixed-use neighborhood of townhomes in Pittsburgh that he says informs his support for missing middle housing. \"When I was younger, when my parents were both working, I could go over to a neighbor's house right next door, or be able to walk down the street to the corner store,\" Steidl said. \"That's an important aspect of my upbringing that I realized growing up wasn't really common for a lot of people that grew up in the US.\"               Bear and Steidl said they've seen growing demand from developers and philanthropic organizations, which view infill construction as both a business opportunity and a way to address the housing shortage and affordability crisis.       Greenville, South Carolina, is one of the places expanding more sociable living options. Grant Taleck, a content creator who's made videos about communal living for Live Near Friends, is starting the process of building an ADU in his backyard. The city's recently loosened development code makes this possible.               Taleck realized he wasn't alone in wanting to live near friends when his videos about so-called \"cottage courts\" \u2014 clusters of starter homes \u2014 and how Americans love the college experience because campuses are walkable communities went viral. The Florida native has already convinced his mother and one of his best friends to move to Greenville, selling them on the city's plentiful \"third spaces,\" walkability, and mixed-use design. He hopes a friend will move into his ADU.               \"It's not that hard to convince people,\" he said. \"Once they visit here, they're like, Okay, I want to be here. It's really special.\"       Do you live near or with friends or in a communal living arrangement? Or do you aspire to? Share your story with this reporter at erelman@businessinsider.com.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Not all phones are built for fast app-switching, but a select few excel at it.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Modern smartphones are powerful computers that can do a lot at once, but a small screen ensures that a poorly designed user interface will severely restrict how well someone can multitask. Unfortunately, the stock Android multitasking UI, known as Overview, leaves a lot to be desired, meaning phones that opt for this interface simply don't multitask as well as others.  Android Central Labs is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between. Much of this frustration started for me when the Android team redesigned the multitasking UI during the Android 9 Pie update. Instead of the vertically-scrolling card interface that showed four or five apps at a time, Google's design team opted to follow the old Palm Pre model of large, horizontally scrolling cards \u2014 something that isn't very surprising given the head designer of Android was also on the Palm WebOS team. This new design made multitasking very inefficient because only one large app card is visible on the screen at a time, while a sliver of one additional app is shown off to the side. There's no way to tell what app is next in the list until it appears, making it hard to switch quickly between more than two apps at a time. Thankfully, companies like OnePlus, Vivo, Samsung, and a few others have figured out that this UI isn't the best. From grids of apps to floating windows, triple-app split screens, and quick app switching, I've picked out my favorite Android multitasking UIs that'll let you get more done in less time. The most efficient way to multitask on a modern Android phone is to use swipe gestures, not the traditional 3-button navigation layout, so many of the gesture-based features I speak about below are dependent on that setting.  OnePlus and Oppo phones let you quickly switch between 10 apps at once with a single swipe and a tap. OnePlus has the best default multitasking UI you'll find on any Android phone, but it wasn't always that way. Back when Android 9 Pie came out, OnePlus quickly adopted Google's terrible UI but realized its mistake when its most loyal users were unhappy with the oversimplified UI. Since then, OnePlus' multitasking UI design has managed to bridge the best of every idea, offering a quick way to instantly swap between seven apps at once, run two apps at once, and even quickly hover a third app on the screen. From the overview UI, it's possible to choose from the last 10 apps with a single swipe and a tap. This is thanks to the quick slider at the bottom that shows the icons of each app along with a large card of the app above it. This is the fastest you can switch between apps on any Android UI and it's also available on OPPO phones thanks to the company's merging of Color OS and Oxygen OS code bases. Ironically, this UI is very similar to what Apple used to have in iOS 7-9 before the iPhone X came out. I say ironically because the company made multitasking worse by removing the bottom row of icons, but thankfully, OnePlus and OPPO realized their mistake and capitalized on it. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android  You can also quickly split the screen or make the current app float by dragging your thumb up from the bottom of the screen until the current app card rests in the \"floating\" or \"split\" sections that appear on the screen. Some other phones, like Samsung, have a version of this feature but don't allow you to do it in a single swipe. The introduction of the Canvas feature from the OnePlus Open was rolled into the Oxygen OS 15\/Color OS 15 update for any eligible phone and allows you to run split-screen apps in a \"nearly full-screen\" mode. This makes it more convenient to use split-screen mode because you can have the prominent app take up 90% of the display while the other rests at the bottom 10%, waiting to be maximized.  Vivo offers a selection of a grid or AOSP-style card list right on the Overview screen. Out of the box, Vivo users can quickly select between the traditional single-large-card UI and a tablet-like grid of cards with the tap of a button. On the Overview UI, just tap the icon at the bottom to switch between the two views, making it easy to select from 4 apps via a single tap and another four with a swipe. You can find this grid of cards on other phones, but most require you to do something special to enable it. Foldable phones usually only have this UI on the large inner display, and while Samsung phones offer several similar UI options, you have to separately download the Good Lock app from the Galaxy Apps store along with a separate module just to find the option. Vivo makes it available via a single tap on all its phones.  Vivo's UI also features the same swipe-up-and-hold to either split or float the active window that's on OnePlus and OPPO phones. In fact, most phones from China sport this feature, making us wonder why Samsung, Google, Motorola, and others don't implement it.  Samsung's default stacked cards in One UI 7 offers kinetic scrolling, improving the stock experience, but the real key lies in using one of the many Good Lock alternatives. Samsung finally got with the program and did something about the terrible stock multitasking UI in Android when it began rolling out the One UI 7 beta at the end of 2024. The new UI looks like a mash-up of Android and iOS designs, sporting the stacked card look of iOS with the four quick icons at the bottom. The problem with Samsung's design is that the icons at the bottom aren't based on active apps. They're based on an algorithm Google built into Android that tries to figure out which apps you use most often. That means these icons are almost never the same, and while they can sometimes be helpful, the lack of consistency is more a problem than a help. At the least, Samsung's cards \"snap\" into place, making it easier to focus on each one as it passes by. But you don't have to deal with this nonsense UI if you really want to multitask. Just download Good Lock and change basically anything you see on the Overview screen.  With Good Lock, you can select from five different \"task changer\" UI designs. List is the default option that shows one vertical card at a time. Grid is the one I praised Vivo for including by default, and it shows six app cards on screen at a time. Stack is the new default in One UI 7 and shows one prominent card up front with three cards \"peaking\" behind it. This one makes it easier to see what app is next in the list but doesn't enhance multitasking as much as the Grid option does. The Vertical List option resembles the original Galaxy Nexus multitasking UI of vertically-scrolling cards, which makes better use of screen space than the default horizontal list. The last option, Slim List, is the \"real\" power user option as it offers seven apps to choose from immediately. Samsung also offers hover and split-screen app options, but you need to open up the Overview UI first, then long-press on a card and drag it to the appropriate action. This is an extra step versus what Vivo, OnePlus, OPPO, and other Chinese brands offer.  Book style foldables offer multiple ways to multitask, and most have a pinnable dock that allows for one-tap multitasking. Technically, book-style foldables like the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the OnePlus Open offer the best multitasking experience on any phone, but not everyone likes the size of these devices. Most offer a different multitasking experience on the smaller outer display than what's on the big inner display. Some foldables, like the Honor Magic V3 below, don't have an option to \"pin\" the dock at the bottom of the screen. Most other book-style foldables, however, allow you to have this dock present at all times, meaning multitasking is a single tap away at all times.  OnePlus wins the award for best foldable multitasking UI because its small screen UI is identical to its other phones, including that handy row of app icons at the bottom. When you open the phone, you'll find there's no real reason to ever open Overview, thanks to the app dock at the bottom of the screen. While most foldables have this dock now thanks to Samsung and Android 12L, OnePlus one-ups things with its Canvas software that lets you run three apps at a time on the big screen. You can arrange these in several ways, but it takes multitasking to a new level.  Many Android manufacturers have chosen to stick mostly to the stock UI but add a few convenience features. Motorola and Google offer quick action buttons at the bottom for taking a screenshot, allowing you to screenshot an app in the Overview UI without having to reopen it. I'm not sure who uses this, but I've never found myself tapping the button other than to see what it does. Motorola also offers a button below the cards that locks the app in memory, making it a priority to stay in RAM for quick access in case the phone is running low. This is best for phones like the Moto G 2025 that only have 4GB of RAM and might reload apps often. A third button is available from the Overview UI on some Motorola phones when the sidebar gesture option is enabled, allowing apps to be quickly floated with a tap and then moved into a semi-hidden side panel when minimized. Google Pixel phones have a screenshot button and a second \"Select\" button that can extract text from an app tile, but it's far slower and clunkier than just swiping between two apps using the gesture bar at the bottom of the screen. Some cards on the Pixel Overview UI also have a quick \"copy link\" or \"copy image\" button, which is actually quite handy on some occasions. Overall, though, the Pixel's Overview UI is overengineered and poorly designed.  These companies add something to the barebones AOSP experience but don't fix the core problem of the large card design. Honor keeps the default giant card UI but enhances things by adding a small button to the top right of each card to instantly float the window. This doesn't help with switching between more than two apps quickly, but it's at least a little better for juggling three apps when you have one floating. Honor also has a quick hover and split-screen action when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and drag the card to the appropriate action. Nothing doesn't add any buttons to the Overview UI but does allow users to quickly float the active app by sliding up from the bottom of the screen until the card gets to the top half of the screen. This will put the app in a floating window for nicer multitasking, complete with clearly marked \"minimize\" and \"close\" buttons in the app's floating frame (similar to Motorola), but overall, it's the most basic of all four companies listed here. While these four companies do something better than AOSP, they're niche features that you probably won't use all the time. They don't fix the main problem, which is the inefficient single giant card on the screen and no real way to quickly switch to another app without needless scrolling. Additionally, none of them offer the kinetic scrolling Samsung offers, making it more difficult to find the app you want as the card goes whizzing by.  I find it very hard to understand why Google hasn't fixed this UI in the seven years since Android 9 Pie was released. I got excited when the first Pixel Fold was unveiled in May 2023 and showcased a grid-like multitasking UI, only to later find out that this UI only appeared on the large inner display, not the outer display that I used most of the time. The bottom line is that Android's default Overview multitasking UI needs a huge facelift. The best alternative right now is OnePlus's default design, which takes the large card format and substantially enhances it with a simple icon grid below, making it easy to switch between the last 10 apps with a single swipe and a tap. Every other company convolutes this process in some way, with the next-best option falling under the grid format on Vivo and Samsung phones or the vertically-scrolling \"slim list\" on Samsung's Good Lock app. Any company that opts for stock Android is simply stuck with the worst option possible, making multitasking a chore rather than a joy. Google needs to address this with Android 16, and it needs to happen ASAP. You have lots of options to choose from, Google. Any of them would be an improvement over what's currently available. Thanks.

Something like that, I know people who swear by those because they are arguably the best of both worlds, especially here in the US where the power grid isn't really reliable in places. BMW makes a lot of motorcycle engines, so I guess they are still equipped to build hybrid drivetrains like that of the i3. With battery density increasing, it could be possible to have that small displacement engine there idle most of the time just in case 100 or 200 miles of ev range are not enough.

The American dream is to do what you want and to make money doing something you're good at. Not to be cuddled by a government to the point where people get stuck in arrested development with a childlike mentality where think they should get whatever they want for free and can throw a tantrum when they don't.In the end Trump massively upsetting the economy is going to be a positive thing, but it will get messy at first as the deck is getting reshuffled.When you're a decade into the \"messy at first\" part will you admit you were wrong? They're stacking the deck right now for the uber-rich to control even more aspects of our country. In fact, putting one of them in charge of a made-up organization whose sole purpose seems to be to fuck shit up with no oversight and no one able to stand up to them or tell them no.

I didn't buy 2 EVs to save the planet. I bought them because EVs are far cheaper to run than ICEs, and they're far more reliable. There are no $250 oil changes every 3 months or annual \"service intervals\" at $2K a pop. It's also significantly cheaper to fill an EV than an ICE. Our main EV (Model X) used $1700 in electricity last year with zero scheduled maintenance to cover 28K miles. That's $0.06\/mile. The SUV we had before that cost $110 to fill and got 18 miles to the gallon if you took it easy. It also required an annual recommended service at Lexus that was never less than $1500. So the Tesla cost $1700 to cover 28,000 miles, the Lexus cost $6000 in fuel plus $1000 in oil changes, and a $1500 annual service. So to drive the same distance in comparable cars, the EV cost $1700 while the ICE cost $8500, so for us, ICEs were 5x more expensive to drive. There's absolutely no way I will ever go back to an ICE for a daily driver, and arguments against EVs are always from people who don't have one. Now, they're not a good fit for everybody. Regardless of what others claim, you really need an EV charger at home if you drive more than 20 miles a day. If you take regular road trips beyond 150 miles each way, you're going to find stopping to charge for 20 minutes isn't fun regardless of what toys are available on the touch screen. So there are caveats, but for us, it's been a significantly better experience than we had with 2 Lexus ICEs. I bought them because EVs are far cheaper to run than ICEs, and they're far more reliable. There are no $250 oil changes every 3 months or annual \"service intervals\" at $2K a pop. Nobody in their right mind spends $250 on an oil change and $2k on an annual service. At those prices no wonder you think ICE's are expensive I bought them because EVs are far cheaper to run than ICEs, and they're far more reliable.

At those prices no wonder you think ICE's are expensive I don't know how long your loan was, but 28,000 miles in even just the 8 years is under 300 miles a month.  Why would you have even had to change the tires? There are no $250 oil changes every 3 months or annual \"service intervals\" at $2K a pop.While I'm with you and own an EV now myself, this stupid meme has to die. No new car needs an oil change every three months, and they don't have annual service intervals either. Most cars demand an oil change every 2 years or 25,000 miles or so.If you want to talk about cost of maintenance then stick to the actual things that need maintain, rather than what the local garage is trying to upsell you on. Which are numerous in their own right, an engine has lots of moving parts that wear over time and few years  There are no $250 oil changes every 3 months or annual \"service intervals\" at $2K a pop.

Driver fatigue is responsible for about 20% of fatal accidents. Get to where you're going safely, not quickly. Stop smell the roses, drink a coffee, stretch your legs, SURVIVE. There's a reason some countries have legal requirements for 15min breaks every 2 hours of driving for professional drivers. This is even worse for driving on a straight long highway, which ... well America.

On one side, Trump\u2019s America which he\u2019s committed to ICE (so this announcement makes sense) and tariffs on steel and quite possibly EU autos in the future (so this announcement makes less sense). OTOH, there\u2019s China, which was a growth driver for them, but in which they\u2019re losing ground and profitability due to Chinese OEMs\u2019 offerings and a market focused on EVs. And then t  After renting a BMW a couple of weeks ago, I'll never own a gas car.  Sure, the acceleration is terrible.  But it's like learning to drive all over again.  It's difficult to know how fast one is driving as there's inconsistent engine sound.  The jerky acceleration as the gears shift was nerve racking.  The car itself was noisy, far too much road and engine noise fo ra car this expensive.  Refuelling at the office was a PIA, they didn't have a gas station, so I had to go to a gas station, wait in line, then stand in the freezing cold holding a smelly gas pump to refill the tank, rather than just waking up to a full charge in the morning.  THe damn thing shut off at a traffic light when I opened the door becuase I thought it was not closed tightly and only knew it when the light changed to green and woudln't go.  And hte field of view was just awful, all I could see was hood. Granted, some of these things are just related to the learning curve and my co-workers did tell me 'you get used to it.\"  But I didn't see how ANY of them contributed to an improved experience over my Ioniq 5.  And many contributed to unsafe driving. I would have expected a user with a UID as low as yours would have gotten used to gas cars in back in 1980. Well, actually, that's the funny part. Back in the 80s, cars had a range of about 400 KM on a tank of gas, and had to be plugged in, in the winter, if you wanted them to start eight hours later.  Parking lots at factories and office parks had outlets at each parking spot. I'm also old enough to remember long lines at gas stations and what not, and gas stations weren't as ubiquitous as they are now.  Hell, I remember contacting CAA, Canadian Tire and similar to get road trip directions including gas stations. B  I once drove a Tractor and decided that the internal combustion engine just isn't useful for a car. - That's an analogy of what you just said. I'm with you by the way. I've driven plenty of Teslas and I it was primarily the reason which is why my current EV is not a Tesla. They are simply rubbish cars. To compare them to EVs on the other hand is just stupid. To look at the things you list for example: I can configure my car to respond like an automatic and coast. I can configure it to respond like a manual a  The political winds are wildly distorting peoples' EV outlooks.   I know it sounds ridiculous, but take just a moment of time, close your eyes, and imagine a future where we've solved most of our climate concerns. What does that world look like for the United States, for example? Will everyone be driving a gas car? Will everyone be taking mass transit? The answer to both of these questions is probably no.   In countries like the United States you can't shift everyone to mass transit without a mass migration t  EVs also currently have way more value in an urban area.  That's where you get concentrations of exhaust, which also leads to ozone problems in the summer.  It's where you get stop and go traffic that wastes fuel.  And it's where you are generally driving shorter distances. No point rallying against them because it really is the better option for a lot of people by population, just not necessarily by land area.   ...death cultist.

Cost really isn't the issue anymore, it's lack of charging infrastructure (possibly also mixed a bit with an unwillingness to make a 30 minute DCFC pit stop during road trips) and\/or concerns over long-term battery calendar lifespan.  A smaller, but probably still significant factor is that many Americans see their car as an extension of their identity, and EV ownership may not necessarily align with some folks' political leanings.As far as hybrid pricing goes, back when my partner and I were shopping for his new car, we looked at the pricing for a Prius and noped right out of that.  The '23 Bolt EUV ended up being substantially cheaper.  I'm sure if road tripping was a concern the Prius would've been a better fit, but we just needed a daily commuter that would be charged at home every night, and for our use case the extra expense and complexity of a hybrid powertrain was just superfluous.  Do we regret our decision?  Not at all.  In fact, a few months later I ended up trading in my '19 Nissan Versa for another Bolt.

Add the prices of a Dacia and a Ferrari, divide by two and the result will look like everyone is driving a Porsche.Also, most people don't buy new cars anyway. You're not wrong to point this out, since it's a major error made in discussing lots of things. Especially salaries. But it's not quite that big an issue with car sales. The best selling vehicle in the US in 2024 was the F-150, which starts at $36K for the lowest trim. Not far off from the $48K average. Silverado was #2 at $37K for the most basic model. It's not until you get to the Honda Civic at #10 that the MSRP gets under $25K, again only at the lowest trim. So a $48K average is definitely skewed because  If they can't afford a Model 3 at ~$43k, then they also can't afford most new cars with gasoline enginesexcept to the extent that EV owners keep their cars longer, thus delaying their ability to purchase used EVs.You're right.  A lot of people can't afford new cars period.  But EVs are also a better value for the money because of longevity.Price is definitely a problem here.  But it's because there are not enough used EVs on the market.  They've been around for a while but because of how sales and production are accelerating, most are recent purchases.

We've always been making new cars.  Throwing out old cars just drives up prices. People don't seem to understand that new sales drive adoption but most people are buying used.  I think EVs are the better buy for new if the price isn't overblown.  But I'm not in the market for new right now. The longevity might be too good, though.  There might not be such a large market of used EVs.  Or at least that would be true if cabin interiors were made to be able to be refreshed easily.  Everything is viny  How can you invest in a country where your profits depend on the mood of the president? How can you invest in a country where your profits depend on the mood of the president?

That's the point of making it $50k. So you have to lease it and get into a cycle of endless debt. Ownership is not for the masses and is bad for profits. If I sell you a car you might come back in 3 years or 10 years for a new one. If I lease you a car, then you will come back because you have no choice. Can't afford the payment to buy, look at these nice lease deals, just a few grand down upfront and this low payment for 36 months, then you have no equity and can do it all over again. The car lease is for the people who would have traded in at 36 months anyway.  They would have gotten a much worse deal trading into a dealer.  But the lease agreement keeps the vehicle in a better condition for resale, so it's a bit of a win-win for them. Either way, the car doesn't get scrapped - it lives for a long time after as a used vehicle. And cars have no equity.  The only way to get your money's worth is to buy a car and keep it for 10+ years. Or is it the lack of $7500 handout where taxpayers helped pay for people's new cars?Technically, the rebate is your own money.

Can you explain how we are going to find all the minerals needed to make BEVs cheap enough to replace most every ICEV?You mention a need to have a low cost per mile but then mention some need for higher thermodynamic efficiency.  Why care about thermodynamic efficiency if the fuel is cheap and carbon neutral?

On the other hand is the BEV technology, a technology that still can't compete on capability with ICEVs.  What is keeping the BEV competitive with ICEVs is basic economics.

Can you define \"moving the goalposts\" in the context of argumentation? I'll give you an example: first talking about cost per unit distance, then talking about how ICE doesn't necessarily need to be \"fossil\" fuels, but in practicality the only way that an ICE car can get to that cost per unit distance is on fossil fuels due to inherent inefficiencies in controlling small explosions to make mechanical energy, and the complete lack of any form of scale production of synthetic fuels at any cost. And then when called on on this very obvious logic flaw - one you've been presented with over and over through time by multiple people including myself - you then \"whatabout\" other costs that have absolutely nothing to do with your original premise. Internal combustion served us very well for like 100 years, but it's time for it to go because we have far simpler and more efficient modes of creating that mechanical energy from electricity, and far more efficient ways to extract energy from the same fuels to make electricity.  Please stop hanging onto your obsolete tech because of familiarity.  Oh, and please actually listen to the obvious facts people are telling you about this obsolete tech, because it's clear you haven't been. Also, aren't you always in here trying to convince people about how great nuclear power is?  Why would you be doing that, but still clinging to your obsolete internal combustion engine when you could be driving an EV that is powered by nuclear? Let's say that society needs children in order to continue.  Even more so if Social Security is a ponzi scheme that will collapse without population growth.  Nobody would want to take on the financial burden but everyone reaps the rewards.  That's exactly the sort of thing that is usually funded by taxpayers.  It's more than just social security.  The world would become wholly incompetent without another generation to take over.  And education is part of it too. Bullshit. https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-de...

I wonder how China's government's efforts compare with Norway's, who, iinm, are the real trail blazers when it comes to EVs. Apples and oranges. The Norwegian government has had a very successful program focused on consumption, while China has had a very successful program focused on production, first and foremost. Yes. And I\u2019m pretty sure they saw this as a way to eventually win in the automative space over the US and, to a lesser extent, European and Japanese OEMs, by leveraging the fact that Chinese consumers aren\u2019t culturally invested in ICE the way that so many in the West are, and thus they could move to a more modern tech while western countries got mired in culture wars. Long range EVs have reached price parity with fossil fuel cars now. Sometimes they are even cheaper with available discounts. MG are a good example to use. Long range cars that are cheaper than other brand's petrol models, and better built.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"A decision by US President Donald Trump to place a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports has left some of the US's major trade partners scrambling to make a deal.  The US is a major steel importer, importing nearly a quarter of the steel it uses, according to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute, which adds that its dependence on aluminium is even greater.  Its neighbours Canada and Mexico, as well as some allies in Asia are among its main suppliers. Trump has said his latest tariffs will take effect on 12 March \"without exceptions or exemptions\". With just over a month to go before the tax kicks in, here is how some countries have responded. As one of the largest suppliers of both commodities to the US, Canada has a lot to lose. \"Canada has extra reasons for irritation as they are the largest steel supplier and one of the largest aluminum suppliers to the US,\" says Deborah Elms, a trade expert with the Hinrich Foundation. Canada's industry minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has slammed the decision, calling it \"totally unjustified\".  In a post on X, he said Canadian steel is being used in key US industries including defence, shipbuilding and energy, adding that this made \"North America more competitive and secure\".  He added that Canada would \"defend our industries as we have always done and always will\" and warned that Canada's response would be \"clear and calibrated\". Though Trump has said he will not consider any exceptions, it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken on the phone with Trump and that the US leader was considering an exemption.  Calling Albanese \"a very fine man\", Trump had earlier explained that the US runs a trade surplus with Australia.  \"The reason is they buy a lot of airplanes. They're rather far away and they need lots of airplanes,\" Trump said. \"We actually have a surplus, it's one of the only countries which we do.\" But despite being the world's largest exporter of iron ore - a key steelmaking raw material - Australia's exports of steel itself are not as significant. According to Albanese, Australian steel accounts for about 1% of US imports, though its steel is used by a major US military shipbuilder.  The UK has said the government \"will take a considered approach\" and will speak with the US about the details but wants to be clear it will be working in the national interest. However, the BBC understands the UK will not retaliate immediately, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said she \"strongly believe[s] that a deal can be done\". The trade body UK Steel has said in a statement that the tariffs would deliver a \"devastating blow\" to their industry.  \"The US is our second-largest export market after the EU. At a time of shrinking demand and high costs, rising protectionism globally, particularly in the US, will stifle our exports and damage over \u00a3400m ($494m) worth of the steel sector's contribution to the UK's balance of trade,\" Gareth Stace,  UK Steel's director general, said in a statement.   \"It is deeply disappointing if President Trump sees the need to target UK steel, given our relatively small production volumes compared to major steel nations,\" he said, adding that there was a danger that other countries could \"redirect\" steel to the UK market to avoid US tariffs.  On Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded by saying \"unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered\".  \"They will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures. The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,\" she said. \"I deeply regret the US decision to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. Tariffs are taxes - bad for business, worse for consumers.\"  According to trade group Eurometal, the US was the second-largest market for EU exports of iron and steel. Trump imposed tariffs on both the UK and the EU during his first term but those restrictions were later relaxed by the Biden administration. India's Steel Secretary Sandeep Poundrik has reportedly claimed that Trump's tariffs will not have much of an impact, pointing to the fact that India exports only a small fraction of its steel to the US.  \"How much steel do we actually export to the US?\" Poundrik said at an industry event, according to a PTI report.  \"We produced 145 million tonnes of steel last year, of which 95,000 tonnes was exported to the US. So, how does it matter if out of 145 million tonnes, you are not able to export 95,000 tonnes?\"  But not everyone shares this sentiment.  The chief of the Indian Steel Association (ISA), Naveen Jindal, has said he is \"deeply concerned\" that US restrictions could lead steel makers to dump their steel in the Indian market at lower prices.  These tariffs are \"expected to slash steel exports to the US by 85%, creating a massive surplus that will likely flood India which is one of the few major markets without trade restrictions\", he claimed. South Korea is a major steel exporter to the US, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Its steel is used by homegrown firms like Hyundai, Kia, Samsung and LG, all of which have factories in the US and Mexico. On Tuesday, Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo said South Korea would \"actively consider\" whether there was room for negotiation with the US - a day after the industry ministry held an emergency meeting with steelmakers. In 2018, when Trump similarly imposed a 25% tariff on all steel imports, Seoul was granted a waiver in exchange for a yearly import quota.  It's unclear what deals might actually be cut or waivers granted over the next month, but Eswar Prasad, an international trade policy expert at Cornell University, says in the long run, US trading partners may seek to diversify away from the US by selling their products elsewhere. But he also says that \"Trump's drastic actions have put the rest of the world on the back foot\" because of the US economy's strength relative to most of its trading partners. Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, says that while the US's trading partners may seek appeasement in the short term, they could still decide to hit back in the long run. \"While overtures may be made to work with the Trump team to avert the tariffs, our partners may conclude that tariffs are coming so fast and furious, negotiations are not a durable option,\" she says. Donald Trump's plans for tariffs risk raising prices for items from cars to canned food.   The leaders share a warm relationship, but both will have their own wish list when they meet this week. The move threatens to have a big impact in Canada, a major source of the metals in the US.  Trade Minister Douglas Alexander said the UK would not have \"a knee-jerk reaction\" but \"a clear-headed\" response. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists warn they could put prices up. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Chinese automaker BYD (BYDDF+8.39%) is stepping on the accelerator in its ongoing race with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (TSLA+4.01%) and others to make smart cars more affordable. The company announced that its \u201cGod\u2019s Eye\u201d feature, which includes capabilities like remote parking via smartphones and autonomous overtaking on roads, will be available \u2014 for free \u2014 in all BYD vehicles, including budget cars. The announcement sent BYD\u2019s stock up 4% while Tesla\u2019s sank 2%. BYD\u2019s \u201cGod\u2019s Eye\u201d feature was first rolled out in 2023 but was only available in more upscale models.  BYD founder and chairman Wang Chaunfu couched the move as a way to make driving safety technology available to the masses. \u201cWe are starting an era where autonomous driving is for everyone,\u201d said founder Chuanfu at a live-streamed event in BYD\u2019s Shenzhen headquarters on Monday. BYD\u2019s highly popular Seagull hatchback, for example, retails for less than $10,000 USD and will now include the God\u2019s Eye feature. Experts predicted that its availability to the masses would upend the market, but this shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise. \u201cThis marks the continued commoditization of ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) for autonomous driving technology,\u201d said Teymour Bourial, founding partner of sustainability consultancy ExoPeak. \u201cGiven how affordable the technology has become, it was just a matter of time before this happened.\u201d Bourial added that BYD\u2019s rollout could push Tesla into re-thinking its full self-driving (FSD) model. \u201cIt will become difficult for consumers to justify paying extra for a service that competitors offer for free,\u201d said Bourial.  Still, he predicted less of an impact, at least right away, in the U.S. and Europe. \u201cChinese automakers still represent a relatively small market share, and will likely face expansion challenges in the face of growing protectionism,\u201d he said. Jason Castriota, CEO of automotive design firm Castriota Design, also was not surprised by the move, but predicted it will put a jolt in the segment. \u201cThis will send shockwaves through the market, but it is important to recognize that this will play out differently in each market,\u201d Castriota said, adding that, at the moment, Tesla doesn\u2019t have much to fear. \u201cDespite losing a chunk of the market, Tesla still holds nearly 50 percent of all EV sales in the USA,\u201d he said, adding that with many U.S. automakers pausing or slowing EV plans, Tesla should have time to solidify their position.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Business Insider Edition  Goldman Sachs on Tuesday terminated a policy requiring its IPO clients to have at least two diverse board members, citing a December court ruling over a similar initiative at the Nasdaq stock exchange.          \"As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,\" said Goldman spokesman Tony Fratto. \"We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.\"               In December, a federal appeals court made waves when it struck down Nasdaq's efforts to get companies to diversify their boards.               Goldman embarked on a legal review of its policy following the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, a spokesperson said. As the review was taking place, the bank took two companies public that did not meet those requirements: Titan America, a company that provides materials for construction, and Venture Global, a liquified natural gas producer.               Ann Lipton, a Tulane University law professor, meanwhile, questioned whether the Nasdaq ruling, which centered on the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a government agency, applies to companies like Goldman Sachs.               \"The Fifth Circuit said Nasdaq as an exchange under SEC oversight can't require it,\" Lipton told BI. \"It said nothing about what underwriters can require of clients.\"               The appeals court ruled that the SEC overstepped its authority by approving the stock exchange's diversity rules. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 says the SEC's job is \"to protect investors\" and \"promote competition,\" not make decisions about the makeup of corporate boards, the panel of judges said. Nasdaq did not appeal the December decision.               Still, Goldman's move follows rollbacks of other DEI initiatives by large US corporations, including Meta, Target, and Walmart. Goldman has historically been among the top banks taking companies public worldwide.               Goldman adopted its board diversity initiative in 2020 as CEO David Solomon vowed to work only with IPO clients that have at least one diverse board member. The next year, Goldman bumped that requirement up to two.               Around the same time, Goldman created a position dedicated to helping clients find diverse board members, which managing director\u00a0Ilana Wolfe filled.               During her time as head of corporate board engagement, Wolfe and her team have placed about 125 diverse people on Goldman clients' boards.               The bank plans to continue to offer board placement service, a spokesperson said.               \"I thought, 'it's great we put out this commitment, but wouldn't it be even greater if we were part of the solution and helped our clients get there?'\" Wolfe told Insider in 2023.               Goldman's change of policy was reported earlier on Tuesday by Bloomberg.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

This isn't new though.  A friend wanted me to come to his company and I interviewed, and afterwards was told that they went to two guys with no experience instead of me (though I wasn't demanding much as  You mean I could be an English speaking programmer in the Philippines?I would have to consider it.

It's more difficult for an employer to fire someone outside of the United States. Employment at-will [mostly] only exists in the United States. The rest of the world uses the \"Just Cause\" employment standard.   In most countries you would need to document the poor performance, as well as disclose the real reasons for firing the employee. Additionally, there would be a notice period for any layoff unless it was for gross misconduct.

The Meta employees are looking at 5-6 months pay (16 weeks plus 2x weeks for each year with Meta), thats pretty generous for \"under-performing\" employees.

Studies have statistically shown that there's less chance of an incident if you do it at the end of the week. is that true for remote workers too?if you fired me on a Monday after I made the commute all the way to HQ, i would very likely go postal.call me up on a Sunday afternoon to tell me I've been canned & won't have to make the 2 hr trip, that would likely be a quite different reaction And if you could just not come in on Sunday, or any other day, that'd be great.

If you fire workers on Mon - Thur the \"survivors\" will spend the next day talking about the coworkers that were just let go. As long as the stock price goes up they don't care. Oh ya, people care about the metaverse, it's likely the only place they'll ever be able to afford a home. No no no zuck will show them all and we'll all eat humble pie.  This was like when his friends in school doubted this facebook thing would take off.   Trust me.  It's gonna be... just like that.. guise. Facebook was stupid enough to announce they have no long term plans if the metaverse doesn't blow up this year. :) Yes it shouldn't be allowed because the employer looking to fill an open position can use the candidate's the date of separation, and past news articles to deduce whether or the layoff was for performance or not. In fact, this should be treated as a form of defamation. This is why people like Suckerburg should be sued into oblivion. If we had any type of labor protection in the US or at companies like Bookface, there would be no firing people willy-nilly in order to gain a bump in share price. Which is all that's happening here. The talking avatar that is Zuckerburg has to constantly generate press in order to get the market excited about the stock he owns most of. Otherwise his value tanks and he's no longer the 3rd or 4th (reported) richest being on the planet. Firing under-performers isnt \"Willy-nilly\", why should poor workers be kept on the payroll? For AI, most people are untrainable. As a starting point, it is the same as asking, is it possible to train all students to get an A in math. Even this seems be hard and studying is easy compared to doing new scientific discoveries. They are cutting folks who likely knew they were under-performing, and id find it hard to believe Meta doesnt have a corrective program for under-performing workers. Meta will be hiring AI workers - even if everyone being let go were also AI workers, their poor performance would make them unatractive to Meta. They might want to start with that low-performing employee who tossed away over $50 billion over the last 4 years on a metaverse bet that virtually (ha!) nobody gives a crap about. A metaverse that (at least initially) was touted as the future of work. Oh, the irony! Imagine renaming your entire company because you think your Second Life reboot is going to do any better lol. Why? Normally companies would promote a risk taking idea of creating a new market. That it didn't take off is hardly a problem, and what definitely isn't a problem is spending $50bn. That's only a problem if you are a poor company. Boz recently publicly commented that if metaverse doesn't take off this year Facebook has no plan B. They also announced they were laying off 20% of the people working on it because he read that the mac 128k was made by small teams or some shit... which is almost certainly not true in any sense that matters to what he's doing at meta.  Their emphasis on meta horizon worlds seems to have also impacted sales on their store since those worlds are advertised virtually indistinguishably from games you gotta pay f  That Meta will select layoff victims \"with a focus on staff who 'aren't meeting expectations'\" suggests that they are intending to include workers who do meet or exceed expectations.  But it gets worse than that, as there are reports [businessinsider.com] that workers who had good track records of performance reviews were suddenly downgraded without explanation, presumably to meet the quota for the mass layoff. Zuckerberg said \"the cuts would create headcount for the company to hire the 'strongest talent.'\"  So, the same executives and managers that led the current hiring of workers that now need to be laid off will once again lead the new wave of hiring.  They botched the last wave of hiring and are now counted on to do it right this time. By creating headcount, Zuckerberg really means that Meta will save enough money to hire new workers.  However, last year, Meta spent $30 billion for stock buybacks, money that was effectively wasted since the $30 billion is immaterial given the total capitalization and amount of annual stock transactions.  For some reason, Zuckerberg and Meta couldn't figure out how to invest any of that $30 billion in future growth, even though they desparately now need cash to fund the new wave of hiring.  What this reveals is a lack of respect for and valuation of workers ... in addition to incompetence about how to strategically plan for growth and how to effectively manage financial resources. Your insights are so profound, please tell us about the multi-billion company you founded that supports tens of thousands of families around the world - Zuckerberg could learn a lot from a smart CEO like you.. Look Zuck's a smart guy who got pretty lucky and he managed that pretty good for a little while until he was too old and way out of touch from years of being a billionaire and has zero idea what a 22 year old wants from a social network. It's obvious to anyone into VR that the metaverse will not take off in the window that meta has indicated will be critical to the long term success of the company and the state of the quest pro and meta horizon worlds kinda hints that he doesn't have any idea how people actu  There may be more comments in this discussion.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Business Insider Edition  The white-collar job market has gotten so competitive, that even MBA graduates \u2014 once thought of as having a leg up in hiring \u2014 are struggling to land jobs.Their troubles could stick around for a while.          Since July, Joshua has worked at Starbucks while he looks for a marketingjob. In the fall of 2023, his contract position at PlayStation was cut and, despite working with a recruiting agency, he still hasn't landed a job in his chosen industry.               \"I'm an MBA graduate in his 30s, living paycheck to paycheck, watching what feels like the rest of my colleagues and classmates move forward with their lives,\" said Joshua, who earned his business degree from Santa Clara University in 2021. His last name is known to BI but is being withheld due to fear of professional repercussions.               Job acceptance rates at some of the top business schools have declined in recent years. Much of it likely has to do with a slowdown in white-collar hiring overall, but other evidence suggests companies are hiring fewer MBAs. After all, they may require a higher salary than their peersat a time when companies are pivoting to invest in technology that promises to do the job cheaper than any human \u2014 no matter their degree level.               Business Insider looked at the job acceptance rates three months post-graduation at the top 15 business schools from US News and World Report's 2024 ranking \u2014and focused on the nine MBA programs with publicly available data going back eight years and Harvard, with data going back six years.               At eight of the 10 schools, the class of 2024's job acceptance rate was the lowest.               Economists told BI that elevated interest rates and companies' investments in artificial intelligence are among the factors that have led to slower hiring for MBA graduates.               Gracy Sarkissian, associate dean of Columbia University's career management center, said that while the three-month post-graduation job acceptance rate for the school's MBA graduates fell in 2023, employment reached pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.               Dartmouth, Yale, Stanford, MIT, Dartmouth, the University of Michigan, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Virginia didn't respond to requests for comment. Duke and Harvard declined to comment.               The usual suspects for MBA hiring \u2014 consulting firms and Big Tech \u2014 are hiring fewer of them, the Wall Street Journal reported in January.               It's all part of an overall hiring slowdown.US businesses are hiring at nearly the lowest rate since 2013, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data.               Whilethe overall US unemployment rate remains low compared to historical levels, many people who need a job are dealing with a considerably tougher market than a few years ago.       Are you an MBA graduate looking for a job? Are you comfortable sharing your story with a reporter? Please fill out this form.           Elevated interest rates have contributed to slower hiring in industries such as finance, tech, and consulting \u2014 sectors that attract many MBA grads, Kory Kantenga, head of economics, Americas at LinkedIn, told BI. Instead, healthcare, government, and hospitality have been dominating hiring since 2023.               In addition to higher interest rates, uncertainty about Trump administration policies and the impacts of AI have led some businesses to be more cautious about expanding their workforces, said Audrey Guo, an assistant professor of economics at Santa Clara University. She added tech companies that hired workers in droves during the pandemic \u2014 only to lay off many workers in recent years \u2014 may be looking to avoid this cycle in the current climate.               Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, said some companies could be slowing hiring because they're waiting to see if the economy can stick a \"soft landing\" \u2014 in which inflation comes down, the unemployment rate doesn't spike, and a recession is avoided. She said job openings for finance and tech roles on Indeed have fallen considerably from their peaks in 2022, to below levels seen in February 2020.               \"If I were looking for a job in banking and finance or software development, I would expect it to definitely take longer than it did in 2022,\" Shrivastava said.               Finding work can be challenging even in sectors with more job openings. This includes management roles, where openings listed on Indeed are roughly 9% higher than they were in February 2020.               Dan Trujillo is trying to find one of those management roles. He was laid off in January from his role as a director of customer experience at a manufacturing company. He earned his Executive MBA from the University of Colorado a year earlier and said he struggled to land his previous job. \"I applied to somewhere between 25 and 30 positions without ever hearing anything back other than a rejection email,\" said Trujillo, who's in his mid-40s and based in the Denver area.               Guo said some employers could be slowing hiring as they monitor the potential of AI tools in the workplace. Additionally, some companies' significant investments in AI could also be leaving them with less money to put toward hiring workers.               \"I think the roles where we're seeing the biggest declines in demand now tend to be the ones that have really high returns to using AI,\" said Lisa Simon, chief economist at the workforce analytics company Revelio Labs. She cited software engineers and data analysts as two examples.               Looking ahead, Kantenga said that future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts could help improve labor market conditions for MBA graduates. CME FedWatch, which projects interest-rate changes based on market activity, forecasts a nearly 84% chance rates will be lower by the end of the year. However, Kantenga said uncertainties tied to the Trump administration could lead some employers to slow hiring until they have a clearer sense of what policies will be implemented.               Additionally, some changes to the current labor market could work in the favor of MBA graduates. Satyam Panday, chief US and Canada economist at S&P Global Ratings, said that an uptick in baby boomer retirements in the coming years could create a gap in the workforce that AI likely won't be able to fill \u2014 which could make it easier for some MBA graduates to find work. While some companies may be able to get by with fewer workers, Guo said they'll still need to invest in their leaders of the future.               \"Companies will need to think about how to still preserve a pipeline of new workers so that, eventually, when the senior people retire or need to be replaced, there still is some pipeline of people with that experience,\" she said.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"        Greg Rosalsky       This first appeared in the Planet Money newsletter. You can sign up here. By now, many economists are hoarse screaming that higher tariffs and a trade war will raise prices and hurt the U.S. economy. But many Americans aren't listening. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University, conducted in late January, found that 42% of Americans believe tariffs will help the U.S. economy. The United States' recent history with free trade might help explain the disconnect between economists and a large swath of the American public. For decades, mainstream economists claimed that free trade would be a clear win for the United States. Sure, they said, there would be some losers. But those losers would get new jobs in a growing economy and basically everything would ultimately be fine. Everything turned out not to be fine. No research has made that more abundantly clear than a series of studies over the last decade-plus on what's known as the \"China Shock.\" The shock refers to what happened to American communities after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. These studies have found that as a flood of Chinese imports came rushing into the U.S., it destroyed well over a million manufacturing jobs and created basically miniature depressions in communities around the country. Contrary to the assumptions of old-school economists, manufacturing workers struggled to adapt and move to new jobs in the aftermath. Spearheaded by economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson, the research project on the China Shock has led to a big reevaluation of trade policies in econ wonk circles. Back in 2011, when the economists began unveiling their research, one of their big, eye-opening findings was that, for displaced workers, \"the adjustment process was wrenching, slow and scarring,\" says Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That was not like classic economic theory, \"where you lose one job and you get another almost equally good job at another firm.\" The economists, as well as others in their wake, also found that the broader communities hit by the China Shock suffered enormously. They saw higher unemployment rates. They saw declines in wages and in upward mobility. They saw an explosion in the use of welfare programs. And they became plagued by social ills, from higher rates of child poverty and single parenthood to an increase of deaths from drugs, alcohol and suicide. The China Shock research has helped convince more economists and policymakers to begin supporting greater government intervention in markets, like strategically using tariffs and subsidies to boost certain industries (\"industrial policy\") and \"place-based policies,\" which take special measures to help left-behind communities succeed. Recently, the economists published a new installment in their series (this time Autor, Dorn and Hanson are joined by co-authors Maggie Jones and Bradley Setzler). Equipped with even better, more precise data \u2014 as well as the benefit of being able to see what happened to these communities with the greater passage of time \u2014 the economists take another look at the aftermath of the China Shock. Their analysis goes through 2019, the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic. The economists look at the effects of the China Shock from two angles: how it affected places and how it affected people. They find that on metrics such as employment rates, the places hit by the China Shock mostly recovered by 2019. A different set of industries rose in the ashes of manufacturing, offering residents jobs at places like big-box stores, restaurants, schools and health care facilities. But, the economists find, the people who were hurt by the China Shock did not recover. Manufacturing workers did not transition to these new sectors. The economists find that the people who took the new jobs, concentrated in the service sector, were often newcomers and demographically different, including immigrants, U.S.-born Latinos and younger workers with college degrees. Meanwhile, the ladders in manufacturing that once provided workers without a college diploma a solid wage and upward mobility were kicked over. The research on the China Shock had already illuminated why so many Americans have been swayed by President Trump's brand of populist, nativist politics. This new installment is even more eye-opening on that front. So why did economists get free trade so wrong? And could tariffs help? We asked Autor. In their new study, the China Shock economists throw a bit of shade on the economics profession for getting the effects of free trade so wrong in the past. \"That China's rise severely disrupted local labor markets in high-income countries came as something of a surprise, to both economists and policymakers,\" they write. Even as Chinese imports were inflicting long-lasting damage in manufacturing communities across the U.S., they write, many economists remained \"sanguine\" about how those communities were adjusting. But it's not like no one saw the destruction coming. In 1999, there were violent protests in Seattle against the World Trade Organization. Labor unions were shouting from the rooftops that foreign competition was devastating for their members. And politicians like Bernie Sanders, Ross Perot \u2014 and, yes, Donald Trump, then running to get the presidential nomination of the Reform Party \u2014 vociferously opposed the bipartisan free trade movement. Why did so many economists and policymakers minimize the potential devastation that free trade with China would wreak on many Americans? For one, Autor says, the preceding history of free trade had not been as disruptive. \"A lot of trade in the 20th century was trade among rich countries,\" Autor says. \"So it was more like, we sell some jet engines to France \u2014 they sell some Champagne to us.\" Trade wasn't really about cutthroat price competition. \"We weren't used to major trade expansions with much lower-income countries,\" Autor says. When the U.S. and the rest of the world opened their doors to Chinese-made products, many economists and policymakers underestimated the effects of something that is painfully obvious in retrospect: All of a sudden, rich-world workers had to compete with a vast sea of other workers willing to work for cheap wages. Autor also suggests that the field was failing to ask the right questions and look carefully at the evidence, and that economists didn't have the same data-crunching abilities back then. In the years since, economics has seen what some have called an \"empirical revolution,\" where statistical techniques have seen big improvements, data sources have gotten much bigger and richer, and evidence looms larger than traditional theory. A bedrock theory in economics has been the theory of comparative advantage, which basically says \"free trade among consenting nations raises GDP in all of them,\" Autor says. And, we should say, that may still be true. Autor and his colleagues' research focuses on how manufacturing workers and their communities adjusted to the trade shock. They don't look at the overall costs and benefits of free trade with China. Trade with China also had winners. For example, it benefited American farmers, who got access to a massive new market for their goods. It benefited high-skill workers, like lawyers, designers, stock traders and consultants. It benefited Silicon Valley, Wall Street and a host of big corporations, which got access to cheap labor to manufacture their products and a massive market in which to sell goods and services. Big profits in this trans-Pacific relationship helped boost the stock market. And trade with China benefited American consumers, who could now get access to cheaply made products that fill the aisles of stores like Dollar General and Walmart. That all may be true, Autor says. But looking at the devastation in many former manufacturing towns, he says, \"Every Day Low Prices\" \u2014 a reference to Walmart's slogan \u2014 \"doesn't compensate for not having a job.\" The theory of comparative advantage also acknowledges there will be losers from trade. But, Autor says, economists began using theoretical models that painted this rosy picture about what would happen to those harmed by it. These models contributed to wishful thinking that labor markets would adjust pretty easily to the trade shocks and that the workers harmed by trade would easily move to new sectors or places as the economy grew and changed. Autor says they were surprised to find that workers, on average, did not follow these pathways for better jobs. First, their data shows that only a low percentage of workers moved out of manufacturing into nonmanufacturing jobs. Second, he says, they don't see an increase in these workers moving to new places. In fact, he says, it's the opposite. \"They became\u00a0less\u00a0likely to move out,\" Autor says. One potential reason is \"they were in such dire straits.\" Or, maybe, in many cases, \"they didn't see better opportunities available to them. Many of the places they might have gone to were similarly affected.\" And there are, of course, a whole bunch of noneconomic reasons people don't move, including wanting to remain close to family and friends. Instead of moving to new sectors or places, manufacturing workers either dropped out of the labor force or clung to jobs in their dying industries. Even those who were able to keep jobs in declining manufacturing businesses still suffered. They saw their wages stagnate and their opportunities for upward advancement disappear. As stated earlier, in their new research, the China Shock economists find that employment in these places did eventually rebound. It took like a decade or more. And the jobs were different. But local economies did come back. However, they find, the new jobs in new industries were taken by different people. Rather than the sort of storybook version of trade adjustment, where workers rather quickly find new jobs, Autor says that he and his colleagues find \"a lot of this adjustment process is generational. It really is a different generation of workers doing a different set of jobs in the same places.\" Now, President Trump is leading the charge against free trade. Supporters of Trump's tariffs come in at least two different stripes. One camp seems to believe that, yes, tariffs will have costs for the American economy but they're worth it for political reasons. Trump has sold his tariff threats against Canada and Mexico, for example, as helping the United States reduce immigration and the flow of drugs into the country. Trump's threat of tariffs, this camp believes, can also help the United States get more out of its trade relationships, like compelling foreigners to buy more of America's stuff. Another camp seems to believe that higher tariffs are an end in themselves. They seem to believe that tariffs can make the U.S. economy stronger and maybe even reverse the damage of trade shocks. Marc Short, who served in the Trump White House during Trump's first term, was recently on a panel on NBC's Meet the Press, and he said he believed this camp was more powerful in the Trump 2.0 administration. \"The first administration had economic advisers and national security advisers who believed in trade, for both economic benefit and national security benefit,\" Short said. \"The team he has around him today has a very different viewpoint, a very mercantilist viewpoint that says you should be paying for access to American markets, regardless of the reality that Americans are the importers paying that tariff \u2014 that tax.\" Widespread use of tariffs, especially with close trading partners, Autor suggests, will ultimately harm the economy \u2014 including the manufacturing sector. \"So much of the stuff that is manufactured here uses foreign parts,\" Autor says. \"There is bicycle manufacturing in the United States, but almost all their parts are coming from Taiwan, for example.\" American auto manufacturers rely on parts \"moving freely across the border between Canada, Mexico and the United States. And when you raise tariffs, you're basically creating costs and frictions for all of those transactions. \u200aYou're gonna raise costs for U.S. manufacturers. And we saw the first round of Trump tariffs didn't do much for U.S. manufacturing. We don't see any evidence that actually caused a rebound. It mostly caused prices to rise.\" But, Autor says, that doesn't mean there's no role for tariffs to strengthen the American economy and create good-paying jobs. He suggests that temporary use of tariffs on strategic products \u2014 in conjunction with public investments \u2014 can nurture growing industries of the future and can help working-class Americans thrive in the 21st century. The China Shock research suggests that classic, free market economic theory blinded many to the reality that free trade can destroy the livelihoods of many people and that they have a hard time adjusting. The late and great psychologist Daniel Kahneman \u2014 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \u2014 called this sort of thinking in economics and other realms \"theory-induced blindness.\" \"Once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws,\" Kahneman wrote.

Tesla\u2019s brand favorability is at an all-time low, and Elon Musk\u2019s controversial views and actions are alienating core customers, particularly in environmentally conscious markets, warned Saxo Bank\u2019s global head of investment strategy. Tesla\u2019s stock is down by more than a quarter since its mid-December peak and is the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven. Elon Musk\u2019s politics risk becoming a millstone around the neck of Tesla as the $1.1 trillion company struggles to reignite the supercharged growth it enjoyed in the past. Late last month, Tesla promised vehicle sales this year would increase once more even though they suffered a historic decline in 2024. Notably, though, the company backed away from Musk\u2019s promise that volumes were set to rise by 20% at the bare minimum. With well over a quarter of its stock market value up in smoke since its mid-December peak, the company is pinning its hopes on its\u00a0robotaxi pilot program\u00a0slated for June that could finally see it deliver on a nearly decade-long promise that Teslas will drive themselves without human supervision.\u00a0Shares once again dropped on Tuesday, declining 4% in the session. \u201cTesla\u2019s biggest challenge in 2025 isn\u2019t technology\u2014it\u2019s perception. Elon Musk\u2019s political baggage is now weighing on sales, brand loyalty, and investor confidence,\u201d warned Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Bank, in a research note on Tuesday. Citing an analysis this week by Stifel that Tesla\u2019s net favorability rating has dropped to just 3%, its lowest ever, he warned the road ahead is filled with uncertainty. \u201cThe company faces declining sales, increasing competition, and growing scrutiny of CEO Elon Musk, whose influence\u2014once an undeniable asset\u2014may now be doing more harm than good,\u201d wrote Falkencrone. Already the stock is the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven, and more declines are possible, the Saxo Bank strategist warned. Amid a second straight year of double-digit profit declines, Tesla\u2019s stock price has paradoxically hit the eye-watering level of 90 times next year\u2019s earnings per share. For 2025, the multiple is even more egregious, well into the triple digits\u2014four times as much as its Mag7 peers. Musk\u2019s politics first began to evolve in the aftermath of the first COVID lockdown wave, when he decided to move Tesla headquarters out of California following a\u00a0notorious clash\u00a0with local health authorities. But he only really became widely controversial in the aftermath of the Twitter acquisition in late 2022. He completed his political journey with his embrace not only of Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA base, but his full-throated\u00a0endorsement of the far right\u00a0in Europe, including Germany\u2019s AfD and English nationalists like Tommy Robinson. Following Musk\u2019s salute during the Trump inauguration, which many people said looked like the Nazi \u201cSieg Heil\u201d gesture, users review-bombed a video on the refreshed Model Y by the Fully Charged Show, calling Teslas \u201cSwastiCars\u201d that can drive from Berlin to Warsaw on one charge\u2014a reference to Adolf Hitler\u2019s blitzkrieg. Now, Musk\u2019s Dutch customers are debating whether they feel \u201cTesla shame\u201d while demand in\u00a0Germany\u00a0plummeted 60%\u00a0in January, shrinking its share of the EV market from 23% two years ago to just 3.7% last month. The Tesla CEO has taken little notice of it. His exhortation late last month to far-right Germans, absolving them of any shame they might feel about Hitler, earned Musk a stinging rebuke from the director of Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial museum. It\u2019s not just his politics that is causing people to rethink their opinion of the entrepreneur, either. Musk\u2019s antics themselves are increasingly being seen by those both on the left and the right quite simply as cringe. On Tuesday, for example, Musk demonstrated he\u2019s once more the biggest fan of himself. Posting under the avatar name \u201cHarry B\u014dlz,\u201d he wrote: \u201cI need to meet this Elon guy. He sounds awesome,\u201d after podcaster Joe Rogan effusively praised the entrepreneur. A number of Twitch streamers in the\u00a0gaming community\u00a0he sought to lure to X are now\u00a0condemning\u00a0the Tesla CEO after he admitted\u00a0going on Rogan\u2019s show to lie\u00a0about how good he was at video games, without so much as\u00a0acknowledging it was wrong. \u201cTesla\u2019s brand favorability is at an all-time low, and his polarizing views are alienating core customers, particularly in environmentally conscious markets,\u201d Saxo Bank\u2019s Falkencrone added. Right now, the most robust source of demand for Tesla comes from the Far East, where censorship in the form of the Great Firewall of China ironically insulates consumers there from his recent behavior, as X is banned in the country.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"by Calculated Risk on 2\/11\/2025 09:32:00 AM  This testimony will be live here at 10:00 AM ET and also on C-SPAN 3.  Report here. An excerpt: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.  Employment, inflation, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these disturbances. The Committee's primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average. Therefore, the federal funds rate is likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past. Owing in part to the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound, the Committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased. The Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.  The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhance the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. In order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.  Monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity, employment, and prices with a lag. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks over time to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the Committee's assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal. Moreover, sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.  The Committee's employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.  The Committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January, and to undertake roughly every 5 years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. emphasis added  ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Carmelo Camilleri will never forget the time his dad yelled at him for buying Diet Pepsi at Walmart when it was on sale at ShopRite. He and his fianc\u00e9 were preparing to host his parents when they realized that they had forgotten to get soda the night before. They swung by the nearest grocery option, which happened to be Walmart, and word of the detour got back to Camilleri's dad. \"He actually yelled at me. He said, 'What's wrong with you? It's on sale at ShopRite,'\" the Staten Island native told Business Insider. \"I said, 'I know. You were on your way, and we were going to be late.' He goes, 'You could have gone there. We would've waited for you. It's OK. Get the cheaper price.'\" Camilleri says his dad is the reason he price-compares everything from gas to ground turkey \u2014 and his personal finance lessons are the reason the 31-year-old is a homeowner with robust savings and financial options. \"My goal is to have the option to retire at 35,\" said Camilleri, who has been working as a salesman since college and now runs a sales business. The path to early retirement would mean selling the business, he added, \"so if and when that happens, I'll definitely have the opportunity to move on with my life.\" Here are two money lessons from his dad that \"put me in the right mindset,\" said Camilleri. Camilleri lived at home with his parents for years after college, partly thanks to an early principle that his dad instilled in him: \"Always own. Never rent.\" In his mind, renting equates to throwing money away. \"You put a dollar in, that dollar is gone forever,\" said Camilleri. \"When you're renting, you're building someone else's dream. You're building someone else's asset.\" Living at home not only allowed him to save the majority of his sales income, which would eventually go toward a six-figure down payment, but it also meant he could be patient and diligent during the homebuying process. \"I was always going to buy a home. It was just a matter of when \u2014 not if,\" said Camilleri, who started seriously considering buying in 2020 and closed on a $670,000 five-bedroom in Brick, New Jersey in 2021. He paid $25,000 under the original asking price during a time when most homes in the area were going for above asking, he said. \"I probably spent a little over a full year looking. There were times when I would just stop, like two or three months at a time, because I wasn't getting anywhere \u2014 and I wasn't going to overpay,\" he said. \"I wasn't willing to spend more than I would need to, and it's not that I financially couldn't do it \u2014 it's just not smart. I'm always looking for my money to grow, not the other way around.\" Camilleri, who moved out of his parent's home and into his own at age 27, is proud to say, \"I never paid a dollar of rent my entire life.\" Camilleri didn't fully grasp his dad's second main money lesson \u2014 \"Keep investing your money, keep letting it grow\" \u2014 until he earned money for the first time. He was 19, had just finished his freshman year of college, and landed a summer gig as a sales rep. In a two-month span, he made about $7,000 selling Cutco knives. \"At the time, I thought I was rich,\" he said. But before he had a chance to touch it, \"The first thing my father said to me was, 'Don't spend it. Put it away.' And I said, 'What do you mean? I have this money. I should be able to use it.'\" His dad responded by teaching him about what happens when you overspend, accumulate debt, and incur interest. Rather than having compound interest work against him, he could take advantage of the phenomenon by investing his money, which he's been doing ever since. Most of his invested money is in the stock market, he said: \"Obviously, nothing's guaranteed in life, but when you're investing in companies like Apple and Google, and using ETFs, these are long-term plays that are pretty much always going to pan out.\" Camilleri, who refuses to pay for cable and subscriptions, buys ground turkey in bulk, and price compares gas using an app called GasBuddy, hesitates before agreeing that he's \"frugal.\" At this point, his habits are ingrained. \"This is how I live my life. I get the best deals on everything, and I never buy at the first price. I'm always trying to negotiate. I'm always looking to get the best price I possibly could,\" he said. His friends and fianc\u00e9 say they don't think they could live like he does. They tease him about not being human. His response is that anyone can save and invest like he does and achieve financial independence. \"I am a human. I'm no better. I don't have superpowers,\" he said. \"I just have a different mindset.\" Jump to","label":0}

Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Arabia\u2019s Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data Center Why American Mobility Ground to a Halt The Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt Marseille Cutting Arena Subsidies Can Help Cover Tax Cuts, Think Tank Says The Facebook parent\u2019s record 16-day rally has been driven by all manner of news \u2014 even the kind that has pressured its megacap rivals \u2014 pushing its valuation toward $2 trillion for the first time. \u201cI have long viewed Meta as the biggest beneficiary of AI outside of maybe Nvidia, and I think more people are coming around to that idea,\u201d said Conrad van Tienhoven, a portfolio manager at Riverpark Capital. While the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. face questions on when they will see a return on their billions spent on AI, \u201cMeta spent the money on AI solutions that have had an immediate impact on how it targets and measures ads, the outcome of which has been faster growth and a higher average revenue per user.\u201d The stock fell 0.8% on Tuesday, but the 16-day rally represented the longest winning streak of any current Nasdaq 100 Index component going back to 1990, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It added more than 17% over the surge, bringing its market capitalization above $1.8 trillion. Despite the gain, it remains one of the cheapest big tech plays. The string of catalysts has been remarkable. In January, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said the company plans to invest as much as $65 billion on AI projects in 2025, much more than had been expected. While capex plans have come under increased scrutiny, Meta\u2019s target reinforced the perception it is investing from a place of strength. While tech was rocked by the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that claimed strong performance despite costing less and requiring fewer chips, Meta shares climbed. Investors took DeepSeek\u2019s success as a validation of open-sourced models, as employed by Meta\u2019s Llama. The firm\u2019s results underlined how AI is flowing through to its financials, improving how ads are targeted to its billions of users. Zuckerberg said 2025 would be a \u201creally big year\u201d for AI. Then, Meta on Monday began notifying staff of job cuts as it focuses on AI talent. Zuckerberg has also made some high-profile changes that have served to better align Meta with the Trump administration. The stock\u2019s streak began before the inauguration in January. The recent strength stands in contrast to Alphabet, the other major player in online advertising, which disappointed with its results, putting shares in negative territory for the year, compared with Meta\u2019s gain of about 22%. \u201cMeta is really ahead of its competitors in proving that the capex it is pouring into AI is working, which is why investors continue to gravitate toward it,\u201d said Jim Polk, head of equity investments at Homestead Advisers. \u201cIt has shown that AI is having an impact on user engagement, on margins, whereas Alphabet still needs to prove its capex is working and that its market share in search won\u2019t be eroded.\u201d Revenue growth at Meta is seen rising almost 15% in 2025, before modestly decelerating over the subsequent years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, net earnings growth is seen accelerating from 6.2% this year to 15% in 2026. The extraordinary length of Meta\u2019s rally has brought its 14-day relative strength index to about 77, notably over the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock is overbought. However, even with the streak, Meta\u2019s valuation doesn\u2019t scan as especially high. The company currently trades at nearly 27 times forward earnings, the highest level for shares since 2020, but in line with the Nasdaq 100. Among the Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks, only Alphabet Inc. trades at a lower multiple. \u201cIt\u2019s in algo heaven because it\u2019s one of the few large cap stocks that had a perfect quarter,\u201d said Rhys Williams of Wayve Capital Management. \u201cModels really like reasonably priced stocks where fundamentals are solid.\u201d Meta\u2019s current success represents a dramatic turnaround from just a couple years ago, when shares cratered amid its strategic pivot to focusing on the metaverse, along with a privacy-policy change from Apple Inc. that diminished Meta\u2019s ability to target ads, and negative user trends, especially amid competition from TikTok. Those concerns have all been reduced. Meta\u2019s AI investments have offset the impact of Apple\u2019s policy and contributed to improved user engagement, and while TikTok remains a significant competitor, its future is uncertain ahead of a US ban that could go into effect in early April. \u201cRight now I suspect the market is pricing in TikTok not being banned in the U.S., but if the ban does go through, it would be a huge positive for Meta,\u201d Polk said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how likely it is, but that is something that could keep the rally going.\u201d Tech Chart of the Day Tesla Inc. shares are extending losses for a fifth consecutive session, edging lower in Tuesday trading. Elon Musk\u2019s net worth fell below $400 billion for the first time in two months, dragged down by the slide in Tesla\u2019s share price. In recent weeks the stock has been weighed down by bad sales reports from around the world, while Chinese rival BYD has upped the ante through its smart-driving strategy. Top Tech Stories A group of investors led by Musk has offered to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI for $97.4 billion, escalating a clash between the Tesla chief executive and the artificial intelligence company he co-founded.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"[Iftah] has been exploring the sounds beyond what we can hear, recording ultrasound and pitching it down. He made a short video on the practice, and it\u2019s like a whole new world of sounds exists just outside of our hearing. For instance, a dropped toothpick sounds like you\u2019ve just dropped a piece of lumber, a broken lightbulb sounds like a shattered window, and a blackbird sounds like a blue whale. Besides simply sounding super, [Iftah] speculates that there\u2019s some regularity here: that as you slow down the sound it sounds like it came from sources that are physically bigger. He follows this up in a second video, but if you just think about the basic physics, it makes sense. If you\u2019re interested in recording your own ultrasound, there are a bunch of options on the market. With modern audio processors running up to 192 kHz or even 384 kHz out of the box, all that\u2019s missing is the high-frequency-capable microphone. Those aren\u2019t unobtainable anymore either with many MEMS mics performing well above their rated frequency response specs. Recording ultrasound sounds like a fun and not-too-expensive project to us! Of course, most of the ultrasound recording we\u2019ve seen has been about the bats. Check out the Pipistrelle or this pair of DIY bat detectors for some good background. But after watching [Iftah]\u2019s video, we\u2019re no longer convinced that the cute little insectivores are the coolest thing going on in the ultrasound.   Interesting how everything sounds exactly like it would if the objects were much larger. Interesting, but not surprising. Even in daily life you might notice that large humans tend to have deeper voices than small humans. More volume = space for larger resonant waves to build up. Writing that bats are insectivores is like writing that all presidents eat only burgers. Many bats species eat only fruits. Some other even feed on mammal blood. And yes, some eat insects. As a sound designer, I\u2019ve also done a lot of ultrasonic recordings, some unintentionally. One summer evening, I was trying to capture the sound of frogs and crickets. I had my recording levels set appropriately for those sounds. However, I was frequently seeing the level meters jump to full scale and the clipping indicators occasionally flashed. I thought I might have a faulty connection to my mics as I certainly wasn\u2019t hearing anything that would cause that. When I got my recordings onto my edit machine in the studio, the meters in my DAW did the same thing and I could see the waveform had many very loud segments even though they sounded the same as the quieter parts. When I switched to a spectrogram view, I saw a lot of loud activity captured around 40 kHz and higher. It was bats. When slowed down a few octaves, it was very cool to hear these otherworldly bird-like sounds. Additionally, I heard the same echolocation phenomenon he describes where the individual chirps got closer together as the bat zeroed in on its target. It was similar to hearing a ball bearing bouncing on a hard surface as the delay between bounces converges to zero. I would love a pair of headphones with ultrasonic mics in them that auto dropped the pitch of sounds so I could just walk around with them to see what I could hear. I\u2019m with you there. With the right frequency compression I think it could be done pretty comfortably without interfering with normal sound. NE602(SA612, etc) + ultrasonic transducer make for very simple bat detector designs. Jingling keys, florescent lights, insects, so many cool sounds waiting to be observed! Always a fan of videos like that that get people thinking about how they perceive the world and all that goes on beyond the typical sensory ranges. Life seems like it is longing to be seen in new angles. Getting new perspectives into sensory abstracts beyond the usual is a trip and a half, no matter the route taken.  So much goes on beyond our observation, awareness at any given moment, be it in our own subconscious or the world external.  Can\u2019t think every thought in a single life, can\u2019t have every perspective, let alone in any individual moment\/time slice! A wonderful world of interesting new perspectives, just beyond reach, aside from via technology.   (Much like with many other things in life!). That being said, it isn\u2019t quite right to say we can\u2019t hear it. We can\u2019t hear it via natural biology, sure, but we can via sensory substitution, expansion technologies.   These sorts of techniques (self-terming sensory weaving), take patterns from a source, digitize and then convert to another medium within our perceptual range \u2013 a common case is tactile, via haptic vibrations like those in a cell phone. After about a month, the mind will generate a \u201cqualia\u201d around it, a representation of the new sensory signal as though a native sense.   However, this doesn\u2019t give the same sorts of views as the video demonstrated, vs different ones. The ability to slow down, focus on specific elements and do more complex manipulation may not translate as well to direct perception, but still offers insights into a world of detail and mystery beyond our senses.   (because of the slowing it down aspect, it does also limit some types of investigation, vs using haptic vibration patterns to signal different intensities\/frequencies of audio for example) Hearing what bats hear is cool, exploring it and \u201cseeing\u201d it conceptually from angles even bats can\u2019t as the video shows is super amazing.  Sensing some extra perceptual manifold overlap to what they sense, directly is also pretty cool (subjectively, anyway \u2013 does require going a little \u201ccrazy\u201d so not for everyone) Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

The brand shipped 16.9 million units in the region for an 18% share of the pie. Its annual growth was 14%. Oppo is followed by Samsung with 16.6 million shipments and 17% market share, and Samsung's shipments fell 9% compared to 2023. Next, Transsion and Xiaomi are tied at 15.5 million shipments and 16% market share each, but while Transsion grew 41%, Xiaomi only grew 26%. The last of the top five is vivo with 12.3 million shipments, a 14% market share, and a 14% improvement in shipments compared to 2023. The market as a whole reached 96.7 million smartphones shipped, which is 11% more than in 2023. If we look at just the fourth quarter of 2024, then Transsion takes the lead with 4.1 million shipments and 17% share, growing 4% compared to Q4 2023. It's followed by Oppo with 3.9 million shipments, 16% of the pie, and 9% growth, then Xiaomi with 3.8 million shipments, 16% share, and 5% growth. Samsung is in fourth with 3.6 million shipments, 15% market share, and a 15% dip in shipments year-on-year, while vivo is in fifth with 3.5 million devices shipped, 14% of the pie, and a 10% YoY growth. Canalys says the Oppo A18 was the best selling model across the region last year, and the A3x helped drive Oppo's sales as well. On the other hand, while Samsung's shipments have dropped, its average selling price has increased by 14% from $285 in Q4 2023 to $326 in Q4 2024, so it's selling less phones but more expensive ones.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"It looks like Motorola is not messing around with its next foldable.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The hype around Motorola's upcoming Razr 2025 series is building as early renders of the Razr Plus 2025 (or Razr 60 Ultra in some places) have just surfaced. The Motorola Razr Plus (2024) made waves as one of the best foldable phones on the market, solidifying its spot as a standout in the flip phone segment. But now, the hype is shifting to whispers about its successor. Courtesy of AndroidHeadlines, we\u2019ve got leaked renders of Motorola\u2019s upcoming clamshell foldable device, codenamed Orion. The shots showcase a dark green color paired with a stitched faux leather back, hinting at a luxurious and polished design. What sets the Razr Plus 2025 apart is its huge cover display that works seamlessly with all Android apps\u2014something most flip phones can\u2019t match. The leaked images don\u2019t show many big design changes. As per the leaked renders, the right edge houses the volume buttons and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. AndroidHeadlines shared a bunch of pics, but the foldable screen inside is still under wraps. One shot hints at a punch-hole camera and slim bezels. Down at the bottom, you\u2019ve got the SIM slot, mic, USB-C port, and speaker all lined up. Further on the hardware front, the leak hints that the upcoming device will stick with its 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and the standout 4-inch OLED cover screen. Under the hood, it\u2019s expected to run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, probably the seven-core version tweaked for foldables. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android It's also likely that the Razr Plus 2025 will rock a dual-camera setup on the back. Though specifics are still unknown, rumors suggest it could combine a wide-angle lens with a telephoto lens\u2014bringing back a feature that was missing in last year\u2019s model. The Razr Plus 2025 is also rumored to pack a 4,000mAh battery, likely keeping the 45W wired and 15W wireless charging speeds from its predecessor. But with the possible shift to a 7-core Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, it\u2019s unclear how battery life will hold up. We\u2019ll have to wait for some hands-on testing to see if there\u2019s any real improvement. Jay Bonggolto always keeps a nose for news.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"We're into February, which means a global debut trifecta for Xiaomi could be in the cards.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Some alleged information regarding the upcoming availability of Xiaomi 15's latest flagship series in global areas has surfaced. According to Dealabs (French), information on the pricing of the Xiaomi 15 and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra have been discovered for European markets (via Gizmochina). The publication reportedly \"retrieved the corresponding\" price, storage, and colors of the latest Xiaomi phones. Starting with the Ultra, the post suggests it could arrive for \u20ac 1,499 (~$1,553) in France and other parts of Eurpope. Xiaomi may also only offer the device in one color, Chrome, alongside a 512GB storange option. Information on its RAM wasn't stated. Elsewhere, the post highlights the supposed Xiaomi 15 data, which claims it will cost \u20ac1,099 in Europe (~$1,138). Consumers could see colors similar to what Xiaomi delivered to its Chinese market: green, black, and white for its 512GB storage option. What's odd is that it seems Xiaomi has tinkered with the available storage options, at least for the original 15 from October. The leaks don't make it clear if the Chinese OEM is offering a 512GB choice for both the base model and the Pro, considering the latter reached 1TB while the former topped out at 256GB. There's still a little uncertainty, but that might disappear quite soon. The post claims the devices are gearing up for a February 26 launch date in Europe. The most interesting of these alleged pricing leaks is the Xiaomi 15 Ultra as, following a delay, the device is set for this month. The company's president of the mobile phone department, Lu Weibing, stated the 15 Ultra will see a \"simultaneous\" release in China and overseas markets. Weibing was attempting to answer user's burning questions about the company and its products, especially following a rumored delay. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android However, during that time, the 15 Ultra was spotted in an FCC listing with 90W fast charging. Tpster's claimed the device could see a ~5,400mAh to ~5,800mAh battery to join its rapid, corded charger and 50W wireless charging capabilities. The FCC listing also detailed support for satellite communication for texts and calls. The original Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro appeared at the FCC in November, signaling the company's upcoming global release. Xiaomi's Lu Weibing added that the 15 Ultra would drop after the Chinese New Year. The celebrations usually run into February so, perhaps, this rumored late date holds some merit. More importantly, the Ultra should join its base and Pro siblings in that global debut as Xiaomi did something similar with the 14 series.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Business Insider Edition  Sam Altman hit back at Elon Musk over his surprise bid for OpenAI, describing the move as an effort to stifle a competitor and saying he doesn't think the Tesla boss is a \"happy person.\"          \"Probably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,\" Altman said of Musk in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of the Paris AI Action Summit. He added: \"I don't think he's a happy person. I do feel for him.\"               Musk on Monday led an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid with other investment firms to acquire OpenAI's nonprofit arm, a proposal Altman has dismissed outright.               Musk said in a statement on Monday that the bid was about returning OpenAI to an \"open-source, safety-focused force for good.\"               Altman suggested Musk's bid was less about OpenAI and more about stalling a competitor.               \"I think he's probably just trying to slow us down,\" Altman told Bloomberg. \"He obviously is a competitor. He's working hard, and he's raised a lot of money for xAI. They're trying to compete with us from a technological perspective, from, you know, getting the product into the market.\"               Musk's xAI is building rival AI models, positioning itself as a direct competitor to OpenAI.               \"I wish he would just compete by building better a product,\" Altman said. \"But I think there have been a lot of tactics \u2014 many, many lawsuits, all sorts of other crazy stuff, now this. And we'll try to just put our head down and keep working.\"               Altman told journalists at the Paris AI summit that OpenAI was \"not for sale.\" When asked by CNBC how seriously he was taking Musk's bid, the OpenAI chief said, \"Not particularly.\"               Shortly after news of the bid broke, Altman said on X, \"no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\"               Musk replied, \"Swindler.\"                  Swindler               \u2014 Harry Blz (@elonmusk) February 10, 2025           OpenAI, X, and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.       Tensions between Musk and Altman have been escalating for years. Musk was a cofounder of OpenAI with Altman but cut ties with the company in 2018.               In March, Musk sued Altman and OpenAI, accusing the company of betraying its founding principles; he dropped the lawsuit months later. In August, he filed another lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI, accusing them of manipulating him into cofounding the company as a nonprofit.               Altman has repeatedly downplayed Musk's legal moves, suggesting they're part of a broader attempt to undermine OpenAI's progress.               Musk, meanwhile, has publicly criticized Altman and OpenAI's close ties to Microsoft, one of its largest backers, arguing that the company that created ChatGPT is no longer acting in the public interest.               Now Musk's close ties to President Donald Trump add an undercurrent to the tech CEOs' long-running feud.               When Bloomberg asked Altman if he was worried about Musk's political influence, he said: \"Maybe I should. But not particularly.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Deepak Puri, Chief Investment Officer of Deutsche Bank (DB) Private Bank, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our \u201cSmart Investing\u201d video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): How do you expect markets to react to Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum? DEEPAK PURI (DP): Well, I think the companies that export steel and aluminum to the US, they\u2019re going to have a little bit of a negative price reaction because the chances are with that, those kind of tariffs, there\u2019s going to be a substitution effect. And that\u2019s really is what the administration is trying to do. They want to bring some of these industries back to the US. They want to bring the jobs that accompany these manufacturing back to the US. So I think that\u2019s a very quick knee-jerk reaction. But for the entire trade and tariff scenario, I would say the things that I\u2019m keeping track on is the sequencing of events, the sequencing of which industries or sectors are much more front and center than the intensity of those events. And then the retaliation. So sequencing, intensity, retaliation. And I think just like President Trump is much better prepared to start with trade tariff much earlier in his second term, I think a lot of our trading partners are also preparing for these sort of trades and tariff wars, so they are much more inclined to start reciprocating very quickly. And you\u2019re seeing that.  You\u2019ve seen that initially with Mexico, Canada, when those were announced, then retraced, but the Canadian authorities were very quick to come up with their own tit-for-tat tariffs. And I think similar things could happen, you know as a way of reciprocating for these steel and aluminum tariffs. However, having said that, I think that\u2019s one of the stated goals of this administration is to reduce trade deficit. The United States trades with almost a hundred countries, more than that, and with most of them we have a trade deficit, meaning we import more from that country, then we export to them. And what President Trump is saying that there needs to be a level playing field. You need to open your markets to our goods and services just like we have opened our markets to your goods and services and these trade and tariff wars are nothing but a bargaining chip to come to that agreement. I\u2019m not sure how quickly, if ever you can get to a trade balance with the fact that the US consumer has much higher propensity to consume than the rest of the world, right? We consume a lot more, so it\u2019ll be very difficult to tell other countries that their population needs to start consuming like us. Culturally it\u2019s just not there. So I think the trade deficit is going to remain with us. However, this does score some brownie points because this is something he has campaigned on, so he is following through on his campaign promises to some of those swing states where he won decisively. AM: Steel stocks reacted positively in the US markets to these tariffs. Do you see other sectors being affected either positively or negatively? DP: Indeed,  there\u2019s going to be, even if the dynamics don\u2019t change overnight, there\u2019s going to be a big bid up in prices for some of the sectors where tariffs might be forthcoming. And there have been talks with regards to pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, automobiles. These are three major industries where tariffs might be coming to from countries that are producing these and then exporting it to our country. So the local pharmaceutical companies, local automobile manufacturers, might be in a better position to play the trade and tariff. But I will say this is one factor that you may want to consider when you\u2019re doing your initial stock due diligence in terms of which stock to pick or which sector to pick. Because the myriad of factors that influence a stock price movement, it\u2019s  the macro backdrop of where we are as an economy that plays a much bigger role, the underlying corporate health and feasibility. Are you making earnings? What is your business model? Is it additive? Or have you been increasing market share? So I think those also should play a role in addition to the, the trade and tariff stuff that we are talking about. AM: The CEO of Ford has come out and said that these tariffs are causing chaos in the auto industry. How do you see them playing out in that sector? DP: Yeah, autos is one of the key pain points that at least the administration has pointed that we pay a lot less,  we have less tariffs on foreign auto producers than those companies have for US auto manufacturers. So there needs to be a level playing field. Having said that, one of the reasons inflation has been so high has been because of used car sales. And then tomorrow we\u2019re gonna get the inflation data. And I\u2019m interested to see what portion of the increase month-over-month is coming from the used car price point. So this is something that\u2019s been going on, it\u2019s a secular trend, it seems. Post-pandemic, people were much more inclined to buy an extra automobile, maybe to go to their second home. And that has stayed even to now, three or four years after the pandemic. So there\u2019s a lot more demand for cause. And if you\u2019re gonna have a supply disruption, they\u2019ll put upward pressure on the price of automobiles, which will then lead into a higher inflation.  Now, one thing I feel, and we haven\u2019t talked much about it, is the inflation. Almost all trade and tariffs are disruptive to the supply chain. And the initial reaction tends to be that inflation expectations may go up. Now for the time being, that hasn\u2019t been the case, but that is one area that I want everyone to be focused on is, are the inflation expectations getting what\u2019s called unanchored? They have been quite anchored at around 3% for the next year, next five years. Do they start going up? Because that\u2019ll be a nice cue for the administration to dial down the trade and tariff talk because people are now expecting this to become much more inflationary and then the rates market is gonna react, which in essence can then have an impact on the stock market. So how it\u2019s flows through into the inflation narrative is really the key to come out of, with regards to automobiles, but broader trade and tariff narrative. AM: It\u2019s really interesting. And I\u2019m also curious how this shakes out because the Fed is obviously watching inflation, then Trump has opinions about what the Fed should do, and then he\u2019s got his agenda as well, which may have to pivot, depending on what happens with inflation. DP: Absolutely. And I think that\u2019s why the cards are very close to President Trump\u2019s chest. We just don\u2019t know. But I think the administration knows that one of the reasons the incumbents lost was because of inflation. So to have policies that just spur up more inflation, given that the midterm is not going to be that far away, would be a little bit of shortsightedness.  The other thing I would say is that I think if you\u2019re President Trump and this administration, they\u2019re not looking at this as a four-year term. They are looking this as the next 15, 16 months. The key date in mind for them is really July 4th, 2026. And it\u2019s a heavy word, but it\u2019s the semi quincentennial anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the 250th year. And given it\u2019s going to be such a historic moment with a president that has this panache for big moments and historic moments, it\u2019s hard for me to see that policies, yes, they may be on steroids now, but may not be ratcheted down given if it starts impacting real economy and the stock market. So I think President Trump wants to enter this 250th anniversary with a lot more optimism about the real economy and the stock market, and they\u2019re gonna do whatever it takes to keep the rally going for the time being. AM: If you had one final thought to give investors out there, what would it be? DP: If you\u2019re just strictly talking about trade and tariff, my first reaction would be not to react on everything that comes out from the administration because the markets work in mysterious and complicated ways. That would be one driving factor, but I think it might be shortsighted to just make that decision. So you want to look at other variables that might influence the stock market. The other thing I would say is that trade and tariff wars, obviously they are there, and I don\u2019t think for the next three years we are gonna get anywhere around it. But on the other hand, keep your personal objectives in mind. These are externalities you have little control over. And in some instances it might just purely be noise, but what hasn\u2019t really changed, is if your own personal situation, the biggest risk to your portfolio is not really whether there\u2019s going to be more trades in tariff, whether it\u2019s going to be a recession or even earnings, how they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s really your ability to meet the objective for which you start investing in the first place. Are you on track? So for those kinds of things, it\u2019s always better to keep your emotions in check, be a little bit more objective with your risk assessment, with your return expectations, and take, you know, those as the, the driving factor for your investments rather than taking cues from the outside.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk's brother sold Tesla stock worth about $28 million in a single day, per a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Monday.  Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director, cashed in 75,000 shares of the electric vehicle company on Thursday. The latest disposals trimmed his stake by nearly 5%, to 1.46 million shares, worth about $514 million at Monday's close.               The Tesla CEO's younger brother cofounded the software company Zip2 with him in 1995 but has since focused on ventures including restaurants, urban farming, and outdoor classrooms.               Tesla shares have surged by almost 40% since the US election on November 5. Elon Musk helped Donald Trump win by spending more than $250 million in support of his campaign, speaking at his rallies, and marshaling his social media followers to vote for the former president.               Investors wagered that Elon Musk's role as a trusted advisor to the president and the head of the quasi-governmental Department of Government Efficiency would translate to light-touch regulation of his companies and supportive policies.               But Tesla shares have dropped by 13% this year even as the broader stock market has risen, fueling a nearly $40 billion decline in Elon Musk's net worth, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He remains the world's richest person, with an estimated net worth of $395 billion \u2014\u00a0$142 billion more than that of his nearest rival, Mark Zuckerberg.               A Stifel analyst said in a recent note that Elon Musk's government work appeared to be souring consumers on the Tesla chief and his company, which could weigh on sales.               Elon Musk has long argued that Tesla is more than an automaker. He's touted its artificial intelligence efforts, arguing that they'd lead to huge profits from future products such as Optimus humanoid robots and fully self-driving vehicles.               Insider stock transactions are closely watched on Wall Street as they can indicate sentiment about a company. Directors' jettisoning shares could signal that they expect the company's share price to plunge and want to cash out before it does.               Insiders may sell stock for many reasons, including diversification, retirement planning, or a need for a lump sum to pay taxes or cover a large expense.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Real estate broker and CEO Ryan Serhant sat down with Quartz to discuss the luxury real estate market, reality television, and his new AI venture: S. MPLE. Serhant appeared on the Bravo (CMCSA-0.68%) television series \u201cMillion Dollar Listing\u201d from 2012 to 2021 and now stars on the Netflix (NFLX+1.56%) series \u201cOwning Manhattan.\u201d He recently made the biggest transaction of his real estate career \u2014 closing on a $200 million property, while on a flight to Miami.  Check out Serhant\u2019s conversation with Quartz below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Quartz: One of the interesting things about the high end real estate market is that there\u2019s technically no hard definition of luxury real estate. When you\u2019re looking at a property, what elements make it truly luxurious? Serhant: I think most people define luxury by the cost: if you\u2019re spending $10 million, most people would say, \u2018well, ten million \u2013 that\u2019s luxury.\u2019 For me to consider a property luxury real estate, I look at the quality and the attention to detail. There\u2019s $10 million boxes that are probably just expensive because of the location or size. But they\u2019re not luxurious. A $1 million incredible home, that had artisans using Venetian plaster, might not be in the most luxurious location, but it\u2019s a luxury home. The first thing I look at in a home \u2013 and I\u2019m weird \u2013 is the hardware, in rooms like the kitchen and bathroom. Because it\u2019s one of the last things you buy, when you\u2019re building or designing your home. It really reveals if someone is spending the right amount of money and not forgetting the details. When people pay less attention to details, it makes me wonder, \u2018okay, what else did you cheat on?\u2019 If you want to know if a place was built the right way, if it\u2019s a real luxury property, look at the door knobs. I go into houses all the time that have s\u2014-y, little door knobs and I just know: this is going to be a problem. It always is, every time. Quartz: What is the biggest piece of advice you\u2019d give to someone who watches a show like \u201cOwning Manhattan\u201d or \u201cMillion Dollar Listing\u201d and wants to get into the luxury real estate market? Serhant: First: get your license. Then you need to work on a team and be an apprentice for two or three years. You\u2019re not going to start making money tomorrow. You have to really, really learn. That has to be part of the plan. And if you can stomach that, I think it\u2019s the greatest career you could ever have. Quartz: You\u2019re venturing into the world of AI with S.MPLE by SERHANT. Can you explain what S.MPLE does and how you foresee AI impacting the luxury real estate industry? Serhant: S.MPLE is a workflow automation service that uses what we call artificial intelligent recipes to create agentic support. Long gone are the days where now you need seven different systems to do your administrative work. Using S.MPLE, you get back the 80% of your day that you use for administrative tasks. Now you can actually spend your time getting out there, selling, and creating deals and relationships. For the consumer, it makes your relationship with your salesperson so much more valuable, because you don\u2019t wait for anything anymore. All the administrative work is now automated. It\u2019s creating much stronger relationships, especially when consumers are working with an agent to buy something. I think until a house sells itself to another house, there\u2019s still a great need for salespeople. And when you\u2019re spending a lot of money, you want to talk to a human. But S.MPLE removes a lot of the additional complexities. Your work is done for you. Our team calls it Instacart (CART+0.93%) for sales.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"After disappointing performance from some recent big name titles on handhelds, Stellar Blade is going to be taking things seriously.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Popular PS5 title, Stellar Blade, will be making the jump to the PC later on in 2025, and it's looking good for handheld users, too. In Shift Up's latest earnings report (via GamingOnLinux), specific attention is paid to how the game will be optimized for 'UMPC' which is an old-school way of saying gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally. The information comes from the Q&A portion of said earnings report: \"Q.2: What are the expected results of PC version, and why? A.2 : In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version. We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry. We have identified and analyzed both successful and underperforming cases of console exclusives released on PC, and we are preparing to release the game in a way that ensures continued success in the PC market. This will include optimization, enhancing user convenience, adding supplementary content, and tailored marketing strategies unique to Shift Up. In particular, we plan to optimize the game to ensure smooth gameplay even in UMPC (Steam Deck) environments.\"  Despite the success of the Steam Deck, in particular, it can still feel at times like handheld owners are second fiddle when it comes to big game releases. Sure, there are limitations on the hardware, but still, it's refreshing to hear a developer talking up handhelds in this way as a priority, not an afterthought. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The most recent PlayStation exclusive to jump to PC, Spider-Man 2, certainly didn't have handhelds in mind. OK, it was generally a mess at launch on PC, but handhelds with their reduced horsepower feel the burden even greater. The other part of the quote above that stands out to me is that they have \"identified and analyzed both successful and underperforming cases of console exclusives released on PC.\" Gamers on PC do have different expectations at times to console players, who are mostly happy to download a game, open it, and it just works. On PC there are additional factors, not least mouse and keyboard, as well as Ultrawide monitors, high frame rates, and so on. Stellar Blade has been pretty popular to this point on the PS5, if Shift Up nails the PC port, then they could really have a winner on their hands.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Deepak Puri, Chief Investment Officer of Deutsche Bank Private Bank (DB), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our \u201cSmart Investing\u201d video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Given Sam Altman\u2019s open rejection of Elon\u2019s bid to take over open AI, how do you see that changing the AI landscape for investors? DEEPAK PURI (DP): AI has been in the news for a couple of years now. It just tells you the stakes are high. You have two of the most powerful people, not only in the tech stratosphere, but in general in markets terms, going head-to-head in terms of their vision for AI. I also feel that given what happened with DeepSeek over the last couple of weeks, there are more questions being asked by investors in terms of all the CapEx spending that\u2019s going into AI. Has it been monetized or is it being monetized in the right way? Meaning if a big mega tech firm is putting billions of dollars of investment in AI, at what point do the earnings number and the revenue that they have start being additive, given the AI investments? So there are going to be a lot more questions raised because of DeepSeek, but it\u2019s not morphing into this sort of egoistical drama between these two individuals. That at least tells me that AI is going to be with us in some way, shape, or form, and directing this market for some time to come. AM: Yeah. So with the companies that have reported earnings so far, they\u2019ve previewed what their AI spending will be going into the rest of the year, and they\u2019re keeping their foot on the gas despite the DeepSeek revelations, we\u2019ll call them, or curiosities. When do you think investors are going to start to get impatient with all of this spending? DP: It\u2019s the third year in of the initial launch of ChatGPT, November 2022. So I think markets and investors are patient, especially given the kind of liquidity that\u2019s out there. I think investors are going to be able to say, okay, let\u2019s wait and watch because the upside is so large. You\u2019re looking at a transformational technology that can really make a dent into our productivity, which has been the holy grail. That\u2019s what everyone\u2019s been looking for over the last 15, 20 years. And so I think in this particular instance, investors would have a longer shelf life in terms of how much patience they have. Any other technology, which was probably not as transformational, I think it would\u2019ve been much lower. But I think maybe this year, even next. The other thing I would say is that the rules of the engagement of AI are going to be written in this administration, and this administration seems to have a regulatory relief as part of their standard protocol, which again, should be beneficial to the complex in general. AM: And given this personal feud that Altman and Musk have with each other, do you see the administration having to react to this? I mean, Musk\u2019s on Trump\u2019s one side, Altman\u2019s now working directly on the other side with Stargate, right? Do you see this impacting the evolution of AI? DP: Maybe not evolution, but obviously there might be some comments being made by the administration, by the FCC, by the Treasury Secretary, because there are so many touch points of AI, and I think the administration knows that AI is going to be an important, not just from a stock market perspective, but it has bigger consequences when it comes to the real economy as well, how quickly some of these AI-related technologies get commercialized and we start feeling it on our day-to-day lives. So I think there is going to be a lot more verbiage coming out of the administration. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re gonna be taking sides per se, because I think in a way President Trump can act as a bridge and say we need to work towards this very good goal of getting AI done. So that might be one way of having his say in this. AM: As AI proliferates throughout other sectors and asset classes, where can investors take advantage? What sectors should they consider? DP: Yeah, so initially the enablers of a technology are the ones that the market bids up. And we have seen that with the big tech. When you\u2019re looking at AI, you want to look at maybe three areas. One is the chips. The other thing would be in data. It uses a lot of data, so data centers, cloud, that comes into play. And the third is really the infrastructure surrounding AI, which is power because it\u2019s a high-powered technology, you need to look into, you know, those industries. But I think a lot of those are probably priced in, those gains. I\u2019m not saying that those are gonna go down dramatically, but I would be very cautious of putting new money into some of these areas because I think those sectors and industries are priced in. At this stage, maybe investors want to broaden their focus from the enablers to the adapters and those industries and sectors that are going to be adapting AI to their business models. And the areas that I feel are much more open for doing this would be in finance. So financial tech, FinTech, healthcare, med tech, those two, and then consumers. I think these three areas are probably more primed for adopting the AI and creating their own use-cases and adopting them into their business model. So those would be the sort of broad sectors that I would be focused on for the next leg of AI sort of permeating into the broader stock market.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"CLN Asian equities were mostly lower overnight as Pakistan and Thailand outperformed and Hong Kong and Indonesia underperformed. China\u2019s markets took a breather last night after a strong run. It was a relatively slow news night without a key catalyst to bring markets lower. Mainland markets opened flat, but followed their Hong Kong counterparts south later in the session. Meanwhile, Hong Kong started to regain some ground mid-session, but ended near worst levels. Profit taking may have been a culprit here as the latest popular trades were all lower, including technology, consumer discretionary, and the electric vehicle ecosystem. Also, Mainland investors were heavy net sellers of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, to the tune of over $1 billion. Auto names fell broadly on concerns of competition from BYD\u2019s new in-house assisted and smart driving features that it intends to roll out. The giant is China\u2019s largest carmaker and, with the right software, could be a serious threat to autonomous-only competitors such as Baidu. However, there were some positives. Shipping names were higher on data showing that container volume at Shanghai\u2019s port reached a new record in January. Premier Li spoke on CCTV about increasing foreign investment and raising wages to promote domestic consumption. Meanwhile, DeepSeek was reported to be seeking to build a team to work on highly theoretical \u201cArtificial General Intelligence.\" China\u2019s CPI jump to 0.5% in January from 0.1% in December and negative inflation, or deflation, in recent periods is a positive sign for the consumer. This was the fastest-paced inflation reading in five months. Healthy Chinese (Lunar) New Year spending was the likely culprit in raising China\u2019s inflation rate in January. Meanwhile, trade-in consumption subsidy policies continue to trickle down into the real economy. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce, more than 20 million applications for electronics trade-ins have been submitted, referencing purchases of over 25 million units. Illumina, a U.S.-based genomic sequencing company with significant China revenues of 10% in 2022, was added to China\u2019s retaliatory \u201cUnreliable Entities\u201d list. The company said it is engaging constructively with authorities and intends to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations in China\u2019s jurisdiction. Health care stocks have been on the rise lately. The end of a long-running antigraft campaign in hospital procurement was a likely catalyst. Meanwhile, the CEO of contract research organization Wuxi Biologics, which would have been targeted by the botched U.S. Biosecure Act, said that new contracts are at an all-time high during JP Morgan\u2019s Annual Conference last month. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed lower by -1.06% and -2.73%, respectively, on volume that declined by -9% from Monday. Mainland investors sold a net -$1.14 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs overnight via Southbound Stock Connect. The top-performing sectors were Energy, which gained +0.15%, Materials, which fell -0.25%, and Financials, which fell -0.32%.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 22-year-old Dhruv Loya, from Buffalo, New York, about job searching and landing a role at Tesla. The following has been edited for length and clarity.          I did over a year of job hunting before I landed my first job after college, working for Tesla.               I started looking for jobs in the summer of 2023. Back in 2020, I moved from Pune, India, to study biomedical engineering at the State University of New York at Buffalo. I spent a lot of money, took student loans, and received financial support from my parents to study in the US, but it was really difficult for me to land a job. I applied to hundreds of listings, but I often didn't hear back or got rejected.               Although I have a job now, I'm aware that it's a very tough time for students looking for work. There are particular difficulties for international students who rely on companies to sponsor their visas.               I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do after college, but growing up, I always wanted to get into a company where I could use my tech skills to do something innovative with an impact.               I did several internships while at university and also had an on-campus job helping students and faculty with tech problems. I wanted to use my time at college to figure out my future career.               In the summer of my third year, I started applying for full-time jobs. I wanted to be employed by December so I could enjoy my last semester and the following summer without worrying about finding a job.               I had an interest in entry-level sales engineer roles but wasn't having much success because I didn't have sales experience. I pivoted toward quality engineering roles because I'd done an internship in this area.               When I applied for jobs, I got ghosted or received automated rejection emails. I tried changing my rsum templates and making YouTube videos to sell myself to recruiters, but nothing seemed to be working.               Things seemed to improve in the fall of 2023 when I started optimizing my rsum for ATS, the tracking software employers use to assess whether your rsum matches the job description. I got ChatGPT premium and asked it to do an ATS analysis on my rsum using the job descriptions for the roles I was applying to. I'd try to keep my score at about 85% because I thought this could help me avoid automated rejections.               I don't know for sure if ChatGPT helped, but when I started using the tool, I saw a difference and received more callbacks.               But I faced another obstacle too. During the application process or interviews with recruiters, there would be a question about whether I'd need a visa sponsorship now or in the future.               Because I was a STEM student, I had access to three years of OPT \u2014 optional practical training \u2014 with my student visa. This meant I wouldn't need sponsorship for three years after graduation, but I'd still answer yes to the question because it asked if I needed sponsorship in the future. After admitting this, I'd receive rejection emails.               When I graduated in May 2024, I still didn't have a job. My parents didn't come to my graduation because they decided to financially support me in my unemployment instead of spending money on the trip from India. I was very upset about it.               My lease expired in August, and I had nowhere to go. I stayed with friends instead of spending money on rent.               I was job hunting on borrowed time. I had 90 days to find a job on my OPT, which took me to late October.               A friend who I studied with got a job at Tesla and recommended me to the recruiter. I sent my rsum, and they interviewed me.               When I spoke to the recruiter, I mentioned I'd have authorization to work for three years through OPT, and it was fine if they didn't sponsor me after that. They gave me a job offer in October 2024 to work as a Powerwall technical support specialist. The role involves troubleshooting the Tesla battery product, which stores solar energy for powering people's homes. It's also more customer-facing than the quality engineering jobs I was applying for previously.               I'm hoping I can move up in the company and get a role where I'd be sponsored and take on more engineering and managerial responsibilities. However, if I have to move back to India after three years, I'd happily do that.               In the end, getting a job wasn't as tough as the journey. Tesla was hiring new people, and the timing was right.               I have many friends who are struggling to find jobs right now, both international and domestic students. In 2023, there were so many layoffs at big companies that more people were put back in the market.               Companies are trying to cut costs, and it seems to me like they're avoiding sponsorships for international candidates. There are a limited number of visas available in the US, so there's much uncertainty around whether candidates will actually get a visa, even when the company is spending so much money on them.               I don't think mass-applying to hundreds of jobs is effective in the current job market. Instead, candidates should focus on quality over quantity. Be strategic, reach out to people, and try to get referrals. Connections and referrals can significantly improve job search outcomes.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"IBM CEO Arvind Krishna There has been considerable discussion and stock price volatility of late surrounding the expected timing of useful applications and hardware for quantum computing. One month after Google created excitement around its Willow quantum chip, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, started a food fight on Wall Street by predicting that quantum computing won\u2019t be a significant computing paradigm for at least a decade. Quantum stocks dropped over 30%. Subsequently, Bill Gates joined in, saying, \u201cThere is the possibility that the [Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang]  Not one to wade into a shouting match, IBM (a client of Cambrian-AI Research) has been quietly and steadily advancing quantum computing sciences and use cases, as explained in a series of webinars, covering quantum applications in energy, financial modeling, electronics, and health care. Last year, IBM also published the 4th edition of a dazzling coffee table book on the coming Quantum Decade. IBM probably has hundreds of scientists working on quantum developing hardware, software, and ecosystems to lead in this exotic technology. While IBM and other quantum innovators like Microsoft, Google, AWS, and startups see hundreds of applications in development today, Zuckerberg and Huang are probably looking for big-impact applications. And there aren\u2019t any, at least not yet. The current quantum applications being developed fill specific scientific niches with little industrial and economic impact. They are important niches to the scientists who can now solve previously unsolvable problems, but they may not constitute another multi-billion-dollar market. Those applications will take much faster quantum computers and new algorithms that can exploit the hardware. IBM and its competitors are developing hardware, software tools, and algorithms that could deliver those billion-dollar applications in the next 5-10 years. Specific uses of quantum computing in physics and chemistry are already pushing research forward. Still, these experiments demand faster hardware, error correction, and new algorithms beyond the R&D setting. IBM thinks it can achieve quantum advantage sometime in the next two years - via improved performance and error mitigation techniques and increased collaboration with the HPC community. IBM also announced its plans to reach over 2,000 logical qubits. True error correction should arrive in 2029 with the Starling processor, followed by the Blue Jay processor, with 2,000 logical qubits and over a billion gates in 2033. Quantum is hard; extremely hard. Advances in cryogenics, qubit design, scaling interconnects, algorithm development, run-time tools, and applications will enable useful and perhaps pervasive quantum solutions. The inherent error rate of quantum bits is a thousand times higher than that of digital circuitry. Consequently, scaling quantum processors to thousands of qubits and dealing with the instability of those qubits creates demanding challenges. Useful Quantum Computing requires advances in the hardware and the algorithms But we are getting close to realizing significant advances as these developments take shape. The chart above explains the dynamics at play. We are currently at the beginning of quantum utility, where we can begin to see the benefits of hardware and algorithms as we progress. All quantum industry players including IBM, Amazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft, hardware startups (Alice and Bob, Atos D-Wave, Quantinuum, Rigetti, QuEra and Xanadu among others) are amongst the over 70 global quantum startups working on solving these challenges. Along the way, advances in quantum are supported and complemented by advances in classic HPC computing to support the execution of the circuits by offloading some of the execution onto the CPU and GPU or using those tools to clean the results. In fact, accelerated servers surround quantum processors, always working in tandem with classical computers In IBM\u2019s most recent webinar, we learned how researchers apply quantum to solve Life Sciences and Health Care problems. One of the brightest application spaces for quantum is accelerating the R&D process for pharmaceuticals. The current process takes 10-15 years, billions of dollars, and yet 90% of drug candidates fail. Quantum and AI can potentially speed the process, cost less, and produce superior outcomes, potentially becoming the billion-dollar solution that Jensen and Zuckerburg seek. In drug discovery, quantum computing can speed the development and evaluation of proteins through simulation and applying machine learning. Quantum computers have the potential to simulate complex molecular interactions at an atomic level with unprecedented accuracy, allowing researchers to model drug-protein interactions more realistically, leading to the discovery of novel therapeutic compounds. Quantum algorithms have the potential to search vast chemical databases much faster than classical computers, enabling rapid identification of potential drug candidates that match specific molecular criteria. Quantum computers can also identify optimal molecular structures for specific targets, leading to improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of potential drugs. Quantum computing could speed up the screening of vast libraries of potential drug candidates, allowing researchers to quickly identify promising molecules for further testing. Quantum computing has the potential to model complex protein folding patterns and interactions at a molecular level, helping researchers identify novel drug targets that were previously undetectable. IBM is researching the applicability of quantum computing across the broad spectrum of drug ... [+] development and delivery, Quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare and life sciences by addressing key challenges in the field. For example, quantum algorithms can integrate data to uncover critical genes, proteins, and pathways. Quantum walks can identify key proteins in cancer signaling pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies. Additionally, quantum methods speed the discovery of higher-order gene interactions, accelerating the understanding of polygenic diseases. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms enhance predictions of protein and RNA structures, which are crucial for designing biologics and mRNA therapies. Quantum techniques also improve ligand-based virtual screening and simulate drug-target interactions with unprecedented accuracy, enabling better lead optimization. In clinical trials, quantum algorithms can optimize trial designs, site selection, and cohort identification, reducing costs and improving outcomes. The webinar showcased several collaborative success stories where IBM has partnered with industry leaders to demonstrate the potentially transformative power of quantum computing. A few examples: Client use cases To accelerate industry adoption further, IBM has launched the Quantum Accelerator program, which helps enterprises identify business problems suitable for quantum solutions, prototype quantum applications iteratively, and leverage IBM\u2019s ecosystem of over 250 members and 39 innovation centers. This program is designed to support the enterprise during all their journey of quantum adoption. If you ask IBM, they will tell you it already has, albeit in small doses, while the potential wave of quantum applications will begin in earnest around 2030. Whether that is early or late depends on your expectations, and Jensen and Zuckerberg are famously impatient guys. We believe that quantum computing is poised to transform healthcare and life sciences by addressing computational bottlenecks and enabling groundbreaking innovations. From understanding disease mechanisms to optimizing drug discovery pipelines, IBM quantum\u2019s advancements promise to unlock unprecedented opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, reducing R&D costs, accelerating timelines, and improving patient outcomes.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"SUQIAN, CHINA - JANUARY 28, 2025 - A illustration photo shows DeepSeek and Nvidia logo on January ... [+] 28, 2025 in Suqian, Jiangsu, China. (Photo credit should read CFOTO\/Future Publishing via Getty Images) On January 27, 2025, China-owned DeepSeek, an AI research and technology company comparable to OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, topped the Apple App Store\u2019s Top Free Apps chart just days after releasing its flagship model, R1. DeepSeek\u2019s models have outperformed those of OpenAI and Anthropic in some third-party tests, while operating at a fraction of the cost by using fewer high-end chips. Following DeepSeek\u2019s rise, the stock prices of AI giants Nvidia, Oracle, and Microsoft dropped by 16%, 10%, and 4%, respectively. According to Scott Galloway, a business analyst and co-host of the Pivot podcast, Meta\u2019s stock price was expected to drop. However, it has remained steady as the company sets up several \u2018war rooms\u2019 to analyze DeepSeek. Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, has argued that DeepSeek\u2019s approach is a \u2018cheap and dirty\u2019 version of AI, while U.S. companies focus on more advanced solutions. But how much will that distinction impact consumer behavior? DeepSeek has adopted a strategy similar to that of Chinese e-commerce giant Temu, which offers fast fashion\u2014arguably lower-quality products\u2014at accessible price points. In 2024, Temu captured a 17% share of the U.S. e-commerce market within the discount store category, becoming the no. 1 most downloaded app on the US app store. As Deepseek gains traction in the U.S. market, what should music industry players be aware of? Lower-cost AI solutions could make DeepSeek an attractive option for startups building tools to optimize workflows and reduce inefficiencies within the music business. As the industry increasingly depends on emerging technologies, DeepSeek\u2019s advancements may reshape how music businesses operate. Over the past year, the music industry has experienced whiplash\u2014from looming TikTok bans. A social platform that has become embedded in the music business, fueling discovery while expanding licensing opportunities and driving revenue for both new and legacy artists. As businesses grow increasingly reliant on AI infrastructure, the risk of regulatory crackdowns poses challenges not just for music stakeholders, but for the broader economy, as the very platforms they depend on could be restricted or removed.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"US President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in ... [+] Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on all US imports of steel and aluminum. Photographer: Al Drago\/Bloomberg Updated, Feb 12, 2025: This post has been adjusted to add details about the January 2025 Consumer Price Index report. Earnings season is well underway, and investors are getting a glimpse at how companies have performed in the last quarter of 2024 and, more importantly, how firms are reacting to the potential policy changes in and the shifting macro landscape. The continuous stream of news relating to tariffs, AI adoption, immigration, and government spending could impact inflation, economic growth, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. While the impact of these factors is still unknown, analyzing the most recent S&P 500 earnings and management comments can provide insight into how corporate America is preparing for the uncertainty. As of February 7, 61% of the S&P 500 had reported quarterly earnings. Overall, results are encouraging. The aggregate year-over-year earnings per share growth rate is 13.1%, exceeding the initial analysts\u2019 consensus expectation of 8%. According to FactSet, analysts forecast a 13% growth in S&P 500 profits in 2025. The market is paying particularly close attention to profit growth given the S&P 500\u2019s lofty valuation of 22.1 times one-year forward earnings. Technology companies continue to lead earnings growth, although their dominance at the index level is beginning to fade. Profits for the mega-cap Magnificent 7 relative to the S&P 493 narrowed to 19% in Q4 2025, the smallest gap since Q1 2023. Bottom-up consensus estimates imply the earnings growth premium will continue to decline to 6% in 2025 and 4% in 2026, suggesting broader market profits are set to rebound. A wider distribution of earnings growth should help stock performance for the sectors that have failed to keep up with the rally in technology shares over the last two years. Communication services, financials, and information technology were the standout performers in Q4, benefiting from growth in digital infrastructure, a steeper yield curve, and increasing demand for artificial intelligence applications. Communication services sector quarterly blended earnings, which includes companies that have already reported and projections for companies yet to announce, grew at 29%. Profits in information technology climbed a more modest 16.2%. Financials, in particular, benefitted from rising net interest income and renewed activity in capital markets, helping blended earnings grow 51.2% in Q4 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023. However, some sectors were hit hard by developments in global markets. Energy companies\u2019 profits declined by 27.5% as falling oil prices, reduced refining margins, and weaker global demand impacted bottom-line performance. Materials, insurance, and autos also lagged, while staples and industrials underperformed their long-term growth levels. Unsurprisingly, one common theme on post-earnings management calls is the mention of tariffs. To date, 50% of S&P companies have referenced tariffs when discussing their outlook. At a macro level, tariffs remain a significant downside to corporate earnings. According to a Goldman Sachs note to institutional investors, economists project a five-percentage-point increase in the effective U.S. tariff rate, which could reduce 2025 S&P 500 EPS by approximately 1% to 2% and lower the overall economic growth rate by one percentage point. While tariff policy is still highly uncertain, companies are prepared to adjust if needed. \u201cWe\u2019re planning for multiple scenarios because it\u2019s not just the tariff that may be on Mexico or Canada or China; it\u2019s the impact of retaliatory tariffs that would also come into play on those supply chains. So we\u2019re looking at very tactical short-term, midterm, and long-term if necessary actions,\u201d said Stanley Sutula, the chief financial officer of Colgate-Palmolive, during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. Potential tariffs also have an impact on manufacturing capital investment plans. \u201cWith respect to possible tariffs, we are working across our supply chain logistics network and assembly plants so that we are prepared to mitigate near-term impacts. Many of these actions are no cost or low cost. What we won\u2019t do is spend a large amount of capital without clarity,\u201d said Mary Barra, chair and CEO of General Motors, during the company\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings call. Another common theme in Q4 2024 earnings season is the adoption of artificial intelligence and continued capital expenditure from the large technology hyperscalers. The group of AI hyperscalers, which includes Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon, is set to spend over $320 billion in 2025 on AI-related technologies and infrastructure, up 40% from 2024. Microsoft announced plans to spend $80 billion on data centers for AI workloads, Google expects to invest $75 billion for cloud and networking infrastructure, Meta is budgeting $60 to $65 billion to accelerate AI innovation and maintain leadership in technology, and Amazon anticipates spending $100 billion to expand AWS capacity and meet surging demand for AI services. AI adoption is filtering into non-technology companies as well in an attempt to drive productivity and grow margins. \u201cMore than 4 million advertisers are now using at least one of our generative AI ad creative tools, up from 1 million six months ago,\u201d said Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li. Given the volume of data stored in the financial sector and the need to regularly implement new technology, large institutions such as Citigroup are pushing forward with implementing AI into operations. \u201cWe accelerated our use of AI, arming 30,000 developers with tools to write code, and launched two AI platforms to make 143,000 colleagues more efficient. The investments we\u2019re making to modernize our infrastructure, streamline processes and automate controls are changing how we run the bank,\u201d said Jane Fraser, chief executive officer of Citigroup, during the bank\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call. Every sector appears to be pushing forward with AI adoption. For example, retailers use AI for inventory optimization, banks use it for fraud prevention, industrial companies use it to create predictive maintenance tools, and healthcare firms deploy AI for drug discovery and diagnostics. As costs come down and availability grows, more S&P 500 firms are expected to implement AI to enhance productivity and enhance profit margins. The strength of the U.S. dollar emerged as a key headwind for multinational corporations, with the trade-weighted dollar appreciating 6% during Q4. This appreciation reduced overseas revenues and pressured overall corporate earnings, especially in the technology sector, where 56% of revenue is generated outside of the United States. Apple highlighted foreign exchange challenges in its latest earnings announcement, projecting a 2.5% revenue decline due to currency headwinds. U.S. dollar strength is also impacting consumer products companies with globally integrated supply chains. For example, Procter & Gamble anticipates a $300 million after-tax hit to earnings for fiscal year 2025 due to foreign exchange fluctuations. Multinational S&P 500 companies must adapt not only to the potential of tariffs on their global manufacturing business but also to the possibility of currency fluctuations that may follow. Deutsche Bank USD Trade Weighted Index Beyond individual sectors and the impact of tariffs, AI, and the dollar, the broader macroeconomic backdrop remains supportive. The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.3% annualized rate in Q4 2024, slower than Q3\u2019s 3.1% but still above the 2% long-term trend. Corporate and investor sentiment is high given the outlook for deregulation, tax cuts, and productivity growth, and the latest U.S. employment report highlights a rebound in private sector labor demand. However, concerns about the fading impact of immigration-driven labor supply growth and declining unemployment persist. In addition, inflation expectations are beginning to rise again due to the stronger-than-expected economy and the likelihood that the costs of any tariffs would be passed through to consumers. Inflation is already a concern. The January Consumer Price Index rose for the fourth consecutive month as the cost of groceries, gas, and used cars increased. CPI rose 3% in January year-over-year, up from 2.9% in December. Higher consumer prices could complicate decision-making for the White House as it balances the risks of rising costs due to tariffs with the potential benefits of increased revenue. Most of the administration\u2019s trade, immigration, deregulation, and tax reforms are still in the development phase. Adding to the uncertainty is how other countries may react or retaliate as these policies are solidified. Until investors receive clarity on these issues, the variability around earnings projections for the balance of 2025 should remain high. In the meantime, investors can take comfort in what they see from Q4 earnings. S&P 500 companies are meeting earnings expectations, DeepSeek is not derailing AI investment, and companies will adapt to tariffs if and when implemented.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"By\u00a0         Bill Chappell                        The FBI says this photograph, taken the day after NFL quarterback Joe Burrow's house was burglarized, shows several suspects in the crime with items that were reported stolen, including Burrow's jewelry bearing his jersey number, 9. The agency believes the theft was the work of a South American crime ring.                                                           FBI \/ Screenshot by NPR                                       hide caption  The recent burglary of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow's mansion is part of a wave of \"crime tourism,\" in which international burglary teams travel across the U.S. to steal from homes in affluent areas, according to the Justice Department.  The burglars often use sophisticated strategies to overcome security measures so they can pilfer jewelry, watches and luxury goods from mansions. The FBI calls them South American Theft Groups; many of the suspects arrested so far (including in Burrow's case) are from Chile. A pattern of tactics used by the teams fits the Ohio burglary of Burrow's home in early December and other crimes \u2014 including recent burglaries targeting professional athletes, FBI spokesman Todd Lindgren told NPR. In recent months, burglars targeted the homes of high-profile players such as the NFL's Travis Kelce and NBA's Luka Doncic.\u00a0 Last week, a federal court unsealed a January indictment charging two men with operating a large jewelry fencing operation in New York City.  The indictment alleged the defendants were \"fences\" for South American burglary crews who roved the U.S. targeting wealthy neighborhoods and provided  \"an essential market for the stolen goods\" between 2020 and 2025. One of the men had been in contact with suspects in the burglary of a high-profile athlete in Ohio last December, a press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York stated.                  Authorities say Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, a citizen of Chile, rented a Volkswagen Atlas in Florida \u2014 and that the car was tracked to Cincinnati and back to Florida after the break-in at Joe Burrow's house. Cabello is seen here in the driver's seat, with another Chilean suspect, Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, in the passenger seat.                                                           FBI \/ Screenshot by NPR                                       hide caption  An FBI special agent who investigated the Burrow burglary said it \"was consistent with burglaries executed by South American Theft Groups (SATG),\" according to an affidavit.  Law enforcement agencies across the country, FBI Special Agent Aaron Bauder wrote, \"have had burglaries that fit the SATG M.O. wherein professional athletes were the victims.\" \"The SATG M.O. for residential burglaries include targeting high-end houses that back up to green spaces, walking trails, golf courses, or other undeveloped land,\" Bauder wrote. \"They then gain access to the residence through a rear window or glass door, on the second floor when possible.\" The thieves focus on jewelry and designer accessories, which are typically sold through illegal fences along the coasts, in states such as New York, California, and Florida, he said. \"The groups usually consist of foreign nationals from South America who either enter the country illegally or overstay on visas to continue committing their crimes,\" Bauder wrote. \"SATG's often travel using rental vehicles and will carry false identifications and documents,\" he said, adding that the groups routinely activate and de-activate cellphones, sometimes in less than a month. In the Burrow case, the suspects allegedly carried bogus ID cards purportedly from Argentina and other countries, and bearing false names, according to the affidavit. The burglaries are part of a wave of crime tourism. The FBI has a nationwide working group devoted to South American Theft Groups; the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation formed a task force to address them last March. The FBI has issued tips for minimizing the chances of being victimized by the crime gangs, including avoiding saying on social media that you're on vacation. The agency has also specifically warned pro sports leagues that athletes could be targeted, according to ABC News, which first reported the development. Much of the focus of the theft rings is on Chile, due in part to its 2014 inclusion in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program that lets foreign citizens visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa. Chile remains the only South American country on the U.S. visa waiver list. In 2023, members of Congress from California wrote to Chile's ambassador to the U.S., saying they had \"strong concerns\" that the Chilean government wasn't doing enough to prevent criminals from traveling to the U.S. In just one year, they said, \"14 Chilean nationals have been charged with burglaries and other related crimes in Orange County after entering the United States under the [visa waiver program].\" Similar concerns have been raised in Michigan, where state lawmakers said that in 2023, \"multiple Chilean nationals who had entered the country under the Visa Waiver Program were arrested for stealing millions of dollars' worth of goods in [Michigan's] Oakland County area.\" In July of 2023, Chile and the U.S. signed an agreement aimed at sharing more information to combat serious crime \u2014 \"one of several steps required for Chile to maintain its status\" in the Visa Waiver Program, according to Chile's foreign affairs ministry. Nearly 350,000 Chileans use the program each year, the ministry said. Despite the focus on Chile, South American Theft Group cases have also been found to have ties to numerous other countries, such as Colombia. And the FBI's Sacramento, Calif., field office says a group with members from Chile, Peru, and Venezuela has been linked to sophisticated robberies targeting at least 29 ATM robberies across at least eight states. Three Chilean men are now facing federal charges related to the burglary at Burrow's house, where thieves took nearly $300,000 worth of jewelry, designer luggage, and other items on the evening of Dec. 9, 2024, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in southern Ohio. At the time, Burrow was in Texas for a game against the Dallas Cowboys. Jordan Francisco Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, 23; and Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, 38, face charges including transporting stolen goods across state lines and falsifying records in a federal investigation, along with state charges. Ohio State Highway Patrol initially arrested the three after a traffic stop in January, along with another man in the vehicle, Alexander Esteban Huaiquil Chavez, who faces state charges. An officer-worn camera recorded the traffic stop, showing one of the men wearing a Bengals knit cap. Items in the back of the truck included a T-shirt from LSU, where Burrow starred in college. Tools that can punch a hole in a window were tucked behind the glove compartment.  The public defender's office in Clark County, Ohio, which is representing the men, declined to comment on the case when reached by NPR.\u00a0 On Tuesday, federal prosecutors in New York City announced the arrests of two men operating a Manhattan pawn shop who are alleged in court documents to have \"regularly served as 'fences' for South American Theft Groups ('SATG') who engaged in crime tourism.\" One of the men, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy, was linked to at least two of the men arrested in Ohio by phone records and video surveillance, according to a court filing by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. The document alleges that Nezhinskiy also had contact with one of the Ohio suspects less than a week before Burrow's house was broken into.  Nezhinskiy and another suspect, Juan Villar, each now face one federal count of conspiracy to receive stolen property and three counts of receipt of stolen property. They're accused of fencing \"countless pieces of stolen merchandise taken from across the United States\" and having ties to \"at least five separate burglary crews\" that have been operating since 2020. Those crews were \"composed largely of foreign nationals,\" prosecutors said. A message to an attorney representing Nezhinskiy was not returned before this story was published. Authorities' searches of Nezhinskiy's storage units found \"large quantities of luxury goods and clothing, including high-end handbags, wine, sports memorabilia, jewelry and art,\" according to court documents. Prosecutors say the units also held power tools commonly used in burglaries and opening safes. They also allege that witnesses said Nezhinskiy and Villar \"coached them to steal items away from New York so it will be easier for the defendants to resell the items and harder for law enforcement to track.\" The documents say Nezhinskiy, a Georgian national, \"has been subject to a final order of removal [from the U.S.] since 2003. However, Nezhinskiy remains in the United States as he cannot be returned to his home country.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Business Insider Edition  If you, like many travelers, are interested in testing the cruising waters, one of your first steps should be determining your ideal cruise line.          Going on a vacation at sea isn't as simple as choosing where and when you want to go. Like hotels, the cruise industry spans budget companies to floating five-star resorts.               Some are great for families, while others don't allow children \u2014 some geared for foodies and others for bachelorette parties.               Choose wisely, or you might not be satisfied with your vacation. If you don't know where to start, use this guide to help you navigate the waters.               Cruises can be an economical vacation option with fares often including accommodations, food, entertainment, and several on-board amenities.               Consider Carnival Cruise Line, Margaritaville at Sea, and MSC Cruises for the best bang for your buck.               Margaritaville at Sea (yes, thatMargaritaville) sells two-night voyages from Palm Beach, Florida, to the Bahamas for as little as $50 per person. Expect bars and restaurants named after hit Jimmy Buffet songs and a straightforward \u2014 albeit arguably dated \u2014 cruise experience.               Or opt for MSC. The European cruise giant is still expanding its US presence. But if you don't mind being a semi-early adopter, you can cash in on its two- to four-night itineraries for less than $300 per person, many from Florida's popular cruise ports.               If you prefer the classics, try Carnival. It has a legacy of rowdy and affordable voyages, the cheapest also for less than $100 per person and day. Expect a diverse crowd, from families with children to college spring breakers and bachelor parties.       Carnival's newer ships won't be its most affordable. However, they will have amenities such as a roller coaster, a ropes course, a water playground, and outdoor games \u2014 perfect for keeping the kids entertained.               If that's the ultimate priority, consider booking one of Carnival, Royal Caribbean International, Norwegian Cruise Line, or Disney Cruise Line's newer ships. There, you'll find enticing amenities such as waterslides, mini-golf courses, and kids' and teens' clubs.       Royal Caribbean is best known for its giant vessels, some accommodating more than 7,000 guests. More space means more activities \u2014 its largest few have a carousel, a surf simulator, decks-tall slides, an ice skating rink, and a zip line.       Norwegian's newer ships are slightly smaller. Yet, they still have standout facilities like a virtual reality arcade, a go-kart course, and outdoor games such as beer-less pong.               And how could we forget Disney? The branding alone is sure to win over the youngest guests. If not, the fireworks show, character meet-and-greets, and venues named after hit Disney movies (\"Zootopia\"-themed candy store, anyone?) might help.               Family-friendly cruises can start at less than $100 per person and day. Expect to pay more for Disney and any newer ships.               For example, Royal Caribbean's latest Utopia of the Seas has three-night itineraries starting at more than $180 per person and night.               Cruise ships aren't all giant, rowdy, and overstimulating. However, if you want a peaceful and all-inclusive vacation onboard a small vessel \u2014 preferably with more wealthy retirees than young children \u2014 be prepared to pay five-star resort prices.               In the luxury cruise world, fares exceeding $500 per person and day are the norm. But with it, you'll get indulgences such as caviar service, butlers, and crew who'll know your name before introducing yourself.               You won't have to look hard for truffle or foie gras-topped dishes, nor will you pay out of pocket for fancy cocktails and pre-dinner wine. Depending on the cruise line, amenities such as WiFi and excursions can be complimentary, too.               Luxury ships are also much smaller than their mammoth mass-market counterparts, allowing them to visit more exclusive destinations. Expect diverse itineraries, from small Pacific islands to European rivers to Antarctica.               As such, these ships often only accommodate a few hundred \u2014 instead of a few thousand \u2014 guests.               Popular options include Silversea, Seabourn, and Regent Seven Seas \u2014 owned by the parent companies of Royal Caribbean, Carnival, and Norwegian, respectively.               For a nostalgic and storied option, try Cunard. For more contemporary ships, consider Crystal, Explora Journeys, Atlas Ocean Voyages, and the Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection.               Look into Viking, Uniworld, or newcomer Riverside Luxury Cruises if you prefer cruising riverways.               If you want a plush vacation without a plush fare, upscale options such as Princess Cruises and Holland America Line could satisfy your luxury itch.               On a premium ship, guests can expect classy cocktail lounges in lieu of waterslides and a relaxed ambiance instead of jittery kids lining up for a zipline.               Take Gen X-friendly Celebrity Cruises, for example. The Royal Caribbean Group-owned brand's newer vessels have stylish interiors, elevated restaurants, and a guest capacity upward of 3,850 \u2014 great for travelers who want a large but not overwhelming ship.               For smaller, boutique-style vessels, try Oceania Cruises. Its largest vessel accommodates less than half the guests of Celebrity's. And unlike its competitor, amenities such as WiFi and premium coffees are free.               The same goes for Oceania's complimentary specialty restaurants \u2014 crucial for a cruise line that prides itself on upscale onboard dining.               For a younger and more upbeat crowd, there's Virgin Voyages.               The kid-free cruise line's fleet has a Miami and Las Vegas resort-like feel, colorful Instagram-friendly decor, and fun dining options. If you're feeling extra frisky, you can even get inked at the onboard tattoo shop.               Starting costs vary per company, from about $100 per person and day for Celebrity and Princess to more than $150 for Virgin and Oceania.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With the often-hot Magnificent Seven trade on the skids less than two months into the year, it may be time to exit stage left before the selling picks up. \"Over the last several years we have maintained the view, that it was prudent for long-only US equity managers to be at least market-weight the Mag 7. Today, our views have evolved to the point where we are changing our mind and believe lowering exposure is prudent,\" Trivariate Research founder and CEO Adam Parker said in a new note Tuesday. The Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed of late. Only one of the big-cap tech components \u2014 Meta \u2014 has posted double-digit gains out of the box, more in line with the sector's usual strong performance. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.2%, slightly ahead of the 3.5% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer, off by 17% this year. Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Mag Seven). Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons. For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker. \"There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today\u2019s massive investments,\" says Parker. Valuation on Mag Seven stocks \u2014 despite their sell-off \u2014 also remains a concern for Parker. Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Mag Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average. Warns Parker, \"The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern.\" Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia? And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors. \"We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7. However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"AI-powered search struggles to gain a stronger foothold against Google.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Google has dominated search for years, generating the vast majority of organic traffic worldwide - but while its grip remains firm, new data suggests that cracks are beginning to form. A new Seranking report crowning 2024's top search engine claims Google saw a 0.91% decrease in its global market share - however, it still drives nearly 95% of all organic search traffic, and no other platform comes close. Bing, the second-largest search engine, also saw a 0.17% increase, bringing its total share to just 3.51% while DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and other search tools remain below 1%. The report further reveals AI-driven platforms such as ChatGPT and Perplexity sparked interest in 2024, particularly in the latter half of the year. ChatGPT\u2019s referral traffic rose from negligible levels to 0.09% by December, while Perplexity experienced steady but slower growth, reaching 0.02%. These numbers suggest AI-driven search platforms are gaining ground, but at nowhere near the scale of Google. Even if AI search adoption accelerates, it would take years before it could significantly challenge the traditional model. Microsoft's Bing has also integrated AI tools into its search experience, hoping to draw users away from Google. However, its incremental growth shows that AI alone is not enough to disrupt established habits. While other brands are integrating AI to fight against Google, the tech giant is not folding its arms. It has rolled out AI-driven features like AI Overviews and Gemini 2.0, which have helped it maintain its edge. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! These advancements, coupled with its vast infrastructure and user trust, ensure that Google remains the go-to search engine for the foreseeable future. Although AI-generated responses provide a new way to access information, they do not fully replace traditional search. For now, Google remains unshaken at 24 times the size of its nearest rival.

TVs continue to get thinner and lighter, and just when you think a chassis can\u2019t get more impressive, brands like Hisense introduce a model like the S7 Series CanvasTV. Designed to look like a piece of fine art hanging from your living room wall or sitting atop a TV stand, this signature Hisense QLED is a major competitor to Samsung\u2019s The Frame lineup of QLED TVs and TCL\u2019s NXTFrame QLED TVs. And right now, when you purchase the Hisense 65-inch Class S7 Series CanvasTV through Amazon or Best Buy, you\u2019ll only pay $900. At full price, the 65-inch CanvasTV sells for $1,300. It\u2019s one of the best TV deals of the week, so don\u2019t miss out!   The primary calling card of TVs like the Hisense CanvasTV is the boutique shell. At first glance, this 4K QLED may look like any other LED on the market, but when you\u2019re done watching a movie and power down, the Hisense can display digitized artwork. Using Hisense\u2019s Art Mode, you\u2019ll be able to choose from a range of single images or set up a slideshow. You can even connect a USB drive to showcase your own photos or upload them via Hisense\u2019s Art Mode app. Features like the hi-matte display go a long way in protecting the CanvasTV from glare and providing extra texture and depth when viewing artwork. The TV comes with an Ultra-Slim Wall Mount, too, so you\u2019ll be able to mount it flush to the wall as you would a new museum exhibit. When it comes time to watch movies or play video games, the onboard 2.0.2 speakers do a nice job of filling small to medium-sized rooms with sound.

TVs don\u2019t last as long as they used to, which is why it\u2019s more important than ever to stick with a brand that\u2019s going to treat you well.

Kimberlee Orth Name: Kimberlee Orth Firm: Ameriprise Financial Services Location: Wilmington, DE Team Custodied Assets: $940 million Background: Kimberlee Orth grew up in New Jersey and studied business at the University of Delaware. She first started her career working in the budgeting department at a hospital in Philadelphia before deciding to take the CFP program and become an advisor. She joined Ameriprise 38 years ago and has been at the firm since. Orth began as a sole practitioner, but today she works with her husband and three of her four children and has a team of 21 staffers in total and 1,200 clients. Investment Approach: Like other advisors, Orth starts with a financial plan and discusses goals, liquidity needs and time frame with her clients. \u201cWe use investment strategies and vehicles that are proven,\u201d says Orth. \u201cThe basics are boring sometimes, but they do work.\u201d On the equities side, that usually means a mix of separately managed accounts, ETFs, stocks and sometimes mutual funds. In fixed income, Orth says her team is still using certificates of deposit accounts for clients since the rates are still good. \u201cWe use bonds in the portfolio judiciously: For some clients, a structured annuity could make sense, as it provides some downside buffer with upside potential,\u201d she adds. The good news is that you\u2019re getting paid on cash: There is still a reasonable rate of return.\u201d A retirement planning product, structured annuities typically provide a series of tax-free income payments over a certain period of time, thereby shielding investors from market downturns. Orth has also jumped on to the alternatives bandwagon investing client assets in real estate, private equity and private credit. \u201cBucketing assets and making sure you have enough liquidity is important in order to protect yourself on the downside,\u201d says Orth. Investment Outlook: \u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the stock market and always prepared for volatility,\u201d says Orth. \u201cEspecially for clients that are taking a stream of income in retirement, we have to prepare very carefully.\u201d Markets may get a boost from President Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda, but Orth is telling her clients to expect more volatility and reminding them to separate emotions from investment decisions. Best Advice: \u201cYou can\u2019t control the market but what you can control is your reaction to the market,\u201d says Orth. \u201cWhen you have a plan with savings in place to achieve your goals, you don\u2019t have to be at the mercy of markets.\u201d  Forbes ","label":0}

Studiocanal is also planning its next moves in the\u00a0Paddington\u00a0franchise, which will include another feature film as well as a TV series and stage show.\u00a0     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tIt will continue to invest heavily in development and production finance \u2013 it deploys \u20ac200M ($206M) per year in film and television productions \u2013 with upcoming feature titles including WWII title\u00a0Pressure, starring Andrew Scott and Brendan Fraser, Glen Powell revenge thriller\u00a0Huntington\u00a0and James McAvoy starrer\u00a0Control. On the TV side, it\u2019s drawing on its huge library of IP to reboot projects such as\u00a0The Wicker Man\u00a0and\u00a0The Avengers. This week, Studiocanal will launch sales at EFM on a reboot of slasher\u00a0Silent Night, Deadly Night\u00a0from its new genre label Sixth Dimension.\u00a0  IPO & Windowing  \t\u201cWe saw this as a great opportunity,\u201d Studiocanal CEO and Canal+ Deputy CEO Anna Marsh tells Deadline in a rare interview at the company\u2019s Paris headquarters. \u201cThe group is in a true development phase and the London Stock Exchange listing will potentially enable us to use stock as currency to expand as well as opening up opportunities that we simply didn\u2019t have before.\u201d\u00a0  \t           \tStudiocanal currently operates in France, the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Australia and New Zealand. It invests in around 80 releases per year, of which 30 are self-produced. It holds stakes in 19 production companies, including wholly owning British\u00a0TV indie Red, with minority stakes in Andrew Rona and Alex Heineman\u2019s The Picture Company, Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s SunnyMarch, UK outfit Urban Myth Films and Spain\u2019s Bamb\u00fa Productions. It also has offices in L.A., New York and Beijing.  \tThe company has worked with all the major streamers across the years, in different capacities. In 2021, it co-produced an adaptation of Matt Haig\u2019s book\u00a0A Boy Called Christmas\u00a0with Netflix while a few years later, Studiocanal fully financed The Picture Company production\u00a0Role Play\u00a0with Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo, which Amazon Prime Video took U.S. rights and many offshore territories.\u00a0  \tThrough its Spanish production company Bamb\u00fa, it produced\u00a0Now and Then, the first Spanish-language TV series for Apple+ while UK outfit Red is behind many of Harlan Coben\u2019s TV series on Netflix such as\u00a0Fool Me Once\u00a0and\u00a0The Woods. Hulu took U.S. rights to\u00a0Paris Has Fallen, the Studiocanal series based on Gerard Butler\u2019s\u00a0Has Fallen\u00a0film franchise.\u00a0In France, Netflix had the second window for its local hit\u00a0Beating Hearts\u00a0after Canal+\u2019s pay-TV window.\u00a0  \t\u201cEvery single one of these platforms have their editorial or creative idiosyncrasies and when we put a film or TV series together, we know which door we should knock on in terms of the story we\u2019re trying to tell,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cCanal+ is definitely complimentary. Some of the movies we can make with a platform but also release in our territories directly where other times we are quite experimental.\u00a0  \t\u201cNothing precludes us, for example, of releasing a movie for Netflix in theaters and having it on Netflix afterwards or selling to a free TV channel. You just have to be open-minded, and I think these days platforms understand that partnerships are really important, and that production is a slow and expensive process. Working with partners, you can be more agile, quicker and deploy less capital. But because we\u2019re a streamer ourselves, we certainly don\u2019t close the doors to any of those partners.\u201d\u00a0  \tFrench media chronology remains a hot button topic as global streamers have shaken up the landscape since their entry into the country. A few weeks ago, Disney+ signed a landmark deal in France, committing it to investment obligations in French and European works for a shorter release window of nine months after theatrical release (against a current window of 17 months). Canal+ CEO Maxime Saada has been vocal about what this will mean for the French landscape, and said Canal+ will look to trim its windows across both its pay-TV offering and streaming services.\u00a0  \t\u201cGranting Disney the broadcast of films nine months after their release for \u20ac35 million per year, where Canal+ now pays \u20ac220 million for a six-month broadcast, mechanically degrades the value of cinema,\u201d said Saada in an op-ed in\u00a0Le Monde\u00a0last week.\u00a0  \t\u201cSelling access to the first operating windows thus jeopardizes the first pillar of the model, the financing of cinema,\u201d he continued. \u201cCanal+, its main financier, will therefore be forced to adapt and reduce its investments. This new situation also risks making a crucial financing window disappear by leading to the merger of two operating windows, that of pay television and that of platforms, which are now separate.\u201d\u00a0  \t           Growth in Africa and beyond  \tWhile the pan-European giant doesn\u2019t have direct distribution in the U.S., Marsh indicated that the company is not ruling it out. \u201cThe U.S. is a really important territory, particularly when it comes to the theatrical market, and it\u2019s certainly one that we\u2019re keeping an eye on,\u201d she says. The IPO will give the company more wind in its sails and \u201cgrowth will certainly be organic and through external opportunities.\u201d\u00a0  \tMore immediately, Marsh says the group is looking to expand in Africa with a focus on English-speaking countries. Canal+, which has had a strong presence in French-speaking Africa for decades, currently owns a 45.2% stake in the continent\u2019s leading platform MultiChoice.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere are ongoing discussions to increase our ownership in that company,\u201d she says.\u00a0  \tPresently, Canal+ Group\u2019s pay-TV platform operates in 52 countries, with more than 26.4 million subscribers, of which two-thirds are from outside of France. Adding MultiChoice\u2019s nearly 16 million (mostly English-speaking) subscribers, would mean the multi-billion acquisition would place the French company among the top five biggest entertainment companies in the world and the biggest outside of the U.S.  \t\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible opportunity, not only for the Canal+, but also for Studiocanal when it comes to our growth and production strategy,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cJust being able to tap into that incredible English-speaking subscriber base really opens things up.\u201d\u00a0  \tShe stresses that \u201cinvesting in local content is really important\u201d to the group, noting that the move will allow them to tap into South Africa\u2019s local industry. Canal+ and MultiChoice co-produced TV series\u00a0Spinners, which Studiocanal distributed around the world. The company also recently shot John Patton Ford\u2019s revenge thriller\u00a0Huntington, starring Glen Powell, Ed Harris and Margaret Qualley, on location in South Africa, using local crew and tapping into the nation\u2019s 25% plus tax incentive.\u00a0  \tThere are plans to make \u201cmany more projects\u201d in the country, says Marsh, and the company is already in development on \u201cone massive South African story\u201d which it is making as a feature film and will announce soon.\u00a0  \tCanal+ has also been aggressively investing in Southeast Asian streamer Viu, where it owns a 36.8% stake, and also has a 29.3% stake in Swedish streamer Viaplay.\u00a0  \tThere are also plans to move more into the elevated genre space. Last year, the company tapped Jed Benedict to head up new in-house genre label Sixth Dimension. Reporting to Studiocanal EVP of Global Production Ron Halpern, Benedict will look to identify high concept horror, thriller and science fiction films that the group can develop, produce, acquire and distribute. The label recently announced its first title, a reboot of 1984 slasher\u00a0Silent Night, Deadly Night, which the company will distribute in its own territories and shop to buyers at EFM.\u00a0  \tIn addition to Benedict, Studiocanal made a number of key hires in 2024, including M-K Kennedy as Executive Managing Director for Worldwide TV Series and Isabelle Pain as Head of Global Acquisitions and Analytics. Anne Ch\u00e9rel was promoted to Chief Commercial Officer while Chlo\u00e9 Marquet was promoted to Head of International Sales for Films and TV series and Fran\u00e7oise Guyonnet was upped to CEO of Studiocanal Kids and Family  \t           Banner year  \tStudiocanal\u2019s 2024 bumper year was buoyed by a raft of its own productions: Paddington in Peru has taken $104M globally and has yet to open in major markets such as the U.S., Germany, France and South Korea; Andrew\u00a0Garfield and Florence Pugh starrer\u00a0We Live In Time\u00a0is closing in on $65M; Amy Winehouse biopic\u00a0Back to Black\u00a0earned $15M in the UK; Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley starrer\u00a0Wicked Little Letters\u00a0took $12M in the UK; while French production\u00a0Beating Hearts\u00a0took a huge $30M at the local box office, marking the company\u2019s highest-grossing film in France to date. Its global box office tally of nearly $300M in 2024 is four times higher than compared to 2021 ($75M) and nearly double of 2023\u2019s takings ($155M).\u00a0  Paddington\u00a0is a prime example of how the group can exploit IP. Studiocanal fully-financed the $90M third instalment of the franchise, which marked the highest opening of the franchise in the UK when it was released in November.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere will be a fourth film,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the next movies and we\u2019re working on a new TV series as well as the stage show musical with Sonia Friedman and Eliza Lumley.\u201d  \tInvesting in development is paramount to the company, with Studiocanal veteran Halpern playing a key role in nurturing projects from script to screen.\u00a0  \t\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got an excellent script that attracts excellent cast, then you\u2019re going to find partners quicker and have a higher chance of getting the movie made,\u201d she says, highlighting\u00a0We Live in Time\u00a0as a prime example. \u201cAndrew Garfield and Florence Pugh agreed to make this movie quite quickly because of Nick Payne\u2019s fantastic script.\u201d\u00a0  \tWith its major productions, U.S. partners are key. It partnered with Focus for Amy Winehouse biopic\u00a0Back to Black,\u00a0Sony for\u00a0Paddington in Peru\u00a0and A24 for\u00a0We Live in Time.\u00a0\u201cWe definitely try to find a U.S. partner before the cameras roll because it helps us at the final stages of development to nail our story and make sure we can resonate with an American audience,\u201d she says. \u201cOften we come to a U.S. partner when it\u2019s fully packaged, but sometimes we can go and cast the final pieces together and then what\u2019s really important is the dating.\u201d\u00a0  \tShe continues: \u201cMore and more we\u2019re seeing that you really need to be creating an event that is global and worldwide, rather than a stop and start where Europe may release a movie, and you have to wait a long time before it comes out in the U.S.\u201d  International rise  \tMarsh has been with Studiocanal since 2008 and has earned a reputation for being one of the savviest European execs in the business. A New Zealand native, she moved to France after university where she attended the prestigious HEC Paris Business School, whose notable alumni include Kering CEO Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault and former French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. \u201cMy dream was to work in the culture business in Paris, because I had such an admiration for the French passion for culture and cinema,\u201d says Marsh.\u00a0  \tShe started her career at French TV production outfit Tele Images before moving to TF1 International where she worked across\u00a0La Vie En Rose, which saw Marion Cotillard earn a Best Actress Oscar for her turn as iconic French singer Edith Piaf.\u00a0\u00a0  \t\u201cThat was a real opportunity to understand how things work, the ins and outs of the business and the fact that non-English movies can travel and have potential to resonate worldwide on the big screen,\u201d she says.\u00a0  \t           \tBut for Marsh, the end goal was to work at Canal+. At the time, Canal+\u2019s Studiocanal banner was ramping up is overseas acquisitions, buying UK distributor Optimum Releasing in 2006 followed by German production-distribution banner Kinowelt.\u00a0  \t\u201cIt seemed to be the most globally facing company, even back then, amongst the all the French studios,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could just feel this real pull towards the international globalization of Studiocanal, which fitted my career perfectly at the time.\u201d\u00a0  \tShe joined Studiocanal as VP of International Sales to Head and quickly rose up the ranks to International Sales and Head of International Distribution Strategy, working across titles such as Atom Egoyan\u2019s\u00a0Chloe, the first international production fully financed by Studiocanal, as well as\u00a0Paddington\u00a0and Liam Neeson starrer\u00a0Non-Stop.\u00a0  \t\u201cIt was an incredible opportunity to work on the sales side but also understand the ins and outs of distribution, picking the right dates, coming up with a media plan and deploying P&A dollars, working with our third-party partners in conjunction with the Studiocanal territories to establish a global distribution strategy,\u201d she says.\u00a0  \tMarsh credits Saada as being a big supporter as she climbed the ranks at Studiocanal from EVP of International Distribution to MD of Studiocanal UK and then CEO of Studiocanal in December 2019. Her tenure across different parts at the organization has, she says, \u201creally enabled me to identify the challenges and support the teams to achieve their goals.\u201d  Back catalog  \tStudiocanal sits on one of the biggest and most diverse film libraries in the world, with 9,400 titles in the catalog, ranging from classics such as Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Breathless, Carole Reed\u2019s The Third Man and Humphrey Bogard and Katharine Hepburn starrer The African Queen to franchises such as The Avengers, Rambo and Bridget Jones.  \tBeing able to tap into this wealth of IP and find stories that can be adapted for modern audiences is a key part of the gameplan moving forward. A remake of library title\u00a0Escape From New York\u00a0is still in the works with 20thCentury Studios and The Picture Company, with Studiocanal retaining distribution rights in several territories.\u00a0  Huntington, which is being produced with Graham Broadbent and Pete Czernin\u2019s Blueprint Pictures (a frequent collaborator with Studiocanal) with A24 releasing in the U.S., is an adaptation of Robert Hamer\u2019s British crime black comedy\u00a0Kind Hearts and Coronets, which sits within the Studiocanal catalog.\u00a0  \tLikewise, Robin Hardy\u2019s horror classic\u00a0The Wicker Man, which is also owned by the group, is being made into a TV series with Urban Myth Films and Andy Serkis and Jonathan Cavendish\u2019s The Imaginarium. There\u2019s also a reboot of iconic 1960s television series\u00a0The Avengers\u00a0in the works.  \t\u201cWe go above and beyond to restore our movies, re-release them and take them to a younger audience,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cWe\u2019re always thinking about remakes or reboots or spinoffs and how we can sell movies. There are so many clients around the world from the platforms to free-TV channels or pay-TV platforms to the distributors themselves, so we make sure no stone is left unturned, and we invest a lot into catalog sales teams so that they have a real depth of knowledge of every single market and what every client is wanting.\u201d\u00a0  \tFor Marsh and the group, the ambition is to continue to support talent and make movies that work for subscribers in France and the Canal+ Group across Europe, Africa and beyond.\u00a0  \t           \t\u201cWe\u2019re looking to grow with the group and make sure we are working together in the best possible way, optimizing synergies that can create event cinema and add value to the group,\u201d she says. \u201cIt used to feel like Studiocanal was its own island in the Canal+ group. But now we\u2019re definitely part of the same continent and we\u2019re working hand in hand to build the company, to tell better stories and to identify the best talent and help each other out when needed.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Alex Kreger, UX Strategist & Founder of the financial UX design agency UXDA, designs leading banking and fintech products in 37 countries.   The banking industry is undergoing an unprecedented transformation as the digital revolution reshapes how financial services are delivered and consumed. Traditional banking models, once dominated by physical branches and face-to-face interactions, are being upended by the rise of digital technologies. This shift has given birth to digital brands in banking, heralding a new era where financial brands must evolve to meet the changing expectations of tech-savvy customers. As the founder of UXDA, a fintech user experience design agency, I want to explore the emergence of digital brands in banking, the factors driving this change, and its implications for the future of financial services. Today's consumers live in a digital-first world. Smartphones, tablets and laptops are integral to daily life, influencing how people communicate, shop and manage their finances. According to a survey by the American Bankers Association, 71% of bank customers prefer to use mobile or online banking, while only 14% use branches and call the bank. The convenience of digital platforms has set new standards for accessibility and user experience. Modern consumers demand: \u2022 Convenience: Access to banking services anytime, anywhere. \u2022 Speed: Real-time transactions and instant account management. \u2022 Personalization: Customized products and services tailored to individual needs. \u2022 Transparency: Clear information about fees, rates and terms. \u2022 User-Friendly Interfaces: Intuitive digital products that simplify complex financial tasks. I've seen traditional banks, with their legacy systems and bureaucratic processes, often struggle to meet these demands. This gap has paved the way for digital brands that prioritize customer-centricity and technological innovation. The financial sector is highly competitive, with traditional banks, fintech startups and tech giants vying for market share. Companies that invest in their digital brand can differentiate themselves by offering unique value propositions and superior customer experiences. Digital branding enables financial institutions to highlight their innovations. Fintech startups and challenger banks have capitalized on this opportunity by offering digital-first banking solutions. Companies like Nubank, Revolut, Wise, Plaid, Stripe and Chime have built brands entirely around digital experiences, attracting millions of users with their sleek interface, low fees and innovative features. Digital brands in banking remove expensive physical branches to offer more accessible, cost-efficient services, leverage data analytics and AI for personalized insights and embrace open banking to enable collaborative innovation. They spotlight social and environmental commitments to achieve meaningful impact while simplifying cross-border transactions at competitive rates. Real-time payment systems allow instant transfers and improve overall satisfaction. Through inclusive services, they can extend financial access to underbanked communities. Forming partnerships with tech providers and non-financial brands helps create holistic and embedded solutions. By prioritizing a seamless customer journey, they are able to deliver a convenient, rewarding experience. Finally, crypto-friendly services enable digital brands to expand possibilities in emerging markets by integrating digital assets, blockchain solutions and next-gen investment opportunities. Today, establishing trust goes far beyond guaranteeing secure transactions. It requires banks and fintechs to be transparent, consistent and hyper-focused on delivering genuine value through digital experiences. In the digital realm, customers can\u2019t rely on face-to-face reassurance; instead, they look to the brand\u2019s digital footprint: user reviews, network presence, app design, digital experience and every online interaction that conveys credibility and authenticity. Companies looking to break through in this age of digital banking and remain competitive should prioritize the following best practices: \u2022 Always be available. Digital brands must be open to solving problems and interacting through a digital channel that is convenient for the user. You can use this approach to continuously improve your products. \u2022 Focus on customer centricity. Digital banking leaders need to understand that users expect an intuitive experience and real-time updates. Therefore, they should provide seamless interfaces and thoughtful notifications, reminding everyone that convenience really is above all else. \u2022 Innovate with purpose. To be a competitor in digital banking, leaders should focus on simplifying processes like the sign-up process, eliminating pitfalls, providing transparency and integrating smart money management tools. \u2022 Focus on authentic engagement. Avoid relying solely on \u201ctoken engagement\u201d like advertising and technical messages. Encourage open conversations and meaningful topics on your platform that evoke an emotional response and build an active brand community that leads to long-term loyalty. \u2022 Create a distinctive identity. A dated corporate look and a one-size-fits-all digital service might have worked 10 years ago, but modern consumers crave more. To stay competitive, digital-first banking brands must invest in tailor-made product design and vibrant brand authenticity\u2014showing incumbents that a consistent digital identity is more than window dressing; it\u2019s a business imperative. The dawn of digital brands in banking signifies a transformative period where customer expectations, technological innovation and competitive pressures converge. Financial brands that successfully navigate this landscape will be those that embrace digital service not merely as a marketing strategy but as a fundamental reimagining of their business models and brand propositions. In the future, digital brands in banking will hinge on AI-driven personalization\u2014delivering customized advice and proactive insights\u2014while banks transform into multi-service platforms that embed finance within non-financial ecosystems and embrace open banking collaborations. Alongside these technological advancements, ethical and sustainable practices will gain greater emphasis through social responsibility and eco-friendly financial products. As cyber threats escalate, financial institutions will fortify defenses with AI-driven security protocols and enhanced privacy controls, ensuring users can both trust and shape how their data is used in this increasingly interconnected environment. The future of finance belongs to those who recognize that the digital revolution is not just about adopting new technologies but about redefining what it means to be a financial brand in the digital century.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Aldi has struck a new deal to sell a chunk of the Winn-Dixie stores it purchased last year as part of its expansion plan back to its parent company, Southeastern Grocers Inc. (SEG). Almost 400 Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket locations across the South were part of Aldi\u2019s acquisition of Southeastern Grocers last March. Around 300 of the stores Aldi bought are located in Florida, but their fate is still unknown. At the time of publication, there were at least five former Winn-Dixie stores in Florida that have or plan to reopen as Aldi locations, including one in Pensacola. Aldi still plans to convert about 220 former Winn-Dixie and Harvey's Supermarket locations to Aldi grocery stores by 2027, but neither company has shed any light on the long-term plans for 170 stores that will remain as SEG locations. \"Approximately 170 stores will be remaining as SEG locations, and we will be informing our associates first of those decisions as they are finalized, and as market conditions permit,\" an SEG spokesperson told the News Journal in an email. \"We will share this information with each community once our associates have been appropriately informed.\" Pensacola's lone Winn-Dixie location confirmed to be undergoing a conversion is on Nine Mile Road and will be reopening as Aldi in the near future. A Southeastern Grocers spokesperson couldn't confirm to the News Journal whether other Pensacola-area stores would remain under the Winn-Dixie banner or be converted into an Aldi. Shopping at Aldi:Some Florida Winn-Dixie stores are converting to Aldi stores. 10 ways they'll be different Almost 400 Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket locations across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi were a part of Aldi\u2019s acquisition of Southeastern Grocers last March and nearly 300 of those stores are located in Florida where the Winn-Dixie chain is based. Anthony Hucker led a group of consortium investors, including C&S Wholesale Grocers, to buy back Southeastern Grocers from Aldi. He will serve as the new company\u2019s chair, CEO and president. Aldi sold the grocery and liquor store operations under the Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket banners back to Southeastern Grocers as part of the deal, whose financial terms haven\u2019t been publicly disclosed yet. The deal will cause a minor shakeup in Aldi\u2019s announced five-year, $9 billion national expansion plan, but Aldi's and Southeastern Grocers\u2019 leadership are working together to ensure a smooth transition. \"Since announcing the acquisition of Southeastern Grocers in March, ALDI has made significant progress toward our goal to bring more stores to communities across the Southeast as part of our five-year national growth strategy,\" an Aldi spokesperson said in an email to the News Journal. \"From the beginning, we shared that we intended for a meaningful number of Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarkets to continue to operate, and we\u2019re delivering on that promise while also supporting ALDI growth.\" Southeastern Grocers will continue to operate the stores identified for Aldi\u2019s conversions until they\u2019re closed for renovations. A single Winn-Dixie location in the Pensacola area was confirmed for conversion into an Aldi after the acquisition of Southeastern Grocers last March. That Winn-Dixie store is located at 312 E. Nine Mile Road and it\u2019ll reopen soon as an Aldi. Four more stores across Florida have reopened, or will reopen soon, as Aldi locations. Winn-Dixie has nine other stores across Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, excluding the Nine Mile Road location. Neither Southeastern Grocers nor Aldi have confirmed what additional stores, if any, in our area could be converted. Online sleuths have identified\u00a0nearly 50 Winn-Dixie Florida locations\u00a0that were likely to become Aldis, but the company has not released its own list of how many conversions are still planned across the state.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip. The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade. Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era? I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers. Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people. Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him? Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons. Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days. Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years. He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs. DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals? JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards. Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries. DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this? JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat. So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies. We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system. We need a new system. MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history. Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences. One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support. Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners. DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices. MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually. Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices. One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children. DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims? JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products. But I want to go back to consumer prices. People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases. What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree. The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy. DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s? MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity. It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them. Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago. JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith. DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality? MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers. If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with? If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war. So the spillover effects could be very, very negative. DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth? JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains. The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world. So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.

Just like with clocks, most people didn\u2019t really need to have calendars on their walls or their desks since you can just look at your phone or device to check what day it was. But now we have a sort of resurgence of analog things that can exist along with their digital calendars. Suddenly we started seeing a demand for wall and desk calendars again, and preferably something that can be reused since we also want to be kinder to Mother Earth. Designer: Pharhaat       This metal calendar is one such example of a calendar that can be used over and over again or a perpetual calendar as it\u2019s called. Its main material is a metal plate that can be bent and folded\/unfolded into a tent-like calendar that you can place on your desk or on your shelf or wherever you want to place it to see what date it is easily. It is small enough at just 12 x 19 centimeters that you can carry it around easily or transfer it to where you need it. The days of the week and months of the year are engraved on the plate and it comes with rings and metal balls to place on the calendar.        The good news is that you will be the one to adjust to the day, date, and month. The bad news is that you will be the one to adjust to the day, date, and month. So you will have to remind yourself to adjust it to the right day, date, and month that are engraved on the metal plate. On the English version (there is a Persian version as well as the calendar is bilingual) , the days of the week are listed on the left side while the numbers are on the upper part with the months on the bottom part. Just move the rings and metal balls around to their respective spaces.    It also comes with a full year calendar on card stock that you can place at the back as there\u2019s a slot to place it or any card you may want to put there. So yes, you can just look at the full calendar of course (although the print is pretty tiny) but the metal calendar is much more aesthetic. And the fact that you have the move the ring and ball around can be a ritual that you can follow every day.    Travelers know the frustration: your bag is neatly packed with essentials, but then\u2014there it is\u2014a bulky, awkward toothbrush taking up precious space.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Find out how the sluggish job market is even tougher for Gen Z, who struggle with assessing their skills and being ghosted by prospective employers. Landing a new job in 2025 may be tough 2025 is going to be a stellar year for career prospects and job security\u2014at least, according to Gen Z. New data from iCIMS found that 87% of Gen Z feel confident about landing a new job this year. Another 45% believe that the economic outlook will affect their job security positively. Similarly, LinkedIn found that 58% of all employees (and 69% of Gen Z workers) plan to look for a new job this year. Twenty-seven percent of Gen Z workers expect to receive a raise or promotion at their company within the next 12 months. Over a third of Gen Z respondents haven\u2019t been affected by layoffs or budget cuts, which may be contributing to their rose-tinted outlook. But those who are actively searching for a new role are discovering that it\u2019s not as easy as it might look. LinkedIn\u2019s latest research indicates that the job market is still sluggish, with one in five workers who were job hunting in 2024 still looking for new opportunities. Despite predictions that the market will revive soon, the job search won\u2019t get much easier. Probably due to applicants leveraging AI in their job search process, the number of applicants per open job on LinkedIn has jumped from around 1.5 in 2022 to 2.5 as of fall 2024 in the U.S. All of this adds up to a rude awakening for Gen Z workers, who have already faced significant headwinds in launching their careers amid the pandemic and its aftermath. While workers from all generations are grappling with the slow job market, Gen Z\u2019s relative newness to the process may be making their experience more difficult. Today, this generation is trying to answer four big questions in their quest for the right job: With these obstacles, it\u2019s little wonder that even Gen Z\u2019s optimism may be faltering. Still, 51% say they\u2019re open to a role in a new industry or area, and 25% plan to learn new skills this year to open up additional opportunities. Is AI actually creating more work than it is alleviating? Hirers may be tempted to think so, as many are finding the hiring process increasingly challenging. One-fifth of HR professionals (21%) are spending between 3\u20135 hours a day sifting through applications. Another 70% say that less than half the applications they receive even meet all the criteria. AI may make it easy to apply to massive numbers of jobs, but if it\u2019s not a good fit, it\u2019s a waste of time on both sides of the hiring experience. That\u2019s where LinkedIn\u2019s new job match feature can help. Job match lets job seekers see their match level for a job description in seconds, as well as detailed insights into which qualifications they meet and which ones they might be missing. Job match, which is available to all LinkedIn members, shows personalized match information available for every job on the platform. When job seekers can see how their strengths line up with a potential role, they can focus on applying for the best positions for their skill sets\u2014with any luck, freeing hirers from the glut of irrelevant applications that are slowing down the process for everyone. An additional challenge for Gen Z, not touched on in the iCMS or LinkedIn data, is the growing reluctance of some employers to hire any Gen Z workers at all. This dynamic\u2014fueled by legitimate concerns about Gen Z\u2019s lack of workplace etiquette, poor job preparation in college and often weak human\/professional skills\u2014will only make their job search harder, even if they\u2019re doing all the right things. In fact, recent research even found that some employers\u2019 aversion to hiring Gen Z goes so deep that they would rather bring in a freelancer (45%), recruit a retired former employee (45%), have a robot\/AI do the job (37%) or even leave the position unfilled (30%). It\u2019s evident that many Gen Z workers have a lot to learn about thriving at work\u2014but I have no doubt they will figure it out. Their thirst for learning and development is second to none, and they make full use of online platforms to quench it. Of course, experience is the best teacher\u2014and this generation will get that in spades this year as they navigate the challenges of job hunting in 2025. I wish them all the best in their journey.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"The job market is unpredictable, but your career doesn\u2019t need to be determined by the fate of the ... [+] economy In January, job growth was much slower than expected. Economists predicted 170,000 new jobs added to the U.S. labor market to kick off 2025, but the reality was 27,000 shy of that figure. Only 143,000 vacancies were posted last month for non-farm payrolls (jobs that do not include farm workers, military personnel, private household employees, or non-profit workers but are mainly private sector and government jobs). Should you be worried? If you depend solely on landing a job as your primary career goal and source of income, you should be. You\u2019ll likely be sorely disappointed if you focus your job search on traditional jobs only, as the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data keeps shifting monthly, sometimes according to expectations and other times against economists\u2019 projections. Depending on the outcomes of fortune and employers' decisions is certainly not a way to live your life. A better way to approach your job search is to proactively find ways to future-proof your career instead of waiting for an employer to hand you an opportunity. This allows you to be in more control of your finances, the achievement of your career goals, and your employment status--virtually unaffected by whether hiring slows down or increases. Note that non-farm roles (excluding self-employed professionals) are experiencing this impact. Meanwhile, the freelance job market is booming, with more than 50% of the U.S. workforce (approximately 86.5 million) projected to be constituted of freelance workers, according to Statista. Recent developments in technology and AI have impacted this growth, making it even more accessible and easier than ever to make money and start freelancing online. But where do you begin? The very first step you need to take to start freelancing and making money online as you build up your career is to understand and leverage your strengths. This is because it will be much easier to build a successful business and be financially independent if you use the brain capital and intellectual resources you already have instead of starting from scratch and learning something new. You\u2019ll be much more confident and gain results faster, and it will be a quicker time-to-market. Most people don\u2019t realize that the skills and strengths they display regularly at work in their primary job are of extreme value and can be applied elsewhere, either directly or indirectly, to fuel their personal career and business growth. Once you\u2019ve identified your strengths, brainstorm a list of lucrative business ideas using ChatGPT to help you. Then, figure out which one(s) align most with what you\u2019re passionate about. If you find several ideas that resonate, don\u2019t start them all at once. This is a surefire way to spread yourself thin and get overwhelmed. Instead, concentrate on building one idea at a time, and as your freelance business grows, you\u2019ll be able to scale, delegate, and automate some of your work so that you can start working on the other ideas. When starting as a freelancer, it\u2019s critical to your growth and success to say yes to as many opportunities as possible. Even when you define your niche, you will get clients asking you to help them with all sorts of requests, some of which may fall outside your niche. Be willing to take them on, at least at the beginning, because these are the pivotal experiences that help you understand your target audience and market and enable you to shift gears if necessary. These are the projects that build up your portfolio. As Richard Branson is often quoted to say, \u201cIf somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes \u2013 then learn how to do it later!\u201d And especially if you\u2019re currently unemployed and waiting on a job offer, saying yes to the opportunities that come your way and taking a dare on yourself will help you ride out the waiting period and open doors for more significant possibilities. Last but not least, know your market inside out. Too many freelancers and would-be side hustlers make the fatal mistake of going off on an idea and investing their resources based on guesswork. This leads to disaster and can be disheartening, especially if you\u2019ve been out of work for several months or experienced a layoff recently. Instead, take time to know who you\u2019re providing your services to. Learn about their pain points. Research what platforms they frequently use (some freelance businesses thrive better on LinkedIn and YouTube, while others are more suited to Instagram, TikTok, or X--formerly Twitter). The most successful creators, influencers, and freelancers are the ones who know exactly who their audience is and what their audience needs. This research will pay dividends, helping you improve your online visibility and presence strategically in the right places and maximize your earnings. So, should you be worried about the job market? The fastest way to make money online is to say yes and learn on the go You\u2019re looking at the wrong thing. Focus on what\u2019s in your hands, not on what\u2019s outside of your control.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"ETF - Exchange Traded Funds; stock market and exchange. Business; trading; investment funds; profit; ... [+] strategy. 3D illustration With an ever-growing list of similar-sounding ETFs to choose from, finding the best is an increasingly difficult task. How can investors change the game to shift the odds in their favor? There are at least 110 different Technology ETFs and at least 352 ETFs across eleven sectors. Do investors need 32+ choices on average per sector? How different can the ETFs be? Those 110 Technology ETFs are very different from each other. With anywhere from 21 to 444 holdings, many of these Technology ETFs have drastically different portfolios with differing risk profiles and performance outlooks. The same is true for the ETFs in any other sector, as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks. Consumer Non-cyclicals ranks first for stock selection. Utilities ranks last. I think the large number of sector ETFs hurts investors more than it helps. Manually conducting a deep analysis for every ETF is simply not a realistic option, exposing investors to insufficient analysis and missing profitable opportunities. Analyzing ETFs, with the proper diligence, is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each ETF. As stated above, there can be as many as 444 stocks or more for one ETF. Figure 1 shows the top-rated ETF for each sector. Best Sector ETFs 1Q25 *Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity Among the ETFs in Figure 1, Global X MLP ETF (MLPA) ranks first overall, Invesco KBW Property & Casualty Insurance ETF (KBWP) ranks second, and iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) ranks third. Virtus Reaves Utilities ETF (UTES) ranks last. Why do you need to know the holdings of ETFs before you buy? You need to be sure you do not buy an ETF that might blow up. Buying an ETF without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. No matter how cheap, if it holds bad stocks, the ETF\u2019s performance will be bad. PERFORMANCE OF FUND\u2019S HOLDINGS \u2013 FEES = PERFORMANCE OF FUND Global X MLP ETF (MLPA) is not only the top-rated Energy ETF but is also the overall top-ranked sector ETF out of the 352 sector ETFs that my firm covers. The worst ETF in Figure 1 is Virtus Reaves Utilities ETF (UTES), which gets a Very Unattractive rating. One would think ETF providers could do better for this sector.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":" \t\t\t\t\tBy Dade Hayes  Business Editor  \tCapping a years-long effort to emphasize the living room, YouTube said Tuesday that it now gets more of its total U.S. viewership on TV sets than on mobile devices.  \tU.S. viewers watch more than 1 billion hours in the U.S. counting both TVs and mobile, CEO Neal Mohan said. The exec expanded on those stats and offered several more in his annual letter to the YouTube community, posted on the eve of the Google-owned video giant\u2019s 20th anniversary.  \tYouTube was founded on February 14, 2005, and went live in December of that year. Google acquired it for $1.65 billion in stock in 2006.  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tAmy Schumer Delivers Netflix's Top Weekly Title 'Kinda Pregnant'; 'The Night Agent' Still No. 1 In TV Despite Season 2 Audience Decline\t\t \t\t\t                \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Harry Potter' TV Series Due To Hit HBO In 2026: Everything We Know About The Cast, Who's Creating It, What J.K.

Today\u2019s creators have moved from filming grainy videos of themselves on desktop computers to building studios and producing popular talk shows and feature-length films,\u201d Mohan wrote.     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tYouTube has spent the past two years as the No. 1 platform in terms of U.S. market share in Nielsen\u2019s monthly Gauge report, Mohan noted. \u201cBut the \u2018new\u2019 television doesn\u2019t look like the \u2018old\u2019 television,\u201d he observed. \u201cIt\u2019s interactive and includes things like Shorts (yes, people watch them on TVs), podcasts, and live streams, right alongside the sports, sitcoms and talk shows people already love.\u201d  \tMohan identified the four \u201cbig bets\u201d the company is making in 2025, including on cultural relevance, the creator community, the living room and AI.   \tAI is helping drive advancements in a few areas, Mohan said, including reckoning with language differences. More than 40% of the total watch time of videos with dubbed audio comes from viewers choosing to listen in a dubbed language, he said.  \tYouTube plans to expand its pilot with CAA, which is designed to give more people access to technology designed to identify and manage AI-generated content that features their likeness. The company will also use machine learning to help estimate a user\u2019s age, in an effort to ensure they get age-appropriate programming and protections.  \tSome stats were mentioned by Mohan but had been previously released. He noted that 45 million users watched political content on Election Day. Also, an Edison Research study last fall found that YouTube is now the preferred outlet for podcast consumption, based on total viewing time.   Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Reliable power on the go is getting easier to come by, thanks to innovative new generators that seem get smaller every day. Anker is at the forefront of the portable power station revolution, and their 1800-watt Solix C1000 is the one to check out today thanks to a limited-time Amazon deal that\u2019s dropped its price to its lowest point ever, just $499. See at Amazon The Solix C1000 has 11 outlets, including 6 AC ports, and can crank up to 2400 watts and handle 99% of the appliances you want to keep running at home during a power outage or on the road while you\u2019re camping or RV living. It\u2019s amazingly durable, but for an extra layer of protection for outdoor use, this deal includes a water-resistant carry bag. The Solix C1000 normally lists for $1,068, but this Amazon limited-time deal takes a full 53% off that number. On the road, the Anker Solix C1000 is ideal for keeping your creature comfort devices charged and running. The six AC outlets, 2 USB-C, and 2 USB-A ports let you plug in a myraid of devices and small appliances, from smartphones and handheld gaming consoles all the way up to car fridges, coolers, and mini space heaters. As a home backup in case of power outages, the Solix C1000 is ideal for keeping your laptop, router, and TV running to keep you informed. And when connected to a medical device like a CPAP machine, the Solix C1000\u2019s switchover time of under 20 microseconds keeps everything running without a hiccup. If you\u2019re planning a big outdoor project, the Anker Solic C1000 will save you from running those long extension cords for your power tools. The AC plugs are perfect for electric chainsaws, power drills, and more. And when the Solix C1000 needs to recharge, it can be fully back up to full capacity in under an hour when connected to an AC outlet, and under 2 hours when you connect a 600W solar panel (sold separately). In one short decade, Anker has established a stellar reputation for power devices ranging from ultra-compact smartphone chargers to large solar power stations capable of charging virtually an entire home in case of emergency. The Solix C1000 hits that sweet spot right in the middle \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it has 11 outlets to serve as an extremely capable home backup device, and it really shines when you\u2019re away from wired power \u00e2\u0080\u0094 camping trips, RV trips, tailgate parties, and more.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"There are now two major international agreements designed to protect the global community that the United States is refusing to participate in: The Paris Climate Accords, which the Trump administration has pulled out of for the second time, and now the declaration that came out of the Paris AI Action Summit which called for all development of artificial intelligence tools and technology to be inclusive, open, ethical, sustainable, and safe. God forbid, right? The United States was not alone in its rejection of the agreement, which was signed by over 70 governments and international bodies including the European Union, China, and India. The United Kingdom also opted not to place its signature on the pledge, a move it signaled on Monday according to Politico, without providing any public explanation as to why. The US was not so quiet about its reasons. In his first international address, Vice President JD Vance essentially told the world that they could shove it if they\u2019re expecting the United States to act responsibly when it comes to AI development. Vance referred to the declaration, which does not seem to have any enforcement method, as a \u201cmassive\u201d set of regulations that amounts to \u201cauthoritarian censorship,\u201d per Reuters. Vance\u2019s primary reason for snubbing the global community, he said, was because the Trump administration believes \u201cexcessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry just as it\u2019s taking off.\u201d Growing that industry safely and with guide rails would get in the way of profits, you see, and that simply cannot stand. Vance, seemingly defiantly, insisted that not only will America reject this international agreement, but it\u2019ll \u201censure that the most powerful A.I. systems are built in the U.S. with American designed and manufactured chips.\u201d And while he said that America won\u2019t go at it alone, he also made clear that if\u00c2\u00a0the rest of the world wants to come along on that journey, the Trump administration will allow it\u00e2\u0080\u0094but only if they drop this whole \u201cinclusive and sustainable\u201d stuff. It seems at least part of the issue for Vance and the administration he represents stems from China, which did sign the agreement. At one point during his speech, Vance warned that \u201ccheap tech in the marketplace\u201d has been \u201cheavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes\u201d and said \u201cpartnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure.\u201d While he didn\u2019t namedrop DeepSeek, the Chinese AI firm that grabbed headlines by releasing an open-source chatbot that was competitive with American models allegedly at a fraction of the price, it does seem that he was pointing directly at it in every other way. The rest of the world seemed disappointed but not shocked by America\u2019s decision to withhold its signature. And it seems like the Trump administration\u2019s reckless approach is already affecting others. French President Emmanuel Macron signed the agreement but also stated that France would seek to cut red tape when it comes to AI investment and development. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would make a point to \u201creduce bureaucracy\u201d and increase its investments in AI. That\u2019s about in line with what we\u2019ve already seen from the AI industry. ChatGPT\u2019s very public arrival was born out of a rush to get to market, not an assurance that the tool was safe and ready for the public. By opting not to sign on to the AI Action Summit agreement, the Trump administration has signaled that\u2019s the plan for the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094be first, consequences be damned.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"The first landmark win in an AI copyright case is here. A Delaware court has ruled that a tech startup used copyright-protected material to build a competing AI-based legal product, which is against the law, handing over a remarkable win to Thomson Reuters. This is the first major victory for a plaintiff fighting against an AI company over what constitutes \u201cfair use\u201d of material owned by another entity. The parent company of the Reuters news agency has been tangled in a lengthy legal case against Ross Intelligence, an AI company that lifted material from Thomson Reuters\u2019s Westlaw platform. The plaintiff argued in court that Ross Intelligence\u2019s usage of material pulled from its database to train an AI-powered legal research tool was not fair use, and that it infringed on copyright-protected material. In their ruling, U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas rejected Ross\u2019 claims that its conduct was \u201cinnocent infringement,\u201d granting a summary judgment in favor of Thomson Reuters. At the center of the case is the concept of fair use, which is broadly dependent on four factors: (1) The purpose and character of using copyright material, including whether it is commercial or nonprofit (2) The nature of the copyrighted work that was used (3) How much of the work was used and how substantial a part it was relative to the copyrighted work\u2019s whole (4) How does the usage affect the copyrighted work\u2019s value or potential market position The district court\u2019s decision was a 2-2 split between Ross Intelligence and Thomson Reuters, but Judge Bibas ruled that the fourth factor outweighs the rest. The latest court ruling could set the ball rolling for more decisive action in other cases where AI companies have been dragged to court for unfairly using copyright-protected content. One of the biggest such cases involved The New York Times mounting a legal challenge against OpenAI and its backer Microsoft for using the news outlet\u2019s content without proper authorization to train its AI products such as ChatGPT. Getty\u2019s lawsuits against Stability AI are another example where the \u201cscraping\u201d of content without due licensing or compensation was challenged. Amazon-backed Anthropic also found itself tangled in a copyright battle against the Universal Music Group. Recently, we have seen a new trend where two supposedly warring sides strike a licensing deal to quell the copyright disputes. OpenAI has struck licensing deals with Axios, Hearst, and CondeNast, among others. Perplexity, stung by its own long list of copyright lawsuits, has inked similar partnerships with Fortune and Times, to name a few. Meta, Google, and Microsoft have also signed similar deals with \u201ccontent\u201d partners. Even the Reuters news agency has entered into a licensing partnership with Meta. But striking licensing deals is merely a stop-gap solution. Experts are still divided and seek further clarity on what constitutes copyright law in the age of AI. For example, if an AI model is regurgitating a paraphrased version of someone\u2019s copyright-protected material, what degree of similarity between the two would trigger a copyright infringement lawsuit? We\u2019ll find out soon. OpenAI and South Korean tech firm Kakao, developers of the popular KakaoTalk messaging app, have entered into a strategic partnership that will see ChatGPT functionality integrated into KakaoTalk while providing OpenAI with valuable training and user behavior data. This news comes just a day after Japan's SoftBank pledged $3 billion to deploy OpenAI technologies across its various business ventures. The Kakao agreement will cover three initial projects between the two companies. First, they plan to develop a Korean-language assistant similar to Siri or Google's Assistant but built atop OpenAI's tech. Second, Kakao employees will gain access to ChatGPT Enterprise in their workflows and third, the aforementioned KakaoTalk integration. Adobe announced a new multimodal capability for its Acrobat AI Assistant that can analyze legal documents to \"demystify complex language, summarize key terms and identify differences across multiple contracts,\" all with a single click. It's called, unsurprisingly, Contracts AI. Contracts is capable of interpreting both digital and scanned documents, automatically identifying contracts as such. The system then \"tailors the experience, generating a contract overview, surfacing key terms in a single click ... and recommending questions specific to customers\u2019 documents,\" according to the announcement post. Google announced a new experimental AI feature being made available to select users on Thursday. Dubbed \"Ask for Me,\" this AI agent will look up pricing and appointment availability for local businesses and automatically make reservations on your behalf -- though it only works for nail salons and mechanics shops currently. Accessible through the Google Search Labs, Ask for Me will initiate when users search for either nail salons or auto repair centers with Google Search. If, for example, you need a mechanic, the feature will pepper you with questions about the service you need, the make and model of your car, and your availability to bring it in for work, before reaching out to the shop. You'll also need to enter your contact information (phone number and email, specifically) so the AI can keep you apprised of its efforts.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"It has been a journey to hold on to this decades-old car I\u2019m driving without pouring any money into after-market upgrades. The car needs a ton of TLC for electric work and new shocks. I\u2019ve been holding out on dealing with the \u201cstereo\u201d for as long as possible. But a recent APK teardown of the Google app has me seeing red. I\u2019m driving to Los Angeles in a few months and need hands-free controls. I may not have them by then, at least not through the Roav Bolt dongle. Android Authority did some code sleuthing in a beta version of the Google app and found a dormant text string with the term \u201cdepreciation_notification.\u201d This string seems to be associated with accessories like the Roav Bolt, which launched in 2019 after Google debuted the Google Assistant \u201cdriving mode.\u201d The text associated with the string leads us to believe the end is nigh for these specific accessories launched during this era. It reads thusly: Google Assistant on your car accessory will be discontinued in coming weeks. To keep using Assistant, invoke queries either on your Mobile or via Android Auto. I contacted Google to ask if what\u2019s being seen here is valid. That last sentence in the notification text, especially the phrase \u201cinvoke queries,\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like something Google would push through in a final release to users. That\u2019s not user-friendly! (Neither is killing off accessories people rely on to navigate the perilous roads of the U.S. safely, but I digress.) I do believe that the Roav Bolt is essentially done for and that I need to move on to another solution. I bought it in 2019, three years into the Google Assistant journey. We were at a different time back then, when we thought the Assistant would remain a \u201cbot\u201d that connects to the search giant\u2019s vast offering of indexed information. Anker makes the Roav Bolt. It plugs into the cigarette lighter\u00e2\u0080\u0094sorry, the \u201cauxiliary power outlet\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u0094to stream audio through the car\u2019s Bluetooth and allow you to call on the Google Assistant hands-free while driving. It accepted all the basic commands, like \u201ccall somebody\u201d and \u201cskip songs.\u201d I could even ask for facts on the fly if my passenger disagreed with something I said. I saw the writing on the wall when Google scaled back Android Auto on phones and then rolled it in as part of the Google Maps experience. Last year, it twisted the knife already lobbed into the heart of accessories like the Roav Bolt when it transitioned the Google Assistant into Gemini. My usual setup stopped working entirely for several months. I could only manage a command one out of every three times I attempted it. It\u2019s the worst thing to endure when driving, and you need Google Maps to act fast. But none of this surprises me. I knew there would come a time when I\u2019d have to devise another solution for my very specific, niche problem with my car. These days, if you buy a new car, or even when you rent one, you get a vehicle with Android Auto (and Apple CarPlay) built-in. All you have to do is plug your phone into it with a cable. There is no reason for a phone-only driving mode for a specific subset of people. Still, I am sad that the dongle is about to be extinct. I thought I had it all figured out by investing a mere $50 (not adjusted for inflation) for Anker\u2019s Roav Bolt. For my upcoming trip, I may have to revert to a USB-C to the auxiliary plug-in I had going before. It\u2019s not ideal\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u2019s ugly\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it\u2019s free.

Located in the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, the residence comes with a ridiculous amount of floorspace and unmatched views of the area. The apartment is being sold by local firm Invest Dubai Real Estate, which asserts that it's the world's highest penthouse suite and says it's situated at \"over 1,300 ft\" above the city streets. This is indeed extremely high up, though without an exact figure we can't be certain it beats the $250 million penthouse in Central Park Tower reported on by the Wall Street Journal, which is situated at a height of 1,550 ft (472 m). Accessed from the Burj Khalifa's only private elevator, the residence is spread over two stories and has a floorspace of 21,000 sq ft (roughly 1,950 sq m), so it's massive, making it the largest residence in Downtown Dubai. It comes with floor-to-ceiling windows, a private swimming pool, entertainment areas, multiple bedrooms, and amenities including an exclusive lounge, fitness center, Japanese gardens, and dedicated 24-hour concierge service. The total lack of furniture is hailed as an opportunity to make it your own. Rather than heading down to IKEA like the rest of us, the owner will probably want a custom architect-designed interior that makes the most of its expansive layout. \"It comes as a shell-and-core unit and provides a blank canvas for buyers to craft a bespoke masterpiece, with ample space for grand entertaining areas, ultra-luxurious bedrooms, and custom amenities tailored to their vision,\" adds Invest Dubai Real Estate.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"5 ways to use an AI agent to grow your business  Most business owners waste time on tasks a robot could handle. They answer the same customer questions over and over. They manually track leads and sales. They spend hours analyzing data that an AI could process in seconds. Your most valuable work gets left until the end of the day in favour of admin that could be automated. Your next competitive advantage is sitting right in front of you. AI agents can handle repetitive work while you focus on growth and it\u2019s not as complicated as you think. Here's how to put artificial intelligence to work in your business today.

AI agents handle the boring stuff without complaint. They process invoices. They screen resumes. They schedule meetings. Your team tackles meaningful work instead of mindless admin. Identify tasks that eat your time. Choose a workflow platform with AI agent features, including Make, Zapier, and Lindy AI. Map out your processes clearly. Build automated systems step by step. Test thoroughly before going live. Train your team on the new tools. Track time saved and productivity gained. Stop drowning in manual work when AI could set you free. Create superhuman customer service. Boost your sales pipeline. Turn data into decisions. Perfect your inventory control. Automate repetitive tasks. Your AI workforce is ready to be deployed.

{"date":"2025-02-11","content":"Donald Trump first achieved national fame in 1987 with a bestselling book titled The Art of the Deal, which created an enduring false impression that Trump was good at making deals. In fact, the secret to Trump\u2019s initial financial success\u2014and also to his many subsequent financial failures\u2014is Trump\u2019s propensity not to make deals, but to break them. A better title would have been The Art of the Stiff. On Sunday, Trump hinted that the United States might renege on some of the $36.22 trillion that it owes on the national debt. Speaking to reporters Sunday on Air Force One about Elon Musk\u2019s review of government spending, Trump said:  We\u2019re even looking at Treasury. There could be a problem\u2014you\u2019ve been reading about that, with Treasuries, and that could be an interesting problem because it could be that a lot of those things don\u2019t count. In other words, that some of that stuff that we\u2019re finding is very fraudulent, therefore maybe we have less debt than we thought of. Think of that! \u201cFor those not familiar with how financial markets work,\u201d Paul Krugman later explained on BlueSky, \u201cU.S. Treasuries are the ultimate safe asset, used as collateral for everything. Even a hint that some Treasuries might not be honored could bring everything to a screeching halt.\u201d The bond market did not come to a screeching halt. We didn\u2019t even see an uptick in interest rates (which is how the bond market expresses distress). Trump\u2019s veiled threat not to honor U.S. debt obligations got amazingly little coverage, probably because nobody thought to ask a follow-up question. I\u2019d guess there weren\u2019t any financial reporters present. Another mitigating circumstance was the Crazy Old Bastard factor. Trump made his unsupported allegation of bond fraud after signing, in front of the cameras, a proclamation declaring February 9 \u201cGulf of America Day\u201d and telling reporters, \u201cI\u2019m committed to buying and owning Gaza.\u201d It can\u2019t be repeated too often that Trump has been declared by 200 mental health professionals to suffer from a \u201csevere, untreatable personality disorder\u2014malignant narcissism\u201d and also to suffer from cognitive decline. If the markets (or the press) reacted to every crazy thing Trump said they couldn\u2019t function. On the other hand, Trump is president of the United States, enabling him to follow through on his more unhinged statements, and reneging is a lifelong habit. That\u2019s how he got rich! I don\u2019t mean to minimize the hundreds of millions that Trump received from his father over the years. (At age 3, Trump\u2019s weekly allowance was the equivalent in 2025 dollars of $5,605.) But we\u2019ve seen silver-spooned \u201cbootstrappers\u201d before. What distinguished Trump\u2019s financial success was his well-documented enthusiasm for declining to honor agreements. That also distinguished Trump\u2019s financial failure. Eventually Trump\u2019s reputation caught up with him and most banks refused to do business with the Trump Organization (a prejudice Trump has lately misconstrued as a refusal to do business with conservatives). As I\u2019ve written previously, Trump\u2019s personal finances are in a dangerously precarious state, rendering him highly susceptible to bribery. As president, Trump judges himself free to ignore any and all preexisting arrangements, from the Constitution to statutes to judicial rulings. Even when Trump himself signs an international treaty like the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, it\u2019s a coin flip whether he\u2019ll honor it. What\u2019s kept financial markets from tanking since January 20 is their conviction, however misplaced, that Trump won\u2019t deliver on his intermittent threats to wreck the economy\u2014that he will renege on reneging. That\u2019s what happened last week when a stock market tumble spooked Trump into withdrawing for 30 days his threatened 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico (which, had he carried them out, would have violated USMCA). The bond market\u2019s initial reaction to Trump\u2019s comments was to shrug them off. \u201cTrump\u2019s veiled threat is so insane that it won\u2019t happen,\u201d Harvard economist Jason Furman assured me. Politico\u2019s Victoria Guida quoted an administration official saying that Trump was talking about unspecified Treasury payments, not Treasuries, prompting some of the business press (for instance, Bloomberg) to report that Trump\u2019s meaning was unclear. Trump\u2019s meaning was not unclear, and that administration official was lying when he or she said Trump was talking about unspecified Treasury payments. Go back and look at what Trump said. It\u2019s on video, for Christ\u2019s sake. (Fast forward to 21:15.) He said, \u201cTreasuries.\u201d You aren\u2019t imagining things. Your president is not a well man. The bond market\u2019s calm won\u2019t last if Trump repeats his threat once or twice more, as he tends to do until he gets a reaction. Or it may react with even greater alarm than expected when Trump and congressional Republicans reveal their deficit-busting tax plan. (The bond market has for some time been freaking out about the budget deficit.) \u201cThe political world needs to appreciate the fact that he\u2019s playing with fire that will burn everyone,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Steve Benen observed Monday. I second that.  Timothy Noah is a New Republic staff writer and author of The Great Divergence: America\u2019s Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It.","label":0}

I had no trouble tossing on different guards to fade the sides of my head, and it cut in every direction without issue. Speaking of guards, the kit comes with 12 of them, so you shouldn\u2019t have any issue finding the right length. I also like that the blade pops off, so it\u2019s easy to clean attachments and the clipper body when you\u2019re done. With a two-hour runtime, it has plenty of juice to cut long hair like mine. And while it takes a couple of hours to recharge, a tiny indicator light helps you keep track of battery life. The power and precision of the Andis ReVite makes it our top pick for 2025. I had a hard time finding fault with the ReVite, but if I had to nitpick I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bit loud, and it\u2019s certainly louder than the smaller clippers we tested, like the Philips Multigroom 9000. I was also surprised to discover it doesn\u2019t come with some sort of carrying case or bag\u2014a confusing decision given that it comes with so many guards and accessories. You can pick up a case for less than $20, but even a drawstring pouch from Andis would be sufficient. Still, these are minor faults and the ReVite is an otherwise excellent option for the price whether you\u2019re a total amateur or advanced user.

Tested charge time: 12 hours | Tested runtime: 1 hour | Weight: 8 ounces | Clipper lengths: 1\/16 inch to 1 inch, plus left\/right-angled ear guards | Zero gap possible: No | Warranty: 5 years\u00a0 Best for: Skip if: The Wahl Color Pro is the kind of device you break out for simple haircuts and the occasional touch-up. It isn\u2019t incredibly powerful, and the precision won\u2019t blow you away, but the color-coded guards the guesswork out of hair cutting. For example, you\u2019re more likely to remember using the blue guard on the sides of your head and the green guard on top, before remembering using guards 4 and 7. Our tester appreciated the Wahl Color Pro\u2019s simplicity, noting that it\u2019s a great tool to have on hand when you can\u2019t get to the barber or want to save money cleaning up your neck, sideburns and other hard-to-reach areas. And if you decide to make the leap to the buzzcut, it shouldn\u2019t have any problem tackling thin or short hair. To get all that from a clipper that costs less than $50 is rather impressive. The Wahl Color Pro Cordless offers simple, reliable performance for at-home maintenance. The charging process leaves something to be desired: These clippers require a 12-hour charge time. Not only that, but the charging indicator light at the base doesn\u2019t change color or turn off to indicate the battery is fully charged, so you never really know if it\u2019s full, half full or nearly empty. Ultimately, the battery hiccups don\u2019t detract from the performance, which is why this clipper earns our value pick at just $40.

Tested charge time: 30 minutes | Tested runtime: 30 minutes | Weight: 13.2 ounces | Clipper lengths: Bare guard only (others sold separately) | Zero gap possible: Yes | Warranty: 1 year Best for: Skip if: It\u2019s really easy to love the Andis Master Cordless Clipper, whether you\u2019re a novice or a veteran stylist with years of experience. Like the Andis ReVite, the Master leads with power and performance, but it remains balanced and easy to maneuver. Our tester needed a few passes to evenly cut his curly hair (but he notes this is the case even when he goes to the barber), but these clippers had no trouble creating a fade or lining up his sideburns. A charging dock is included, so you can charge the device like you might an electric toothbrush\u2014placing it upright in the stand to top off the battery between uses. The Andis Master Cordless Clipper stand out with its sleek profile and exceptional build quality. While the Master Cordless Clipper isn\u2019t lacking in how it works or maneuvers, it\u2019s worth noting that it only comes with a number zero guard\u2014you\u2019ll have to buy others separately. Normally, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem because guards are often interchangeable between brands, but this device is compatible with proprietary ones (the purple guards Andis is famous for). If high-end power, performance and quality are what you\u2019re after, these are the clippers to get.

Tested charge time: 2.5 hours | Tested runtime: 2.75 hours | Weight: 10.7 ounces | Clipper lengths: 1\/18 inch to 3\/4 inch | Zero gap possible: Yes | Warranty: 2 years\u00a0 Best for: Skip if: We\u2019ve been fans of the original BaBylissPro GoldFX Clipper for its powerful motor and sharp blades, but the newer features of the GoldFX+\u2014with upgraded functionality and universal charging capabilities\u2014make it a no-brainer to win this category. This precise clipper is a favorite among experts thanks to its smooth operation and quiet brushless motor. It didn\u2019t break a sweat when I drove it through sections of long, thick hair, and the eight guards made it easy to find the perfect length for fades. The battery lasted me over 2.5 hours on a single charge using the standard charger and it took just as long to recharge. You can also use a USB-C charger thanks to a secondary port under the base. The powerful brushless motor and USB-C charging making the BaBylissPro FX+ a powerful, capable hair ... [+] clipper. The GoldFX+ doesn\u2019t leave much to be desired, but you\u2019ll have to remove two screws in the clipper head to thoroughly clean it. It comes with a small tool to make disassembly easy, but it is something to consider depending on how fuss-free you want maintenance to be. I had no trouble cutting hair or cleaning the device, and because this clipper masters zero gaps and graduated tapers, it\u2019s an easy recommendation for anyone who wants a smooth experience with results that rival that of a professional\u2019s. You can also get it in silver or rose gold if the Tony Montana-esque pure gold isn\u2019t your style.

Tested charge time: 3 hours | Tested runtime: 1 hour | Weight: 18.4 ounces | Clipper lengths: 1\/8 inch to 1\/2 inch | Zero gap possible: Yes | Warranty: 1 year\u00a0 Best for: Skip if: With its magnetic guard attachments, LED display and 0.1mm adjustment increments, the Bevel Pro sits at the intersection of grooming and tech. Earning a spot in our best beard trimmers guide, it efficiently tackles facial hair and head hair, and its sheer weight makes you feel like you\u2019re holding a rugged, reliable tool. Although it takes a minute to make sense of the button layout (if you\u2019re like me and ignore the manual at all costs), you\u2019ll find it intuitive once you get it down, and the digital display keeps track of both the battery life and trimmer length. It\u2019s a clipper that looks like it was sent to us from the future, and it acts like one, too. The Bevel Pro impresses with its all-in-one design and heavy, durable build. While it looks beautiful, the Bevel Pro\u2019s heaviness and sleek egg-like shape come at the cost of ergonomics: It\u2019s the easiest clipper to drop among those we tested. I also had to use quite a bit of force to swap the stainless steel blades\u2014although the guards secure to the blades via magnet, so those are easy to switch in and out. And the only other drawback worth mentioning is the battery, which lasts an hour at most and takes a few hours to recharge. Still, I was blown away by the Bevel Pro\u2019s performance and its overall design. There isn\u2019t another clipper quite like this on the market. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Tested charge time: 2 hours | Tested runtime: 6 hours | Weight: 8 ounces | Clipper lengths: 0.5mm to 16mm, plus left\/right-angled ear guards | Zero gap possible: No | Warranty: 8 years\u00a0 Best for: Skip if: The Philips Multigroom 9000 is our top beard trimmer pick for grooming facial hair, and it\u2019s just as capable if you\u2019re managing hair atop your head. The sleek, lightweight design makes it easy to maneuver in tight spaces, and there\u2019s plenty of customization thanks to an assortment of attachments. It lacks cutting options for longer hair (it cuts up to 7mm in small intervals before jumping to 9mm, 12mm and 16mm) but you can break out angled trimmer guards to cut around the ears and move up in 1mm increments with dial-adjusted guards. And it technically doesn\u2019t matter how much hair you\u2019re cutting because the battery lasts for hours on a single charge\u2014my testing delivered six hours of runtime. The Philips Multigroom 9000 uses its small size to help define the details. You might run into trouble if you\u2019re using the Multigroom 9000 to cut long, thick hair. I prefer to think of this device as a do-it-all hair manager, meaning it won\u2019t offer the same power and performance as a dedicated clipper. In fact, I started using it with one of the guard attachments, but quickly transitioned to the shaver as I cleaned up my sideburns. It should get the job done if you have thin or straight hair, but volume and curls will give it trouble. Here are a couple of other clippers that received high marks online but didn\u2019t quite make our list of top picks. These options aren\u2019t bad by any means, but they don\u2019t stand out as the best options for a particular preference or style of hair. Panasonic MultiShape: This is an excellent beard trimmer, but it\u2019s not quite as capable when it comes to cutting hair. The longer clipper attachments aren\u2019t as sturdy as the shorter ones, which can lead to uneven results on longer buzz cuts. On top of that, the alignment of the guards can feel a little off, making it hard to trust the consistency of the cut. Braun Hair Clipper Series 7: These clippers get the job done if you\u2019re only after a very short buzz cut (less than 3mm). However, the guards aren\u2019t as strong as the reinforced ones found on our favorite clippers. During testing, they sometimes bent or shifted under pressure, which made it tricky to get a clean, even cut, especially at longer lengths. At Forbes Vetted, we\u2019ve covered dozens of grooming topics over the years. From electric razors to body hair trimmers, we\u2019ve got plenty of experience finding the right products that take care of your body. To identify the best hair clippers, we created a testing protocol that focused on three key variables: power and performance, ease of use and customization. With insights from Brook and Wickliffe, we evaluated each clipper\u2019s performance, testing everything from battery life and ergonomics to levers and guard options. Below is a breakdown of how we tested, and the expert advice that guided us along the way. The Andis ReVite features an adjustment lever to alter the closeness of your cut.  We started by assessing the charging time and battery life of each model, focusing on how long the battery takes to charge, how long it lasts on a full charge and whether it maintains consistent power over time. Some of the models we tested can be operated while they\u2019re plugged in, but Wickliffe says that \u201cthe common downfalls of battery life and power have been remedied with newer models, and now there is much less of an argument for corded clippers.\u201d For this reason, we tested each set of clippers without plugging them in. From setup to maintenance, we tested how easy each device is to use, especially for beginners looking to cut their hair at home. We also looked at blade care, as both experts emphasized regular cleaning and oiling to maximize longevity. \u201cI\u2019d suggest oiling your clipper blades before every use... and disinfecting your tool with something like Cool Care from Andis,\u201d says Wickliffe. Similarly, Brook recommends cleaning the blades after each use and storing your clippers in a cool, dry place. Customization features, such as adjustable levers and guard options, are important when it comes to gauging how well clippers perform on different types of hair, and for various styles. We looked for clippers with an adjustable lever that helps blend lengths together to create clean fades, and we looked for ones with a strong motor and durable blades that won\u2019t die or jam up, respectively. When choosing the best hair clippers for your needs, it\u2019s all about finding the right tool that balances power, precision and comfort. Whether you\u2019re going for a professional-level fade or some simple maintenance, focusing on a handful of key features can spell the difference between quality clippers that last for years and cheap ones that break after only a few uses. The BaBylissPro Gold FX+ offers a premium cut with a limited set of guards. A clipper\u2019s ability to cut its way through hair starts with the efficiency and power of its motor. A strong motor not only cuts through thick or curly hair with ease but also delivers consistent performance over time. For those with thick or curly hair, stylist Sunnie Brook recommends clippers with \u201ca strong motor (rotary or pivot) and sharp blades.\u201d And for fine hair, opt for lighter, magnetic motors. Blades are equally as important as the motor because even if the motor is powerful, it can\u2019t cut through thick hair with dull blades. Look for stainless steel or titanium-coated blades for durability and long-term sharpness, and keep in mind that regular maintenance is key here. Well-maintained blades not only cut better but also reduce the risk of irritation or tugging during use. Guard options allow you to cut different lengths and styles, whether you\u2019re trimming a beard or blending a fade. Solid clippers should come with a range of guards to suit different lengths, and if you\u2019re someone who likes experimenting with different styles, you\u2019ll want at least four basic guards to get started. The adjustable lever is a game-changer for blending and tapering. Found on the side of most clippers, it allows you to fine-tune the blade length without switching guards. Wickliffe considers it the number one feature to look for because it helps you blend lengths together seamlessly, and it\u2019s especially useful for cutting precise details and clean lines. Because hair clippers are handheld tools, comfort and design matter more than you might think. Lightweight, ergonomic designs reduce hand and wrist fatigue during longer cutting sessions, and textured grips can improve control, especially if your hands get wet or oily along the way. Based on extensive testing and expert insights, we determined the Andis ReVite clippers to be the best option for 2025 due to the design\u2019s powerful motor and vast selection of trimming guards that come with the kit. Our top value pick is the Wahl Color Pro Cordless, which gives an easy, no-frills cleanup. The highest grade on hair clippers refers to the longest guard length available, and while the longest guard length can vary by brand, most clippers max out at a grade 8, or one inch. However, it\u2019s worth noting that some brands offer additional guards or specialty attachments for even longer trims, which makes them a better option for more natural looks. The main difference comes down to intended use and blade design. Hair clippers are built for bulk cutting and handling larger sections of hair, and they often come with guard attachments for different lengths. Trimmers, meanwhile, are designed for precision work, like edging, outlining or tidying up hard-to-reach areas. They\u2019re ideal for detailed cutting around your ears, neck and beard. ","label":0}
