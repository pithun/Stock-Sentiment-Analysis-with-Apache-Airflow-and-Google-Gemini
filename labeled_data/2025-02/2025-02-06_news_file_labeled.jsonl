{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  Investors have been on edge as President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies have seesawed markets and potentially\u00a0raised the risk of a recession.          Shortly after Trump took office, he said he would impose import taxes on Canada, Colombia, and Mexico. He reversed course once those nations agreed to work with him on hot-button issues like border security. China also got hit with tariffs and responded in kind.               Stocks seem to have stalled as strategists try to sort out the US's ever shifting trade approach.               As markets struggle for direction, BMO Capital Markets is trying to cut through the noise. The Montreal-based bank focuses much of its research on the US and Canada, making it an authority on the economic and market effects of tariffs across those countries.               \"The scale of this economic uncertainty is unprecedented,\" Camilla Sutton, BMO's head of equity research for Canada and the UK, said on Wednesday during a webinar about the impact of tariffs.               It's almost impossible for American and Canadian companies to plan and issue guidance to investors when they don't know what next month holds \u2014 much less next quarter or next year.               But top minds at BMO seem confident that Trump's tariff talk will be more bark than bite.               \"We've long said that opportunities come about when people \u2014 investors and markets \u2014 overreact,\" Brian Belski, the firm's chief investment strategist, said in the webinar. \"And we believe that there was a clear overreaction to this.\"               BMO's message to clients is best summed up by a four-word statement from Belski: \"Remain calm and disciplined.\"               While neither the S&P 500 nor the Canadian S&P\/TSX Composite Index has gone far lately, both have had dizzying intraday swings.               Despite this volatility, BMO is sticking with year-end targets that imply double-digit gains, since it believes both US and Canadian markets are in long-term uptrends. Belski said he'd thought US stocks were set for 25 strong years since arriving at BMO in 2012 and he's not changing now. He added that Canadian stocks were \"coming along for the ride.\"               \"Within secular bulls, you can have cyclical bears, which we clearly did in the fourth quarter of 2018,\" Belski said. \"We had a clear bear market during COVID and another bear market in 2022. So you can have these opportunities, from a fundamental perspective, to be involved.\"               That said, the top strategist suggested investors take a granular look at individual stocks instead of simply buying shares of US-based companies.               \"Worry more about the implicit, bottoms-up view on the stocks versus trying to make the big market call,\" Belski said.               Similarly, stock pickers shouldn't get greedy or caught up in the hype of a promising company or market-shifting trend. Nor should they make huge bets based on policy views or predictions, especially in this highly uncertain market.               \"Now is not the time to be hitting home runs,\" Belski said. \"Now it's time to be hitting singles and doubles, and it's time to be more fundamental. It's time to turn off the rhetoric. It's time to kind of take two steps back and look at the mosaic.\"               Belski said investors should zero in on four aspects of companies: their valuation, growth, operating performance, and price performance.               Through that lens, Belski's view is that US stocks are richly valued and have little room for error, though they can justify that premium because of their remarkably consistent earnings growth, plus top-tier marks in free cash flow, return on invested capital, and debt to equity. Canadian stocks don't get nearly as much attention as their US peers, though they score well there also.               \"The equity markets in Canada and the United States \u2014 relative to other developed markets in the world \u2014 are on much better footing,\" Belski said.               Certain sectors look like better bets than others. BMO is especially bullish about four investment ideas, which Belski reiterated in a recent note: consumer discretionary, financials, real estate investment trusts, and technology.               Consumer discretionary and technology look like solid bets in a continued economic expansion, and the latter has historically done best in up markets, BMO has said. And while financials and real estate have been whipsawed by interest-rate swings, both have rallied substantially lately.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"        Lauren Frayer                        Pets At Home in Southend, U.K., is one retailer to be selling dog treats made from lab-grown meat.                                                           John Keeble\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  LONDON \u2014 Last summer, the United Kingdom became the first country in Europe to legalize lab-grown meat, starting with pet food. On Friday, it will hit the shelves.   The manufacturer is called Meatly, and its product is called Chick Bites \u2014 a type of dog treat. But Chick Bites are made without ever involving a chicken. Instead, cells taken from one chicken egg are cultivated in a lab and then combined with plant-based ingredients. The company says the result is \"just as tasty and nutritious as traditional chicken breast.\" Meatly, based in London, calls itself the first company in the world to supply cultivated meat for pet food. It claims its single sample from egg cells, multiplied in a lab, is capable of producing enough protein \"to feed pets forever.\" Cultivated meat \u2014 sometimes called \"no kill\" meat \u2014 is seen as more ethical and environmentally friendly, although the cultivated meat industry does contribute to CO2 emissions, given that its production facilities rely on electricity.  Compared to traditional beef farming, making cultivated meat uses 45% less energy, and if its manufacture is powered with renewables, it can emit up to 92% less greenhouse gases, use 95% less land and 78% less water, according to estimates by the European Environment Agency. (Beef production, a top source of methane emissions and an activity that requires large areas of grazing land, has an environmental impact far greater than that of chicken production).   In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the sale of lab-grown meat for human consumption in the United States. Singapore and Israel have also approved it.  No European Union country has done so. Austria, France and Italy have all lodged concerns with the E.U. And no country in the world has approved lab-grown meat for pets except the U.K. Chick Bites come in a pale blue resealable plastic pack with a cartoon of a dog waving a flag that says: \"Puptivists changing the world.\"   In an email to NPR, Meatly CEO Owen Ensor said Chick Bites are on sale for \u00a33.49 (about $4.35) a pack. That's in the middle price range for dog treats for sale on the website of Pets At Home, the U.K. pet supply retailer that's slated to begin selling Chick Bites on Friday.  \"Around 20% of all the meat that is consumed by higher pet-owning nations \u2014 and that would include the U.K. \u2014 is actually consumed by pets, not people,\" Andrew Knight, professor of veterinary science at the University of Winchester, told the BBC. When people talk about the environmental impact of meat, Knight said, \"They've always been focusing on human diets.\" \"Actually, pets are a really big part of this picture as well,\" he said. A 2022 survey by U.K. researchers, published in the PLOS ONE journal, found that 32.5% of respondents said they were willing to eat cultivated meat themselves. A much higher percentage, 47.3%, said they were willing to feed it to their pets. Even though Austria has not approved lab-grown meat for any consumption \u2014 human or pet \u2014 a Vienna-based company called BioCraft Pet Nutrition says it is cultivating mouse, rabbit and chicken meat in a lab, \"because cats and dogs absolutely love them.\" Whether that is true won't be clear until these products reach their intended market.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  The resilient US job market could weaken this year, with employers showing early signs that they're readying more job cuts in 2025.          Job cut announcements continued to rise in January, even as the labor market remained on solid footing overall. Layoff announcements swelled to 49,795 over the month of January, according to data from Challenger, Gray and Christmas. That marks a 28% increase from the prior month, though it was the quietest January for layoff announcements since 2022, the career outplacement firm said in a report.               That number looks poised to increase in the coming months, given recent mass layoff announcements, the firm added. Since the start of February, ADM has said it was planning to cut up to 700 workers in its latest cost-cutting measures, while Salesforce and Workday also made plans to cut 1,000 and 1,750 workers, respectively.               \"January was relatively quiet in terms of job cut announcements. However, we've already seen major announcements in the early days of February, so it seems this quiet is unlikely to last,\" Andrew Challenger, the senior vice president of Challenger, wrote in a note.               Meanwhile, WARN filings \u2014 regulatory filings businesses with more than 100 workers must submit if they're planning to lay off more than 50 people at a worksite \u2014 have also increased in recent months. Companies filed 253 layoff notices in December, with plans to cut 21,873 jobs, according to public records accessed by WARNTracker.com. That's up from the prior month, when firms filed 217 notices, with plans to cut 20,105 workers.               \"The number of positions covered by a WARN filing jumped in November and remained relatively high in December. As a result, we still think the trend in claims will rise to about 250K by the end of Q1, reflecting a fading drag from residual seasonability and deterioration in the underlying trend,\" Samuel Tombs, a chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote.       Hiring was robust in December. The economy added 256,000 jobs that month, well above the expected 164,000. The jobless rate, meanwhile, remained near a record low, slipping to 4.1%.               Economic forecasters, though, have been observing weaker labor market conditions in the past year, with the unemployment rate climbing 30 basis points throughout 2024.                Friday's jobs report is expected to show that hiring decelerated but continued to grow in January. Economists expect US employers to have added 170,000 jobs, according to FactSet.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Michael Saylor is apparently done thinking small. The founder and CEO of MicroStrategy announced Wednesday that his company would be dropping the \u201cMicro\u201d from its name, instead operating as Strategy. The company also announced it would be changing its logo to include a \u201cB\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u0094a letter that notably does not appear in the word \u201cStrategy.\u201d That \u201cB,\u201d which appears behind the name \u201cStrategy\u201d in the new logo, is a nod to Bitcoin, which at this point is really Strategy\u2019s only, well\u2026strategy. The company has basically thrown its full weight behind the cryptocurrency, at the behest of its crypto evangelist CEO who has already bought nearly 500,000 Bitcoins using the company\u2019s funds. In its press release, the company called itself the \u201clargest Bitcoin Treasury Company,\u201d and said that it was changing its brand color to orange to represent \u201cenergy, intelligence, and Bitcoin.\u201d Sure.

I mean, if you\u2019re going to change the company\u2019s name and you can make it anything that you want with the existing knowledge that you want to find a way to work a Bitcoin-style \u201cB\u201d into it, why wouldn\u2019t you make sure that you picked a name where you didn\u2019t have to hastily tack the symbol on at the end? Call yourself Blueprint and toss that stylized \u201cB\u201d right up front. I\u2019m neither a business strategist nor a graphic designer but this feels like an extremely solvable problem. Anyway, here\u2019s some corporate speak gobbledygook from Saylor explaining the name change: Strategy is one of the most powerful and positive words in the human language. It also represents a simplification of our company name to its most important, strategic core. Antoine de Saint-Exupery said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 After 35 years, our new brand perfectly represents our pursuit of perfection. Cool, man. It\u2019s a little funny that Saylor and Co. are going so hard on \u201cStrategy\u201d as the company becomes more and more narrowly focused on a singular approach to its business. The company doesn\u2019t really do \u201cstrategy\u201d anymore. Instead, Strategy is so tied up in Bitcoin that its stock basically serves as a proxy to the cryptocurrency itself. Luckily, Saylor has never gone all-in on one thing before only to get burned by it when the bubble bursts\u00e2\u0080\u0094except that time when MicroStrategy served as the harbinger for the dot-com downturn that saw the company stock drop 62% in a single day. But other than that one extremely famous time, flawless record.

AMD actually cashed on crypto harder than nvidia did. Their cards were utter unobtainium during ethereum craze, because they were more efficient for that specific work. And that meant AMD letting gaming market just die for their cards. Gamers basically couldn't get their cards for years in any meaningful amounts. So game makers saw no sense in optimizing games for them, or for that matter making new techniques in any meaningful amount of quality for them. For several years. For all of nvidia's faults, they made a good effort at staying relevant for gamers during ethereum boom. And now, they're basically the only game left in town.

Did you short and get your free money? Momentum might even be on your side now. Sales are down because people are waiting for the new models, which are all sold out.   AMD is not going to jump in there and get these buyers. Some of those people ate waiting for AMD instead because this generation of nv cards offers too little benefit for the price increase. The serious gamers who will pay this much don't want cards which are only faster with more fake frames. no new gpu is available outside of the scalper market and the AIBs are upping their prices well above FE msrp. It\u00e2(TM)s a significant price increase if you actually want to purchase one, over prices from just November. Often double or triple price from scalpers. The 4090 was almost msrp when they stopped production. Take a deep breath, its gonna be ok. Outside of a halo 5090, the other three cost exactly the same as the previous gen, including 5070, 5070 Ti and 5080. So, what price increase are you talking about?The issue is NVidia labeling of the models compared to their specifications. For example, the 5080 is priced $200 below the 4080 launch price. However examining the specifications of the 5080 shows it is closer to previous generation's xx70 models in things like bus and RAM. This is not the first time NVidia has misleading with label names. Many feel the 4060 was should have been labeled a 4050Ti based on performance and specifications. The 4060Ti  was on average 5% faster than the previous generation 3060T  Outside of a halo 5090, the other three cost exactly the same as the previous gen, including 5070, 5070 Ti and 5080.

For those looking to go with decent performance mid-range for a good price, AMD has the better product.   Sure, you have a LOT of idiots with a RTX XX60 tier card who think that NVIDIA is the best, but in that price range, AMD has often been a far better choice. Do you think people at the low end turn on ray tracing?   If they leave ray tracing off, then NVIDIA has no actual advantage over AMD at  Yesterday: \"AMD outsells Intel in the Data Center!\"Today: \"AMD is losing in the GPU market!\" feast or famine. Frankly, I'm not interested in $2K video cards. I'm not crypto-mining, and I'm not looking to generate LLMs. My Rx 6800 is doing fine and I don't have to take out a home equity loan to pay for it's electrical usage. GPUs are big business in the Data Center as well. For example, El Capitan (LLNL) has almost 44,000 AMD GPUs in it, along with the same number of EPYC CPUs. It's all in HP packaging, but it's AMD CPUs and GPUs. Tomorrow: \"Intel integrated graphics beat NVidia in portable devices!\" Nvidia: RockIntel: PaperAMD: Scissors Actually AMD has utterly crushed nvidia in ultraportables. The only exception is nintendo, which never cared about performance. Everyone else went with deeply specialized AMD SOC specifically designed for those systems. Be it Steam, major Chinese manufacturers, or major Western manufacturers. AMD's ultraportable SOC has an amazing CPU + GPU performance and low power consumption on top of it. Well, except for MSI iirc. But that intel based portable was a joke that no one bought. [hashtag] The New Beleaguered I'm very impressed by the continuous advances in GPU technology having been made in the past 25 years, but instead of the next monster gfx\/ai\/ultranumbercruncher card, I'd really just like a small gfx device with a consistently low power draw, low need for active cooling, made with quality components that don't give up the ghost after two or three years of use, and with quality FLOSS driver and source code support. Nvidia and ATI\/AMD has had over two decades to get their stuff together, and still Intels integrated offerings are the winning bet for the above criteria. Matrox, but they aren't cheap. Pretty sure they use ATI chips, but they are industrial-strength, designed to be ran non-stop driving video walls or multimonitor setups for control rooms. ATI has been bought out by AMD a long time ago. Matrox today is basically out of date Radeon chips with Matrox's firmware\/drivers and boards that have a lot of outputs. You need to look for a processor with integrated graphics. I thought AMD also had integrated gfx for their processors? Nothing high end of course, but still decent. I'm loving this 5825U laptop with 8 core integrated vega GPU, two count em two teraflops. I have a Ryzen 4600G that works just fine for my needs. My desktop may never have need of a separate GPU. The kid's PC is running some long obsolete video card from a decade ago. A new video card is desired there, but it must draw less than 200 watts. The industry went haring off after the 0.01% elite gamers for bragging rights, then they are wondering why sales are down. Look at Intels B580 cards. It should be just fine for a midrange video card, but it doesn't work properly on CPUs older than 10th generation. The kid has an i7-8700. Oops. That sale is lost. Steamdeck? You can buy a low power integrated option from AMD (eg. the mobile or NUC-type devices) which is far better than the Intel integrated stuff. There's an entire line of AI-enabled\/GPU stuff now, and has been for a while. Eg. the Ryzen AI Max coming up... It's been a while since I shopped, but if they still do the GE APUs that sounds like what you want. They were the integrated graphics on the upper mid range desktop chips, something like 80% the clock, but 50% the overall power. I can't think of a think to not like about this 5825U, especially the price. Low end Nvidia quadro cards (now called RTX) fill that niche.  For example, a T400 uses 30W and can drive 3 x 4K monitors at 120 Hz.  In a lab, I've seen these used 24\/7 for more than 6 years without issue (to give an idea here, a server-grade motherboard failure would be more common).  The drivers may be open-source now:  https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/b... [nvidia.com], at least on Linux. If you want to game, then I wouldn't recommend one of these cards just on a performance\/price basis.  Also the lower-end RTX cards usua I'd really just like a small gfx device with a consistently low power draw, low need for active cooling, made with quality components that don't give up the ghost after two or three years of use, and with quality FLOSS driver and source code support. You might want to check out IGPs. Both Intel's and AMD's have been pretty good in recent years. That exists. It's called the iGPU and you simply need to buy an appropriate CPU with one included. Or failing that get a NVIDIA GT710 for less than $50 the power consumption there is low enough that the cards are fanless. Honestly I don't think you've looked. There are far more computers out there with your desired kind of GPU. They are in offices by the 100s of thousands. people stop buying cards, waiting for something good, that is not a heater and not crazy priced. whales don't care and still buy nvidia at their crazy prices, but the other people are trying to wait and only buy something if they really need too (broken or need a new pc)... also you get the clueless that buy \"cheap\" nvidia just because they know it is good, while its performance\/price is actually right now pretty bad AMD need to release something that performs well, don't use 800W and don't cost +1k, forget a  You know it's winter, don't you?   Many people go Intel and NVIDIA, just because that heats up a room VERY well. you know that there are more economical ways to generate heat ... and also remember that winter ends and then you have all other months that generating heat might not be ideal... like in summer!! ... yes, if you have it, you can use a AVAC system to cool down the home, but then you pay more than double the electric bill, as you pay for generating the heat and then pay even more to remove that same amount of heat and deal with all the inefficiencies. even ignoring that,  having a GPU using 800W is expensive i  I use my home computer to occasionally play games but also for professional applications for 3D, video, and the like.Most of that software is written to take advantage of CUDA, so while GPUs from AMD might have advantages like sharing system RAM with the CPU, or Intel's new GPUs might be competitively priced, I guess I'll have to stick with Nvidia for the foreseeable future. Strange that AMD drivers have been very stable, while you need to roll back NVIDIA drivers a full year at times to fix problems.  I'm pretty sure the base 5070 replaces the base 4070, not the 4070Ti or 4070 Super.  That would be replaced by a 5070 Super. To be fair, CUDA cores don't actually have same performance between architecture. It's in the name, U stands for \"unified\". It's what allows different architectures with difference performance be programmed for once with a loss of around 20% (highly variable minimum and maximum based on specific task) compared to fully optimized system at a much lower programming overhead. But the \"super of the same SKU of previous generation is better than lowest end of that SKU in the next\" is indeed pretty new for nvidia.  30 series CUDA cores were significantly worse than 40 series if memory serves correctly. That was in fact one of the selling points of 40 series over otherwise excellent 30 series that went toe to toe with their equivalent and quite disappointing 40 series equivalents in gaming. And absolutely trashed them on RRP to performance ratio. Headline: \"AMD is Making Another Run at Nvidia With New 4K-Ready GPUs as Sales Collapse\"Body: \"The company's gaming division reported $563 million in Q4 2024 revenue, down 59% year-over-year.\" This implies that AMD is launching new graphics cards BECAUSE their sales have decreased. GPU research begins years in advance and production takes months to ramp up and stockpile before launches. They've planned to sell these video cards for years... it just so happen that their sales have fallen recently as well. Thing is, you do actually make a production run before releasing the cards, so you have something to sell. Usually. Nvidia for example didn't for their current release, which is why they have a paper launch in the middle of longest Chinese holiday when every guest worker goes home to their family. But usually you make a bunch of cards and store them in warehouses so you actually have something to sell once they're released, rather than do a paper launch with cards slowly trickling out over next few months. So  AMD makes the GPUs, and those GPUs need to go out to video card makers MONTHS before a launch.   Have you noticed how you can't find those RTX 5000 series cards ANYWHERE, because even on launch day, many places had a total of 9 RTX 5090 cards available for sale, meaning, sold out instantly.   That's at the level of a paper launch.   AMD not rushing to  release products may allow there to be a decent number of Radeon 9070XT available at launch.   The real question is what the performance is, and how much fas  I'd wager that the majority of the people who can spend $700 on an AMD card can spend a bit more and get a 50-series nVidia card. The folks who can't spend $700 on a GPU are likely a prime market for the $250 Battlemage GPUs from Intel. They benchmark pretty favorably for the creative market, and AMD isn't offering double the performance at double the price. I'll add to the argument that in addition to price, there's not as much impetus to spend $700 on a GPU. Crysis is nearly 20 years old, and I haven't hear  I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s being done on purpose.  Collusion with nvidia.  The government needs to force them to spin off ATI. Do you consider the RTX 5070\/5070Ti to be \"weak GPUs\"?    The 9070 and 9070XT are looking to target those NVIDIA cards for the price\/performance.   If you only compare to the RTX 5090 which costs $2100+ even if not being sold by scalpers, then sure, AMD isn't even trying to sell at that price point. How can a company that just took the server market from Intel--do so badly at making GPU's and drivers. Because a CPU is not a GPU?  A Ryzen doesn't have drivers.  It's hardware.  And far different tech than GPUs. GPU prices are still hilariously overpriced, and AMD has failed to compete with NVDA on the high end for a decade.  At this point I have to assume it\u2019s collusion.  AMD agrees not to impede on nvda\u2019s GPU profits, nvda doesn\u2019t encroach on AMD by developing high ARM chips. AMD should spin off ATI so we can get a true GPU competitor again. What makes you think cards with 16GB of VRAM and need more layers to the BCB, need larger coolers than the old cards, and have more features are overpriced?   The price of EVERYTHING is higher today than in 2017, so, $550 for a video card today vs. a Geforce 1080 or Vega 64(which was $600 at launch), and you are complaining about things being overpriced? The 1080 retailed for $599 at launch.  It\u2019s not appreciably smaller than the 4080 which retailed at $1200.  The price of all other electronics, including CPUS, has barely budged in that time span. \u201cMore features\u201d? You stupid fanboy, what do you think happens as technology marches on? Here here.  Despite over 20 years of promises, AMD drivers have always been awful.  I remember the huge Catalyst rebranding campaign that went nowhere. nVidia's drivers are rock solid, especially so for legacy applications. There may be more comments in this discussion.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"More Americans filed unemployment claims last week, but the labor market remains healthy and layoffs relatively low More Americans filed unemployment claims last week, but the labor market remains healthy and there are still relatively few layoffs. U.S. applications for jobless benefits rose by 11,000 to 219,000 for the week ending February 1, the Labor Department said Thursday. Analysts were projecting only 213,000 new applications. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered representative of layoffs. The four-week average, which evens out some of the weekly volatility, rose by 4,000 to 216,750. While the labor market did start to show some minor signs of weakness last year, jobs remain plentiful and layoffs historically low. Last month, the Labor Department reported that job growth in December surged and unemployment fell. Employers added 256,000 jobs in the final month of 2024 and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%. The final jobs report of 2024 showed that the economy and hiring were able to grow at a solid pace even with interest rates much higher than they were before the pandemic. The Labor Department will released January employment figures early Friday. Economists surveyed by FactSet believe that U.S. employers added 170,000 jobs in the first month of 2025, weaker than December but also still healthy.  As expected last week, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate alone after issuing three cuts late in 2024. Fed officials are keeping their eyes on inflation and the labor market for signs of a potentially weakening economy. They expect only two rate cuts this year, down from previous projections of four. Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, a host of companies have announced job cuts already this year. Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025. Late in 2024, GM, Boeing, Cargill and Stellantis announced layoffs. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of January 25 climbed to 1.89 million, an increase of 36,000 from the previous week. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executives are so in on AI wearables, the company plans to unleash six new mixed reality devices this year, according to a leaked memo. The tech industry is still grappling with the massive flop of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmetaverse\u201d; even as the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineers and execs attempt to sell us on the benefits of AI chatbots on your face, Meta can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get over its last missteps with Horizon Worlds. Silicon Valley normally works in waves, and judging by the recent annual Consumer Electronics Show, the tide is dragging us all toward a deep, black ocean of AI wearables. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg already promised investors the moon and more, saying the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to ship hundreds of millions and \u00e2\u0080\u009ceventually\u00e2\u0080\u009d sell \u00e2\u0080\u009cbillions\u00e2\u0080\u009d of AI glasses. On Thursday, Business Insider shared a leaked memo from Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Reality Labs head Andrew \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoz\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bosworth titled \u00e2\u0080\u009c2025: The Year of Greatness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In it, Bosworth claims the company is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpushing our advantage by launching half a dozen more AI powered wearables.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The memo was sent to staff in November, so plans could have changed in the meantime. Six new AI wearables in a single year would smash Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardware record for any other year. In 2024, the company launched its revamped Ray-Ban Meta glasses and the Meta Quest 3S. Zuckerberg teased \u00e2\u0080\u009cthird-generation\u00e2\u0080\u009d smart glasses technology during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. Recent reports from Bloomberg have hinted Meta is now working on a pair of sports-centric Oakley-styled AR glasses for athletes. These reports further hint the company is developing glasses with a heads-up display, internally dubbed Hypernova. The other products could simply be different glasses styles, much like the Ray-Ban smart glasses that come in \u00e2\u0080\u009cWayfarer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSkyler,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeadliner\u00e2\u0080\u009d varieties. The more expensive $370 versions include transition lenses. However, Boz further mentioned \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR [AKA mixed reality].\u00e2\u0080\u009d This hints that Meta wants to drop more products with displays, akin to Project Orion true AR glasses the company showed off at Meta Connect last year. What this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suggest is any new VR helmet in the works. Bloomberg previously reported Meta is working on two new Quest headsets, one of which might be a sequel to the short-lived Quest Pro. Either way, the glasses seem more of a shoo-in for 2025. These plans for \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreatness\u00e2\u0080\u009d also include Horizon Worlds, Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first attempt at a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmetaverse\u00e2\u0080\u009d living world that was so dull it made the 2003 game Second Life seem like a roller coaster thrill ride by comparison. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHorizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bosworth continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel the weight of history on you then you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying attention. This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The memo is full of hyperbole and corporate speech so thick Weird Al Yankovich could use it to conceive a sequel to his parody jingle Mission Statement. Nowhere does Bosworth even mention the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cmetaverse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is interesting considering the entire company was named after that previous attempt to become \u201cvisionaries\u201d in tech. The weight of history crushed those designs on a shared VR universe, mostly because nobody wants to spend more than an hour or two strapped into a VR device. Smart glasses make much more sense from a usability standpoint, though we have yet to see a pair that makes good on the promise of wearable computers. Apple was reportedly working on a similar pair of mixed-reality spectacles, though the latest hints from reliable sources suggest the company killed off its planned AR glasses. The company was reportedly stumped by the need for processing power and battery life. Considering Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missteps, Meta needs to prove it can do more than offer an AI chatbot for your face.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  The idea that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are more concerned with wealth preservation than alpha generation \u2014 gains above the board market \u2014 isn't necessarily true.          One of the hardest parts of Ahmed Husain's role is working to meet the diverse needs of his clients. As the global head of family offices at Neuberger Berman, he works with over 1,000 single-family offices globally that manage a minimum of $1 billion, about the top 0.01% of wealth holders.               Their risk appetite is diverse, Husain said: first-generation wealth creators who made their money, or second-generation wealth creators who have inherited an operating business, have a bigger risk tolerance, which likely comes from having a continued income stream. But those from third or fourth-generation wealth who have not earned it or are responsible for multiple heirs \u2014 something common among European family offices \u2014 are more concerned with preserving what they have.               But like the broad market, they, too, have ridden the ebbs and flows of public markets. A typical family office's performance has matched or trailed the S&P 500, being generally down by 10% to 15% in 2022, slightly recovering with an 8% to 12% return in 2023, and finally seeing good gains in 2024, with the typical European family office up about 13% to 15% and US family office up by about 15% to 17%, Husain said.               It's generally because of their heavy exposure to the broad US market.               Whether the client is in the US or Asia, 80 to 90% of their book wealth is in US public equities or US private markets, Husain noted. It sounds concentrated, but many started with less exposure, near 40% to 50% and over the past decade or so, US outperformance has increased that exposure heavily. It's why everything from US inflation to Washington's policies concerns them.               \"I am surprised,\" Husain said of the number of clients, some of which have upward of $30 to $50 billion in wealth that have, say, $12 billion just sitting in the Samp;P 500.               Not only has the index giant's performance been stellar, especially over the last two years, racking in gains above 20%, but US markets are transparent, built on a strong and stable currency, with leading companies run by high-performing CEOs with the best pay packages who find ways to squeeze margin, he said. All of that has been a strong attractor for wealth from every corner of the globe.               The trend toward indexing and away from active investing isn't new, but it wasn't as expected for family offices that lean into customized investing strategies. However, ultra-high-net-worth individuals have been firing their active managers because it's just been hard to beat the S&P 500, he said.               So now, at the beginning of 2025, they're finding themselves super long the US dollar and US assets, and for risk purposes, there's a strong sense that they should be diversified. But clients had the same concern in 2022 and 2023, leading them to diversify in foreign markets like China, Japan, and Europe, which didn't really work out either, he added.               Going into 2025, questions about the big risks and opportunities in US equities have dominated the conversation across offices as they seek ways to balance exposure.               \"Some clients are like, 'Look, we are limited. We're a family office, we don't have thousands of people,\" Husain said. So they either throw their human resources toward private markets or, if they decide to have active managers, they become very selective, seeking contrarian managers who oversee the Japanese and European markets or who can find alpha\u2014above market returns\u2014 in US small caps, he said.               The US small-cap market is full of stocks that can outperform. But not if you go into it passively through the Russell 2000, which is poorly made, merging thousands of low-quality companies with weak earnings and balance sheets, Husain said. In this instance, family offices are willing to hire a small manager with $500 million to $3 billion of AUM, who can be very selective.               Obviously, these companies are likely to be more volatile, but the bullish view family offices have on US growth under President Donald Trump suggests that small local companies may do well.               \"Once you start going off index, and you're owning companies that are not going to get the momentum flow of just passive money, everything comes down to really deep fundamental analysis,\" Husain said. In other words, things like a firm's three-year business plan, execution success, and inflection points really matter.               As for developed markets, valuations are just too attractive. Even as European growth stalls, Husain says some of the hottest stocks can be found there. Names like Rheinmetall, a German manufacturer of weapons, ammunition, and armored vehicles, up about 124% over the past year, or Italian radar and aerospace defense maker Leonardo, up 78% over the past year, have outperformed or done just as well as Nvidia over the same period.               The German Dax Performance index (DAX), which includes 40 major German blue-chip companies, is already outperforming the S&P 500. It is up almost 8% this year compared to the S&P 500's 3%. It was up almost 28% over the last 12 months compared to the S&P 500's 22%.               This means there are definite pockets of outperformance. Husain said family offices will look for an active manager in those strong foreign markets to find winning bets, especially in the face of trade wars, which can create opportunistic momentum.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Dexter Zhuang achieved what's known as \"Coast FIRE\" \u2014 an offshoot of the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement that means he no longer has to add to his retirement savings \u2014 with a simple, two-pronged approach: increasing income and reducing expenses. He negotiated raises throughout his tech career and experimented with a variety of side hustles. As for the reducing expenses component, \"geo-arbitrage\" helped. This strategy, which became increasingly popular during the pandemic when remote work allowed employees to essentially work from anywhere, involves earning an income from a higher-payer country while living in a lower-cost country. Zhuang, 33, started his career in San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the US, where he worked as a product manager for Dropbox and growth-stage startups. He quit in 2019 to travel the world and experiment with the digital nomad lifestyle. It was his first taste of geo-arbitrage \u2014 he was doing remote consulting, charging the hourly rate he earned from his employer in the States while living in less expensive places throughout Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In 2020, he moved to Singapore to work at a regional fintech startup. He explained that, while he was earning a lower salary in Singapore than he would have earned for a comparable role in the States, he ended up being net positive due to a lower cost of living and lower taxes. In San Francisco in 2018, \"my average expenses were about $6,422 per month,\" he told Business Insider. \"Fast-forward to Singapore in 2022, my total monthly expenses were $4,945, on average, in terms of the USD.\" These numbers don't take into account inflation, he noted: \"If you adjusted for inflation, the San Francisco expenses would be even higher.\" As for taxes, \"that was also lower for me in Singapore than in San Francisco, in terms of my effective tax rate.\" Even though he was earning a smaller base salary, the cost-of-living difference allowed him to save and invest more of his total income and, ultimately, hit his Coast FIRE number sooner than he would have if he were still living in the Bay Area. Zhuang prefers not to share his exact net worth, but BI confirmed that he has accumulated six figures by looking at screenshots of his savings and investment accounts. As of 2025, his cost of living is even lower. He and his wife moved to Mexico City in 2024, and their average monthly expenses are about $3,500, he said. His income is also less \u2014 he left the Singapore startup in 2023 after growing his side hustles to the point where they were bringing in full-time income \u2014 but has more flexibility and feels less pressure to earn a certain amount now that he can coast into retirement with his current portfolio. There are a variety of geo-arbitrage strategies anyone with flexible work can use to save more, said Zhuang. He relocated from a higher-cost-of-living country to a lower-cost-of-living country but pointed out that it's possible to relocate domestically \u2014 either to a less expensive city or even a more affordable neighborhood within your same city. \"It's good for most people, especially families with kids, who would find a global move to be disruptive,\" Zhuang wrote in his newsletter Money Abroad. Another option is working remotely for a global employer that offers competitive salaries regardless of an employee's location. \"As a hiring manager in the Asia tech industry, I saw wildly different salary ranges for people who were hired in Singapore (mature market) vs places like Indonesia (emerging market),\" he wrote, adding: \"To plug the gap, I've seen high-performing tech workers successfully petition their global companies to benchmark their salary based on the more competitive market (e.g. instead of benchmarking to Malaysia, use Singapore).\" Keep in mind that \"the global tech talent market is still inefficient. If you're a top performer in an emerging market, look for companies that do benchmark their salaries globally.\" Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"DeepSeek sparked a global tech stock sell-off that cost Nvidia $600 billion in market value. But JPMorgan (JPM) Chase says the AI chipmaker is bound to benefit from the Chinese startup.  The Hangzhou-based artificial intelligence startup sent shockwaves through both Silicon Valley and Wall Street last month after raising questions about Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. But despite the AI-driven stock rally losing $1 trillion in value, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research analysts said in a new report that DeepSeek will likely have a positive impact on companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet, as well as chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA). The Chinese startup launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models in January that performed on par with similar models from OpenAI and Anthropic, while its open-source DeepSeek-V3 model released in December also performed competitively with AI models from the U.S.-based companies \u2014 for far less money and less advanced chips. According to the V3 technical paper, the model cost $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. firms, meanwhile, are spending billions on tens of thousands of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 chips, which are not allowed to be sold to China under U.S. export controls. DeepSeek\u2019s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to \u201cstrong demand\u201d for higher performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, JPMorgan analysts said Wednesday. \u201cTherefore, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in advanced AI chips \u201cshould enable them to unlock new use-cases.\u201d Other chip firms such as Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell (MRVL), and Micron (MU) are also likely to benefit from DeepSeek, according to JPMorgan. Chip pioneer Intel (INTC), however, stands to lose out from DeepSeek, analysts said, because demand for its central processing units, or CPUs, will decrease as amid the shift to accelerated computing. JPMorgan analysts also said they \u201cbelieve the broader Internet ecosystem should benefit\u201d following the open-source AI model advancements demonstrated by DeepSeek and China\u2019s Alibaba (BABA). The improved cost efficiency \u201cshould accelerate\u201d AI development and adoption, leading to more consumption, the analysts said, adding that they \u201cexpect heavy capital expenditures investment\u201d by Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta to continue in the medium term. Meta is expected to benefit from increased open-source model adoption as it builds its next-generation open-source Llama 4 model, JPMorgan said. During the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough shows the need for a global open-source standard led by the U.S.  Amazon, which introduced DeepSeek-R1 in its cloud platforms, will likely benefit from providing more open-source AI model options, analysts said, because it will increase AI demand and usage, driving monetization.  Meanwhile Alphabet is also likely to benefit from the lower training and inferencing costs demonstrated by DeepSeek, JPMorgan said, because it will be able to accelerate development and adoption of AI agents, as well as other AI applications such as Google\u2019s NotebookLM and Gemini Advanced with Deep Research.  Google on Wednesday made its \u201cmost capable\u201d AI model, Gemini 2.0, available to everyone. At its unveiling in December, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said Gemini 2.0 \u201cwill enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  Pressure has steadily been building on Russia's economy in the three years since it invaded Ukraine in 2022, but things could continue to get worse for Moscow even after the war stops, a think said this week.           According to the Center of European Policy Action, a public policy research group based in Washington, DC, the economic outlook in Russia could darken further once the Ukraine war comes to an end. That's partly because Russia has become \"addicted\" to military spending to prop up its economy, and partly because Moscow is weighed down by a range of economic issues that could take a while to resolve even after the fighting is over, the center said in a new report.               \"Even without any ongoing fighting military spending would need to remain high,\" Alexander Kolyandr, a senior fellow at CEPA, said.               According to Russia's latest federal budget, the country will spend a record 13.5 trillion rubles on its military in 2025, up from around 10.8 trillion rubles last year. Economists have said that stimulus is largely responsible for Russia's recent economic growth, with GDP rising around 4% last year.               But other indicators of Russia's long-term prospects look weaker.               Russia's labor market is slammed with a severe shortage of workers, thanks partly to the exodus of Russians who fled the country when Russia first began its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The nation was short around five million workers in 2023, according to estimates from the Russian Academy of Science's Institute of Economics.               \"The labor market dislocation will remain unless Russia faces a severe contraction. A combination of the demographic trough, brain drain, and high demand from the defense industry and the army will pressure the market, forcing the Kremlin to choose between importing foreign workers at the risk of social discontent and a constant labor shortage,\" Kolyandr said.               The flight of Russia's most educated workers has also caused Russia to fall behind in the tech space, another issue that economists have said could impact Moscow's long-term growth.               Patent filings fell 13% in Russia in 2022, while patent filings from foreign applicants dropped 30%, according to data from the Russian Patent Office.               \"Russia remains technologically backward and dependent on high-tech imports,\" Kolyandr added. \"The 2025 budget, which sacrifices spending on science, education, and health in favor of defense, illustrates the problem.\"               Russia is also under continued pressure from Western sanctions, which have restricted the nation's access to financing and crimped revenues from some of its most important exports, like oil and gas.               Russia's total energy revenues plunged by nearly a quarter in 2023. The Kremlin, meanwhile, expects oil and gas revenue to keep shrinking until 2027, according to a draft budget viewed by Bloomberg.               \"It would not be accurate to say that the sanctions did not work. While they have failed to prevent Russia's aggression and to change Russia's political course since 2022, they have helped to distort the country's growth, possibly planting the seed for another 1980s Soviet-style crisis,\" Kolyandr added.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"     The competition over generative AI search is heating up.    OpenAI introduced ChatGPT search in the fall, but now anyone can give it a try. ChatGPT just got a lot more like Google. Parent company OpenAI announced that its ChatGPT Search feature, which acts like a search engine, is now available for logged-out users for the first time. Similar to the logged-in experience, ChatGPT can now search the internet and provide links to relevant web sources. People can use natural language to ask for up-to-date sports scores, news, stock quotes and other information.\u00a0 Read more: Generative AI: What You Need to Know About the Tech Behind ChatGPT Users typing in questions can choose to press the web search icon located below the question bar. It will then display a series of links at the bottom from trusted sources. As with any use of AI, users should be aware of potential factual errors, as AI chatbots are known for hallucinations, or presenting false information as true. The provided links can assist with fact-checking. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman retweeted the news on Thursday, adding: \"Make search great again.\" In October, the company rolled out ChatGPT search to ChatGPT Plus and Team users, as well as SearchGPT waitlist users, and expanded in December to logged-in users. The change is part of a greater effort to provide ChatGPT with more useful answers. It also comes as OpenAI continues to ramp up its efforts to be more ubiquitous. Last month, OpenAI introduced a new AI agent called Operator, designed to make everyday tasks easier, from making dinner reservations and ordering groceries to filling out forms. OpenAI and ChatGPT also face increased competition, not only from US players such as Google and Anthropic but from Chinese startup DeepSeek.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Washington, DC, office market had been showing signs of recovery from the one-two punch of a decade-long contraction by the federal government and the aftershocks of the pandemic.          Now, the Trump administration's plans to cull the federal workforce and slash government spending have cast uncertainty over that rebound.               The orders could further slim down a federal office portfolio that has already been reduced by millions of square feet in recent years, sapping a major area of demand for the region's office market.               The administration's efforts to halt hundreds of billions of dollars of federal spending, and dismantle the US Agency for International Development, meanwhile, is also likely to have far reaching consequences. The actions, which have and could continue to face legal challenges, would take away or sharply diminish funding for a universe of programs, non-profit groups, and government contractors that, in turn, could impact their ability to lease space.               \"It's going to have a huge impact on the market and not a good one, it's just going to be ugly,\" said John Boland, a Washington, DC-based vice chairman at the real estate services firm Newmark. \"I'm glad I'm 67 years old and my career is coming to an end.\"               Boland said that he personally supported the Trump administration's cost cutting, but also acknowledged the way it's \"really spooking people in the marketplace.\"               He said that nonprofit groups have told him they may need \"a third of the space or maybe nothing at all\" if they lose government support.               The Washington, DC, office market is coming off of an upswing. Eight million square feet of space was leased in 2024, the highest total in three years, according to the real estate services and brokerage company CBRE. Vacancy declined slightly, to 22.5% in the fourth quarter.               Government leasing was the largest driver of activity, and nonprofits were the third largest behind law firms, according to CBRE.               For decades, the federal government grew steadily in the capital region, topping at roughly 57.5 million square feet in 2011, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Since then, efforts under both Republican and Democratic administrations have been ongoing for years to reduce that space.               \"What we have seen over the last 15 years is a shedding of real estate on the part of the federal government,\" said Darian LeBlanc, an executive vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield who manages its government services group. LeBlanc said that the federal portfolio is now around 43.5 million square feet in size in the DC region \u2014 a 24% reduction from the peak.               Many federal workers embraced remote and hybrid work during the pandemic and have continued to work remotely. LeBlanc said that currently, an average of about only 20% of workers were in the office on any given day across most federal agencies. The new administration has roiled federal office employees by ordering them to return to the office full time while offering those who resign payment through September.               \"You are most welcome to stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination,\" a frequently asked questions page on the US Office of Personnel Management stated, describing the deferred resignation offer.               President Donald Trump has said he will seek to tear up labor agreements recently struck between labor unions that represent the federal workforce and the Biden administration. Some of those unions have negotiated employment agreements that permit employees to work remotely.               Unions have reacted angrily to the Trump administration's efforts, including the paid resignation offer.               \"This maneuver is intended to panic civil servants into accepting what seems like a sweet deal but is probably a scam,\" Randy Erwin, the president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, a union that represents 110,000 government workers, said in a statement.               However sweeping Trump's efforts to change the federal government's workforce and office portfolio may be, experts say the impacts will take years to be felt.               \"It's important to keep in mind the federal government never does anything rapidly,\" LeBlanc said. \"They never have, and I don't think it's reasonable to think that this is something they will act immediately upon.\"               Nonprofits, however, which depend heavily on federal financial support could be more quickly affected.               There are more than 29,000 nonprofits that spend $100,000 a year or more on their office occupancy and receive government assistance, according to Open Impact Real Estate, a real estate services and advisory firm that specializes in nonprofit work. A third of them rely on federal dollars for the majority of their budgets, the company said.               The drastic cuts being pursued by the new administration \"would be catastrophic\" to the nonprofit world, Stephen Powers, a cofounder of Open Impact, said. He noted that the impact would be disproportionately felt in Washington, DC, and New York City, where the nonprofit sector is clustered.               \"Clients of mine are not signing leases,\" Powers said.               Nonprofit groups occupy about 7% of the total office space in the Washington, DC, metropolitan region, and 12% in the city itself.               Not everyone is as gloomy.               Hilary Goldfarb, a senior managing director at the development company Rockefeller Group who leads its Washington, DC, operations, pointed to a flurry of law firm and lobbying leasing in the city that she believes will be robust.               Law firms, which often have in-house lobbying operations in the region, accounted for 20% of the office space taken in the city last year, according to CBRE, making it the second-biggest tenant group by leasing activity level.               Rockefeller Group is in the process of building a roughly 400,000-square-foot office building at 600 Fifth St., with a completion scheduled for the summer of 2026. It preleased about half of the project's space to the law firm Crowell & Moring in 2023 and is marketing the remainder.               \"My view is one of optimism, not uncertainty or lack of clarity,\" Goldfarb said.               And there are some who feel that the government's desire for efficiency will drive federal agencies from antiquated state-owned facilities into privately owned, higher-quality office buildings, giving lift to the overall market.               The largest lease in the capital in 2024, for instance, was a roughly 280,000-square-foot deal by the United States Agency for Global Media, a federal agency that oversees the state-owned broadcasting network Voice of America and provides funding for others, such as Radio Free Europe.               The agency took its space at 1875 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, an office property that was built by developer EastBanc in 2006. The new location allowed USAGM to downsize a previous office in a government-owned space that had spanned roughly 1 million square feet, according to Anthony Lanier, the president and CEO of EastBanc.               \"Get people back into the office, improve the quality, dump bad space,\" Lanier said. \"Don't sit around in obsolete buildings.\"               Asked if he could have gotten the same deal done with the Trump administration, Lanier said: \"all I can say is that this transaction would fit the tenor that we are seeing\" from the new administration.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Over 10% of laptops over $800 that sold in December 2024 ran on a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Snapdragon-powered PCs had a strange 2024. Many of the laptops received positive reviews, but overall sales did not meet expectations. It appears the market shifted in December, however, as highlighted by Qualcomm during its most recent earnings call. This week, the company shared a few pieces of information that indicate Snapdragon-powered PCs are gaining popularity. Specifically, Copilot+ PCs with Snapdragon X chips inside sold well in the $800+ market. \"While we are still in the early phase of the transition to Copilot+ PCs, we are pleased with consumer reception for our Snapdragon X Series, which has exceeded our expectations,\" said Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. \"According to Circana, in December, Snapdragon X Series had more than 10% share of the greater than $800 Windows laptops in U.S. retail.\" That stat has some specific caveats, such as only covering laptops rather than all PCs. It also is limited to sales in the United States. That 10% only applying to laptops over $800 also narrows the scope, but that price point is rather interesting. PCs with Snapdragon X processors offer better value than many devices that run on Intel or AMD chips. At first glance, that would suggest Snapdragon PCs would do better in the budget space than the mid-tier or premium segments, but Qualcomm hasn't targeted that price range yet. That will come with the Snapdragon X that aims to shake up the $600 laptop market. Laptops with a Snapdragon X Elite or Snapdragon X Plus fall into higher price tiers but rate well in terms of performance and value. The best Windows laptop on the market right now is the Surface Laptop 7, which runs on a Snapdragon processor and starts at $999.99. The best laptop from CES 2025, the ASUS Zenbook A14, also runs on a Snapdragon X processor. That device will have an $899 version available later in March and the $1,099.99 model is available now. It appears Qualcomm saw some victories to wrap up 2024, and it will be interesting to see if the trend continues in 2025.  Qualcomm only launched its Snapdragon X chips last year. As the company indicated in its recent earnings call, Copilot+ PCs are still in their infancy. But things did not start out well for Snapdragon X chips and Copilot+ PCs. Only 720,000 PCs with Qualcomm processors sold in Q3 24. That led to just a 0.8% share of sales in that quarter. At the time, Qualcomm chips were said to only power 1.5% of all Windows PCs. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The figures shared by Qualcomm do not cover the same exact categories as the stats we saw for Q3 24, but it appears that the company's PC efforts are trending in a positive direction. Qualcomm also highlighted improvements for the app compatibility for Snapdragon-powered PCs. \"The broader app ecosystem continues to expand, with Snapdragon-native apps now including 20 of the most popular VPNs, 50 of the most popular security and cloud storage apps as well as new applications for creators,\" said the company. With the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus hitting their stride and the Snapdragon X on the way, there will be a much larger selection of laptops with Qualcomm chips in 2025 than in previous years. \"We have now over 80 design wins launched or in development across the X series, and we're targeting commercialization of more than 100 devices,\" said the company during its earnings call.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":" Although foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold line and Huawei\u2019s bold tri-fold Mate XT Ultimate have the lion\u2019s share of this niche market, there was a time when Microsoft had a very different definition of what a foldable device could be. It was a vision that was years in the making but, unfortunately, only had four years to exist in people\u2019s hands. The Surface Duo presented a dual-screen experience that spoke to the hearts of the Microsoft Courier concept, but now it is just a footnote in tech history. But what if Microsoft remained stubbornly optimistic and held on to that dream far longer? What if Microsoft actually turned the Surface Duo into a portable productivity powerhouse that becomes the driving force in the hybrid work systems of the future? This concept design imagines a future that could have been for the Surface Duo, one that would have put Microsoft back on the map as the leading productivity platform in the market. Designer: Nicolas Schmitt       Unlike the foldable phones that we know today, the Surface Duo delivered a completely different experience that literally spanned two screens. It had its perks and trade-offs, appealing to a different class of users from the more multimedia-focused products that we have now. The first two generations definitely had some rough edges, but we can only imagine what the Surface Duo could have been had it been given more time to mature.         The Microsoft Workstation imagines one such alternate reality, one where Microsoft designed accessories that would have made the Surface Duo shine even brighter. These designs focused on the device\u2019s dual potential to be your only computer as well as an extension of your computer. Although the actual phones ran Android, it was also in the realm of possibility that Microsoft could have eventually put Windows on Arm on it in the future.    One accessory concept serves as a wireless charging dock for the Surface Duo, but it also has another purpose. When connected to an external monitor, for example, it could present a more traditional desktop experience, somewhat like Samsung\u2019s DeX platform today. The hub initially looks like a flat box, almost like a Mac mini even, but the top lid can be lifted at an angle to make it easier to view the Surface Duo\u2019s screen.    A bit more interesting is the idea of turning the Surface Duo into a portable second screen for Surface laptops and tablets. A simple-looking stand can magnetically latch onto the side of a Surface Pro screen, having the Surface Duo hanging from a more ergonomic height. While the Surface Duo will never realize its full potential, these accessory design concepts could still be applied to future foldable phones, still making that hybrid work scenario a feasible future.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"If you\u2019ve got Type R dreams but decently equipped compact car money, you can\u2019t go wrong with the regular Honda Civic. The current eleventh generation of the Civic is probably the best the model has ever been, and with prices starting at $25,400, the Civic won\u2019t break the bank. What if a standard Civic isn\u2019t enough, and you must have a Type R? You\u2019re in luck, as last-gen FK8 Type Rs have finally started to show up on the used market for less than the price of a new base Civic.  FK8 values have been holding steady the last few years. Aside from outliers like the yellow limited edition Type R that was offered in \u201821, examples with lowish miles - figure under 30,000 or less - are still priced in the high $30,000 to the low to mid $40,000 range. If you\u2019re willing to deal with older examples with higher miles, you can pick up an FK8 Type R for the price of a new Honda Civic. If you want an FK8 from this decade, you can find a 2021 or 2022 that\u2019s decently priced. Newer, lower mileage FK8s are going for loaded Civic Hybrid Hatchback money, which starts at $34,300 before options. This example for sale in Springfield, New Jersey (one of four FK8s the dealer has in stock) is a 2021 with 35,826 miles, and the dealer is asking $34,885. That\u2019s still $12,160 cheaper than a brand new FL5-gen Type R. There is one downside to these newly affordable Type Rs: There aren\u2019t many of them. Using the aforementioned car buying sites, I\u2019d estimate there\u2019s 60 to 70 FK8s priced like this across the country as of this writing, a veritable handful. Still, if you\u2019re in the market for a cheap-ish hot hatch, it might not hurt to take a leap on a used FK8 Type R.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"     The newest Zenfone borrows cool features from the Asus ROG gaming phone line like fast charging and wired headphone support -- but it's not coming to the US.    Asus on Thursday revealed the Zenfone 12 Ultra, which inherits several cool features from the Asus ROG Phone 9 gaming phone series and retools them for a more mainstream audience. Like last year's Zenfone 11 Ultra, this means that the\u00a0phone\u00a0has a 6.78-inch display, fast 65-watt wired charging and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. But in other ways, Asus scaled the Zenfone 12 Ultra from its gaming phone sibling by supporting a (still very smooth) 144Hz refresh rate (the ROG Phone 9's is185Hz) and a smaller 5,500 mAh battery compared to the ROG's 5,800 mAh. The phone will come in three colors: ebony black, sakura white and sage green. The Zenfone 12 Ultra has a bunch of new AI features, several of which Asus is billing as exclusive to the new phone at launch. These include updated editions of the AI Call Translator, a transcription app and portrait video. The updated call translator adds support for third-party chat apps like WhatsApp, which should provide more flexibility beyond just standard phone calls. There are also new AI article and document summary features, along with photo editing features for unblurring a photo or erasing an unwanted object or person in the background. Many of these match similar AI features that we regularly see on Google's Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra will also receive Google's Circle to Search. The Zenfone 12 Ultra's headphone jack continues to set it apart as one of the few flagship phones from any company to support wired headphones without an adapter. For video recording, Asus is also updating its 6-Axis Hybrid Gimbal Stabilizer for smoothing out shaky cam while taking video -- a feature that comes in handy when I've tested prior Asus phones in bumpy vehicles. Pricing for the new Zenfone 12 Ultra wasn't immediately available, and this year Asus is omitting the US from the phone's international release. I'm bummed by this, as last year's Zenfone offered many of the media-focused benefits of the ROG gaming phones. This includes the big screen, powerful processor, the gimbal stabilizer for video recording and that headphone jack -- while providing a degree of restraint by offering those features at a slightly lower price than Asus's gaming phones. But Asus has always faced an uphill struggle when it comes to the US market, where the audience for Android phones is dominated by Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.

The company released Screw Jam, developed by Rollic Games, on mobile on Dec. 8, 2023 and has since been downloaded more than one million times on the Google Play store; AppMagic estimates it\u2019s brought in more than $20 million in revenue across platforms. The alleged copycat game is Screw Pin Jam Puzzle, which was released in April 2024 on iOS and in May 2024 on Android. Zynga is arguing that AdOne, with its copycat game, did not just create \u201cthe basic concept of a casual screw puzzle game,\u201d of which there are plenty on the mobile market, but instead designed Screw Pin Jam Puzzle to look and feel like Screw Jam. Across the lawsuit, Zynga\u2019s lawyers lay out the similarities: They use an allegedly identical tool box icon on the top of the screen, similar pastel colors, and allegedly copied the user interface and game progression. The confusion between the two games, according to Zynga, is harming the company: Screw Jam is a free game and it needs players to purchase stuff in-app; they can\u2019t if they\u2019re moving on to an identical game. Though Screw Jam has financially overshadowed Screw Pin Jam Puzzle, it appears that the alleged knockoff is the more popular app on the Google Play store: It has 10 million downloads for Screw Jam\u2019s one million. Zynga wants the court to force AdOne to take the game down and, of course, award financial compensation. Crucially, Zynga did not invent the genre or game type, which has players unscrewing bolts to solve puzzles \u2014 it\u2019s a growing genre in its own right. Beyond just screw puzzles, this sort of thing happens a lot on mobile game stores. One developer will stumble on a massive, viral hit game and others will rush to flood the market with copycats. Due to the simple nature of some of these hyper casual games, copycats are relatively quick to reproduce. Rollic Games was named in a 2020 lawsuit for copying another studio\u2019s wood-carving simulator. Rollic lost that lawsuit, forcing the company to pay a fine and remove the app from sale in France. Earlier, in 2018, Voodoo itself was accused by Donut County creator Ben Esposito of copying his then-upcoming game Donut County. Polygon has reached out to Zynga and AdOne for comment.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Not every game can be a megahit. That shouldn\u2019t spell doom If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. by  Maddy Myers If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. This is not the first time I\u2019ve written about a video game that appears to have been sent out to die, and I predict it will not be the last. The latest victim of the business is Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which, of course, was one of the subjects of Electronic Arts\u2019 third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday with CEO Andrew Wilson. Dragon Age: The Veilguard garnered 1.5 million players in its first two months after release, according to EA \u2014 half of what company higher-ups expected in that window (or perhaps the better word is needed, based on the game\u2019s budget). In addition to being available to purchase outright, Veilguard was also available via a $16.99\/month subscription to EA Play Pro, and that 1.5 million would include those players, so the exact number of units sold is not known. \u201cIn order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demands of players, who increasingly seek shared-world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category,\u201d Wilson said on the call. \u201cDragon Age had a high-quality launch and was well reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.\u201d Many have zeroed in on the \u201cshared-world features\u201d part of this quote, with some suggesting that Wilson is blaming Veilguard\u2019s failure to hit sales targets on its lack of live-service elements. \u201cShared-world elements\u201d would have been out of place in Veilguard, to be sure. But the part I\u2019m fixated on is that last part, when Wilson said that Veilguard \u201cdid not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that 2024 was a huge year for RPGs. And all of those RPGs had the arguable misfortune of following in the footsteps of the unexpected juggernaut that was Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, which sold 2.5 million copies after entering early access in 2020; since fully launching in 2023, it has sold 15 million copies and is still in Steam\u2019s top 20 most-played games. Andrew Wilson will hear no argument from me about the \u201chighly competitive market\u201d for RPGs. That would have been a steep uphill climb for the developers of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. But the Veilguard team had already been climbing uphill for years before the game hit the market. It faced multiple redesigns, several high-profile departures, and staff layoffs over the course of its 10-year development. The mere fact that this game took a decade to make would likely have caused its costs to be far more significant than those of the other RPGs with which it was competing for players\u2019 attention in 2024. To quote Bloomberg reporter (and my friend) Jason Schreier in his recent article about skyrocketing video game costs: \u201cTo understand why video-game budgets have grown so rapidly, you have to understand where that money is actually going: paying people\u2019s salaries. [...] So if you have 300 employees and you\u2019re estimating $20,000 a month for each one (got to pay good wages to compete in 2025), you\u2019re spending $72 million a year.\u201d We don\u2019t know the exact salaries for all the employees who came and went over the course of Veilguard\u2019s development, but it seems fair to say that its budget likely ballooned during its long, tumultuous production. For further comparison: Metaphor: ReFantazio had a similarly long development cycle, having first been announced in 2016. Last October, publisher Sega announced that it had sold 1 million copies of the game. Not so different from Veilguard\u2019s numbers, except it wasn\u2019t considered a failure! Let\u2019s go to another example: the sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, about which Square Enix higher-ups have been tight-lipped. This was a sequel, so the comparison might not feel entirely fair, but it is from 2024, so it was definitely competing for players\u2019 attention alongside these other RPGs. Rebirth had a four-year development cycle and has been widely described as underperforming after early estimates placed it at 2 million copies sold. (FF7 Rebirth recently came to Windows PC via Steam and appears to be doing quite well there, but we\u2019re only talking about early sales numbers here.) Another 2024 RPG, Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, took five years to develop. This game was considered a huge success for Capcom, selling 2.5 million copies in its first 11 days post-release. The game eventually hit a milestone of 3.3 million in October 2024, but based on EA\u2019s metrics and expectations as shared in its earnings call, those early numbers are key. One more! Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth took three years to develop, and it sold 1 million units in its first week, according to a proud news release describing it as the \u201cfastest-selling title in the series.\u201d So why would Veilguard be considered a failure by comparison? In terms of player numbers, as our closest approximation of units sold, it\u2019s in the ballpark of what one might expect of the other RPGs released in the same time period at the $69.99 price point. The Metaphor: ReFantazio comparison seems particularly telling to me, especially given its eight-year development timeline. Again, we can\u2019t see under the hood in terms of how much those developers\u2019 salaries actually are costing. But we do know that Metaphor hasn\u2019t even managed to garner as many players as Veilguard up to this point, and when I Google the words \u201cAtlus layoffs,\u201d all I can find is this article from 2024 about how the studio raised its workers\u2019 salaries.  The Dragon Age series was, historically, successful enough to set high expectations for Veilguard \u2014 so let\u2019s consider those numbers. Dragon Age: Inquisition arrived in 2014 to a very different video game landscape with different costs. It did also go on to be the best-selling BioWare game of all time, eventually hitting 12 million units \u2014 a mega-blockbuster. EA never released the game\u2019s early sales figures, only describing its launch as \u201csuccessful.\u201d If we go further back, Dragon Age 2 sold 2 million units in its first two months post-release. All this to say, EA CEO Andrew Wilson and the rest of EA leadership didn\u2019t just expect Dragon Age: The Veilguard to sell on par with the inevitable competition, or even slightly above average. They expected it to be a huge, immediate hit \u2014 and they didn\u2019t just expect it, they budgeted for it. Even though the entire year of other comparable RPGs leading up to Veilguard proved the unlikelihood of this, those expectations didn\u2019t change. And then, unsurprisingly, Veilguard failed to meet them. And so, even though the game performed just as well as it ordinarily would have for the type of game that it is and the time period in which it was released, BioWare still got hit with post-release restructuring and layoffs (the team size is estimated to be just 100 people now) because Veilguard needed to be not just a success, but a massive success. And it needed to become that successful in a year that also had multiple other amazing RPG releases preceding it. And it needed to do that after having one of the most infamously tortured development cycles I\u2019ve heard about in my entire journalistic career. Maybe the game did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this \u201chighly competitive market.\u201d But highly competitive expectations seem like an undeniable factor, too.  Correction: EA\u2019s press release about its Q3 FY25 results states that Dragon Age: The Veilguard \u201cengaged approximately 1.5 million players during the quarter,\u201d but did not state how many units were sold. This article has been corrected to account for this distinction between units sold and player numbers.  The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"During Qualcomm\u2019s earnings webcast for the first quarter of 2025 (timestamp 22:49 if you\u2019re interested), President and CEO Cristiano Amon shared a very specific data point: \u201cWithin the sale of U.S. retail of Windows laptops above $800, [Qualcomm] had more than 10% share.\u201d In other words, out of all the Windows laptops priced above $800 and sold in the U.S. between October and December 2024, more than 10% were powered by Snapdragon X chips. The first thing you might notice here is that 10% is a much bigger number than the 0.8% market share Qualcomm was reported to have during the third quarter of 2024. The second thing you might notice, however, is just how many qualifiers this statement has. This data point isn\u2019t covering all PCs, all laptops, or even all Windows laptops \u2014 it\u2019s only covering Windows laptops over $800. It\u2019s also only talking about the U.S., and only taking into account consumer sales. All in all, it\u2019s very specific \u2014 and on the bright side, this makes it more likely to be true since without all those qualifiers, the 10% figure would seem utterly unbelievable. On the not-so-bright side, it also makes the statement a lot less impressive. It\u2019s fair to cut Qualcomm some slack, though \u2014 it\u2019s pretty new to the PC market, and its Snapdragon X chip got a lot of people talking. It helped Windows-on-Arm really start to take off, and gave Windows laptops a significant battery life boost compared to x86 devices. The company\u2019s goal to take 50% of the Windows PC market by 2029 might look a long way off right now, but a lot can happen in four years. Even as OpenAI continues clinging to its assertion that the only path to AGI lies through massive financial and energy expenditures, independent researchers are leveraging open-source technologies to match the performance of its most powerful models -- and do so at a fraction of the price. Last Friday, a unified team from Stanford University and the University of Washington announced that they had trained a math and coding-focused large language model that performs as well as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1 reasoning models. It cost just $50 in cloud compute credits to build. The team reportedly used an off-the-shelf base model, then distilled Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model into it. The process of distilling AIs involves pulling the relevant information to complete a specific task from a larger AI model and transferring it to a smaller one. Many SoCs are being prepared for upcoming 2025 devices, and a recent benchmark suggests that a MediaTek chipset could make Chromebooks as fast as they have ever been this year. Referencing the GeekBench benchmark, ChromeUnboxed discovered the latest scores of the MediaTek MT8196 chip, which has been reported on for some time now. With the chip being housed on the motherboard codenamed \u2018Navi,\u2019 the benchmark shows the chip excelling in single-core and multi-core benchmarks, as well as in GPU, NPU, and some other tests run. Google Chrome's Incognito mode and InPrivate just became even more private, as they no longer save copied text and media to the clipboard, according to Windows Latest. The changes apply to Windows 11 and 10 users and were rolled out in 2024. However, neither Microsoft nor Google documented it. Even though this change is not a recent feature, it's odd that neither tech giant thought it was worth mentioning. Previously, the default setting was that when a user saved text or images to the clipboard history, it was synced with Cloud Clipboard on Windows. Moreover, accessing this synced content was as simple as pressing the Windows and V keys, which poses a security risk, especially when using incognito mode.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"IBM was one of the earliest frontrunners in artificial intelligence. The company, known for designing some of the world\u2019s first personal computers, built the first AI to defeat a world champion at chess, in 1997, and then the first AI to win the quiz show Jeopardy, in 2011. In 2025, the AI frontier looks very different. The splashiest headlines often focus on AI models created by the likes of Google and OpenAI, which cost billions of dollars to train and can perform as generalists answering all kinds of questions. But IBM\u2019s approach is different. The company has zeroed in on building smaller AI tools with a focus on reliability, and on helping its clients apply them to specific use cases. IBM\u2019s strategy speaks to one side of a debate currently raging in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. Will the economic gains from AI mostly accrue to the few big companies investing billions in so-called \u201cfoundation models\u201d like OpenAI and Google? Or will they instead flow to the thousands of companies that use AI to make themselves more productive? Lately, the tide has appeared to be turning in IBM\u2019s direction. At the end of January, the release of a highly efficient open-source AI model by the Chinese lab DeepSeek led many Wall Street analysts to conclude that large U.S. tech companies might struggle to recoup their huge investments, since similar technology to theirs would be more cheaply available elsewhere. The same week, IBM announced its most recent earnings, which showed a 10% increase in its bespoke AI software sales, beating analysts\u2019 expectations. Its stock price jumped 12% on the news, reaching an all-time high and valuing the company at some $240 billion.\u00a0 To Arvind Krishna, the former leader of IBM's research division who has been CEO since 2020, the DeepSeek news felt like a validation of his strategy. \u201cSmaller models, with much less compute applied to train them, can be successful,\u201d he says in an interview with TIME. That, he suggests, might not be good news for the big tech companies at the forefront of the AI race. \u201cI think it's going to drive economic returns that are different\u2014because if you spend a hundredth of the cost of training [an AI model] and you can deploy it on a much smaller infrastructure, everybody has to be competitive,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I think it is going to put pressure on [their] economics.\u201d IBM, of course, isn\u2019t just an AI company. It runs a cloud computing service, designs all kinds of software, and runs a consulting business to help clients knit them all together. It\u2019s also a major investor in quantum computing research\u2014the quest to build an entirely different kind of computer, based on quantum principles, which could carry out some calculations billions of times faster than existing machines. Krishna is bullish that this research will soon yield even bigger breakthroughs, saying that before 2030 he expects \u201cwe will see something remarkable happen.\u201d If it does, Krishna is quick to add, much of the value will accrue not only to IBM but also to its clients. But he also says that such a breakthrough could help IBM return to a dominant position in the tech industry, similar to the one that it held for much of the late 20th century as the world\u2019s biggest PC manufacturer. \u201cAssuming the timeline and the [quantum] breakthroughs I'm talking about happen, I think that gives us a tremendous position and the first mover advantage in that market, to a point where I think that we would become the de-facto answer for those technologies,\u201d he says. \u201cMuch like we helped invent mainframes and the PC, maybe in quantum we'll occupy that same position.\u201dThis profile is published as a part of TIME\u2019s TIME100 Impact Awards initiative, which recognizes leaders from across the world who are driving change in their communities.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Swedish designer Jenny Nordberg has unveiled a collection of furniture at Stockholm Furniture Fair, made from used parts that are otherwise difficult to recycle. Nordberg worked on the project with Soeco, a Swedish company that refurbishes used office furniture for the second-hand market. The designer took parts that Soeco struggles to sell and transformed them into designs that include a conference table, a cabinet, modular seating and a linear pendant light. Nordberg is exhibiting the collection, The Executive, in \u00c4lvsj\u00f6 G\u00e5rd, the section of Stockholm Furniture Fair dedicated to limited-edition design and gallery pieces. However these designs are not just one-offs \u2013 Soeco is taking orders from customers, with plans to mass-produce some of the pieces. \"You can order everything and it's reasonable in price,\" Nordberg told Dezeen. The project suggests how recycling might play more of a role in furniture production in future. It was initiated by Sueco's recently appointed CEO, Mattias Andersson, who was interested in exploring how the 12-year-old company might evolve and adapt in changing times. Andersson gave Nordberg free rein to experiment, telling her she could work with anything the company had in its storage warehouses. The designer describes this warehouse as \"a library of possibilities\". \"I said to them, point to things you can't sell,\" she explained. A series of sound-absorbing partition walls provided the framework for upholstered seats in a mix of sizes, all based on the dimensions of the boards as found. \"The challenge here was to create furniture with minimal alterations to the partition walls, as they are difficult to cut,\" said Nordberg. The feet and cushions were also made from recycled material. The upholstery is the only new part, made from a \"naked\" vegetable-tanned leather. An undesirable jalousie cabinet was upgraded with a new paint finish and replacement doors made from plywood offcuts, featuring handles made from recycled aluminium profiles. Old tabletops were transformed into a conference table with a surprising colour finish, produced from filler marks and lacquer paint, and a series of oddly shaped coffee tables. \"I wanted to use the shapes that were there,\" said Nordberg. \"They had around 500 of these strangely shaped desktops and couldn't sell them.\" The collection includes a hanging light made from the curved beams from the frames of height-adjustable desks, along with pen holders from old whiteboards. There are also smaller designs, including a table lamp, a tray, vases and a wall-mounted sculpture. Once Stockholm Furniture Fair is over, all of the works on show will be used to furnish Andersson's office. This led to the project name, The Executive. Soeco is a subsidiary of Yllw, an interior design company owned by leading Stockholm retailer Nordiska Galleriet (NO GA), so it is well-positioned to have a wider impact on how manufacturers work with recycled parts. Nordberg, who is based in southern Sweden, produced all the pieces in collaboration with Soeco's workshop team in Dalby, near Lund.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 31: The Starbucks Coffee corporate logo is displayed on a sign at ... [+] their shop on January 31, 2025 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Kevin Carter\/Getty Images) [Note: Starbucks\u2019 fiscal year 2024 ended in September] Starbucks stock (NASDAQ: SBUX) has experienced a 21% increase in stock price year-to-date, reaching approximately $111 per share (Feb 4). Starbucks\u2019 first-quarter earnings marked a promising start under the leadership of CEO Brian Niccol, despite ongoing challenges in key metrics such as comparable sales and operating margins. The company\u2019s \u2019Back to Starbucks\u2019 strategy shows early promise, with growing loyalty program membership and fewer discount-driven sales. The company\u2019s stock has outperformed broader market indices, such as the S&P 500, which has grown 3% over the same period. In comparison, SBUX\u2019s peer McDonald\u2019s stock (NYSE: MCD) is flat so far this year. Although SBUX stock has experienced growth, we expect potential short-term declines due to significant challenges ahead, including increasing coffee prices and ongoing difficulties in the Chinese market. Separately, can the surge continue? See: Gold To Touch $3000 Under Trump 2.0? In the fiscal first quarter, Starbucks reported net sales of $9.4 billion, unchanged from the previous year. Net income attributable to the company declined to $780.8 million, or $0.69 per share, from $1.02 billion, or $0.90 per share, in the prior year. Furthermore, same-store sales decreased 4%, driven by a 6% decline in store traffic, marking the company\u2019s fourth consecutive quarter of same-store sales decline. In the U.S., same-store sales fell 4%, with an 8% decline in traffic. In China, the company\u2019s second-largest market, same-store sales decreased 6%, fueled by a 4% decline in average ticket size. Overall SBUX\u2019s Q1 results highlight the need for strategic adjustments, especially internationally, as operating expenses surged, compressing margins by 390 basis points to 11.9%, which is well below the ten-year average of 15.1%. Key cost drivers included investments in employee wages and promotional activities. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. The increase in SBUX stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -13% in 2022, -1% in 2023, and -2% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. We forecast Starbucks\u2019 Revenues to be $37.9 billion for the fiscal year 2025, up 5% y-o-y. Looking at the bottom line, we now forecast the earnings per share to come in at $3.05. Given the changes to our revenues and EPS forecast, we have revised our Starbucks\u2019 Valuation to $100 per share, based on a $3.05 expected EPS and a 32.9x P\/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025 - almost 8% lower than the current market price. It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. SBUX Peers shows how Starbucks\u2019 stock compares against peers in terms of metrics that matter.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"SUQIAN, CHINA - FEBRUARY 05: In this photo illustration, the logo of Google is displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen on February 5, 2025 in Suqian, Jiangsu Province of China. (Photo by VCG\/VCG via Getty Images) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) recently released its Q4 results, with revenues missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $96.5 billion and earnings of $2.15 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $96.6 billion and $2.13, respectively. Although Google continued to benefit from its cloud business, the segment sales were below expectations. The company remains committed to its AI strategy, and will spend $75 billion in capital expenditures this year. The stock declined following the earnings release, as investors reacted negatively to revenue falling short of expectations and capital expenditures exceeding forecasts. As an aside, see What\u2019s Next For SNAP Stock? GOOG stock, with 37% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. Investors are optimistic about the potential AI-driven growth for Google\u2019s advertising business. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Google\u2019s revenues of $96.5 billion in Q4 reflected a 12% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 30% to $11.96 billion. Google search revenue was up 12.5% to $54 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 13.8% to $10.5 billion. Not only did Alphabet see its revenue rise, its operating margin expanded 500 bps y-o-y to 32% in Q4. Higher revenue and margin expansion led to a 31% rise in the bottom line to $2.15 per share. Looking forward, we expect the company to post revenue of $389 billion and earnings to be around $9.07 per share in 2025. With mixed results and a high capex plan, GOOG stock plunged 7% post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the increase in GOOG stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could GOOG face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Google\u2019s valuation to be $200 per share, close to its current market price of around $193. Our forecast is based on a 22x expected earnings of $9.07 per share in 2025. The 22x figure is higher than the stock\u2019s average P\/E ratio of 18x seen over the last five years. Given Alphabet\u2019s promising earnings growth potential from its AI initiatives and the ongoing momentum in its cloud division, the company appears to warrant a premium valuation multiple, compared to its historical average. Notably, GOOG stock trades at a valuation multiple much lower than some of its cloud peers, with AMZN stock trading at 38x and MSFT stock trading at 32x forward expected earnings. This difference can be attributed to the antitrust cases that Google is facing, alleging the company monopolized the marketplace and the general search services. While GOOG stock looks like it is fairly priced, it is helpful to see how Google\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  The CEO of Versace's parent company says the brand made two mistakes that caused its sales to slip.  Capri Holdings, owner of Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors, reported a 15% dip in Versace's revenue compared to the previous year. The Italian luxury brand earned $193 million in the quarter that ended on December 28.               Its sales dropped 21% in the Americas and 11% in Asia, according to the earnings report on Wednesday.               In the company earnings call on Wednesday, Capri CEO John Idol said that two things went wrong with Versace \u2014 leaning too hard into the quiet luxury trend and reducing the number of its lower-priced offerings.               Idol said that in the fall of 2023, Capri began to reposition Versace by placing a \"greater emphasis on luxury and craftsmanship, which was more in line with the quiet luxury trend.\"               He said to investors that Versace's \"VIC,\" or very important customers, responded positively to the switch to more sophisticated products. But \"while elevating the assortment, we believed we removed too many unique Versace statement items,\" Idol said.               Reducing the number of entry-level priced goods also meant sales took a hit, he said.               Idol said that Capri reduced end-of-season markdowns in Versace stores as part of its overall brand elevation strategy, which had a \"near-term impact on Versace's revenue.\"               \"Additionally, we significantly reduced our offerings of products at entry-level luxury price points,\" he said, adding that it impacted retail sales as well.               To rectify these issues, Idol said that in the next fiscal year, Versace would try to \"achieve the ideal balance of fun and elegant assortment\" and introduce \"a wider offering of product to appeal to a broader base of luxury consumers.\"               He said that expanding the product offering will help the brand re-engage with its aspirational customers.           The quiet luxury trend, characterized by subtle pieces and logo-less designs, may have hurt the luxury industry, Bank of America analysts said in a January note.               The analysts wrote that the trend fueled the rise of dupes, which resulted in a weaker demand for luxury products.       Kering, the owner of Gucci, YSL, and Balenciaga, saw its stock fall more than 40% in 2024. And luxury giant LVMH saw its sales slide 3% in the third quarter of 2024, partially due to weakened consumer confidence in China.               The BofA analysts suggested that the luxury industry should \"pivot back to creativity, fashion content, and newness\" instead of pursuing simplicity.               \"In order to reestablish stronger barriers to entry, we think the logo and fashion content is important,\" the analysts added in the note.               Representatives for Capri did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, sent outside regular business hours.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett have given about $100 billion in total to the Gates Foundation so far.          The Microsoft cofounder and Gates Foundation chair revealed the scale of his philanthropy to the BBC on Monday. A fact sheet for the foundation shows it received a total of $59.5 billion from Gates and French Gates, who are now divorced, between its founding in 2000 and the end of 2023, and a further $39.3 billion from Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.               Despite his extensive giving, Gates is the world's seventh-richest person, with an estimated $164 billion net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.               \"I still have more to give,\" Gates told the BBC. \"I will give away the vast majority of my money; it's my full-time focus for the rest of my life, and I enjoy it.\"               As of Wednesday's close, he's two spots ahead of longtime friend Buffett, worth $148 billion, and three places above Steve Ballmer, his former assistant and successor as Microsoft CEO, worth $144 billion.               However, he's significantly less wealthy on paper than Tesla's Elon Musk, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, the top three people on the rich list, with respective fortunes of $414 billion, $255 billion, and $248 billion.               For comparison, Buffett has given nearly 57% of his Class A shares of Berkshire to the Gates Foundation and four of his family's foundations since 2006. The gifts, based on when they were received, total about $56 billion, but the same shares are worth $189 billion today.               Buffett is 25 years older than Gates, meaning the technology pioneer is likely to have more time to distribute his fortune. Buffett, Gates, and French Gates established the Giving Pledge in 2006 to encourage the world's wealthiest people to commit the majority of their fortunes to charitable causes.               Gates told the BBC that parting ways with billions of dollars hadn't required him to give up anything.               \"I made no personal sacrifice,\" he said. \"I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\"               Gates \u2014 who published a memoir this week titled \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" \u2014 has previously called for higher taxes on the uber-wealthy, saying people like him should be about a third as rich as they are. But Sen. Bernie Sanders needled him in a recent conversation about why he wanted to remain a multi-billionaire.               \"How much do you deserve? Can you make it on a billion? Think you could feed the family? Probably. Pay the rent? Maybe,\" the progressive senator quipped.               Gates owned about 1.3% of Microsoft prior to stepping down as a director in 2020, regulatory disclosures show. The bulk of his fortune is now in a holding company named Cascade Investment, which he funded with Microsoft stock sales and dividends.       Correction: February 6, 2025 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misstated how much money Bill Gates had personally given away. It was his, Melinda French Gates', and Warren Buffett's gifts to the Gates Foundation through 2023 that totaled $100 billion, not Gates' gifts alone.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Qualcomm said Wednesday that it has made strong progress against its goals for Snapdragon PCs, and that its ongoing litigation with Arm had wrapped up. Specifically, according to Circana \u2014 which owns the NPD Group \u2014 Qualcomm captured more than a 10 percent share of all of the Windows laptops sold in the United States priced higher than $800, Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, told investors.  Though Qualcomm will have a ways to go to usurp AMD and Intel from the laptop market, it\u2019s a good start. Amon said that more than 80 PC designs using the Snapdragon X Elite or one of its derivatives were either in production or development, and the company is targeting more than 100 designs to be commercialized through 2026. \u201cWe look forward to PCs powered by Snapdragon X from leading OEMs including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, and Lenovo in the coming months,\u201d Amon said. More importantly, the Windows on Arm ecosystem continues to work hard to alleviate any concerns of compatibility, one of the sticking points for some customers as they consider moving from Windows on X86 to Windows on Arm.  \u201cThe broader app ecosystem continues to expand with Snapdragon native apps now including 20 of the most popular VPNs, 50 of the most popular security and cloud storage apps, as well as new applications for creators,\u201d Amon said, adding that an additional 50 AI applications are now optimized for Windows running natively on Snapdragon. However, Qualcomm did not specifically break out the number of PCs sold with Qualcomm chips inside. The company recorded that as part of its QCT segment, specifically the IoT portion. Qualcomm said that its IoT business recorded $1.549 billion on revenue, up 36 percent from a year ago. Overall, Qualcomm recorded profits of $3.180 billion, up 15 percent, on revenue of $11.669 billion, up 17 percent. \u201cWe\u2019re still starting,\u201d Amon told investors of its PC strategy. \u201cAs I said, we\u2019ll continue to expand new markets. We like the results today. And the design traction is continuing to increase. The first wave was consumer. Now it\u2019s being deployed towards commercial.\u201d Qualcomm also indicated that its legal dispute with Arm, the company which develops the cores used in Qualcomm\u2019s chips, was essentially over.  Arm sued Qualcomm in Sept. 2022 over a licensing dispute that involved Nuvia, the company Qualcomm acquired in part to develop the Snapdragon X Elite chip. Last December Qualcomm prevailed on two of the three issues at the heart of the suit, but not the third. At CES, Arm executives said that the issue was \u201cunresolved.\u201d At stake was the ability for Qualcomm to develop its own CPUs that were compatible with Arm\u2019s instruction system, which now apparently is not at issue. \u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict vindicated Qualcomm\u2019s CPU innovations and affirmed that Qualcomm\u2019s contract with Arm provides a license for Qualcomm\u2019s products containing our proprietary Oryon CPUs in industries such as smartphones, automotive, next generation PCs, IoT, and data center,\u201d Amon said during the call,\u201d transcribed by Seeking Alpha. \u201cIn addition, ARM recently notified us that it was withdrawing its October 22nd, 2024 notice of breach and indicated that it has no current plan to terminate the Qualcomm architecture license agreement. We\u2019re excited to continue to develop performance leading, world-class products that benefit consumers worldwide that include our incredible Oryon custom CPUs.\u201d Mark has written for PCWorld for the last decade, with 30 years of experience covering technology.

It reported revenue of $1.56 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.16 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $1.55 billion and $0.14, respectively. However, the company\u2019s outlook fell short of expectations, resulting in lower levels for SNAP stock post the results announcement. Separately, see What\u2019s Happening With Google Stock? SNAP stock, with -37% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. The stock has been volatile lately amid developments around the banning of TikTok operations in the U.S. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Snap\u2019s revenue of $1.56 billion in Q4 reflected a 14% y-o-y increase, led by strong paid subscriber growth. Snapchat+ member base reached 14 million subscribers, versus 12 million in Q3. Daily active users climbed 9% to 453 million, and average revenue per user of $3.44 was up 4.6% y-o-y. DAU was better and ARPU was in-line with the street estimates. Snap\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin surged 600 bps y-o-y to 18% in Q4\u201924. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in adjusted earnings surging 2x to $0.16 per share, versus $0.08 in the prior-year quarter. For the first quarter, Snap\u2019s guidance projects revenue of approximately $1.34 billion, slightly exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.33 billion. However, the company\u2019s projected adjusted earnings of $57.5 million (at the midpoint) came in below the consensus estimate of $78.5 million. Despite reporting positive fourth-quarter results, SNAP stock experienced an 8% decline following the announcement, primarily attributed to a subdued outlook for the first quarter. Even if we look at a slightly longer period, the changes in SNAP stock over the recent years have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period.

We estimate Snap\u2019s valuation to be $13, reflecting over 20% upside from its current levels of around $11.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  Sam Altman has personally disputed an accusation now at the center of Elon Musk's federal racketeering lawsuit against him: Musk's claim that OpenAI investors must agree to a fund-no-competitor \"edict.\"          \"That claim is false,\" Altman said late Wednesday in a sworn declaration to the judge presiding over Musk's lawsuit, originally filed in February 2024.               The Tesla CEO and DOGE head is accusing Altman of colluding with Microsoft to unlawfully crush competition \u2014 including by barring OpenAI's outside investors from also investing in rival AI companies during a funding round that closed in the fall.               Altman's declaration was filed in opposition to Musk's demand for an immediate injunction against OpenAI.               If approved by the judge, the injunction would ban OpenAI from forcing investors to agree not to invest in other AI companies and would freeze the tech giant's transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity.               \"I did not tell any investor in the October 2024 funding round that their ability to invest in OpenAI was subject to that condition, nor to my knowledge did anyone else at OpenAI,\" Altman said in the page-long declaration.               There were indeed some restrictions, but those were limited and nothing like what Musk described,Altman told US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who hears cases in Oakland.               Investors who had ongoing access to confidential OpenAI information were told that access would be terminated \"if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI's competitors,\" Altman told the judge.               \"That restriction is necessary to protect against the misuse of OpenAI's competitively-sensitive information, and I understand it is industry standard for that reason,\" Altman's statement said.               Altman added that in explaining that limited restriction, he did not tell investors that they would lose the ability to invest in OpenAI if they chose to fund Musk's xAI or any other competitor.               Musk's claim that Altman, his colleague turned rival, was forcing OpenAI investors to agree to the investment ban was raised in detail during a hearing on the lawsuit held before Gonzalez Rogers on Tuesday.               The two men helped cofound OpenAI in 2015. Musk invested $44 million in the venture before their falling out three years later.               Alleging a violation of federal antitrust laws, Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff told the judge on Tuesday that OpenAI's high-value investors were required to agree to the investment ban as a condition of investing, and \"not just in the latest funding round.\"               The Biden administration's Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission also said that such a ban would violate federal antitrust law, Toberoff said.               Altman's company is weighing a new funding round that could hike its value to $340 billion, all the while claiming to be a charitable enterprise, Musk's lawyer told the judge.               \"OpenAI \u2014 already with 70% of the market, in conjunction with Microsoft \u2014 is seeking to strangle their competitors in the crib,\" he said.               Responding to Musk's claim at Tuesday's hearing, attorneys for Altman and Microsoft said OpenAI's investors were never told to boycott competitors.               In fact, Altman's attorney Sarah Eddy told the judge that there were investors who put money in both xAI and OpenAI.               \"Some investors in OpenAI agreed that in the event they became non-passive investors or with governance rights in other competitors, they would cease getting certain confidential information from OpenAI. That is the agreement that's established by the evidence,\" Eddy told the judge.               The judge did not say when she expected to rule on the proposed injunction.               Altman and his codefendants \u2014 who include OpenAI, Microsoft, OpenAI's cofounder Gregory Brockman, and the billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman \u2014 are seeking a dismissal of the lawsuit. A hearing on those dismissal motions is set for May 28.               Attorneys for Musk and Altman said Tuesday that they'd be ready for trial by the end of 2026 at the earliest.       Correction: February 6, 2025\u2014 An earlier version of this story misstated when Elon Musk's lawsuit was originally filed. It was in February 2024, not March.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Amazon beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the fourth quarter, driven by strong cloud growth, AI investments, and a robust holiday shopping season. However, the company issued a gloomy outlook for the first quarter, prompting its stock to drop by about 2% in after-hours trading.  The e-commerce giant reported revenue of $187.8 billion, a 10% year-over-year increase, and earnings per share of $1.86. Amazon (AMZN) recently overtook Walmart in annual revenue for the first time, driven largely by its web-based services.  \u201cThe holiday shopping season was the most successful yet for Amazon,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s CEO, in a statement.  Despite the strong earnings, Amazon\u2019s outlook for the current quarter fell short of expectations.  The company projected first-quarter net sales of $151.0 billion and $155.5 billion, below the $158.6 billion analysts had anticipated, according to FactSet (FDS). Amazon also cited a $2.1 billion currency impact and  $1.5 billion in sales from Leap Day last year. In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported cloud-computing revenue of $28.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Outside of earnings, Amazon is navigating challenges, including potential tariffs on Chinese imports. While rivals like Temu and Shein could be impacted, Amazon\u2019s strong U.S. infrastructure, fast shipping, and fewer tariff-related issues position it well. To compete with the fast-fashion giants, Amazon launched the low-cost Haul platform in Nov. 2024.  Despite struggles with physical stores, Amazon\u2019s delivery network thrives, setting new speed records in 2024, with nine billion items arriving same or next-day globally. U.S. Prime members saved an estimated $95 billion on shipping last year, according to Amazon. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning. ","label":1}

It was 10:00 PM and she had missed dinner, having arrived straight from university. Was there anything in the fridge, she asked? \u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t bring you here to eat,\u2019 he answered, annoyed.\u201d Once she realized he wasn\u2019t joking, she recalls, \u201cI simply smiled and lay on his bed.\u201d After sex, he didn\u2019t offer her so much as \u201ca slice of cheese and some crackers,\u201d and she left, still hungry. He didn\u2019t hit her or call her names, but the brutality of his response, his frank assertion that no bodily need of hers should stand in the way of his own sexual satisfaction, shocks me each time I read that passage. And yet Tenenbaum acknowledges that she readily accepted it. \u201cIn general, we had a good time,\u201d she writes in The End of Love, one of a number of recent books arguing that we\u2019re doing sex all wrong and that contemporary sexual culture neglects the needs of, or even harms, heterosexual women in particular. Since the late nineteenth century, writers from a wide range of disciplines\u2014including philosophy, social science, and psychology\u2014have attempted to analyze and diagnose the sexual culture of their time. Several of these analyses, written or published during the hopeful interregnum of the Biden administration and in the wake of Me Too, seek to explain why, despite having been raised by feminist mothers or at least exposed to pop feminism from an early age, a generation of heterosexual women still experiences desire so unequally. Despite rising anti-feminist backlash, women today are \u201cwinning\u201d in many areas of life\u2014they form the majority of college graduates in the US and an increasing share of homebuyers\u2014so why do they wield so little agency when it comes to sex? How did we wind up, in Tenenbaum\u2019s piercing image, with \u201can entire sisterhood waiting torturously by the phone\u201d? One answer lies in the various ways that our intimate lives have taken on the worst features of the free market\u2014inequality, precarity, impersonality. This is the argument made in The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, an unpersuasive polemic by the British columnist, antirape campaigner, and self-described \u201creactionary feminist\u201d Louise Perry. She writes that contemporary sexual culture, based on casual sex and hookups, fails women while benefiting men. She points to the outpouring of Me Too\u2013era stories from women describing \u201csexual encounters that were technically consensual but nevertheless left them feeling terrible,\u201d because, in Perry\u2019s analysis, \u201cthey were being asked to treat as meaningless something that they felt to be meaningful.\u201d Like Christine Emba in Rethinking Sex\u2014a short, essayistic \u201cprovocation\u201d interwoven with anecdotes and interviews with straight, educated professionals, most of them women\u2014Perry is at pains to expose the supposed \u201cfree market\u201d of sexual exchange as a buyer\u2019s market in which women are getting a raw deal. Both writers cite women\u2019s preferences for monogamy and committed relationships, as well as survey data showing that men are more open to hookups and more likely to orgasm during a casual encounter. Perry, who worked at a rape crisis center earlier in her career, also believes that casual sex puts women at risk of sexual violence. Perry argues that rape is not only about power, as Susan Brownmiller theorized and as Perry herself often repeated as a rape crisis worker; it is, actually, also about sex. After reading A Natural History of Rape (2000) by Randy Thornhill and Craig Palmer, Perry comes to believe that rape is an evolutionary strategy, hardwired into men\u2019s behavior, by which a minority of aggressive men spread their genetic material: Hundreds of thousands of years of sexual violence\u2014not only in our own species but also in many others\u2014is not a consequence of some kind of misunderstanding, swiftly cleared up during a 45-minute workshop in which kids are told in words of one syllable not to rape one another. This evolutionary account doesn\u2019t go very far in explaining why and how consensual sexual encounters, even ones between steady partners, have taken a turn for the mediocre. In Rethinking Sex, Emba recounts how Kirsten, \u201ca perfect stranger,\u201d pulled her aside at a house party in Washington, D.C., and told her about her new boyfriend, who was funny, good-looking, smart, and gainfully employed. \u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201che chokes me during sex?\u201d She didn\u2019t really like the choking, Kirsten explained, but she really liked him. She wasn\u2019t sure whether to say anything, or even if it could actually be considered a valid problem. After all, sex like this was something that she\u2019d said yes to; and she had definitely said yes to him\u2014it was the bargain one made in order to leap off the dating app carousel into the arms of an otherwise great guy. And anyway, this kind of thing had happened to her friends too\u2014the norm for heterosexual hookups seemed to have changed. Vanilla was out, extremes were to be expected. Why, I wondered, did Kirsten (and dozens of others like her in the book) seem unable to simply communicate with her boyfriend about her sexual preferences? What was stopping her from exercising what the scholars Jennifer Hirsch and Shamus Khan would call her \u201csexual citizenship\u201d? Did her boyfriend think she liked it, or did he not seem to care? How much could he be blamed individually, and how much could be ascribed to his upbringing, schooling, experience with previous girlfriends who accepted or even seemed to enjoy his proclivities, or simply to cues from film, video games, pornography, music, or any of the other social and cultural phenomena that shape our preferences without our necessarily knowing it? Advertisement Both Emba and Perry use the metaphor of an unregulated marketplace to describe this anything-goes sexual culture where everyone operates as a free, unfettered agent; both also link this sexual culture to a broader capitalist ethos of choice, freedom, and transaction. For women especially, this freedom is an illusion. Tenenbaum offers a sociological theory, referencing work by scholars such as Eva Illouz and Chris Haywood to explain that men cultivate emotional detachment in order \u201cto keep control of the relationship.\u201d Emba and Perry both emphasize biology, pointing to women\u2019s shorter fertile windows and, in Perry\u2019s case, concepts from evolutionary psychology, such as parental investment theory, which claims that the asymmetrical physical consequences of sex motivate women to be more selective about their mates. (This argument is less convincing in an era of reliable contraception that, at the time of writing at least, is still readily accessible to the urban professionals Perry appears to be addressing.) I\u2019d offer another explanation, one more in line with a market analogy. Perhaps it is relevant that Washington, D.C., where Kirsten presumably lives, has one of the most lopsided ratios of educated straight women to educated straight men in the country, or that since the 1980s American women have been outstripping men in gaining bachelor\u2019s degrees. As three sociologists studying assortative mating recently observed, \u201ca college degree is the dividing line across which it is most difficult to intermarry.\u201d Did Kirsten believe that if she upset her boyfriend by telling him she didn\u2019t like to be choked during sex, he would leave her and she would struggle to find another, more suitable boyfriend? In Emba\u2019s telling, Kirsten knows\u2014by the numbers or simply in her gut\u2014that the odds are not in her favor, and she has made a calculated decision to trade episodic sex for the daily companionship that so many people desire. If Kirsten was scared to just walk away, her fears were not unfounded. A recent survey found that 45 percent of college-educated women say that not being able to find someone who meets their expectations is a major factor in why they are not dating, compared with 28 percent of women without a college education and 33 percent of college-educated men. And today\u2019s straight singles are mismatched from a purely economic perspective too. A 2019 paper compared the existing supply of American single men to men whom educated women had already married, and found that the married men were more likely to be college-educated, employed, and higher-earning than those still up for grabs. That study\u2019s conclusion\u2014that educated women in the US face \u201clarge deficits in the supply of potential male spouses\u201d\u2014would likely not surprise any of the women in Emba\u2019s book or, to be honest, any woman who has tried dating in a major metropolis. In Motherhood on Ice (2023), the sociologist Marcia Inhorn found that 82 percent of the 150 college-educated, professional women she surveyed in the US cited a lack of a partner as the reason for freezing their eggs. (Inhorn also notes that while Silicon Valley has a high ratio of educated men to women, women in that city repeatedly told her that while \u201cthe odds are good\u2026the goods are odd.\u201d) But while egg freezing may help to compensate for some of the asymmetry in the reproductive periods of women and men, the most recent data, from 2022, shows that fewer than 30,000 women freeze their eggs every year, so it can\u2019t address the broader demographic imbalance that is particularly acute in certain parts of the country, nor the disagreeable male behavior that appears to result. A thirty-four-year-old law student describes to Emba an endless run of \u201cbullshit shenanigans\u201d with men who lack \u201cthe initiative to be reliable partners, because sex is both so casual and so available.\u201d Advertisement Perry borrows from the economic historian R.H. Tawney, dividing the sexual marketplace\u2019s participants into predatory pikes and vulnerable minnows. Inspired by labor rights and redistributive measures that protect the minnows from unbridled exploitation by the pikes, Perry calls for \u201ca sophisticated system of sexual ethics.\u201d She asks men, \u201cas the stronger and hornier sex,\u201d to \u201cdemonstrate even greater restraint than women when faced with temptation.\u201d To extend her market analogy, this seems a bit like asking corporations to operate under stakeholder capitalism instead of shareholder capitalism, to certify as B-corps instead of ruthlessly (or rationally) maximizing their returns. It is an entreaty, not a solution. In diagnosing the maladies of today\u2019s sex and dating culture, neither Perry nor Emba dwells much on the liberatory possibilities of sex, or its potential for simple physical pleasure\u2014for women as well as men. Nona Willis Aronowitz tackles both, without shying away from the pitfalls of seeking them through an activity that relies on another person\u2019s goodwill. In Bad Sex: Truth, Pleasure, and an Unfinished Revolution, she ties together several threads: the collapse of her marriage and her quest for self-discovery through a series of sexual relationships and one-offs; the published and unpublished musings of her mother, the sex-positive feminist writer and music critic Ellen Willis; and a nuanced historical account of how feminists going back more than a century sought to reconcile their ideas, feelings, and actions when it came to love, desire, and autonomy. \u201cWhat, exactly, do I want?\u201d she asks in the book\u2019s early pages. \u201cAnd are my sexual and romantic desires even possible amid the horrors and bribes of patriarchy, capitalism, and white supremacy?\u201d In the next sentence, she acknowledges \u201cthe complexity and absurdity\u201d of answering those questions. Her attempts to understand her own conflicting desires are thorough, earnest, and often illuminating. Because Perry and Emba take for granted certain generalizations about what straight women and men want\u2014based on surveys, their own personal experience, and, in Emba\u2019s case, a number of interviews\u2014their arguments lead them naturally toward protecting women and helping them achieve their stated goal of a committed relationship. Willis Aronowitz, meanwhile, is more attuned to those on the margins, to individuals and movements seeking to carve out different paths, giving ample space to the experiences and ideas of earlier generations of feminists of color, free love advocates, and lesbian separatists who hoped to create a world dedicated to women\u2019s needs and desires. In exploring the concept of vulnerability, she observes how power, identity, and hierarchy shape sexuality and relationships in unexpected ways. The gendered inequality in her relationship with a Chilean lover who once criticized her lack of enthusiasm for blow jobs \u201cwhile not acknowledging that he\u2019d never once even seen my pussy\u201d is tempered by the greater social and economic power she enjoys by virtue of being \u201ca much richer white American woman,\u201d although the tension between those two forms of power remains unexplored. Recounting the debate that began in the 1970s between pro-sex feminists, including her mother, who envisioned a genuine sexual freedom that required a more egalitarian world, and antiporn activists who saw pornography as a dehumanizing product of a patriarchal society, she quotes the self-described \u201cChicana, Catholic-raised lesbian\u201d Cherr\u00ede Moraga. In Moraga\u2019s view both antiporn feminists and sexual libertarians overlooked a history of devaluation that already rendered Black and brown women\u2019s bodies vulnerable to sexual violence, leaving them unable \u201cto grasp why it might be harder for women of color to just proudly embrace sexual freedom,\u201d Willis Aronowitz writes. She goes on to discuss Black feminist writers such as Joan Morgan, adrienne maree brown, and Audre Lorde, who have sought to reclaim erotic pleasure as a crucial liberatory aspect of Black female sexuality, which\u2014when not pathologized in \u201cthe three paradigms of Jezebel, sexless mammy, and Sapphire\u201d\u2014has often been understood through stories of trauma and violation. One of the most affecting sections of the book details the sexual exploration of her close friend Selah, which was complicated by the lessons Selah had absorbed from church and from her strict Black single mother. After a series of disappointing and occasionally violent encounters with men, Selah comes to embrace her queerness when she meets a \u201cconfident butch named Alexis\u201d during a trip to Atlanta. Alexis breaks her heart, but not before guiding Selah toward self-discovery by taking her to a sex shop to buy a dildo. When Selah asks Alexis which toy she wants to use on her, Alexis turns it around: \u201cBaby. What do you want?\u201d It was a question no one had ever asked her before. Willis Aronowitz narrates her own journey to unearth her desires with abundant candor. There are ecstatic highs (\u201cHe could fuck my mouth with authority and then moan with abandon when I fingered his ass and then suck my clit for a hundred years and then burrow his face in my breasts sweetly, lazily\u201d) and undeserved lows (an encounter with a much younger man who, when she glances up mid-fellatio, turns out to have been filming her). Although Mr. Moan with Abandon reveals himself to be a melodramatic liar, \u201can unworthy recipient\u201d of her \u201cnewfound openness,\u201d Willis Aronowitz nevertheless insists on the value of slogging her way through this thicket of often unimpressive men, describing sex as the terrain on which she conducts her self-exploration. \u201cI had just learned so much about myself through fucking,\u201d she writes at one point. \u201cI\u2019d turned my whole life upside down largely because I\u2019d determined that sexual pleasure was a gigantic priority of mine.\u201d She winds up in a long-term relationship again, with a man who shares her ideological and practical commitment to nonmonogamy. She admits that this is the path of greater resistance, a recipe for more insecurity, more \u201cserious talks,\u201d more \u201cworry and despair.\u201d Both she and her partner are often exhausted and on edge. Again, she concludes that the effort is worthwhile, leading her to a place of greater integrity: \u201cThe best truth I can offer is that while nonmonogamy is not at all relaxing, it also feels worthwhile to excavate the deepest wells of my own generosity and trust.\u201d I sometimes wondered if there wasn\u2019t an easier, less excruciating way for Willis Aronowitz to discover herself. Why not take a pottery class or visit a museum? Clearly she and I are different people, and while pursuing encounters with whoever happens to be on Tinder that night strikes me as a circuitous route to finding one\u2019s truest self, I worry more that the suggestions offered by Emba and Perry leave little room for someone whose \u201cgigantic priority\u201d is pleasure, or for the feminists of color for whom eroticism and a positive reclamation of sexuality are not only sources of pleasure but important forms of political resistance. Take Perry\u2019s solution to the problem of a too-liberal sexual culture that rewards men for behaving like cads: In order to change the incentive structure, we would need a technology that discourages short-termism in male sexual behavior, protects the economic interests of mothers, and creates a stable environment for the raising of children. And we do already have such a technology, even if it is old, clunky and prone to periodic failure. It\u2019s called monogamous marriage. The passage arrives at the end of a book that depicts men as incorrigible creeps, a not-insignificant share (at least 10 percent in the US and the UK, in her estimation) of whom are inclined to rape, and that acknowledges that a \u201cdurable marriage is fast becoming a luxury of the upper classes.\u201d Such a prescription strikes me as not just glib, smug, and unrealistic, but also utterly incoherent in light of everything she has argued in the preceding pages. Whom exactly are women supposed to marry, and why would men give up all the goodies currently available to them\u2014and to which they are, in her telling, evolutionarily disposed\u2014in exchange for matrimony? Emba (a convert to Catholicism who writes that she opposed premarital sex in her personal life until, after \u201cwrestling with [her] own faith,\u201d she didn\u2019t) guides the reader instead to the thirteenth-century philosopher Thomas Aquinas, and in particular to his admonition to love. His definition of love was \u201cwilling the good of the other,\u201d a description not of romantic love per se or even of any form of action, but rather \u201can intention: to bear goodwill toward another for the sake of that person and not oneself.\u201d Perry herself hopes for a sexual culture that \u201crecognises other human beings as real people, invested with real value and dignity.\u201d Willis Aronowitz writes that \u201cmost of the time, a hot one-night stand simply requires being a decent human.\u201d At the core of all these books is an implicit question: What is sex for? Clearly, just as there is no average sexual encounter, there is not a simple answer to this question. But failing to talk about it, or even to contemplate it, leaves us all poorly equipped to come to anything resembling a shared consensus. Emba concludes that sex with someone you know and care about is better than casual sex with someone you\u2019ve just met, not least because it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll have their interests at heart\u2014you\u2019ll be more predisposed to will their good. Not all women, as Perry suggests, want or need sex to be \u201cmeaningful,\u201d but sex\u2014or even conversation, as anyone who has politely sat by as someone with high regard for their own ideas blathers on interminably\u2014should be at least informed by a sense of mutuality that goes beyond mere consent. I\u2019m inclined to think that Willis Aronowitz\u2019s endless \u201cserious talks\u201d with her partner about their open relationship suggest one way forward, whether in monogamous relationships or casual encounters. As I read about the many unpleasant or unsatisfying sexual scenarios depicted in these books, it often seemed the problem was not so much a lack of consent as a lack of communication. At one point, Emba proposes the dinner party as an analogy for an ideal sexual experience: it is governed by \u201ca clear set of rules,\u201d but still offers the chance of surprise, discovery, delight. I would suggest that a successful dinner party, like an exhilarating sexual encounter, comes down less to the rules and boundaries that proscribe certain behaviors than to the attitudes or intentions with which participants approach it. Curiosity and respect are more likely to get you invited back to either event than ego and selfishness. Indeed, the sex columnist and writer Dan Savage has pointed out that queer people beginning a flirtation often lead by asking, \u201cWhat are you into?\u201d Verbal communication that precedes a physical interaction offers a chance to think about and articulate one\u2019s desires. It is also an opportunity to recognize the other person as an equal\u2014someone with ideas, wants, and a voice of their own, instead of simply a body. But there\u2019s something terribly poignant and frustrating about reading books by sophisticated thinkers who all conclude, in various ways, that we just need to be nicer, in bed and out of it. I wondered whether the people who need to hear this rudimentary message most\u2014straight men\u2014are likely to pick up these books at all. More influential seems to be the discussion of sexual politics playing out online, in which male strength and female submission are celebrated by proudly misogynistic influencers such as Andrew Tate. The professional racist Nick Fuentes\u2019s exultation on the night of Trump\u2019s election\u2014\u201cYour body, my choice. Forever\u201d\u2014went viral. Sexual ethics in a post\u2013Me Too era may not have been clear cut, but these books, for the most part, are attempts to forge a path forward, toward a sexual culture founded on mutual goodwill and respect. It no longer feels like \u201cforward\u201d is where we are headed.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"It sure looks like 2023 will witness a big leap in foldable phone technology. Interestingly, it won\u2019t be Samsung at the helm, despite kickstarting the foldable phone trend back in 2019. Instead, it will be China\u2019s Oppo, and its sister brand, OnePlus. Earlier today, OnePlus founder and product chief at Oppo, Pete Lau, shared a few images of the upcoming Find N5 alongside a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. The focus is on the crease, or to put it more accurately, an almost non-existent crease on the Oppo phone and the deep ridge visible on Samsung\u2019s foldable phone. \u201cNo crease detected,\u201d wrote Lau. It\u2019s an impressive showcase, as virtually every foldable phone in the market serves a crease compromise. Compared to the early days of foldable phones, the likes of Samsung have made fantastic progress with the underlying Ultrathin Glass (layer). However, the foldable panel still can\u2019t quite shake off the visible crease. It sticks out as an eyesore, especially against dark backgrounds or when the brightness levels are on the lower side. And you definitely feel the vertically recessed line with your fingertips. The crease isn\u2019t just a poor sight, but it\u2019s also a functional hazard. The first sign of pixel damage on the inner flexible screen usually appears alongside the display crease of foldable phones. The Oppo Find N5 seems poised to solve that nagging problem, as is evident from the pictures shared by Lau. Will it maintain a crease-less look after a few months of usage? Only time will tell. But there\u2019s a lot more to feel excited about this phone, ahead of its global debut two weeks from now. It will be the world\u2019s first foldable to provide IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 full-grade waterproofing. The Oppo Find N5 will also come armed with Qualcomm\u2019s flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC and will also support 50W wireless charging. And did I mention that it will do all that while hitting the shelves as the world\u2019s slimmest foldable phone? Yeah, that too. As per leaks, it will be only 4.2mm across in its unfolded state, thinner than even iPad Apple\u2019s M4 iPad Pro. It is not going to land in the US market, but will most likely get rebadged as the OnePlus Open 2 for stateside customers. Samsung will reportedly take a tamer (read: laggard) approach to foldable phones this year. The upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 will likely arrive as a rebadged version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition, which was introduced in China a few months ago. It is slimmer, but doesn\u2019t offer any other notable upgrades. On the topic of slimmer phones, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will soon land in the market, challenging Apple\u2019s own slim warrior that is rumored to wear the iPhone 17 Air badge and is set to arrive in the Fall season. Samsung recently released its newest generation of foldable devices, with the Galaxy Z Fold 6\u00a0leading the pack. This is Samsung's latest and greatest folding phone, and it packs in a ton of power and features with the latest software. But there\u2019s also another factor to consider, especially for the Galaxy Z Fold 6: the price. It\u2019s certainly not cheap, and in fact, there was a price increase with the new model, so it\u2019s more expensive than ever. If you\u2019re thinking about buying the Galaxy Z Fold 6, here are five alternatives you should think about buying instead. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Though foldable phones are still a smaller part of the smartphone world, they appeal to users who want something more from their phones. Having a phone that can become a mini tablet opens up a whole new world for productivity and creativity. If you\u2019re in the market for a foldable, you may be considering the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5, which is one of the more popular choices. But it\u2019s not the only foldable out there. Here are some alternatives to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 that you should look at first. OnePlus Open Samsung has been in charge of leading the foldable segment for too long. For years, Samsung dominated the foldable landscape with little to no competition. But that changed in 2023. While the company put in the work to improve the Galaxy Z Flip 5 with a bigger cover display, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 seemed to remain an afterthought. Fortunately, other smartphone manufacturers started rolling out more foldable phones globally this year, and now, Samsung\u2019s aren\u2019t the go-to choice anymore. There's finally healthy competition and choice for folding phones, and I'm so here for it.

Download this actionable guide and learn how Programmatic SEO can deliver exponential growth for your business. Learn how TAM, SAM, and SOM can provide clarity and guidance in evaluating market opportunities and fine-tuning your SEO strategy. Understanding total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM), and serviceable obtainable market (SOM) isn\u2019t just useful for marketers. It\u2019s an important tool for assessing whether a business idea is viable. These metrics give various business stakeholders, including marketers and product teams, the clarity they need to evaluate whether a new product has the potential to succeed. TAM, SAM, and SOM play a key role in crafting a solid go-to-market strategy, and can influence the overall business plan. They help fine-tune marketing and sales strategies, set realistic revenue goals, and determine which markets are worth your investment of time and resources. While these metrics are deeply interconnected and don\u2019t always have strict boundaries, their value lies in how they evolve alongside your brand, product lines, and customer needs. SOM is a smaller part of the SAM that your business can realistically capture within a certain period of time. How much you are able to capture depends on factors like your competition, resources, and how effectively you can execute your tactics. As the SOM is the smallest audience size in the framework, it is often overlooked as the bigger numbers and bigger audiences are more appealing \u2013 and look better on slide decks. To enhance SEO for your SOM, start with in-depth market research to pinpoint your ideal customer profiles (ICPs) in this reachable group. Use this insight to form content that speaks directly to them. Develop a keyword strategy that includes niche-specific terms, and support it by publishing high-value content, optimizing for local search, and building authoritative backlinks. The goal is to meet your customers where they are while creating meaningful engagement. This is where you can also apply the Pareto Law as outlined by Byron Sharp in the book \u201cHow Brands Grow.\u201d In the book, Sharp cites that 60% of Coca-Cola sales come from just 20% of the buyer base. Their SOM is responsible for 60% of sales. Your SAM is an expansion on your SOM, and represents the slice of the TAM that\u2019s feasible for your business to target, given its unique offerings and practical reach. It narrows the TAM by focusing on customers who align with your specific product and logistical capabilities. For an online sports shoe store, the SAM could be fitness enthusiasts and amateur athletes who shop online and live in areas where the company offers delivery and actively markets its products. By refining your TAM into a SAM, you\u2019re ensuring you prioritize the most realistic opportunities for your business. This then translates into your SEO strategy, and helps you prioritize your content and digital PR focuses by working to reach these audience profiles. The TAM is the largest market opportunity. It represents the total revenue your product or service could generate if you somehow captured 100% of the market. TAM serves as the starting point for understanding the full scale of an opportunity, offering a broad perspective before you narrow things down. In the sports shoe example, the TAM could include everyone in the world who buys sports shoes, whether they shop online or in-store. This overall market might include professional athletes, casual gym-goers, and even occasional joggers, spanning all sales channels like ecommerce sites, retail stores, and third-party marketplaces. You then also have the fashion and collector markets, who see sports shoes as casual everyday wear or as a monetary investment. While TAM is more theoretical, it sets the foundation for evaluating the overall potential of your industry. \u201cTAM\u201d represents the total revenue potential if a company captures 100% of its market. \u201cSEO TAM\u201d narrows this to the revenue achievable by reaching all potential customers through search engines. It represents the potential revenue attainable by engaging all customers who could discover your product via search engines, where their intent aligns with the value of your content or product\/service. I wrote an article exploring the SEO TAM more here. The alignment of your value proposition to what the user is looking for is important, even more so now than ever. The \u201cTAM trap\u201d in calculating your potential SEO market happens when you assume that everyone who searches a specific keyword shares the same intent. Keywords can have multiple interpretations; some you would class as having multiple common interpretations, some more dominant interpretations, and others potentially lesser common interpretations. A number of factors can influence these interpretations, including time of the year and the searcher\u2019s location. Some common examples involve brands, such as Jaguar: Are people searching for the car, the animal, or the sports team? A less common example I\u2019ve experienced was a variation of the term \u201cWAF.\u201d The dominant interpretation of this search term (globally) is Web Application Firewall, but our rank trackers picked up that on Texas IPs, for around a month, Google alternated between our CDN client and the World Apostolate of Fatima church. This was around the time of a religious festival, so, for a short time, the most prominent interpretation of the queries in that locale changed to users wanting details for the church. This impacted our WAF rankings from the top three to lower page one. After the two-week period, when the change in demand subsided, the SERP \u201creset\u201d to reflect the regular interpretations. This is important to note, as just classifying queries by intent isn\u2019t always enough when estimating audience size \u2013 especially when big marquee head terms are involved \u2013 as not all 10,000 searches of the query will come from users with the same interpretation, same prior knowledge levels, or same end-intent.

Markets in China shrugged off tariffs overnight with strong gains, led by growth and technology stocks. The anticipation is that Trump will make a deal with China on fentanyl, agricultural purchases, and possibly more. Shares in the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle maker BYD surged +12% overnight on strong deliveries in 2024 and anticipation for its Intelligent Strategy Launch Event coming up next week. BYD and other China electric vehicle companies are well positioned to benefit from DeepSeek AI\u2019s advancements in the space, which could have a bearing on the ability of China-based carmakers to more efficiently produce autonomous driving technology. Kingsoft Cloud, ZTE and other cloud and data names continued their rise on DeepSeek AI\u2019s efficient, open source AI chat bot. Alibaba also gained overnight as its AI chat bot is said to be more efficient than DeepSeek. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen visual-language model has demonstrated better comprehension of visual text and images than competitors, according to the company. It has also landed over 300,000 enterprise clients. Alibaba\u2019s CEO Eddie Wu said during their last earnings call: \u201cAs China\u2019s market-leading cloud service provider for AI, we will continue to invest in advanced technology and AI infrastructure while optimizing operational efficiency. This will enable us to provide customers across industries with more reliable and cost-effective AI technologies and products. We believe that as AI adoption grows, Alibaba Cloud\u2019s cloud computing and AI-related products will become the foundational infrastructure supporting development across industries.\u201d The company should be considered an AI and cloud play too, in our opinion. Robotics firms also gained overnight on AI optimism. Health care was the top-performing sector in Hong Kong overnight. WuXi Biologics gained +5.22%. The contract research organization has had a few developments so far this year, including the sale of some facilities and a partnership with Candid Therapeutics. Also, the U.S.\u2019 Biosecure Act was excluded from the continuing resolution to keep the government funded late last year, which means it is unlikely to become law anytime soon in its current form. The Act would have prevented WuXi and other pharmaceutical research companies from doing business with U.S. entities that receive federal medicare and Medicaid funding.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Business Insider Edition  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she's worth less than $500,000, prompting a mixture of disbelief, criticism, and begrudging respect from commenters on X.          The New York congresswoman, often called AOC, discussed her personal wealth after an X user claimed she was worth tens of millions as a result of taking kickbacks.               The Democratic lawmaker said that the user was \"completely making things up\" and that she didn't trade individual stocks or earn any income apart from her congressional salary. \"I don't even own a house!\" she said in a second response.                  You are completely making things up. I am not even worth $1 million. Or a half million. I am one of the lowest net worth members of Congress, trade no individual stock, and take no outside income. These filings are public. I loathe corruption, and your lying is reprehensible.               \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) February 5, 2025           Ocasio-Cortez worked as a bartender and server before winning a seat in the House of Representatives, which she's held since 2019. She earns the standard congressional salary of $174,000 a year.               Her financial disclosure form last year showed she had no more than $46,000 across her checking, savings, brokerage, and 401(k) accounts, and owed between $15,000 and $50,000 of student loans.               Forbes estimated Ocasio-Cortez's net worth last year at about $125,000 with most of her wealth in a Thrift Savings Plan \u2014 a 401(k)-style investment vehicle for government employees that doesn't have to be listed in financial disclosures.               Several X users said they disagreed with her progressive politics but appreciated her integrity.               @SpanglEdReAper, who has \"GOD, GUNS AND TRUMP!\" in their bio, wrote: \"As much as I despise completely your political ideology and your methods, its true AOC is one of the few that is not taking kickbacks, or at least that we know of atm.\"               Similarly, @starbw_eth wrote: \"I am not a fan of your politics, but I do believe you are ethical and trustworthy when it comes to your own personal corruption stance. I wish more congressional officeholders followed that same standard.\"               Meanwhile, others were surprised by the state of Ocasio-Cortez's finances.               \"How do you make 174k per year and your net worth is almost nothing?\" the user @raphaellimasp wrote.               @coldhealing wrote: \"Not being worth $500k at age 35 with a salary of $174k is not the financial strategy that we want to encourage in Americans.\"               \"This is NOT a flex,\" @GuyTalksFinance wrote. \"Someone get AOC a book on personal finance and budgeting.\"               Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider in an email it was \"reassuring\" to see apparent critics of Ocasio-Cortez give her kudos for coming across as \"morally and ethically consistent.\"               The reaction also speaks to the social-media-fueled polarization in politics where \"everything triggers an outrage and there is no middle ground,\" and \"politicians and leaders are either deeply hated or deeply revered,\" he said.               In Roulet's view, authenticity can feed polarization because \"if you are true to yourself it makes you even more at odds with those who dislike you, but it connects you with your supporters.\"                  Are you one of those people who believes that chain email-esque meme that claims Im worth 29 million dollars  lmao               \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 19, 2022           Ocasio-Cortez, a vocal critic of\u00a0corporate influence and corruption in politics, has previously posted on X about setting people straight regarding her finances.               In October 2022, she recalled someone asking her how she was worth $29 million and her replying: \"Sir, I wish. My financial disclosures are public. I still owe ~$18k in student loans.\"               \"I don't own nor trade individual stocks, accept no corporate money to my campaign, & live solely off my congressional salary (which requires us to pay for 2 rents out of pocket),\" she continued in a second post. \"All of this is publicly disclosed info. I save in a Thrift Savings Plan just like other fed workers.\"               Accusations of political corruption, many of them demonstrably false, have surged in recent days as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has made government fraud and waste a hot topic online.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The Samsung Galaxy S25 is a bit of a mixed bag, since it provides a few notable upgrades and just as many reused components from last year's Galaxy S24. Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is a powerhouse, there's now 12GB RAM on the base model, and you get Wi-Fi 7 support. On the other hand, the rear camera system, display, and charging speeds are all unfortunately unchanged for another year. That isn't quite enough to count the Galaxy S25 out, because Samsung tweaked the design this time round to make it the smallest flagship phone on the market. It might sound crazy to call a 6.2-inch handset a compact device, but it's the best we've got in 2025.  Smaller form factor with slim bezels Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset with 12GB RAM New and improved Galaxy AI features One UI update is fresh, fun, and genuinely great Refined design with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on front and back Qi2.1 requires a magnetic case for snap connection with chargers and accessories Lacks UWB support Relatively small 4,000mAh battery Slow 25W wired charging speeds Same camera system as Galaxy S22 Why you can trust Android Central    Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Samsung fans looking for a fresh revamp of the flagship Galaxy lineup might be underwhelmed by the Samsung Galaxy S25, at least at first glance. Aside from minuscule design and finish updates, the base-model Galaxy S25 looks quite similar to the Galaxy S24 \u2014 and previous generations before that one. In fact, some of the only impactful hardware upgrades to the Galaxy S25 \u2014 like the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and improved connectivity protocols \u2014 might be more a testament to the breakthroughs Qualcomm has achieved rather than Samsung. And yet, despite my disdain for Samsung's complacency at times, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with this phone. Samsung's renewed approach to software and its close relationship with Google are big reasons why. One UI used to be a disjointed Android experience, and it felt like Google and Samsung services were sparring underneath the software skin. Now, One UI 7 is a standout operating system that feels fast and refreshing. Galaxy AI, Google AI, and the flurry of Samsung and Google software features on the Galaxy S25 feel like they're finally working together, not competing for your attention. That, plus the tiny form factor, makes me want to overlook the Galaxy S25's shortcomings in other areas. There are some egregious omissions here, like the camera system that hasn't been upgraded since the Galaxy S22. Slow charging speeds, the lack of UWB support, and 128GB base storage are other notable oversights. All this adds up to make the Samsung Galaxy S25 my most frustrating recommendation yet. Yes, it's very good, and you should buy it if you want a small, light, and compact Android flagship. But I'd be lying if I wasn't worried about Samsung being rewarded for bad behavior if the Galaxy S25 flies off the shelves because it certainly could've done more here.  Samsung announced the Galaxy S25 series at an Unpacked event in California on Jan. 22, 2025. The phones became available for preorder on that date and officially released February 7. However, preorders from Samsung were delivered early this year \u2014 as early as late January. There are three storage configurations of the Galaxy S25 available: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. With that being said, the 128GB variant isn't available in Australia, and the 512GB variant isn't available in North America. Despite rumors of a price hike, the Galaxy S25 matches the pricing tiers of the Galaxy S24. The Galaxy S25 comes in Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow colorways. I reviewed the Icyblue model, which photographs closer to white but looks like a mix of light blue and silver in person. There's also a trio of Samsung exclusive colors: Coralred, Blueblack, and Pinkgold. You'll find the Galaxy S25 available for purchase from Samsung's online store, third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon, and from cellular carriers. We have a complete guide to all the best deals for your reference.  It's clear from a look down the spec sheet that the Galaxy S25 has to offer something unique to make buyers look past its shortcomings. For example, the OnePlus 13 is a more complete package while costing only $100 more, which doesn't bode well for Samsung's base model. The good news is that Samsung did create something unique with the Galaxy S25. It's perhaps the last small Android flagship left. I know, I know \u2014 it's crazy to say that a 6.2-inch smartphone is small. As a fond former iPhone 12 mini user, I feel you. Small phone lovers like myself simply have to acknowledge that with the departure of the Asus Zenfone (as we knew it), the category is on life support. Unless you count clamshell foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Galaxy S25 is indeed the smallest 2025 flagship you can buy today. While the iPhone and Pixel keep growing larger, the Galaxy S25 is getting smaller. The display on the Galaxy S25 is still 6.2 inches, but Samsung shrunk the chassis in every way. It's smaller, thinner, and lighter than the Galaxy S24. If that wasn't enough, the Galaxy S25 is also more compact than the Google Pixel 9 and iPhone 16 in every dimension.  To get specific, the Galaxy S25 measures 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm and weighs just 162 grams. Those numbers don't quite convey how much thinner and lighter this phone feels compared to the competition. The base Pixel 9, for instance, weighs a whopping 198 grams. I already enjoyed the form factor of the Galaxy S24, and the Galaxy S25 feels better in every way. Although the Galaxy S25 Edge may be thinner when it releases, its rumored 6.8-inch screen will help the Galaxy S25 keep the title of best small phone through the year. Overall, the design of the Galaxy S25 feels like a mix of the design trends we saw on Galaxy foldables and the Galaxy S24. There are still the same flat aluminum side rails with rounded corners and chamfered edges, and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. Meanwhile, the rear camera lenses now have DSLR-style covers, matching the Galaxy foldables. While familiar, I have no complaints about the Galaxy S25's build \u2014 although Gorilla Armor and its anti-reflective properties would've been a big addition. Though some are quick to point out that the sharper edges of the Galaxy S25's design can be uncomfortable to hold, I don't think this is much of an issue on the base model. It's small enough that you should be able to hold it with one hand without needing to shove the corner into your palm. For the Plus or Ultra models, it may be something to consider. When I reviewed the Galaxy S24 last year, I said that the display's bezels appeared smaller than any other phone I've tested. That's still visually apparent with the Galaxy S25, regardless of whether it's actually true. Especially with a light-colored phone, the contrast of the matte aluminum rails and the black display edges make bezels look half the size \u2014 and more than other flagships. Compared to the Galaxy S24, the screen-to-body ratio has only increased by 0.2% on the Galaxy S25, so both devices will feel similar. The similarities probably have something to do with the fact that both phones appear to have the exact same display panel. It's an AMOLED 2X display that goes up to 120Hz with a variable refresh rate, HDR10+, and 2,600 nits of maximum brightness. The resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels, meaning it's only FHD+. As a result, the Galaxy S25 doesn't have the ProScaler for QHD+ that's now available on the Plus and Ultra models. The lack of upgrades doesn't change the fact that the Galaxy S25 looks stunning in most conditions. If I had to nitpick, the brightness could be improved. Other handsets can do much better, and out-of-the-box brightness outdoors should be higher. Samsung's adaptive brightness tends to be too conservative, so I'd recommend disabling this and flipping on the \"extra brightness\" option if you're like me and love a bright screen. Of course, this comes at the expense of battery life. Around the edges, you'll find a volume rocker and a side button used for power and voice assistant control. The side button can be mapped to Gemini for quick access to agentic assistance. On the bottom, there's a speaker grill, a USB 3.2 Type-C port that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, and a physical SIM card tray. The right side merely offers a mmWave cutout for enhanced 5G connectivity. To sum up, don't overlook the Galaxy S25's form factor. Its thinness and lightness, paired with the power we'll get to next, makes it a compelling option in a sea of large flagships.  The hardware on the inside of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is both the best and worst thing about this device. Let's start with the good. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, which was co-designed by Samsung and Qualcomm. This mobile platform is based on the Snapdragon X lineup, the laptop and desktop-class processors made using Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores. In essence, it means that the Galaxy S25 is the most powerful Android phone on the market. This is reflected in benchmark tests, where the Galaxy S25 came out on top in Geekbench 6 runs. It decisively beat the Google Pixel 9, a phone that uses the underpowered Tensor G4 processor. Previously, Google had the edge in AI, with 45 tokens per second supported for AI operations on the Pixel 9. Samsung and Qualcomm completely flipped the script with the Galaxy S25. It can process up to 70 tokens per second for AI tasks, dethroning the Pixel 9. With performance, AI processing, and Galaxy optimization, it looks like the Galaxy S25 is the top-performing base model of any flagship offering in 2025. What does that mean for daily use? It's twofold. First, it is unlikely that you'll notice the speed difference between the Galaxy S25 and another capable flagship while holding them side-by-side. Smartphones have been really fast for a while now, and we don't need Geekbench 6 scores to know it. Second, it is likely that the massive performance increase of the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset will aid the Galaxy S25's longevity. Samsung is promising seven years of software support, and I suspect the Galaxy S25 will have an easier time achieving that than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered Galaxy S24. This is not the kind of year-over-year performance improvement we usually see in smartphone SoCs. It's a once-in-a-decade type of upgrade, and that's why I can see the argument for upgrading now to the Galaxy S25 if you've been waiting a while. To test how the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy pushes the battery and cooling system in the Galaxy S25 to its limits, I ran the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme stress test, which is a graphics-heavy test lasting 20 minutes in a continuous loop. I surprisingly found that the Galaxy S25 didn't get scolding hot to the touch. It got warm but didn't overheat like other flagships have in recent years. However, the loop score during the stress test continually decreased over the course of the 20-minute stress test. The Galaxy S25 hit a peak of 15,336 in the second loop and dipped under 11,000 by the 13th loop. It finished with a final loop of 10,991. What does this all mean? Essentially, the Galaxy S25 will slow down the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor to keep the phone cool. As a result, its internal temperature only increased by 5 degrees Celsius during the test and used just 11% battery. To be clear, this is a good result. You want a phone to know its limits and slow down before burning itself up and losing a ton of battery for the sake of a few extra frames while gaming.  I said that the hardware was also the worst thing about the Samsung Galaxy S25, and here's why. There are some omissions that are extremely hard to justify. For starters, you don't get an ultra-wideband (UWB) chip on the base model Galaxy S25 \u2014 you have to upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Plus or Ultra for that. It creates a situation where if you plan to use Samsung's own SmartTag trackers or the Google Find My Device network over the life of your smartphone, you shouldn't buy the Galaxy S25. Additionally, the Galaxy S25 still charges painfully slow. It only charges at 25W over a cable, which is unacceptable for a flagship in 2025. Wireless charging isn't that much better. It supports the Qi2.1 standard, offering 15W wireless charging and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. It doesn't have internal magnets, so you can't use MagSafe accessories without a case. I may be in the minority here, but I think slapping a thick MagSafe case on the Galaxy S25 defeats the purpose of it being a compact phone. Those are just a few small missed opportunities that might not matter much today but could limit you down the road if you plan to keep this phone for five or more years. There's still plenty of good, like the processor, Wi-Fi 7 support, and Bluetooth 5.4 support. The phone's battery capacity is 4,000mAh, just like last year. A bigger battery would be nice, but I can live with this capacity in this form factor. For most people, the Galaxy S25 should offer all-day battery life. I consistently got 6+ hours of screen-on time with a mix of phone calls, video streaming, camera usage, and social media doom-scrolling. That was paired with about 10+ hours of screen-off time between charges. Most of the time, the Galaxy S25 lasts all day. If you're able to briefly top off the battery at various times throughout the day, you'll be golden. I find this easy to do, simply keeping a cable or wireless charging pad at my desk and in the car.  Samsung reused the rear camera system in the Galaxy 25 for the fourth straight smartphone generation. That's right \u2014 the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S22 share camera sensors. You get a 50MP, f\/1.8 main sensor, a 12MP, f\/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, and a 12MP, f\/2.2 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The hardware is decent enough, but it's old and performs like you'd expect of four-year-old lenses. The one entirely positive thing I can say about the Galaxy S25's cameras is that they include a telephoto sensor, which is crucial and isn't a given on flagships of this size. Some phones, like the iPhone 16 and Pixel 9, try to fake optical zoom using a technique called sensor crop. Nothing beats the real thing, and I love that the Galaxy S25 gives you 3x optical zoom in a 6.2-inch device. Paired with the ultrawide lens, the camera system makes for varying zoom levels, as shown in the gallery below. Samsung tries to make the most of the same camera hardware with computational photography improvements, like usual. There's some evidence to suggest that the Galaxy S25 is improved in a few areas, such as shutter lag and motion blur. However, keep expectations tame. The Samsung Galaxy S25's camera is still no match for a moving car on a nighttime street. I've also found the Galaxy S25 camera to produce colors that look slightly dull compared to cameras in other flagships. I'm glad that Samsung doesn't take the Pixel approach, which includes over-saturating colors and adding faux vibrancy. I do think iPhone shots have a better natural pop of color, though. The front-facing camera is only 12MP, but it gets the job done. Put simply, you're not buying the Galaxy S25 for its camera system. If that's something you really care about, you have no choice but to look to the OnePlus 13 or Galaxy S25 Ultra for that.  I've been a consistent critic of Samsung's software approach, specifically One UI, in recent years. It got to the point that I refused to consider Samsung phones as my daily driver. That's why it should say a lot that I love One UI 7. I'm not sure if it's leaped the Pixel Launcher yet, but it's ahead of OxygenOS, Hello UI, and iOS in my book. That's something I couldn't even fathom saying before trying One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25. What makes One UI 7 so great? It's hard to pinpoint one feature or two \u2014 it's more about how fresh and new the operating system feels. I prefer the split control panel\/notification shade from iOS, and I genuinely like the bubbly and rounded look of One UI now. The app drawer is better, too. You can finally switch between One UI and other Android skins without the learning curve. Everything just makes sense. Another big reason for my newfound One UI 7 love affair is the integration between Google and Samsung apps and services. The two companies are finally figuring out how to work together and deliver a cohesive software experience. It comes down to the little things, like how Google Messages is the default and only messaging app installed on the Galaxy S25. Or how the supercharged Gemini assistant is accessible with the press of a side button and can take multi-app actions on your behalf. Of course, there's more to improve. Samsung should work on cutting down on the bloat further and eliminating unnecessary third-party apps from stock One UI. I don't know why my Galaxy S25 ships with LinkedIn and other Microsoft apps, but I hate it.  It wasn't too long ago when I recommended that Android buyers pick a Pixel due to Google's exclusive perks. Now, the situation feels reversed. The Galaxy S25 gets many of Google's best AI features, from Gemini to Circle to Search, and it gets Samsung's full Galaxy AI suite. It's like the best of both worlds. Not every AI feature will be worth using. The Now Bar, a pill-shaped center for information, is overhyped by Samsung. If you're deep in the Samsung ecosystem or use select supported services like Spotify, it'll be neat. But I usually don't wear a Galaxy wearable and use Apple Music, so my Now Bar just told me the weather and inspirational quotes all day. Which, hey, is nice. Just not all that useful.  One thing worth calling out is how good Samsung's image editing features have gotten over the years. Object removal and generative editing with Galaxy AI is hands-down better than anything Apple or Google offer, as you can see above. To sum up, if you haven't used One UI in a while or have been disappointed by it in the past, it's time to give it a second chance.  At the moment, the $799 Samsung Galaxy S25's biggest competitors are the Google Pixel 9 and the iPhone 16. You could argue that prospective Galaxy S25 buyers probably aren't considering an iPhone 16 and vice versa, so that leaves the Pixel 9 \u2014 also priced at $799. There are some who will prefer Google's software or camera profile to that of the Galaxy S25, but I have a hard time swallowing how much bigger and heavier the Pixel is without providing enough benefits. The Samsung phone is thinner, lighter, and more compact but also faster and more capable. With the Pixel 9 and iPhone 16 out of the way, there isn't a phone that directly competes with the Galaxy S25 in terms of size. However, if you're looking for an Android flagship for around $800 and can live with a bigger screen, consider the OnePlus 13 for $100 more. It's only a smidge slower than the Galaxy S25 while offering a better display, better camera, faster charging, and more base storage. This is the phone I'd buy if I were looking for a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra-esque phone at near-base Galaxy S25 prices.  You should buy this if... You shouldn't buy this if... After spending time with the Samsung Galaxy S25, two things are simultaneously true. This is a standout compact flagship, and Samsung also could've given it more upgrades. It feels like it's the same story every time a Galaxy device is released. There's just enough to make the Galaxy S25 a really compelling device and just as many recycled ideas and components to make buyers hesitate. As I mentioned before, I'm concerned that buying the Galaxy S25 signals to Samsung that releasing four generations of phones with the same camera system is acceptable. It's simply not, and it feels like a sales hit may be the only thing that pushes Samsung to innovate more. The phone's cameras, charging speeds, durability ratings, and connectivity capabilities are just the quick hits of things Samsung could've easily improved with the Galaxy S25 \u2014 but chose not to. I'm also aware that most smartphone buyers aren't trying to make a statement with their phone purchases. Most people just want a good, powerful, and reliable device, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 checks all those boxes. It's also perhaps the only compact Android flagship left on the market today. That's how I'm able to recommend it despite my frustration with how much Samsung reused from prior Galaxy generations.   Small but mighty Samsung's Galaxy S25 might not feel the most exciting, but it's definitively the best small flagship phone in 2025. If you can look past some deficiencies compared to the Plus or Ultra models, the Galaxy S25 is a solid buy at around $800.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"WillScot (WSC) Holdings stock inched up on Thursday after the modular buildings and portable storage containers company was reported to be in talks with the federal government to house undocumented immigrants. Semafor, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has met with Phoenix, Arizona-based WillScot about housing detained undocumented migrants in its mobile structures. WillScot makes portable offices, classrooms, restrooms, and other configurable units. Often, its structures are used on construction sites.  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration aims to return \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of undocumented migrants back to their countries of origin. More than 11 million people without legal immigration status live in the U.S. as of 2022, the last year data is available. About 8.3 million of them participate in the U.S. economy. Over the past few weeks, ICE has conducted a slew of enforcement actions \u2014 several of them public, including one broadcast by Phil McGraw, also known as \u201cDr. Phil.\u201d However, daily arrests are roughly at the same level they were at under former President Barack Obama, Politico reports.  The White House on Wednesday said that more than 400 migrants were released due to several reasons, including a lack of capacity. On Tuesday, the first flight carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay arrived at the naval base in Cuba, where the Trump administration plans to send up to 30,000 people.  Currently, the base can hold just 120 migrants. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has suggested that the base\u2019s golf course could be converted to build housing for 6,000 migrants. Semafor reports that WillScot\u2019s buildings could help house migrants at either Guantanamo Bay or along the U.S. southern border.  WillScot\u2019s stock rose almost 3% in trading Thursday afternoon on the news. Shares are up by more than 10% year-to-date. The company reports its fourth-quarter earnings later this month.  Although such a deal is good for WillScot, it\u2019s bad for private prison operators, who were expected to be a major beneficiary of Trump\u2019s deportation plans.  \u201cThis is, to us, an unprecedented opportunity,\u201d GEO Group (GEO) Executive Chairman George Zoley said in a November earnings call.  GEO, ICE\u2019s largest contractor, has about 13,500 beds for migrants, although executives have said it could scale up to more than 31,000 beds in the short term, Business Insider reported. CoreCivic (CXW) told The Wall Street Journal it could quickly bring its detention capacity to 25,000 beds by bringing unused facilities back online.  CoreCivic stock has grown by more than 32% over the past 12 months, backed by a post-election boom, but has shed more than 14% over the past 30 days. Shares are down by more than 2% on Thursday.  GEO stock is down by almost 3% in trading Thursday, bringing its month-long decline to 5%. But the stock has exploded by 145% over the last year.  On November 5, 2024, the day before the U.S. election, GEO\u2019s stock closed at $15.13 a pop. At its recent peak on Jan. 17, shares were worth more than $35 each, but are now about $27 per share.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Valve might be reviving its console ambitions. A recent report from HandleDeck.com suggests that the company is working on drivers for the RDNA4-based AMD Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards. This is particularly intriguing because the RDNA4 architecture is currently designed for desktop GPUs. If Valve is developing drivers for these high-end GPUs, it could hint at plans for a new Steam gaming console, a potential spiritual successor to Valve\u2019s failed Steam Machine ambitions. Valve has seen immense success with the Steam Deck. This proves that there is a strong market for portable, PC-based gaming devices. The positive reception of the Steam Deck might have encouraged Valve to take another stab at a home console. According to the report, Valve is working on desktop consoles that are branded with the SteamOS license. Also, by working on the drivers for the RX 9070, it suggests that this could be the main GPU for the rumored console. However, before you get too excited, the report offers an alternate possibility. These drivers could be used to help support an external GPU for the Steam Deck 2, so that\u2019s something to think about. For those unfamiliar, nearly a decade ago, Valve made an ambitious attempt to break into the home console market. This resulted in the Steam Machines. These consoles were meant to provide an alternative way for players to enjoy games from their Steam libraries. It was also Valve\u2019s way of trying to disrupt Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo\u2019s hold in the console market. However, the concept failed to take off, and Valve discontinued the consoles back in 2018. Your email address will not be published.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Long before Sonos got in the business of shipping cursed apps, the connected audio company had dreams of releasing a MagSafe speaker for iPhone. Sonos demise documenter Chris Welch at The Verge has the scoop on the product that could have been. According to Welch, Sonos wanted to develop \u201ca miniature speaker that could magnetically\u201d attach to the back of iPhones, to attract Gen Z customers. Here\u2019s more from his report: According to images that I\u2019ve seen, Sonos envisioned a more rectangular design. The prototypes were the same overall shape and size as\u00a0Apple\u2019s discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack, but thicker. Early on, Sonos hoped the magnetic speaker would showcase the innovative transducer technology that came with its\u00a0acquisition of Mayht Holding in 2022\u00a0and deliver surprisingly good sound at a compact size. But technical limitations, questionable appeal, and a limited target market ultimately led to the device being scrapped. A MagSafe speaker for the iPhone isn\u2019t the worst idea in the world, and Sonos always finds clever ways to innovate with audio. Hopefully, the company isn\u2019t actually in demise either. However, the company did just let go of 12 percent of its workforce, perhaps to make itself a more appealing acquisition target. As long as Samsung doesn\u2019t acquire the brand, its quality hardware will hopefully continue to speak for itself. In the meantime, take your pick at any number of mini MagSafe speakers that surely sound worse than the iPhone\u2019s built-in speaker. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Honeywell, one of the last remaining U.S. industrial conglomerates, will split into three independent companies, following in the footsteps of manufacturing giants like General Electric and Alcoa. The company said Thursday that it will separate from its automation and aerospace technologies businesses. Including plans announced earlier to spin off its advanced materials business, Honeywell will consist of three smaller entities in hopes that they will each be more agile. \"The formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,\u201d Honeywell Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur said in a statement. Honeywell had said in December that it was considering spinning off its aerospace division. The public announcement arrived about one month after Elliott Investment Management revealed a stake of more than $5 billion in the aerospace, automation and materials company. Elliott had been pushing for the Charlotte, North Carolina, company to separate its automation and aerospace businesses. The board of Honeywell International Inc. had been exploring strategic options for the company since earlier in 2024. The company, which makes everything from eye solution to barcode readers, has been seeking ways to make itself more nimble. Over the past year and a half, just after Kapur took over as CEO, Honeywell has announced plans for the advanced materials business spinoff, entered into an agreement to sell its personal protective equipment business, and made several acquisitions. The separation of the automation and aerospace technologies businesses is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026. The spinoff of the advanced materials business is anticipated to be completed by the end of this year or early next year. Like Honeywell, other U.S. conglomerates have been pressured by shareholders to simplify their structures, allowing each segment of the company to move more freely and adapt to changes in their respective markets. Iconic CEOs like Jack Welch of General Electric spent years building corporate American behemoths with the belief that with scale came power. Yet those massive companies were forced to compete with upstarts with a narrow focus and a more clearly defined set of goals. Investors also wanted a more clear view of the priorities within each division, which became more murky as the companies grew. In 2015 metals maker Alcoa said that it was splitting into two independent companies, separating its bauxite, aluminum and casting operations from its engineering, transportation and global rolled products businesses. GE announced in 2021 that it was dividing itself into three public companies focused on aviation, health care and energy. At the time, the move was viewed as a potential signal of the end of conglomerates as a whole thanks to the move toward a digital economy. Shares fell almost 3% before the market opened Thursday.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"President Donald Trump has spent much of the interregnum, and now his first weeks back in office, threatening American allies in one way or another, with Canada among the countries taking the most fire.\u00a0 His weapon of choice is the tariff, which the president calls the \u201cmost beautiful word.\u201d On Saturday, he slapped a punitive 25% tariff on Canadian goods to address a perceived trade imbalance. Following a flurry of last-minute negotiations, however, Trump has placed a 30-day pause on the tariffs. However, Trump's tariff threat remains clear and present, especially given that Trump has promised to deploy \u201ceconomic force\u201d if Canada proves unwilling to agree to annexation and becoming the U.S.\u2019s 51st state. While Trump\u2019s protectionism and imperial designs are a sharp break with the recent past, they aren\u2019t new. In fact, they\u2019re part of a very old GOP playbook that dates to a period Trump regularly lionizes: the late 19th century. He sees it as a golden era in American history. Yet, the history of the 1890s actually exposes the dangers of the U.S. trying to force Canada into American hands.  Like Trump, Republicans in the late 19th century wanted to annex Canada\u2014which was then still a British colony. The push to make Canada part of the U.S. reached a fever pitch following passage of the highly protectionist McKinley Tariff in 1890, which raised average tariff rates to around 50%.  To pressure Canada into joining the U.S., the McKinley tariff explicitly declined to make an exception for Canadian products. Republicans hoped that Canadians, who were becoming ever more reliant on the U.S. market, would be eager to become the 45th state to avoid the punishing tariffs.  Read More: Trump Shares the Founders' Delusions on Canada Secretary of State James G. Blaine saw annexation as a way to eliminate continued and contentious competition over fish and timber. Blaine, who co-authored the McKinley Tariff, publicly stated that he hoped for \u201ca grander and nobler brotherly love, that may unite in the end\u201d the United States and Canada \u201cin one perfect union.\u201d Blaine declared himself \u201cteetotally opposed to giving the Canadians the sentimental satisfaction of waving the British Flag. . . and enjoying the actual remuneration of American markets.\u201d Privately, he admitted to President Benjamin Harrison that by denying reciprocity, Canada would \u201cultimately, I believe, seek admission to the Union.\u201d Officials and free trade advocates in both Britain and Canada also understood the implications of the McKinley Tariff. Members of the Cobden Club, a prominent and influential London-based free-trade organization, called it an \u201coutrage on civilization\u201d\u2014one that promised \u201cto lead to the [American] annexation of Canada.\u201d British Liberal Lyon Playfair warned that the law looked like \u201ca covert attack on Canada.\u201d If the tariff act\u2019s objective \u201creally be (as the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John Macdonald, thinks) to force the United States lion and the Canadian lamb to lie down together, this can only be accomplished by the lamb being inside the lion,\u201d he warned. Yet, though both sides were convinced that the tariff would drive Canada into the arms of the U.S., it actually had the opposite effect. Nationalistic Canadians argued that the tariff was \u201ca heavy blow struck alike at our home industries and at the prosperity and independence of the Dominion of Canada \u2014 an unprovoked aggression, an attempt at conquest by fiscal war.\u201d  Rather than compelling Canadians to seek annexation, the tariff stirred \u201clove for Queen, flag, and country,\u201d according to George T. Denison, president of the British Empire League in Canada. The majority of Canadians saw the McKinley tariff as part of \u201ca conspiracy\u201d to \u201cbetray this country into annexation.\u201d They were having none of it. Their cultural and political ties with the British Empire, as well as their anger over the attempted coercion, proved stronger. Canada\u2019s Conservative Prime Minister John Macdonald wanted to react forcefully to send a message to the U.S. He proposed retaliating with high tariffs on American goods, as well as increased trade with Britain. He also recognized a political weapon when he was handed one. He adroitly turned the 1891 Canadian elections into a broader referendum concerning Canadian-American relations. He portrayed the Liberal opposition as being in bed with the Republican annexationists. According to him, they were involved in \u201ca deliberate conspiracy, by force, by fraud, or by both, to force Canada into the American union.\u201d  Read More: What Are Tariffs and Why Is Trump In Favor of Them? After playing \u201cthe \u2018Loyalty\u2019 cry for all it was worth,\u201d Macdonald scored a narrow victory over those favoring friendlier and more open relations with the U.S. The U.S.\u2019s loss was Britain\u2019s gain. Within two years of the McKinley Tariff\u2019s passage, Canadian agricultural exports to Britain jumped from $3.5 million to $15 million, and produce and animal exports grew from $16 million to $24 million. Beginning in 1897, Canadians began granting preferential market access to British imports. And U.S. manufacturers continued to move production to Canada to bypass its tariff walls. Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce Mackenzie Bowell happily informed his colleagues in the Canadian Senate that \u201cthe McKinley Bill, instead of destroying the trade of this country, has only diverted it from the United States to England.\"  He continued, \"Our neighbors are cutting off their own noses to spite us.\u201d  This episode ought to serve as a warning for Trump. Far from enabling the U.S. to annex Canada, the McKinley Tariff that Trump so admires drove the U.S.\u2019s neighbor to the North into the arms of its main economic rival, the British.  Once again, an American president is on the brink of imposing tariffs against Canada and pushing for annexation. The two issues will undoubtedly be central in the 2025 Canadian elections. Trump\u2019s threats could easily backfire as the McKinley Tariff did\u2014leading to the election of Canadian politicians who promise to stand up to him, respond tit-for-tat to any tariffs he enacts, and seek other trade partners instead. The result would be U.S. consumers paying the price at checkout lines. U.S. manufacturers might also decide to relocate to Canada. And the tariff spat could spark further conflicts with Canada down the road. In other words, \u201cTariff Man\u201d Trump would once again be cutting off his country\u2019s nose to spite Canada.

No matter the shopping technique, we all have to get groceries from somewhere. But which grocery stores do people in the U.S. love most? The answer is in data analytics firm YouGov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent ranking of the most-loved chains.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Food & Wine reports that YouGov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s researchers interviewed 1220 people in the U.S. from October to December of last year to gain an accurate representation of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion. Ranking is based on two main criteria: \u00e2\u0080\u009cfame\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the number of respondents that have heard of the chain), and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpopularity\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the number that rated it favorably). Convenience store chains that also sell groceries were included in the survey as well.\u00c2\u00a0 Believe it or not, 7-Eleven is the top pick among the general public. Although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better known for its gas and convenience food items over its fresh groceries, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more popular than any other brand on the list. Sixty-five percent of participants like the chain. 7-Eleven is also the most famous chain, with 97 percent of the interviewees having heard of it. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest franchises. In the Japanese market, 7-Elevens hew closer to the traditional grocery store model, and U.S. stores are now trying to emulate this by stocking fresher, seasonal inventory. Only 8 percent of people dislike the franchise, while 24 percent feel neutral about it. Trader Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is the second most-loved grocery store, with 64 percent of people liking the place. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also pretty well-known, with 94 percent of respondents recognizing it. Trader Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is famous for its snacks, with customers rating their Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled Tortilla Chips and the Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones highly. Just 5 percent dislike the store, and 25 percent of people are neutral about it. Whole Foods Market concludes the top three entires on the list. The franchise used to have incredibly high prices, even earning the nickname \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhole Paycheck.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, some sources have found that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to save money by shopping at Whole Foods over other conventional grocery chains. This change may be part of the reason why only 8 percent of the interviewees in this study dislike the store, while 61 percent think positively about it. Moreover, Whole Foods is pretty famous, with 95 percent of people having heard about it. Twenty-seven percent are indifferent about the store.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"ReSound Vivia hearing aids For those of us who have relied on hearing aids for decades, the evolution of hearing technology is more than just an industry shift it is a lifestyle transformation. My lifelong relationship with hearing aids has been one of adaptation, frustration, and empowerment. What was once niche technology designed for a small population with prescriptive hearing needs is now shaping mass-market accessibility and consumer tech. Features pioneered in hearing aids, such as personalized sound processing, noise management, and Bluetooth connectivity, have become the foundation for mainstream innovation \u2013 from AirPods to over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids and AI-driven consumer audio.  Hearing accessibility has moved from medical necessity to market opportunity, and this shift is only beginning. A defining moment in accessibility came with ReSound LiNX, one of the first Made for iPhone (MFi) hearing aids. This was not just a technical leap, it redefined hearing aids from standalone medical devices to smart, connected wearables; yes, hearing aids are wearables! MFi allowed me to seamlessly take calls, stream audio, and adjust settings directly from my iPhone. More importantly, hearing accessibility could integrate into mainstream consumer tech rather than exist in isolation. That innovation did not stay in the hearing aid industry. Apple took what it learned from MFi hearing aids and applied it to consumer audio. The first MFi hearing aids predated AirPods, and the advancements in wireless connectivity and personal audio processing paved the way for the Apple 2024 launch of the AirPods Pro 2, an FDA-approved OTC hearing aid. The implications were clear: accessibility is not just about medical or American Disability Act (ADA) compliance; it is a market driver. The journey did not stop there. ReSound continued to push hearing technology forward, introducing Omnia, which delivered intelligent noise filtering \u2013 helping users like me stay engaged in conversations without battling overwhelming background noise. Then came ReSound Nexia, powered by Auracast, which set a new standard for public space communication, which I have experienced and worked consistently at Lincoln Center in NYC last Fall and at last month\u2019s CES event in Vegas. These are not just hearing aid improvements. They represent a fundamental shift in how sound is accessed in public spaces, opening doors for hospitality, entertainment, and workplace tech industries to rethink how they deliver audio to consumers. Now, we are entering an era where AI is revolutionizing hearing accessibility.  Enter ReSound Vivia, designed to learn from me. Instead of just amplifying sound, it understands how I hear and do not hear, adapting to my unique hearing profile. Laurel Christensen, Chief Audiology Officer at ReSound, describes Vivia as a hearing aid that enhances the user\u2019s natural hearing intuition, allowing people to focus effortlessly on what matters most, even in complex sound environments. She explains that ReSound Vivia employs a human-centric approach to AI, aiming to empower users to instinctively decide on their auditory focus at any given time. This is a paradigm shift. Instead of me adjusting my hearing aids, Vivia adjusts to my profile by learning, refining, and dynamically optimizing my experience based on my real-world needs. For business leaders, this is a blueprint for AI-driven consumer tech \u2014 products that do not just react but continuously learn and adapt to users in a highly personalized way. The hearing aid industry has long been a quiet leader in hearing innovation, but it is now at the forefront of consumer tech\u2019s next significant evolution. With the FDA\u2019s approval of OTC hearing aids, companies like ReSound, Apple, Bose, Sony, and EssilorLuxottica target a broader consumer market. Once seen as a medical device niche, the hearing tech sector is rapidly expanding into the $100+ billion consumer audio market. Why Does This Matter? A new player entering this space is EssilorLuxottica, the eyewear giant behind Ray-Ban, Oakley, and Persol. With its Nuance Audio brand, the company is expanding into the OTC hearing market, integrating directional sound technology into eyewear. This marks an essential convergence of wearables, fashion, and accessibility. Unlike traditional hearing aids, Nuance Audio glasses aim to discreetly enhance hearing while blending into daily routines \u2014 a potential game-changer for first-time hearing aid users who may be reluctant to wear a traditional device. Notably, EssilorLuxottica received FDA clearance for Nuance Audio on February 3, 2025. The company plans to launch in the U.S. and Italy in Q1 2025, followed by other European countries in the first half of the year. The timing of this announcement, alongside ReSound's unveiling of Vivia, is no accident. It underscores a strategic industry shift toward integrating advanced hearing solutions into everyday consumer products, signaling a new era of accessible, user-friendly hearing technology. The next wave of hearing accessibility innovation will likely focus on: Hearing, especially profound loss like mine, presents technological challenges that no single device can fully solve. But my journey has shown me that accessibility fuels innovation and when done right, it does not just help those with hearing loss. It creates better hearing experiences for everyone. My own experiences navigating a world designed for those with typical hearing have underscored the gaps in current technology and communication environments. Yet, these challenges are not unique to me, they impact millions who struggle with hearing in noisy spaces, on calls, or in public venues. This reality makes the business case clear: when companies invest in accessible design \u2014 whether through better soundscapes, smarter technology, or inclusive communication tools \u2014 they are not just meeting a niche need, they are enhancing the experience for a broader audience, improving productivity, customer engagement, and overall quality of life. That is not just the future of accessibility. That is the future of business, and the companies that embrace it will shape the next generation of consumer technology.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"  When a business finds success in its given market, expanding further into more markets is the logical next step. However, before jumping immediately into action and expansion plans, entrepreneurs must seriously consider both the benefits a new market can offer and the potential risks. As experts, the members of Forbes Business Council have navigated the risks that come with expanding into a new territory. Below, 20 members offer tips on how entrepreneurs can expand a business into a new market while minimizing risk to revenue growth. To minimize risk when expanding into a new market, conduct thorough research to assess demand, competition and regulations. Start small with a pilot program, adapt based on feedback and partner with local experts. Diversify entry strategies, monitor progress and stay aligned with your core mission for sustainable growth. - John F. McQuillan, Triumvirate Environmental, Inc. Identify the differences between your current market and the expanded market. Then, create a plan to mitigate those differences. Also, do a deeper analysis on why your business works in the current market to identify improvements, reuse strategies and systems and do it better in the new market. - Minna Hu, AI Bookkeeper Begin by engaging with customers to identify gaps in existing market products. Then, test the value proposition and product features to gauge how well they resonate with customers without fully developing the product. If the feedback is positive, proceed with a pilot test to further validate the idea. - Sachin Malik, GigaML Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify? Expanding into a new market can fuel growth but it requires strategic planning to minimize the risks. First, ensure the company is ready with solid resources and a strong foundation. Create an operating model that balances core business focus with enough capacity and autonomy for the new market. Founder involvement is key to ensuring alignment, knowledge transfer and smooth execution. - Hans Kristian Aas, Casi If you're seeking to minimize your risk, then expanding into a new market probably isn't what you should be doing. The best you can do is to identify risks that naturally arise when making such a move, and then either accept them or develop plans to deal with them should they materialize. Contingency planning for major market pivots is essential. - Ben Jones, Data Literacy Every business savant will tell you the path with the least risk lies in markets adjacent to your core. For example, you shouldn't decide to open an ice cream stand if you don\u2019t know anything about ice cream stands. Moving into adjacent markets will teach you precisely nothing about yourself, your people and your offering that you don't already know. - Christian Davies FCSD, Bergmeyer My advice is to start small. Test the market with one specific product to understand demand before fully committing. Insights from local partnerships, such as trusted community members or dedicated country managers, can help you further refine your strategy. - Rytis Lauris, Omnisend Start with a pilot launch in the new market. Test your product or service with a smaller, targeted audience to gather insights on local preferences, pricing and demand. This allows you to adapt your strategy before full-scale entry, minimizing financial risk and ensuring a better fit with market needs. - Wayne Liang, Liang Holdings With a new market comes a necessary realignment of brand messaging. Specifically, this is a deep understanding of the new brand archetype the company will need to embody for its new market. A misalignment in the brand association will cause catastrophic exposure to the brand, as evidenced by the recent TikTok viral marketing failure of the 4theMems pajama launch. - Kenda Laney, Laney Media Create an ecosystem map to identify opportunities for growth and minimize risks when entering a new market. This visual strategy provides us with a representation of key players and the overall market dynamics so we can identify opportunities, gaps and strategic partnerships to understand the landscape before we launch. - Adam Povlitz, Anago Cleaning Systems The most effective approach is to officially establish a subsidiary tailored to the specific region. This not only allows for precise tracking of which market generates the most profit but also enables the optimization of strategies based on its performance. Moreover, in the event of significant revenue growth, it safeguards the parent company from potential financial risks. - Jekaterina Beljankova, WALLACE s.r.o Establish strategic partnerships with local businesses in new markets. This approach allows you to tap into existing networks, understand local consumer behavior, and navigate regulatory landscapes with less risk. It has worked well by providing a safety net for revenue while accelerating market penetration through trusted local allies, ensuring both parties benefit from the expansion. - Dr. Clemen Chiang, Spiking Hire consultants who are experts in the local geographies you wish to expand to. When we looked at expanding into China, we worked with a consultant who helped us avoid the typical mistakes other companies make. For example, he convinced us to localize our infrastructure so we would comply with regulations and be taken seriously. A few years later, China was generating my company $100M+ annually. - Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures Set up content creation hubs in the new market to tailor your marketing materials to the locals\u2019 wants and preferences. Then, strengthen this approach by partnering with local influencers and brand ambassadors. Their authentic voices and established credibility will help your brand connect deeply and effectively with the local audience, driving engagement and building trust. - Ran Ronen, Equally AI Expand into adjacent markets by leveraging your reputation in your current field. Every niche has a related sub-niche; identify overlaps where your expertise aligns with new opportunities. This approach minimizes risk by building on established credibility, repurposing resources and addressing complementary needs within a familiar audience. - Aaron Knipp, Cicospace I work with a team of contractors. The flexibility they are able to provide in terms of hours and skill sets has allowed me to successfully bridge the gap between my old business model and growth in new markets. - Emily Reynolds Bergh, R Public Relations Firm For high-capital expansions into new markets, the No. 1 rule is to limit your commitments to long-term, ongoing costs. Rent the minimal space you need to operate instead of building out new spaces from scratch. Rather than hiring full-time employees, assemble your teams with contract arrangements. Tiptoe in, create a manageable footprint, strategically test your expenditures and be adaptable. - Dr. David Lenihan, Tiber Health A tip for minimizing risk during market expansion is leveraging the Ansoff Matrix. Begin with market penetration to strengthen relationships with existing customers and ensure stability. Then, shift to market development, testing new customer segments or regions incrementally. This phased, data-driven approach minimizes risk and fosters sustainable revenue growth. - Vincent Gregoire, Musart To expand into a new market while minimizing risk, listen to your clients and analyze industry benchmarks. Focus on diversifying your offerings within the same industry, tailoring them to emerging trends and client needs. This approach leverages existing expertise while tapping into new opportunities, ensuring a strategic and lower-risk expansion. - Raquel Gomes, Stafi Be patient and never let your growth outpace your capacity. Take the time necessary to learn all you can about the market. Research and data are your greatest allies here. Be thorough and lean on experts in your field and the local community. Whether it's launching a new business or opening another office, I\u2019ve never regretted having thorough research inform my decisions. - Brad Benbow, Prolific ","label":0}

In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term Jet2 plc (LON:JET2) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 20% over a half decade. It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that.  See our latest analysis for Jet2  While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement. Jet2 became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time. We don't think that the 1.0% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. Revenue is actually up 34% over the time period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity. The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts Jet2 provided a TSR of 16% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. The silver lining is that the share price is up in the short term, which flies in the face of the annualised loss of 3% over the last five years. While 'turnarounds seldom turn' there are green shoots for Jet2. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start.

Shares of major tech companies surged in the past two years on the belief that massive datacenter needs for artificial-intelligence technologies would power investment for years.  Still, Amazon may be better positioned than rivals to capitalize on cheaper AI, analysts say, due to its massive cloud business and lower exposure to costly large-language models that power apps such as ChatGPT.

(Reuters) -The three major stock indexes closed higher on Tuesday, aided by energy stocks, while investors saw reason for optimism for a trade breakthrough between the U.S. and China after President Donald Trump delayed tariffs for Canada and Mexico.  New 10% U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports took effect on Tuesday, which China countered with levies on U.S. goods.  It was unclear when the country's leaders would talk and Trump said he was in no hurry. Corporate treasurers are ramping up efforts to guard company earnings against more dollar strength, a move that some analysts said points to increased conviction that President Donald Trump's tariff plans will help keep the U.S. currency higher for longer.  The U.S. dollar index is about 7% above its September lows, hovering close to a two-year high reached in January as investors bought the buck on expectations it would benefit from sturdy U.S. economic growth and Trump's protectionist trade policies.  Corporate treasurers, who often use forward contracts, currency options and swaps to reduce potential losses from currency fluctuations, typically move at a more staid pace.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"You no longer need to sign in to use ChatGPT Search. \u201cChatGPT search is now available to everyone on chatgpt.com,\u201d OpenAI said in a post on X announcing the change, adding, \u201cNo sign up required.\u201d The move makes it easier than ever to use ChatGPT Search, and increases the pressure on Google, which has dominated online search for decades. Other search-focused AI chatbots like Perplexity may also feel the impact of ChatGPT Search becoming more accessible. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search in October 2024, about two years after it released its regular AI-powered chatbot, which quickly garnered worldwide attention for the way it responded to online queries in a conversational way, saving users from having to trawl through endless search results to find what they\u2019re looking for. The regular ChatGPT chatbot is trained on a huge dataset up to a specific cutoff date and doesn\u2019t access real-time information, whereas ChatGPT Search accesses dynamic, real-time information. The AI chatbot is considered ideal for tasks like creative writing, brainstorming, and general knowledge inquiries that don\u2019t require access to recent data, whereas ChatGPT Search is useful for obtaining the latest news, weather updates, stock prices, and other time-sensitive information. Another key difference is that ChatGPT Search lists its sources, including links, so you can click through to particular pages to find out more, if you wish. This makes it very similar to one of its popular rivals, Perplexity. On the web interface, you simply head to ChatGPT.com and click on the \u201cSearch\u201d button inside the prompt box. Once you\u2019ve selected it, you\u2019re good to enter your prompt. As part of the response, you\u2019ll see small boxes showing the origins of the sources. Click on one to visit the page from which ChatGPT pulled its information. Additionally, you can hit the \u201cSources\u201d button at the end of the response, which brings up a column showing the sources in list form. OpenAI is having a busy start to the year, recently launching an AI agent called Operator, which autonomously performs web-based tasks, and also Deep Research, an AI system that autonomously conducts multi-step research tasks, with both features designed to enhance user productivity. DeepSeek, the chatbot made by a Chinese startup that seemingly dethroned ChatGPT, is taking the world by storm. It's currently the number one topic all over the news, and a lot has happened in the past 24 hours. Among other highlights, Nvidia's stock plummeted as a response to DeepSeek; President Donald Trump commented on the new AI; Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a team to find an answer to DeepSeek. Below, we'll cover all the latest news you need to know about DeepSeek. Nvidia gets hit by the rise of DeepSeek Although ChatGPT is the chatbot that quickly lost its public favorite status with the rise of DeepSeek, Nvidia is the company that suffered the greatest losses. In fact, Nvidia's market loss following the launch of DeepSeek's large language model (LLM) marks the greatest one-day stock market drop in history, says Forbes. Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion as a result of the Chinese company behind DeepSeek revealing just how cheap the new LLM is to develop in comparison to rivals from Anthropic, Meta, or OpenAI. A year-old startup out of China is taking the AI industry by storm after releasing a chatbot which rivals the performance of ChatGPT while using a fraction of the power, cooling, and training expense of what OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic's systems demand. Here's everything you need to know about Deepseek's V3 and R1 models and why the company could fundamentally upend America's AI ambitions. What is DeepSeek? DeepSeek (technically, \"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd.\") is a Chinese AI startup that was originally founded as an AI lab for its parent company, High-Flyer, in April, 2023. That May, DeepSeek was spun off into its own company (with High-Flyer remaining on as an investor) and also released its DeepSeek-V2 model. V2 offered performance on par with other leading Chinese AI firms, such as ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu, but at a much lower operating cost. The company followed up with the release of V3 in December 2024. V3 is a 671 billion-parameter model that reportedly took less than 2 months to train. What's more, according to a recent analysis from Jeffries, DeepSeek's \u201ctraining cost of only US$5.6m (assuming $2\/H800 hour rental cost). That is less than 10% of the cost of Meta\u2019s Llama.\u201d That's a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars that US firms like Google, Microsoft, xAI, and OpenAI have spent training their models. OpenAI has announced its AI agent tool, called Operator, as a research preview as of Thursday, but the launch isn\u2019t without its minor hiccups. The artificial intelligence brand showcased features of the new tool in an online demo, explaining that Operator is a Computer Using Agent (CUA) based on the GPT-4o model, which enables multi-modal functions, such as the ability to search the web and being able to understand the reasoning of the search results.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Image credits: Saad Ismail The idea of a foldable iPhone has hovered over the tech world like a mirage\u2014always in sight, never within reach. Over the years, concept renders have fueled speculation, showing everything from dual-hinged designs to clamshell form factors reminiscent of the Motorola Razr. None of these iPhone concepts ever materialized, leaving Apple on the sidelines as Samsung, Google, and others carved out their share of the foldable market. But with leaks and patents hinting at a potential iPhone Flip or Fold, the conversation is heating up again. And this time, it might actually lead somewhere. These rumors aren\u2019t like your average speculations \u2013 they\u2019re reports from the supply chain which I\u2019d probably take a little more seriously than a \u2018what if\u2019 from Ming-Chi Kuo or Mark Gurman. A reliable tipster with inside information from Apple\u2019s multiple suppliers shared a massive list of specs on X (or Twitter as I still prefer to call it) that could feature in this upcoming phone. The device is likely to have a left-side folding mechanism, quite like the folding phone of Apple\u2019s competitors, such as Samsung and OnePlus. When closed, it will measure 9.2 mm thick, with each half at just 4.6 mm\u2014an engineering challenge that Apple seems determined to solve. The internal screen will span over 12 inches when unfolded, putting it in direct competition with tablets rather than smartphones. This suggests a shift in how Apple envisions foldables, probably as a bridge between existing phones and their popular iPad tablets. Designer: Apple       Apple\u2019s supply chain reveals that Foxconn is handling exclusive New Product Introduction (NPI) starting mid-2025, with mass production slated for late 2025 or early 2026. The official launch is expected in Fall 2026, marking Apple\u2019s first real foray into foldables. Sales projections are ambitious\u20148 to 10 million units in the first year, doubling to 20 million in 2027. Apple\u2019s cautious approach means it\u2019s aiming for a refined product rather than an experimental first-gen device. If it meets expectations, this could shift the entire foldable market, much like the iPhone did for smartphones.  Samsung remains Apple\u2019s sole supplier for the foldable display, with an under-development Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) layer that will likely cost between $90 and $100. This high-end material choice suggests Apple is aiming to minimize creasing while ensuring durability. The screen support frame is still undecided, with titanium alloy, stainless steel, and carbon fiber all in consideration. Given Apple\u2019s recent move toward titanium in its Pro models, that might be the strongest contender.       The hinge is easily the toughest nut to crack and Apple\u2019s probably going to over-engineer this to the point of being industrial art. It\u2019s rumored to be designed entirely in-house with components sourced from Amphenol and Taiwan\u2019s Xinyiheng. It allegedly costs approximately $110 per unit, making it one of the most expensive elements of the device. Additional internal components, including MIM parts and reinforcement structures, bring the total hinge-related expenses to around $150. Apple\u2019s meticulous approach to hinge durability suggests it wants to avoid the early pitfalls seen in first-generation foldables from other brands. Structurally, the device will feature an aluminum midframe priced at $80\u2013$90, with Foxconn handling initial production and LanSi and BYD Electronics joining later. The flexible printed circuit board (PCB) might see a significant value jump, with some modules nearly doubling in cost. Apple\u2019s planned shift to Resin-Coated Copper (RCC) for SLP boards will increase efficiency, pushing their value up by 40%. Chinese tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump will possibly play a massive role in shifting prices, making the overall device a little more expensive than originally intended.  The front camera will integrate Apple\u2019s ultra-thin Meta Lens technology. Foxconn and LG are involved in module development, ensuring Apple\u2019s signature camera quality translates to the foldable form. The rear camera system should maintain Apple\u2019s hybrid glass-plastic structure, with Largan leading production and Sunwoo providing backup glass components. These decisions suggest that the camera will still remain the iPhone\u2019s crown jewel despite space constraints. Battery life has been a persistent weakness for foldables, but Apple\u2019s solution is a dual stainless-steel-cased battery with a combined capacity of around 5000 mAh. The cells are rumored to be 3D-stacked, a technique pioneered by ATL, allowing for a higher energy density without increasing thickness. If Apple\u2019s power management matches its current Pro models, this could easily be the most efficient foldable on the market.  What stands out about Apple\u2019s approach is its focus on a large-screen experience rather than a pocketable, flip-style design. This aligns with the broader industry trend\u2014Samsung and Google have both refined their book-style foldables, while smaller flip models have struggled to offer a meaningful upgrade beyond nostalgia. With Apple (hopefully) entering the foldable space in 2026, it could be the push needed to bring foldables from niche curiosity to mainstream adoption. If the iPhone Flip\u2014or Fold\u2014delivers the seamless ecosystem, polished user experience, and durability that Apple is known for, it might redefine what a smartphone can be. A foldable iPhone would quite literally break the internet. Apple\u2019s track record suggests it won\u2019t release a foldable unless it\u2019s confident in its execution. The company sat out on early foldable trends, possibly waiting for materials, software, and market conditions to align. Now, with competitors refining their designs and consumers warming up to the idea, the timing feels different. The real test will be whether Apple\u2019s vision for a foldable can transcend novelty and become a true evolution of the smartphone experience.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"The gaming platform is citing trademark counterfeiting and infringement by  Nicole Carpenter Every day, people turn to third-party marketplaces like PlayerAuctions to buy and sell digital goods, be it high-leveled World of Warcraft, rare Fortnite skins, status-building Neopets, or Grand Theft Auto 5 in-game money. On Tuesday, Roblox filed a lawsuit to shut down the buying-and-selling of Roblox digital goods on PlayerAuctions. Third-party marketplaces occupy a grey area: they\u2019re not necessarily illegal, but using them often violates a game\u2019s terms of service for the player. But because PlayerAuctions uses the company\u2019s trademarks on the website, Roblox is looking to the court to get its products off the site due to infringement and interference with player terms of service, providing an avenue for players to break the rules, according to the lawsuit reviewed by Polygon. Monetary damages are on the table for Roblox, but according to the company\u2019s lawyers, that isn\u2019t enough: Roblox wants the court to order PlayerAuctions to stop the buying, selling, and trading of Roblox stuff. Roblox said in its lawsuit that it carefully manages its economy, calling its \u201cgross domestic product,\u201d which is basically the market value of its entire economy, as comparable to that of \u201ccertain smaller nations.\u201d PlayerAuctions, it said, is \u201cundercutting Roblox\u2019s business\u201d and disrupting its economy. \u201cRoblox is committed to promoting the safety and security of its users and protecting its intellectual property,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told Polygon. \u201cThird-party sites like these have no legal affiliation to Roblox, operate unauthorized marketplaces in violation of Roblox\u2019s Terms of Use and Community Standards, and can be confusing to Roblox users. The Company will continue to be vigilant to combat unauthorized use of our platform and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.\u201d Roblox itself is more than a game \u2014 it\u2019s a platform for other developers to publish their own games, and offerings available on PlayerAuctions, which are among the site\u2019s most popular, reflect that. You can pay for boosting services \u2014 paying someone to level up an account \u2014 for Roblox games Bloxburg or Blox Fruit, buy an account with a specific username, purchase gems for Pet Simulator, or buy a rare pet for Adopt Me. Prices run the gamut from $5 for the Adopt Me pet to $30 for a four letter username. Roblox said in the lawsuit that players using PlayerAuctions can be banned for such an activity; it estimates that of players banned for real-money trading, eight to 10% of users mention using PlayerAuctions. Typically, payment on PlayerAuctions happens on-site, then the digital goods are transferred over to the purchaser within Roblox itself. \u201cHere\u2019s our hassle-free delivery process: I\u2019ll shoot you a friend request,\u201d one seller wrote. \u201cOnce accepted, join me in-game, and I\u2019ll swiftly send over the trade you purchased.\u201d Once the delivery is confirmed, the money is released by PlayerAuctions, per a graphic on its website. Roblox argued in its lawsuit that the use of Roblox itself in the delivery of goods is confusing to players; of players appealing bans or suspensions, Roblox said 12 to 15% of people don\u2019t realize PlayerAuctions or other third-party marketplaces are against the Roblox rules. Beyond the injunction to stop the selling of Roblox goods on PlayerAuctions, Roblox is looking to the court to award damages for trademark counterfeiting and infringement and \u201cpunitive damages sufficient to deter future unlawful conduct.\u201d Polygon has reached out to PlayerAuctions for comment.

But JPMorgan (JPM) Chase says the AI chipmaker is bound to benefit from the Chinese startup. The Hangzhou-based artificial intelligence startup sent shockwaves through both Silicon Valley and Wall Street last month after raising questions about Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. But despite the AI-driven stock rally losing $1 trillion in value, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research analysts said in a new report that DeepSeek will likely have a positive impact on companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Google (GOOGL) parent Alphabet, as well as chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA). The Chinese startup launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models in January that performed on par with similar models from OpenAI and Anthropic, while its open-source DeepSeek-V3 model released in December also performed competitively with AI models from the U.S.-based companies \u2014 for far less money and less advanced chips. According to the V3 technical paper, the model cost $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. firms, meanwhile, are spending billions on tens of thousands of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 chips, which are not allowed to be sold to China under U.S. export controls. DeepSeek\u2019s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to \u201cstrong demand\u201d for higher performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, JPMorgan analysts said Wednesday. \u201cTherefore, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in advanced AI chips \u201cshould enable them to unlock new use-cases.\u201d Other chip firms such as Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell (MRVL), and Micron (MU) are also likely to benefit from DeepSeek, according to JPMorgan. Chip pioneer Intel (INTC), however, stands to lose out from DeepSeek, analysts said, because demand for its central processing units, or CPUs, will decrease as amid the shift to accelerated computing. JPMorgan analysts also said they \u201cbelieve the broader Internet ecosystem should benefit\u201d following the open-source AI model advancements demonstrated by DeepSeek and China\u2019s Alibaba (BABA). The improved cost efficiency \u201cshould accelerate\u201d AI development and adoption, leading to more consumption, the analysts said, adding that they \u201cexpect heavy capital expenditures investment\u201d by Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta to continue in the medium term. Meta is expected to benefit from increased open-source model adoption as it builds its next-generation open-source Llama 4 model, JPMorgan said. During the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough shows the need for a global open-source standard led by the U.S. Amazon, which introduced DeepSeek-R1 in its cloud platforms, will likely benefit from providing more open-source AI model options, analysts said, because it will increase AI demand and usage, driving monetization. Meanwhile Alphabet is also likely to benefit from the lower training and inferencing costs demonstrated by DeepSeek, JPMorgan said, because it will be able to accelerate development and adoption of AI agents, as well as other AI applications such as Google\u2019s NotebookLM and Gemini Advanced with Deep Research. Google on Wednesday made its \u201cmost capable\u201d AI model, Gemini 2.0, available to everyone. At its unveiling in December, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said Gemini 2.o \u201cwill enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant.\u201d For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Apple is starting to feel some impact from the new U.S. administration\u2019s shifting priorities in the global landscape, especially around economic issues like tariffs. Here are the two major threats Apple is facing, and why investors don\u2019t actually seem to be worried. Apple is at the center of shifting geopolitical relations between the U.S. and several countries including China, Mexico, and more. A new Mark Gurman report at Bloomberg points out how there are two major threats: There are other possible threats, including tariffs involving other countries, and on chips made in Taiwan. But these two stand out as potentially the most financially painful for Apple. And yet, by all appearances, Apple and Wall Street don\u2019t seem to be worried. Apple\u2019s stock is down a bit for the year, but not to the degree of some of its competitors. And for the most part, investors seem pleased with the company\u2019s performance and future outlook. Apple\u2019s guidance for its next financial quarter was well received. It\u2019s almost as if Apple and Wall Street saw the current landscape coming, and are optimistic about solutions. Perhaps this is because during President Trump\u2019s first term, Apple got a tariff exemption. And because despite the U.S. and China\u2019s heated relationship during that term, Apple was able to avoid much harm itself. Gurman\u2019s piece highlights one concern from his colleague: \u201cThe hardware part is not the worrisome part \u2014 it\u2019s the backlash toward Apple because of an increase of anti-US rhetoric,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence technology analyst Anurag Rana. \u201cThe bigger issue is the scrutiny of the App Store, which is a longer-term problem for one of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses.\u201d If Apple does start getting associated with any fresh anti-U.S. sentiment, that could certainly make its current China struggles seem small compared to the potential long-term hit. And it could sway the outcome of any potential App Store inquiry. Overall though, while things could always change in a moment, right now Apple\u2019s two big looming threats don\u2019t appear to have teeth.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"The clash of the retail titans has entered a new phase: For the first time, Amazon (AMZN) has surpassed Walmart (WMT) in annual revenue. The online retailer famously founded by Jeff Bezos in his garage during the 1990s has long led Walmart in market capitalization but hadn\u2019t passed Walmart in earnings. Until now. In its earnings release after the close of trading today, Amazon is expected to report revenue of $187 billion, according to analysts.  Walmart reports on Feb. 20, and is projected to announce sales of $180 billion. Still, the increase in revenue isn\u2019t necessarily because Amazon is selling more paper towels or hoodies than Walmart. \u201cAmazon has moved ahead primarily because of the increase in its web-based services,\u201d  says Albert Williams, Chair and associate professor of finance at Nova Southeastern University. He added that when it comes to retail sales the two giants are pretty evenly matched. \u201cAmazon is similar in revenue with Walmart with regards to its normal online retail business. But its web-based services now include AI opportunities, the latest major technology being used in business,\u201d Williams said, and that is driving growth. While Walmart doesn\u2019t have anything comparable to Amazon\u2019s web services, they do have Walmart Cloud Native Platform, an in-house supply chain and distribution technology. And Walmart has attempted to compete with Amazon on the technological front with consumer-level technologies. Walmart launched Realm in 2024, which provides a completely immersive 3-D shopping experience. Roger Beahm, executive director of the Center for Retail Innovation at Wake Forest University School of Business, tells Quartz now that Amazon has taken the lead, it\u2019ll probably be to stay. \u201cWalmart and Amazon certainly offer consumers a choice regarding a wide range of conveniently-available products at affordable prices. But with the continued growth of online shopping, especially among younger demographics, and Amazon\u2019s positioning as the go-to option in that mode, it would be surprising if Amazon wasn\u2019t now able to continue outpacing Walmart in revenue going forward,\u201d Beahm says. Walmart, despite all its growth and attempts to compete, just isn\u2019t there when it comes to product selection. \u201cWhile Walmart\u2019s product selection is extensive, its options pale in comparison to what shoppers can obtain through Amazon.com.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Chinese e-commerce giants Temu and Shein have been preparing to maintain their U.S. customer base following the end of the de minimis exemption.  This rule, which allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has played a key role in their rapid growth in the American market. But with President Donald Trump\u2019s recent decision to suspend the provision, both companies are stepping up efforts to navigate new tariffs and customs rules.  To reduce the impact of the changes, Temu has increased its focus on promoting items stored in U.S. warehouses, allowing it to bypass the tariffs that would have affected direct shipments from China. Shein has adopted a similar strategy, using warehouses in states like California and New Jersey.   While this strategy may help them compete with Amazon, it also means both companies are working with less inventory. However, focusing on local inventory allows them to speed up delivery times \u2013 a critical advantage in the crowded e-commerce space. This has already paid off for Temu, with a significant portion of U.S. sales now coming from U.S.-based sellers. Temu had been exploring faster delivery options from local sellers even before the tariffs. Amazon (AMZN), however, still leads the way in same-day and next-day delivery, with over nine billion items delivered in 2024. Shein, which has already been localizing its operations, has expanded its U.S. distribution centers. This shift enables Shein to fulfill orders from local stock, reducing its reliance on cross-border shipments while easing the impact of tariffs. The move also cuts down on delivery wait times, potentially boosting sales. However, Shein\u2019s U.S. IPO plans are now uncertain as the company faces challenges, including concerns over its labor practices, which have delayed its public debut.  The uncertainty surrounding cross-border shipments grew when the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) briefly stopped accepting packages from China, throwing a wrench in operations for companies like Temu and Amazon. The Postal Service quickly reversed course, allowing packages to be accepted once again. Still, the episode highlighted the volatility that Chinese e-commerce firms face as they navigate shifting customs requirements.  For now, Temu and Shein\u2019s strategies to go local signal that both companies have been preparing for these regulatory shifts and are taking steps to soften the impact.  While critics argue that the de minimis exemption gave Chinese companies an unfair advantage, experts believe both Temu and Shein will continue to thrive. Santa Clara University Professor Kirthi Kalyanam told Business Insider that Shein\u2019s success is driven by its manufacturing model, not  its reliance on de minimis shipments. While the \u201ctightening\u201d of de minimis may remove any price advantage, Kalyanam believes Shein\u2019s core strengths will remain intact.

At Vox, our mission to help you make sense of the world has never been more vital. But we can\u2019t do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? \ufeffMaking people poorer is still bad \u2014 regardless of party. by  Kelsey Piper Over the last few years, I\u2019ve written a lot about degrowth ideology, the view that the only way to save the planet is to abandon economic growth as an objective. Degrowthers sometimes say uncontroversial things like that GDP isn\u2019t the only thing that matters in the world and sometimes say more controversial ones like that you don\u2019t need or deserve a washing machine, air conditioning, or out-of-season fruits and vegetables. I have two major disagreements with degrowthers. The first is that I think they\u2019re wrong about how to save the planet: Many countries have successfully cracked the code to increasing prosperity without increasing carbon emissions, and continuing down that pathway seems promising. The second is that we live in a democracy, and it\u2019s hard to find anything that polls as badly as trying to shrink the economy. Most voters consistently rank the economy as their highest concern. If your plan to fix the world requires making their lives concretely poorer, then your plan will lose at the ballot box. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week. I\u2019ve been thinking about this this week because I think we are witnessing the birth of right-wing degrowth, which has all of the same flaws as left-wing degrowth \u2014 but potentially with much more political power. I saw it most concretely during the 24-hour period where it looked like we were imposing punishing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Sure, some commentators acknowledged, the price of goods is going to rise dramatically, but they were proud to pay more for goods or have less access to them in order to restore American greatness. Sure, the economy will crash, but American patriotism matters more than the economy.  The tariff threat, of course, didn\u2019t last long. The stock market dipped, and Donald Trump declared victory and put tariffs on both Canada and Mexico on hold. And that\u2019s instructive, because while some of Trump\u2019s bad ideas are popular, I think right-wing degrowth is as dead-on-arrival an ideology as left-wing degrowth. That\u2019s not just a problem for the tariffs part of Trump\u2019s agenda; I think it\u2019s also a problem he\u2019ll run into if he starts on his promised mass deportations. The fatal flaw of left-wing degrowthism, I\u2019ve written, is its disinterest in political realities. People care about owning a washing machine; they care about owning air conditioning. In the developing world, people buy these things as soon as they are within reach. People also care about the environment, but if you put their concern for the environment at odds with their ability to have material goods, their preference for material goods will win.  In fact, one of the lessons of the last election is that even delivering quite a lot of improvements for workers will not save you if prices rise; the voters really hate inflation and will punish it at the ballot box. Under Trump, we\u2019re seeing the right set itself up to learn the same lesson. Trump, I saw people crow during the hours before the tariffs are reversed, is willing to put us through short-term pain for long-term gain! (Although, it turns out he was not \u2014 not yet.)  Most people are not willing to pay dramatically more to buy American-made goods; we know that because they have that option already, and overwhelmingly don\u2019t take it. Most people are not willing to deal with a falling stock market in order to stick it to the Canadians. And I think it is vanishingly unlikely that most people \u2014 even most people who want much tougher immigration enforcement \u2014 will be supportive of mass deportations once they produce dramatically higher prices in grocery stores.The problem is that political decisions are made by people who care a ton about politics, people who have dedicated their lives to their vision for the country and the world. Left or right, they tend to dramatically overestimate how much the people they serve are willing to suffer for ideology \u2014 any ideology. But I want to say more than that a degrowth agenda is unpopular; I also think that it is bad. In particular, it\u2019s unpopular because it is bad \u2014 people are mostly accurately assessing what makes for a good life for them and their loved ones, and economic prosperity is a big part of a good life.  I talk to a lot of people who think that the flow of ultra-cheap, low-quality goods is bad for us. I don\u2019t buy it. When my parents were growing up, you could tell the poor kids at school because they didn\u2019t have nice clothes; households used to spend a huge fraction of their income on clothes. Now, we buy lots more clothes but spend much less \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad one. Clothes being extremely cheap means far more people can dress in a way they feel good about.  Just like Americans spend much less than we used to on clothes, we spend much less than we used to on food, and that\u2019s a good thing: It means that even the poorest Americans can afford dietary variety. Under the guise of sustainability on the left and patriotism on the right, we\u2019re encouraged to accept that everywhere will be a food desert. (\u201cDo we need to eat avocados?\u201d Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat from Maine, asked, defending the tariffs.)  I don\u2019t want Congress deciding which foods we\u2019re worthy of eating; I would like to be able to buy the ones I want to eat. And I\u2019d like to have that option even when I\u2019m on a fixed income, feeding a large family, between jobs, or otherwise in a situation where money is tight. In a way, declarations that it\u2019d be fine if food, clothes, and other essentials were more expensive are themselves a product of America\u2019s breathtaking wealth. In a society more in touch with the realities of material poverty, no one could say with a straight face that maybe higher prices would be good for us. But even in America, lower prices are good: They give people more and better options, they make it possible for people with low incomes to live like people with high incomes, and they improve our quality of life. The right, like the left, will need to come up with a vision for the country that embraces prosperity rather than trying to justify wrecking it.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Ford continues to lose a lot of money on electric vehicles like the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E. New tariffs on Mexico and China\u00e2\u0080\u0094which may or may not go into effect\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as the elimination of former President Biden\u2019s EV incentives are not likely to help. The silver lining is that Ford still prints money on its gas-powered cars, so the company overall remains profitable and can use that money to fuel its continued pivot to electrification, where it thankfully seems to remain committed. For the full year of 2024, Ford posted a net income of $5.9 billion on adjusted earnings of $10.2 billion. Its electric vehicle business, however, lost $5.1 billion, even worse than its loss of $4.7 billion the year prior. It expects to lose even more, $5.5 billion, on EVs in 2025. Shifting to an entirely new type of automotive platform requires a lot of upfront research and development, supply chain, and marketing spend. Automakers have to reckon with basic economies of scale. Ford needs to sell a lot of electric cars in order to recoup its investment and start making money on each vehicle, but the cars need to be affordable for people to actually buy them. In the United States, the only electric vehicle maker to actually start seeing profits on each vehicle is Tesla, and that company started by selling luxury cars to wealthy tech executives, even still living on the precipice of bankruptcy for years. Losses are pretty much guaranteed for years. In the past, there was concern that automakers like Ford and General Motors were only paying lip service to electrification. During President Trump\u2019s first administration, for instance, GM supported his plan to eliminate California\u2019s heightened emissions standards. The gas-powered vehicle business has been very profitable for a long time, so legacy automakers have not had an incentive to go electric. It is the whole Innovator\u2019s Dilemma issue. Whatever you want to say about Tesla CEO Elon Musk, he did help force this transition. GM is in a much different place in 2025, however, with a wide range of electric vehicles now on the market that have been well-reviewed, like the Silverado EV. The automaker\u2019s CEO Mary Barra has said its EV business will turn profitable this year. It seems, despite a slowing in growth, that EVs have reached a tipping point where they are inevitable. Most people who have driven an electric car recognize they are just a lot more fun and pleasant, but companies like Rivian have not been able to get stubbornly high prices down. That company promises its R2 will be more accessible with a starting price around $45,000\u00e2\u0080\u0094still too high for most, but better than its existing lineup. Similar to how gas-powered cars were supported by decades of investment, including President Eisenhower\u2019s investment in an interstate highway network, it is taking some time for EV infrastructure to build out. Charging remains an issue but continues to improve. Ford has walked back its most ambitious EV commitments more recently as investors have demanded the company improve its financial performance and sales growth in EVs slows. It canceled a three-row electric SUV and its F-150 Lightning has become a bit old in the tooth. Sales of the pickup fell 15.5% to just 1,907 last month, compared to 2,258 in January 2024. The Mustang Mach-E still performs well, however\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ford sold 2,539 of the vehicles in January, according to Electrek, up 172% from the 1,295 units sold in the same month last year. The automaker hopes a new platform it is developing will enable it to release EVs that are more affordable to the average buyer. Ford is also releasing more hybrid-electric cars and electric vehicles with small gas generators that can charge the battery and extend their range, offering up to 700 miles on a charge. That is something Volkswagen\u2019s subsidiary Scout is doing in the U.S. after earlier committing to making pickups that were entirely electric. Musk has been supportive of President Trump\u2019s plans to end EV incentives. Critics believe that is in part because Tesla is already profitable on a per-car basis, so it does not need tax incentives as much as traditional automakers might. He long said that he was interested in doing whatever was best for the electrification movement as a whole, even if it hurt his own company, but few believe that anymore. Recent sales data from California and Germany suggest his politics are hurting Tesla sales, setting back the EV transition. Musk\u2019s support for President Trump has made him deeply unpopular in California, the largest U.S. market for electric cars, and in Germany he has recently supported the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has dismissed the country\u2019s Nazi past. It is all sad because China\u2019s electric carmakers are running circles around the United States, entering Europe and markets like Brazil and Mexico with both affordable and premium electric cars that threaten the dominance of American automakers. China plowed money into the electric vehicle sector to try and make its country more influential around the world, and it seems to be working. Meanwhile, President Trump and Musk are more focused on generative AI these days, so Americans will probably have to accept a slower EV transition for the next few years and a potential diminishing in U.S. automotive influence.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"The idea of a foldable iPhone has floated around the web for a long time, but we have more evidence the device might exist than ever before. Well-known tipster Jukanlosreve shared a post with a huge amount of new information, including the estimated size, release schedule, and much more. The detail that immediately stands out is the thickness. At 9.2mm while folded and 4.6mm when unfolded, the proposed iPhone is only slightly thicker than the Honor Magic V3, the current thinnest foldable on the market. And the second most notable detail is the whopping 12-inch screen. According to the post on X, the internal screen is comparable to two 6.1-inch phones folded together. The foldable iPhone is expected to launch in 2026 and sell as many as 10 million units, with another 20 million predicted in 2027. While specific details about the cameras aren\u2019t yet available, the front lens adopts Meta Lens technology, while Foxconn and LG work on further R&D. The rear camera has a main and an ultrawide camera. Recent Apple Foldable iPhone Supply Chain Research Summary \u2014 250120 (By zwz) 1. Appearance\u2022 Features a large folding mechanism on the left rear side.\u2022 Folded thickness: 9.2\u202fmm; single-side thickness: 4.6\u202fmm.\u2022 The internal screen is comparable to two 6.1\u2011inch phones\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/UM2rGMQIwp &mdash; Jukanlosreve (@Jukanlosreve) February 6, 2025 One interesting detail is that the phone could have a 5,000mAh battery. That exceeds even the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the largest-capacity battery Apple has ever included. That might not translate to better battery life, though \u2014 if the full screen is 12 inches across, the power demands could be much higher. The post includes the estimated cost of different components, but it warns that several are expected to increase in price soon. The current trade war between the United States and China has left many component prices in flux, but the foldable iPhone is likely going to cost significantly more than its non-folding cousins. There\u2019s still a ton of unknowns about this handset, but this is the most information that has come out so far. It gives an intriguing look at what Apple might have in development at the moment, but we\u2019ll have to wait for official word to learn more. In its normal fashion, Nothing has been everything except clear with its teasers about the upcoming Nothing Phone 3a, and now a new rumor suggests it might borrow one of the iPhone's best features. So far, Nothing has confirmed only that the Phone 3a is on the way and that more will be revealed at its March 4 conference, and the latest teaser post only adds to the mystery. The shared image depicts a button on the side of the phone beneath the power button. For reference, Nothing has always kept its power button and volume rockers on opposite sides of the handset. Unless the Nothing Phone 3a is undergoing a massive design change, the picture indicates a new button is coming with this latest release, and many fans suspect it is a dedicated camera shutter button. Would it be right if we didn't put the latest Samsung Galaxy S series against the latest iPhone in a camera test? We don\u2019t think so, which is why we\u2019ve been out taking photos with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max to see which one has the best camera. Camera specification Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (left) and Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max Andy Boxall \/ Digital Trends The Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s camera has the same 200-megapixel main camera, 50MP telephoto for 5x optical zoom, and 10MP telephoto for 3x optical zoom as the Galaxy S24 Ultra. What\u2019s new, outside of the processor and software driving it, is a new 50MP wide-angle camera. Samsung has collaborated with Qualcomm on a special Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and uses plenty of AI in the camera for improved results. We\u2019re a short time away from when Apple is expected to reveal the iPhone SE 4. Later in the year the iPhone 17 will debut, which should include an \u201ciPhone Air\u201d for the first time. News about perhaps a more significant new iPhone has now been leaked. The company is close to selecting a key supplier for its next-generation foldable display technology, according to a source tied to Apple\u2019s supply chain. This new display technology is expected to be incorporated into the company\u2019s first foldable iPhone, which will be released in the coming years.

Bill Gates was once the embodiment of the computer industry. Though the co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft retired over a decade ago to pursue full-time philanthropy, people still listen when he talks \u2014 and in a recent interview, he talked about Intel. Intel is having a rough time of late. The chipmaker\u2019s stock is practically in freefall. It\u2019s had high-profile failures for its most powerful CPUs, and rivals AMD and especially Nvidia are kicking its silicon butt in the AI arms race. In December, the company\u2019s CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down after working for Intel on-and-off for decades. Yeah, it\u2019s bad. Intel is also one of Microsoft\u2019s most important partners, so it\u2019s no surprise that the company\u2019s woes came up in an interview with the Associated Press. \u201cI am stunned that Intel basically lost its way,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThey missed the AI chip revolution, and with their fabrication capabilities, they don\u2019t even use standards that people like Nvidia and Qualcomm find easy. I thought Pat Gelsinger was very brave to say, \u2018No, I am going to fix the design side, I am going to fix the fab side.\u2019 I was hoping for his sake, for the country\u2019s sake, that he would be successful. I hope Intel recovers, but it looks pretty tough for them at this stage.\u201d It\u2019s a bleak snippet in an otherwise positive interview, and it doesn\u2019t offer any realistic paths for Intel to make up ground. The company\u2019s most recent desktop and laptop chips have been met with more acclaim, and its new discrete GPUs are positioned to thrive in a budget space that has been woefully underserved for the last few years. But you can\u2019t make hundreds of billions in profit selling cards to cash-strapped PC gamers\u2026 and with Nvidia still standing strong even after taking a hard knock from the DeepSeek news, that\u2019s definitely the measure of success for modern chipmakers. Don\u2019t take this for hyperbole. Intel isn\u2019t in danger of an imminent collapse. But after dominating the market for both consumers and enterprises for decades, the company simply isn\u2019t the powerhouse it was a few years ago. The most recent development is that the stock price got a welcome shot in the arm following rumors of an acquisition, something that would have been unthinkable not so long ago.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Sharat Potharaju is co-founder and CEO of Uniqode, whose vision is to enable digital connection with every physical object and place.   Shoppers staring at product labels frequently ask themselves, \"Is this product actually sustainable?\" While 68% of respondents from my company's 2024 consumer survey said that sustainability is moderately-to-very important for them when buying gifts, verifying environmental claims in the middle of a busy store is often frustratingly difficult. Between crowded aisles and time pressure, diving into detailed research on your phone isn't practical. Yet this information gap affects both conscientious consumers wanting to make responsible choices and retailers eager to spotlight their genuine environmental efforts. The Packer's Sustainability Insights 2024 survey found that more than 75% of consumers place priority on sustainability in their buying decisions, while Project44's research shows 65% prefer environmentally responsible brands. But verifiable sustainability information often remains buried in corporate websites or lengthy reports, making research impractical during a shopping trip. QR codes on product packaging offer one way to bridge this divide, turning a quick phone scan into instant access to sustainability information. Let's take a look at how you can utilize this technology to help your shoppers and demonstrate your environmental commitments. Transparency matters more than ever, with 88% of consumers citing authenticity as a key factor in brand choice. By printing QR codes on your brand's products, you can give customers instant access to sustainability stories, providing details about an item's environmental impact or social responsibility credentials. This clarity can increase credibility with consumers while building year-round loyalty. My company's survey found that this strategy meets a clear consumer need, with 39% of respondents stating they would likely use QR codes to obtain sustainability information if available. Digital transparency is increasingly important in today's retail environment. Shoppers are already juggling multiple considerations like price and presentation, so providing QR codes can be a deciding factor for shoppers who want to make environmentally conscious choices but lack time for extensive research. Additionally, this technology can help you better understand your customers' interests by revealing which sustainability features matter most to shoppers, such as recycling instructions and ethical sourcing practices. You can then refine your brand's environmental initiatives based on consumer engagement. While QR codes offer a number of benefits, implementing any new technology comes with potential hurdles. For example, many retailers cite integration with existing systems as their top challenge when adopting new technology, while over half struggle with staff training. Here are a few fundamental considerations to keep in mind: \u2022 Systems Integration: Implementing QR codes smoothly requires a seamless connection with your existing inventory and content management systems. Without proper integration, you may risk disconnected data and inefficient workflows. \u2022 Resource Requirements: Staff training and ongoing management often demand significant time and budget allocation. Recent research by Recorded Future's threat research division showed a major increase in QR code security concerns between Q3 2023 and Q4 2023, so it's important to place special attention on proper implementation and security. \u2022 Content Management: Maintaining accurate, up-to-date sustainability information across product lines requires dedicated resources and clear processes. Outdated information can damage brand credibility. \u2022 Consumer Adoption: While QR code usage has grown 433% between 2021 and 2023, you will still need to address varying levels of consumer comfort with the technology through clear instructions and support. Despite these implementation considerations, QR code systems can create lasting value when properly executed. For retailers looking to implement or improve their sustainability communications through QR codes, consider these key practices: \u2022 Start with the basics. Many free QR code generators work well for small-scale testing. Begin with simple product information pages before scaling to more complex features. For larger rollouts, evaluate whether to build in-house capabilities or partner with established providers who offer security features and analytics. (Full disclosure: My company offers these services, as do others.) \u2022 Create focused landing pages. Design mobile-optimized pages that immediately display key sustainability metrics. Keep content concise and actionable, prioritizing information most relevant to your customers. Whether using in-house resources or third-party platforms, ensure your pages load quickly and update easily. \u2022 Choose the right code type. While static codes can be generated for free, dynamic codes offer update flexibility and tracking capabilities. When evaluating solutions, I recommend prioritizing providers with proven security measures, reliable uptime and clear data ownership policies. \u2022 Place codes strategically. Position codes where consumers naturally look for product information, ensuring adequate size and contrast for easy scanning. Test different locations and sizes with various user groups before full implementation. You can also add brief instructions near the code to encourage interaction. Consumer demand for verified sustainability information sends a clear market signal: Transparency pays off. Meeting this demand with QR codes can give your brand deeper sales insights and valuable consumer data to help you optimize your sustainability initiatives. I believe those who embrace this digital transparency can help shape a retail future that champions verifiable sustainability data for shoppers.

Here\u2019s how it works.

Instead, users should migrate to newer, still supported devices. The two vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2024-40891 (improper command validation), and CVE-2025-0890 (weak default credentials flaw). \u201cZyxel recently became aware of CVE-2024-40890 and CVE-2024-40891 being mentioned in a post on GreyNoise\u2019s blog. Additionally, VulnCheck informed us that they will publish the technical details regarding CVE-2024-40891 and CVE-2025-0890 on their blog. We have confirmed that the affected models reported by VulnCheck, VMG1312-B10A, VMG1312-B10B, VMG1312-B10E, VMG3312-B10A, VMG3313-B10A, VMG3926-B10B, VMG4325-B10A, VMG4380-B10A, VMG8324-B10A, VMG8924-B10A, SBG3300, and SBG3500, are legacy products that have reached end-of-life (EOL) for years.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"It offers a wealth of features for the price by  Alice Jovan\u00e9e If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Keychron makes great yet affordable keyboards that balance function, minimalist looks, and quality. It\u2019s making waves with its new $169 Hall-effect gaming keyboard called the P1 HE, which it recently launched under its gaming arm Lemokey. The company name might sound like a joke, but Keychron\u2019s DNA is apparent in the P1 HE, which offers superb acoustics and build quality. Not only that, its Hall-effect analog switches set it apart at this price, as does its extensive support for modifications.  What\u2019s most impressive about the P1 HE is how close it comes to dethroning one of the most popular Hall-effect keyboards, the Wooting 80 HE, while being $30 cheaper. Sure, the Wooting has it beat with its 8,000 Hz polling rate (versus the P1 HE\u2019s more standard 1,000 Hz), but Lemokey\u2019s option has a customizable media knob, plus it\u2019s easier to find in stock (Wooting makes its keyboards in batches, so it\u2019s a tougher sell if you need something now). In terms of form factor, the P1 HE is a compact 75% keyboard that should appeal to gamers who prefer a minimalist aesthetic. The P1 HE only has two models available off the shelf: black or white. The good news is, if you don\u2019t like how it looks, you can customize almost everything about it. Just like other models from Keychron and Lemokey, the P1 HE can be easily disassembled and rebuilt with a wide variety of aftermarket keycaps, cases, and other components. The only things you need to keep are the PCB, battery, and switches. Being able to swap components is nice, especially if you want to trim a few grams off its hefty 3.5-pound weight. If you haven\u2019t had your hands on a Hall-effect keyboard, here\u2019s the rub: Just like in controllers, Hall-effect switches in keyboards rely on magnets instead of moving parts to determine your inputs. They yield smoother action, not to mention the components will last longer. And with the P1 HE\u2019s analog switches, you can customize the distance that each switch needs to travel to activate and deactivate an input (these are called actuation points). As such, this kind of keyboard tech has become popular among competitive gamers who want their actions to register with virtually no delay. I don\u2019t think the adjustable actuation points will sell casual gamers on the P1 HE. However, with the right adjustments, you might be able to out-strafe your opponents with a clearly noticeable advantage over conventional keyboards. I\u2019m not saying that this will immediately propel you into platinum-ranked matches of Marvel Rivals, but it may give skilled players the edge over the competition. At first, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to notice the difference between analog and mechanical switches, but after spending some time with the P1 HE, I\u2019m not sure I want to go back. Unless you\u2019re someone who gets hung up on the tactile feel of a switch, or who needs that audible click, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll feel the same way. The action on analog switches simply feels more responsive, and even just typing on a daily basis outside of gaming feels smoother. Some less obvious features of the P1 HE include a 1,000 Hz polling rate, in addition to Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity. The built-in 4,000 mAh battery offers more than enough juice to keep you gaming for a few days without having to recharge. While the P1 HE has a lot in common with Keychron\u2019s Q1 HE, it\u2019s worth noting that you can\u2019t configure its settings using the same browser-based VIA software. Lemokey has its own web application you can use. It\u2019s equally streamlined, and I like that it doesn\u2019t require downloading an app. The Lemokey P1 HE has quickly become my go-to recommendation for anyone looking for an affordable entry point to analog gaming keyboards. It\u2019s also just a good gaming keyboard in general, thanks to its accessible price point, wide range of features, and high-quality build. The race is on for another company to beat the P1 HE, which is a tall order given that it packs in so many features while undercutting most other options. The Lemokey P1 HE keyboard is available on the Lemokey website. It was reviewed using a retail unit provided by Lemokey. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"More gamers are getting into VR than ever, but demographic shifts favor free-to-play games over premium ones.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When Nintendo launched the Wii in 2006, it signaled a shift to a Blue Ocean strategy. This meant the company was no longer competing with rivals on the same playing field. Rather, Nintendo would make the Wii a console for the non-gamer, convincing broader demographics to pick up a console for the first time in history.  In his weekly column, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more. It worked. While the PS3 and Xbox 360 sold around 80 million consoles each, Nintendo sold over 100 million Wiis. It had a higher game-to-console attach rate than its competitors, too, giving developers as much financial success as Nintendo. New gamers were hungry to try something brand new, even if the \"hardcore\" demographic shunned the system. In many ways, the Meta Quest platform mirrors that of the Wii, and a new blog post from Meta proves that with 2024's sales numbers. People spent more time on average on the Meta Quest 3S \"than any other headset at launch,\" according to Meta. Sales were also up year-over-year, something we gathered from the recent Meta 2024 earnings call, and while Meta won't assign a number to that, a leaked memo says the company's Reality Labs division grew sales by 40%. More officially, Meta says users spent 12% more on Quest games and apps in 2024 than in 2023, reflected largely by \"significant growth of in-app purchases.\" Existing Quest users upgraded to the Quest 3 and Quest 3S in solid numbers during 2024 but nowhere near the number of users new to the platform. All of these numbers add up to a clear demographic shift that's been felt by developers far and wide over the past 6-8 months. While the VP of VR is leaving, the strategy that's been employed over the past few months is finally being made clearer to developers, and Meta is offering to be more transparent and helpful in 2025, something that's particularly important given the changes in store for the Quest.  Up until the past year or so, VR gamer demographics were largely made up of hardcore VR gamers who found their niche. While this group is wholly dedicated and has been around through the thick and thin of the last decade of VR gaming, it's becoming clear that this group of people is slowly becoming the minority. Meta notes that only 20% of people who bought a Quest 3S upgraded from an older Quest headset, while 27% of people who bought a Quest 3 were upgrade customers. That means the lion's share of people who bought either Quest 3 or Quest 3S had never owned a Meta Quest headset before. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android While Meta's blog post notes that VR enthusiasts remain \"a foundation of this growing ecosystem,\" several developers have seen reduced sales from this group. They \"have high expectations for fidelity and gravitate to premium titles that feature high production value,\" according to Meta, yet titles like Assassin's Creed Nexus and Metro Awakening have a much smaller player base than games like DigiGods, Gorilla Tag, and Yeeps: Hide and Seek. The Meta Quest platform has seen many AAA releases in the last two years, but the games that perform best are often made by small studios with social-first paradigms. That's because young people make up an ever-larger share of new users, something that's reflected not just in Meta Horizon store statistics but also across social media. People are calling Quest a \"kiddie platform\" because of the rise of free-to-play (F2P) titles that are often filled with excitable kids. Join any Horizon Worlds world or a game like Gorilla Tag, and you're guaranteed to run across plenty of kids along the way. Meta paints this picture as a rosy one, saying F2P titles are a new opportunity for developers to capitalize on. While this may be true, it doesn't bode well for AAA games in an industry recently dominated by lay-offs and budget reductions. In other words, while we've gotten a ton of great AAA games to date, the likelihood is that Quest owners will see fewer AAA games going forward. I've spoken to several developers who aren't exactly happy with this trend and are finding themselves on the wrong side of industry change. Matters were made worse when Meta overhauled the Meta Quest mobile app in July, morphing it into a Meta Horizon app instead. This new app prioritized F2P Horizon Worlds content over premium paid content, and developers felt the shift en masse when big-name games weren't selling as they used to.  What we're seeing on the Meta Quest isn't siloed by any means, but the trajectory is somewhat unique. The Final Fantasy VII remake was said to be a commercial failure even after selling over seven million copies. Many AAA game studios have reported the same thing with other big-name games, meaning two big problems are plaguing the AAA market: ballooning budgets and a reduced number of users interested in these types of games. That leaves current development studios in a bad spot. Veteran VR developer Fast Travel Games laid off 30 employees last week, and several other developers have had similar stories in the past few months. Meta says it's trying to set developers up for success with new initiatives but it might be too little too late for some development studios. What's clear is studios that can move quickly and adapt on the fly are the ones that will see the most success going forward. When the Meta Quest app became the Meta Horizon app, it also brought a new open store that more or less abolished curation in favor of a \"throw it at the wall and see what sticks\" strategy. AAA game budgets aren't sustainable on any platform these days, but it's evident that there's little appetite for big-budget games on the Quest platform based on sales. Developers quickly complained about the inordinate amount of Gorilla Tag clones flooding the store every day, drowning out any actual good content with shovelware. When I interviewed VP of VR Mark Rabkin at Meta Connect in September 2024, he told me that high volumes of content weren't a concern, just something new to navigate around. It became clear to me this week why. In a leaked memo, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees that Meta would need to double down on the Metaverse this year, meaning more social apps and Horizon Worlds promotion. This news, coupled with today's blog post from Meta, is a sign that developers need to start focusing more on social apps and less on big-budget single-player experiences if they want to succeed. Meta says a suite of new tools will help developers understand who their customers are, how they behave, what they buy, and what experiences they spend time in.\"  Meta is leaning more toward social games and Metaverse promotion, meaning developers will have to adapt or likely face difficulties moving forward. The hardest part in all of this is seeing something you love slowly die. While it's clear the Meta Quest platform is healthier than ever \u2014 the trajectory of revenue and user retention gets better every quarter, not worse \u2014 the dream of being an Xbox or PlayStation-type system feels further away than ever. We've got plenty of amazing Meta Quest games, particularly over the past year, but waning sales for big-name titles in favor of smaller indie studios means the path to profitability moving forward is very clear for development studios. My hope is that this means we get more games like Breachers, Contractors: Showdown, Dungeons of Eternity, Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons, and Walkabout Mini Golf instead of simple Gorilla Tag clones that take little to no effort to design. I love multiplayer games, particularly ones that have unique hooks and encourage long-term progression with in-game perks and upgrades rather than social hangouts with no real goal. There's obviously room for both here but I fear the writing is on the wall for big-name games on the platform in the future. Indie is here to stay, and it's likely what's going to power Quest development going forward instead of big publishing houses. That is definitely not a bad thing, given the horribly toxic culture in most big development houses, but it also means fewer opportunities to enjoy more high-production content on the platform.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"Login Here's the thing: We may know bone broth is chock-full of benefits, but we have to wonder, is it really different from a homemade stock? According to Ali Miller, R.D., L.D., CDE, \"At this point, it is just syntax,\" she told mindbodygreen. That being said, there are some things to know about the, admittedly nuanced, difference between the two terms. If you've ever made your own bone broth or stock, you probably know how much the two terms overlap. \"Bone broth and stock are the same, as they extract the gelatin\u00a0and collagen from bones so they are more gelatinous and viscous,\" explains Miller. When bone broth first started buzzing on the wellness scene, it may have been billed as something new. But the truth is it's just a proper homemade stock. One type of stock it's definitely not the same as? The sort you make by dissolving a cube from the supermarket. In order to get the benefits of a bone broth\/stock, you need to cook the mixture, bones included, for quite a while\u2014so maybe that's why the item was rebranded bone broth, to avoid confusion with the shortcut stocks we all know. The benefits of bone broth are largely due to its collagen content. Two of the individual amino acids that make up collagen, glycine and glutamine, are what give it that extra kick to improve gut health, as they play a role in supporting the lining of the digestive tract. Bone broth also may lend benefits to hair, skin, and nail health, as collagen has independently been linked to those benefits. A particularly confusing bit? The item that's often most different from bone broth and stock is commonly called just broth. \"This is different from broth,\" she says, \"which is not as thick and is made with fewer bones and less meat.\" Many (non-bone) broth recipes will also lean more heavily on aromatics and a mirepoix for flavor, whereas a bone broth, and a good stock, will have more animal products. According to Miller, this usually includes \"the full carcass\u00a0plus feet for chicken stock (aka chicken bone broth) or knuckles and marrow bones for beef stock (aka beef bone broth). Given these nuanced distinctions, one thing is clear: The best way to get the most benefits may just be to make your own bone broth.

{"date":"2025-02-06","content":"They're working on a new IP Paradox are buying Bulgarian game developer Haemimont Games, the developers of strategy games including several in the Tropico and Jagged Alliance series. The two companies previously worked together on Surviving Mars, which was originally developed by Haemimont and published by Paradox Interactive.\r  In a press release, Paradox attributed the acquisition to their \"strategic focus on growing in the management games genre.\"\r  \"They bring a tight-knit team with long experience in developing management games with many well received projects in their portfolio. Moreover, they have a strong creative streak, technology developed for their niche, a new IP in development and a strong culture that fits Paradox\u2019s way of working,\" says Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester in the press release.\r  Haemimont have been producing strategy games of various kinds since 2000, often doing work-for-hire development on sequels for series created by others. They developed Tropico 3, 4 and 5, all published by Kalypso, and 2023's Jagged Alliance 3, published by THQ Nordic. They don't own the rights to those IP, so don't expect future entries in either series from Haemimont and Paradox.\r  This acquisition does reunite Haemimont with Surviving Mars, the citybuilder they developed for Paradox about building a home on the red planet. Three years after release, ongoing development of DLC was taken over by a different studio, Abstraction Games, while Haemimont moved off to other projects. Paradox Interactive published two further spiritual successors developed by other teams: Iceflake Studios' post-apocalyptic citybuilder Surviving The Aftermath and Rocket Flair Studios' deep-sea citybuilder Surviving The Abyss. Neither successor was as well received as the first, which Alec had enjoyed a lot in his Surviving Mars review. The press release only names an unnamed \"new IP\", however, so who knows whether anything Surviving-based might come of this down the line.\r  Paradox have been having a rough time recently, and last year we spoke to them at length about their future plans. They feel that there's no point competing with XCOM, and that players are less accepting of bugs now, and their intent is to therefore focus on fewer, more polished games within their core market of strategy games.

Select a question above or ask something else IndiGo, India's low-cost carrier, is expanding into long-haul markets by leasing a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways. This marks its first widebody aircraft and is part of a broader strategy to capture high-demand international routes, particularly in Europe. The airline is diversifying its fleet with recent acquisitions, including Boeing 777-300ERs and 737 MAX-8s, and plans to introduce Airbus A350s by 2027, underscoring its ambition for global growth. Join Us on March 17-18 in Delhi Indian low-cost carrier IndiGo announced on Thursday that it will introduce its first widebody aircraft \u2014 a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner \u2014 via a damp lease agreement with Norwegian low-cost long-haul carrier Norse Atlantic Airways. Wet leasing is an agreement between air carriers in which the aircraft is operated under the AOC (Air Operator Certificate) of the lessor. A damp lease is a specific type of wet lease where the aircraft is usually provided with a cockpit crew but without cabin attendants. IndiGo has said the aircraft will arrive in India \u201cin the next few weeks,\u201d and operations are expected to commence as early as next month. While IndiGo hasn't mentioned the route it would be flying, according to a Norse Atlantic stock exchange filing: \"The aircraft is expected to start operations in March 2025 serving long haul routes out of India.\"\u00a0 The decision to incorporate a widebody aircraft into the fleet comes amid indications that IndiGo is actively exploring its long-haul ambitions, beyond its traditional short- and medium-haul markets. On a January 24 earnings call, CEO Pieter Elbers mentioned the airline\u2019s interest in leveraging interim solutions through wet leases, pending regulatory approvals. \u201cSubject to regulatory approvals, we are exploring interim solutions for an earlier introduction of long-range aircraft to our fleet through wet leases.\" The partnership with Norse Atlantic is a step in that direction, aimed at capturing high-demand international routes, as IndiGo continues to build its global network. The initial agreement spans six months \u2014 with potential extension to 18 months. IndiGo has also said that it would be exploring opportunities to contract additional aircraft from Norse Atlantic. IndiGo is evaluating route and network opportunities, with early focus reportedly on key European hubs such as London and Paris, both of which cater to significant Indian diaspora and business traveler markets. \u201cIndian businesses are expanding internationally, our citizens are exploring more destinations than ever before, and our diaspora continues to grow... However, there are still certain key markets, which are underserved and this represents a fast reservoir of untapped potential,\u201d Elbers said at the call. The launch of long-haul services comes at a time when the Indian aviation market is undergoing a significant shift.  With Indian carriers holding a 43% share of the country\u2019s international passenger traffic last fiscal year\u2014a figure that has been on the rise\u2014there is an evident appetite for more comprehensive international connectivity. Credit rating agency CRISIL Ratings projects that this market share could edge up to 50% by the 2027-28 fiscal year, underscoring the potential for growth. Known for its homogeneous Airbus fleet, IndiGo has progressively diversified its aircraft portfolio. The soon-to-come 787-9 Dreamliner, operated under a damp lease, would be the first widebody aircraft operated by IndiGo under a more flexible service model rather than on exclusive routes. This move not only reflects the airline\u2019s strategic ambitions but also highlights its capability to leverage secondary market capacity, developed amid a challenging, supply-constrained environment over the past two years. Designed with fuel efficiency in mind, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would be helpful to cover longer distances economically. The airline also has a firm order for 30 Airbus A350-900 widebody aircraft, with rights for an additional 70 Airbus A350 family aircraft with deliveries slated to begin in 2027. IndiGo has also introduced a business class on its domestic routes and an eagerly-awaited loyalty program.
