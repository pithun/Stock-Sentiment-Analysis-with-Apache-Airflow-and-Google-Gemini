In new guidance issued on Thursday, the SEC announced that it doesn\u2019t view most meme coins \u2014 cryptocurrencies that originate from internet memes or cultural phenomena \u2014 as securities, and that transactions around them do not need to be registered with the commission. The SEC said it reached this decision because the coins do not \u201cgenerate a yield or convey rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business,\u201d and therefore cannot be considered a security. Instead, the SEC describes meme coins as \u201cmore akin to collectibles\u201d and \u201ctypically have limited or no use or functionality.\u201d This comes amid a rise in new meme coin cryptocurrencies following Trump\u2019s election. The DOGE acronym for Trump\u2019s waste elimination agency was likely inspired by dogecoin, a popular meme coin that was enthusiastically supported by DOGE leader Elon Musk prior to his appointment. Trump and his wife Melania also launched their own respective meme coins in January, which have plummeted in value since being released. The clarified guidance could impact crypto regulations and shield companies and individuals that create meme coins from potential litigation. The digital currencies tend to experience volatile price swings and are popularly used in \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes, in which a token is artificially inflated via insider promotion to cash in on the buying frenzy. \u201cMeme coins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation,\u201d said the SEC. \u201cGiven the speculative nature of meme coins, they tend to experience significant market price volatility, and often are accompanied by statements regarding their risks and lack of utility, other than for entertainment or other non-functional purposes.\u201d A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly revealed Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT mid-range GPUS are set to compete against the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti, respectively. At least, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to wait long before we see how well these new cards stack up, as the cards are set to launch on March 6 through a range of OEMs. AMD claims gamers prefer GPUs at mid-range prices, but they want to play their games at 4K anyway. The big news is the price. The RX 9070 costs $550, the same price as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070. The RX 9070 XT starts at $600, $150 less than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti. Both are set to launch on March 6. Skipping any mention of a RX 8000 series (to better align with the GPU nomenclature with the latest Ryzen 9 series CPUs) doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it\u2019s fully two generations ahead, though it is built with 4K and 1440p gaming in mind for more recent games. The lower-level GPU, the RX 9070, comes in at 56 of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RDNA 4 compute units with 16 GB of VRAM (GDDR6 running at 20 Gbps) on a 256-bit memory bus and a boost clock of 2.54 GHz. The RX 9070 XT stands taller with 64 compute units, more AI accelerators, and a 2.97 GHz boost clock. The higher-end GPU also maintains 16 GB VRAM, equivalent to Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RTX 5070 Ti. Moreover, AMD claims it can hit native framerates at or above the RTX 5070 Ti at 4K. Of course, that\u2019s all before unpacking the difference between AMD\u2019s and Nvidia\u2019s upscaling software. It\u2019s up to our tests to see who comes out on top, though that $600 price point looks very attractive amid all the current RTX 50-series stock woes. The RX 9070\u00c2\u00a0has 53.9 billion transistors versus 55.8 billion on the RX 7900 XT. Nvidia CEO\u00c2\u00a0Jensen Huang was more than ready to proclaim, \u201cMoore\u2019s law is dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but there\u2019s still something interesting going on, considering the 7900 XT contained 84 RDNA 3 compute units at launch in 2022. Each RDNA 4 CU is supposed to support higher clock speeds than RDNA 3. AMD also claims its new GPUs are more power efficient than the past or current generation, meaning it should get more done than the RX 7900 series with fewer total compute units. The RX 9070 demands 220W of board power compared to 250W on the RTX 5070. Meanwhile, the RX 9070 XT has 304W of total board power compared to 300W on the RTX 5070 Ti. However, the RX 9070 will still recommend a 650W PSU, while the 9070 XT will ask for a 750W power supply, like the equivalent Nvidia cards. RDNA 4 sports a new structure with an extra computing unit designed with ray tracing in mind. According to AMD, the compute unit is 40% faster than RDNA 3, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a promised two times increase in ray tracing performances per compute unit versus the past-gen architecture thanks to a reconfigured, more-optimized raytracing pipeline. The new architecture supports PCIe Gen 5 along with HDMI 2.1b and DisplayPort 2.1a. Team Red also promoted its second-gen AI accelerators. The RX 9070 should be able to hit 1,165 peak TOPS of AI performance versus the RX 9070 XT at 1,557 TOPS. Ignoring all the talk about AI, AMD purports more gamers are looking to upgrade off the RX 6800 XT or the Nvidia RTX 3080 and RTX 3090. For gen-on-gen performance, Team Red claims you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get 33% better performance in a Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p with ray tracing enabled on the RX 9070 compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RX 7900 GRE. The XT will get over 66% better in the same game at 4K ultra-performance versus the RX 7900 GRE. The frames aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as significant in a game like F1 24 or Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a bigger uplift in native gaming performance. AMD waited until its full announcement to drop its final pricing on the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, knowing its the big consideration for most gamers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tough market, and Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest issues with RTX 50-series availability have made customers nervous about the cost of upgrading. AMD said it was working with the companies making its AIBs to have enough stock at launch, but time will tell. AMD said it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to play in the same exclusive, ultra-expensive pool as the big dogs at Nvidia. Instead, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focusing on the mid-range GPUs that, perhaps, a few more gamers can afford. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean these cards are cheap. AMD may have focused on running cards for under $700, though Nvidia still holds an edge in gaming software. The company now has to bet more gamers would prefer to save some bucks (and, depending on availability, actually be able to buy one) rather than relying on tricks like multi-frame gen. However, AMD is still promoting how its next generation of FSR provides better framerates than the last generation. AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 for the RDNA 4 architecture is supposed to improve the upscaling tech trying to take on DLSS 4 by reducing regular complaints of ghosting or anti-aliasing artifacts. Just like always, FSR takes a lower-resolution image and upscales it to a higher-resolution image, all while keeping the performance of the lower end. AMD said FSR-4 can create \u00e2\u0080\u009cnear-native results\u00e2\u0080\u009d for its supported games on the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT. Whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true will be up to the eagle-eyed players keen to point out any issue with a non-native frame, especially when you throw frame generation into the mix. AMD compared native 4K to FSR 3.1 and FSR 4, claiming the latter seems closer to native with fine details and far-away images. As for performance, AMD claimed a larger uplift in FPS on a 9070 XT in a game like Warhammer 40K: Space Marine II, going from 53 FPS to 102 FPS at 4K. Increased frames are slightly lower on games like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all before frame gen, as well. As for multi-frame gen, that\u2019s still off the table. AMD indicated it has worked on prototypes for that AI capability but is mostly there to encourage benchmarking rather than improve the user experience. No matter what card you choose, upscaling is a boon for gamers who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend $2,000 on an RTX 5090. The question will be how it compares to DLSS 4. AMD also has a new AMF 2.1 model to make generated frames look smoother than before. Nvidia made a big deal about the transformer model of DLSS. AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widening software gulf is nowhere clearer than with 3x or 4x multi-frame gen, a capability exclusive to the RTX 50 series of GPUs. The more frames you generate with AI, the more likely you find odd artifacts (and in our tests, we certainly have). But when comparing mid-range GPUs, those extra frames may be worth the drawbacks to some budget-conscious gamers. AMD said it\u2019s supporting more than 30 games with FSR 4 at launch, including recent games like Marvel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Spider-Man 2 and Kingdom Come Deliverance II. The chipmaker said it planned to have over 75 games support the technology going into 2025. FSR 4 will only be supported on RDNA 4, while the company promised more games will support FSR 3.1 throughout the year.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"     Nothing is going to make home prices drop significantly in the near future.    As a real estate professional, one of the most common questions I get is, \"When are home prices going to come down?\"\u00a0 It makes sense;\u00a0buying a home is a huge financial decision. With the headlines predicting crashes, recessions and market downturns, it's natural to want to wait for the housing market to become more affordable.\u00a0 Yet real estate doesn't behave the way a lot of people think it does. Sure, home values can fluctuate, but prices are stuck at all-time highs. We can partly blame inflation, which is making everything more expensive. We can also blame a massive housing shortage\u00a0for keeping competition up. Across most of the US, we still don't have enough homes available for those who want to buy them.\u00a0 It's my job as a realtor to tell my clients never to rush out and buy the first home they see. But if you're still sitting on the sidelines waiting for a major drop in home prices, you might be waiting forever.\u00a0 A lot of people think real estate is like a stock -- prices go up, prices go down. If you time the market, you can get in at the lowest possible price. Except homes aren't like stocks at all.\u00a0 Home prices don't just suddenly drop. A combination of factors prevents them from falling significantly, from supply and demand to inflation, from mortgage rates to homeowners' emotional attachment to their properties.\u00a0 I've been in the real estate industry long enough to know that housing downturns don't happen in a vacuum. Let's dive into the key reasons why a big price drop in today's market is unlikely.\u00a0 At its core, the housing market is driven by supply and demand. When there are more buyers than available homes, prices go up. Depending on what report you read, the US is short between four and six million homes. The severe undersupply of homes has been a problem for over a decade. After the 2008 financial crisis, homebuilding slowed dramatically and never fully ramped back up. Restrictive zoning laws and rising construction costs have made it difficult to build new homes at the pace needed. In many areas, the high cost of breaking ground on new construction incentivizes builders to just focus on higher-end homes, leaving first-time buyers with even fewer options.\u00a0 At the same time, demand for homes is strong. Millennials, the largest generation in the country, are in their prime homebuying years, and many are determined to buy. As long as market demand exceeds supply, home prices will stay strong. If you've been to the grocery store, filled up your gas tank or paid for any service lately, you've seen firsthand how inflation affects prices. Housing is no different. Inflation puts long-term upward pressure on prices. After peaking in early 2022, inflation started to ease after the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate hikes. But recent data shows consumer prices rising again.\u00a0 As inflation erodes the value of money, tangible assets like real estate become more expensive. A home that cost $300,000 in 2010 would now be worth around $427,000 just from inflation alone. Even if housing demand cools temporarily, home values tend to rise over time simply because of how our financial system works.\u00a0 Selling a home isn't as simple as listing it online and waiting for offers. It's a process that comes with significant costs for sellers, including real estate commissions, closing costs, staging expenses and potential repairs. For many homeowners, selling is expensive and doesn't make much financial sense. Sellers would rather stay put than take a financial hit, and fewer homes on the market prevent prices from falling. The rate-lock effect is one of the biggest reasons why existing homes aren't hitting the market.\u00a0 During the pandemic, millions of homeowners locked in ultra-low mortgage rates, some as low as 2 to 3%. These homeowners are not eager to trade their sub-3% mortgage for a new one at 7%. Even with home values rising, many homeowners don't want to take on a significantly higher mortgage payment for their next home.\u00a0 Until mortgage rates come down substantially, many homeowners will stay put, keeping inventory tight and prices steady. Most sellers are also buyers. Every home that gets sold is usually offset by another purchase. Unlike in 2008, when foreclosures flooded the market, today's sellers are typically moving by choice, not out of necessity. Demand for homes has a lot to do with life stages. People get married, have kids, relocate for jobs, downsize or look for better schools. Even in a high-rate environment over the last two years, these factors have kept the housing market moving. People have a deep emotional connection to their homes, and that plays a role in pricing. When homeowners see a neighbor's house sell for top dollar, they often believe their home is worth the same or more. Even in slower markets, homeowners are reluctant to accept lower offers unless they absolutely have to sell. Unlike stocks, where people are quick to cut losses, homeowners tend to hold onto their properties rather than take a perceived loss. This is another reason why home prices tend to be sticky, even during economic downturns. I often hear the argument that home prices will drop if we enter a recession. While it's true that economic downturns can impact housing, most recessions don't lead to significant price declines. Historically, home prices have remained stable or even risen during recessions. Layoffs tend to impact lower-income workers who are less likely to be homeowners, and those who do own homes typically have enough equity to avoid distressed sales. Unlike in 2008, where risky lending led to foreclosures, today's homeowners are in a much stronger financial position. Over the last 60 years, home prices have appreciated at an average rate of 4.6% per year. If you're waiting for a housing crash, you're betting against a trend that has been remarkably consistent.\u00a0 Even if home prices stagnate, interest rates could stay high, which impacts affordability far more than a small price drop. And it could end up costing you more to wait. Renting instead of buying means missing out on years of home equity, and inflation will just continue making homes more expensive over time.\u00a0 If you're trying to decide whether to buy, focus on your own financial situation rather than trying to time the market.\u00a0 Financial stability: If you can afford a down payment, make sure your projected monthly mortgage payment is comfortable and sustainable. You should also have enough money in the bank for closing costs, insurance, taxes and other homeowner fees. Consider different markets: Not all real estate markets are created equal. Pay attention to what's happening in your specific area. At the time of this article, Florida inventory is growing while the Northeast is still in very short supply. Think long term: Real estate is not about what will happen today or tomorrow but rather decades from now. As a general rule, plan to stay in your home for at least five or seven years so that short-term market fluctuations won't matter much.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Home flippers Mike Gorius and Kevin Hart have found their sweet spot: Ranch-style houses \u2014 ideally three-bed, one-bath \u2014 in Louisville, Kentucky. \"That's probably our favorite house to do. They're just super easy to renovate, most of them are 1950 or newer, and usually there's nothing too crazy about them,\" Hart told Business Insider. \"Once you start getting into houses that were built in the 1900s or earlier, which you see a lot of closer to downtown in West Louisville, who knows what's happened to that house over the past 100 years? You just encounter a lot of issues.\" The business partners also wholesale real estate and buy and hold long-term rentals. In 2024, they did 50 transactions between wholesales, wholetails, and flips, and they own more than 20 rental properties throughout the Lousiville area. BI verified their property ownership and deal history by looking at settlement statements and closing documents. They like their market for a few different reasons. Hart, who was born and raised in Louisville, knows the city intimately. But Gorius, who is from Massachusetts and spent years living in Phoenix, chose to invest in Kentucky's largest city from afar. He's relocating to Louisville now that their real estate company has taken off and they have three employees to manage. Gorius, whose first deal was a duplex that he turned into a long-term rental, looked at a few key factors when considering markets to invest in. 1. Affordability. Ultimately, the reason he didn't invest in the market he was living in, Phoenix, was because of the cost. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sales price of existing single-family homes in the Phoenix metro area in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $476,400. In Louisville, it was $279,200. 2. Presence of major companies. \"It's a hub for UPS. Ford also has a plant there \u2014 a couple of years ago, when I was looking, they had just announced that they were going to add a second plant there and that's still in the process of being built,\" he said. \"If these massive, massive companies are willing to invest in this city then it's definitely good enough for little old me.\" 3. Vibe of the city. Visiting the area sealed the deal for Gorius, who enjoyed the mild weather and general vibe: \"Everyone was super, super nice, just kind and saying hello and everyone was willing to help out. That's what drew me to the market.\" Hart weighed in on what he likes specifically about his native city. \"We have four seasons but, at the same time, we don't have natural disasters like other places. We don't have hurricanes, we don't have wildfires, we have the occasional tornado, but that's super rare in the actual city,\" he said. \"At the same time, we've been super insulated from all these crazy highs and lows that a lot of big cities have seen, especially over the past five, six years.\" For example, \"San Francisco, or really any California town, saw 40%, 50% appreciation \u2014 these crazy jumps on these properties \u2014 so that when interest rates went up two years ago, they also saw 40%, 50% drops in prices,\" Hart explained. Louisville, which he said saw appreciation between 10% and 14% in that same timeframe, didn't have that issue. \"It's just been super steady so no one's having to jump all around for crazy deals.\" That could change, he said, pointing to other markets in the south that are booming: \"Austin's insane, Nashville's insane. Louisville has stayed pretty steady, but it might turn into that one day. We got a Topgolf a couple of years ago, we've had a lot of other infrastructure changes, so maybe we'll get super popular like that. \"But, at this point, it's just a good place to live, and you can still buy a house for under $250,000.\" Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Making moments last from family trips has transformed from the glossy sheen of a photo album filled with memories to a culture of \u201cif it wasn\u2019t shared on social media, then it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The meaningful joy of putting together visuals of our lives as keepsakes has turned into creating digital displays that can often be more stressful to assemble. When photos and videos just go up on the cloud and aren\u2019t chronicled, that can make it hard to look back even on core pieces of our experiences. My favorite albums growing up were of yearly theme park and museum adventures. Trying to recreate that with my own kid has been quite challenging; the stressors of finding the right filter and vertical shots killing horizontal shots becomes glaringly obvious when you try to put them into photo books. It really has you looking sideways. And don\u2019t get me started on the panic I get from having deteriorating home videos as my drives fill up with videos of my child\u2019s first theme park visits. Before our daughter was born, I had many theme-park adventures with my husband. I love taking pictures where it looks like you\u2019re inside a Disney fairytale, Universal Studios movie set, or Meow Wolf sci-fi portal. Getting the right shot (with the fewest tourists in the background) is an art. It\u2019s taken me so many Disneyland trips with my Magic Key to Galaxy\u2019s Edge to find the perfect-picture spots\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it\u2019s worth it, since the theme park\u2019s photo pass program doesn\u2019t always get the best shots and is quite pricey. When I got around to putting together albums of specifically themed stories I wanted to tell, I landed on Star Wars very quickly and wondered if I could piece together my own adventures with datapad scans (phone pictures). Between attending the opening of Galaxy\u2019s Edge at Disneyland, to visits to Batuu with friends in lightly in-universe inspired outfits, and finally taking a trip aboard Disney World\u2019s now-defunct Galactic Starcruiser, I tried out a book from an unnamed service and the print job left much to be desired. As my family expanded, I became intent on finding the best options to chronicle a whole new journey. In order to create my own physical library of photos the first steps I\u2019ve taken to curate amusement park and themed travel is to commit to printing pictures every quarter of my child\u2019s life as she grows. At six months, I\u2019m ordering many more photos for albums, utilizing various models of printers, and snapping instant Polaroids to see which will have the best lasting quality, while trying out online photo book albums. To be real, most of the pictures I take are on my iPhone, because taking time to learn the ins and outs of a more professional camera is too much right now. But nothing beats a classic and one that I know can stand the test of time, Kodak\u2019s Polaroid camera, is compact and perfect for on-the-go instant pictures that have that summer vacation scrapbook feel. I definitely favor the 600 and use one I nabbed from retro-tech hub Retrospekt. There are of course newer Polaroid models with the capability to connect to an app for uploading images, if that\u2019s more your style. I recently tried to get into the 35mm trend after seeing teens and bachelorette parties use them around Walt Disney World. I didn\u2019t expect the market for 35mm cameras to be so intense, since the youths have decided its in style to grab one and not know how the photos will turn out until they\u2019re printed. What a concept, right? The re-seller market of those Canon and Sony battery-operated ones is insanely overpriced and will make you want to dig up the family one in the attic. For my baby shower I used a number of Hello Kitty collaboration 35mm cameras (again from Retrospekt) which guests loved. Good luck with getting the film rolls processed though; with Costco shutting down photography stations it\u2019s been a lot harder to do. Thankfully there are services like Shutterfly which make getting those photo album prints a whole lot less complicated. Out of the various companies out there, it\u2019s produced the best results for me. The app syncs really easily to my phone\u2019s camera roll to grab selections after I\u2019ve pored over them for hours. It also helps you realize how often you\u2019re taking vertical pictures, and serves as a reminder to get more artistic when you snap\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094a shot of droids wandering around Galaxy\u2019s Edge or fantastic shots of the Sleeping Beauty Castle. When I did my baby name reveal at Disneyland using both my own photos and Disneyland\u2019s Photo Pass (because I wanted to cover all the bases), I ordered a book from Shutterfly to display and really took to the matte feel of the pages and quality of the cover. It felt like a childhood picture book to have in my library. Single image printing is a whole other adventure. I\u2019ve tested some smaller picture tech in order to print wallet-sized images\u00e2\u0080\u0094which, by the way, where have the wallet picture inserts gone? The one I found to have really solid print quality is the Canon SELPHY series, which operates off its own app that syncs seamlessly with your phone images. It is however a little complicated to use as you have to buy ink rolls and photo paper specific to the model, and they tend to run out at different times: the paper might run out when there\u2019s still ink or vice-versa ,which is tedious. And taking it on the go isn\u2019t as easy, but I did love using it at home during the holidays to print pictures of Universal Studios Grinchmas. Kodak has more simple model options, like the Barbie Step Slim Wireless Photo printer, which doesn\u2019t require ink and is lightweight for travel, but the smartphone image quality varies. Albums are\u00c2\u00a0 becoming harder to find in person. You\u2019ll more often than not find the scrapbook type, which requires sticky corner edges, at craft stores like Michaels. Online you can find albums to fit your collections of photos from special trips. The Ceremony Club recently released a wedding series that\u2019s a vibe for Disney destination wedding parties, giving each chapter of your fairytale a modern book bound aesthetic. For other trip prints I\u2019ve found that Topdrawer\u2019s photo albums come in various sizes including Polaroid-friendly options, and with designs that can fit in gorgeously on a coffee table or showcased in your library. From rediscovering analog photography tech thanks to cute pop culture collaborations, to getting to experiment with online scrapbooking, making theme park trip memories can be still be interesting\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as certainly a bit more tedious than expected. Thankfully the market is seeing a shift as younger generations crave more tangibility to document their lives outside of uploads on social media and brands appear to be listening. There\u2019s various instant cameras on the market that provide immediate prints and also have the capability point, shoot, print, and save onto a device to share online. Kodak\u2019s Printomatic is one I\u2019ve tried that\u2019s a little too sensitive\u00e2\u0080\u0094and my model doesn\u2019t have a preview window before printing, so the results have been chaotic to say the least, and maybe not worth the price of buying more printer sheets till I get the right shot. I\u2019m only six months in on the mission to capture my little one\u2019s childhood as cinematically as possible and I\u2019m willing to try what\u2019s out there\u00e2\u0080\u0094except AI.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"In an elaborate marketing campaign this month, Duolingo seemingly killed its viral green owl mascot in every country but one. \"Duo, our owl, faked his death in every single market that we had except for Japan,\" Luis von Ahn, the company's CEO, said on an earnings call on Thursday. \"It turns out that in Japan, joking about death is not as kosher. So, in Japan, he was just not dead.\" In an early February campaign, the language learning app announced the \"death\" of its mascot with a sassy statement. In a post on X, the company wrote: \"Authorities are currently investigating his cause of death and we are cooperating fully. Tbh, he probably died waiting for you to do your lesson, but what do we know.\" Pop singer Dua Lipa replied to the X post, and wrote: \"Til' death duo part,\" a reference to a long-standing joke about Duo being in love with the artist. The company went all in: The app's thumbnail depicted the mascot dead with crossed eyes and his tongue sticking out, and Duolingo's social handles mourned his death in a series of posts. On Thursday's call, von Ahn said Duo returned last week from faking his death because users completed enough language lessons to bring him back. The campaign reflected the company's famous nontraditional and country-specific marketing campaigns, which have made the owl mascot and the Duolingo app cultural icons. Duolingo's social media accounts for countries like India, Germany, and France feature hyper-local content based on news events, memes, and trends, amassing hundreds of thousands of followers in each of these countries. Duolingo's Japan Instagram page has posts in Japanese and anime-style art, and they feature Duo participating in local trends. Last quarter, Duolingo became the first company to use animation to deliver prepared remarks on an earnings call, emphasizing its artificial intelligence push. A company representative told Business Insider that the video would have taken weeks to create with human animators, but generative AI did the job in less than seven minutes. The company spent $25.6 million on sales and marketing in the quarter that ended in September, up from $22.3 million in the same period in 2023. Breakdowns for the most recent quarter were not available at press time. \"We believe that our unhinged and viral marketing campaigns \u2014 like our 5-second Super Bowl ad, Duolingo on Ice, and 'Owl Game' partnership with Netflix \u2014 contributed to our user growth and the growth of our iconic brand,\" the company wrote in a shareholder letter released Thursday. Daily active users \u2014 an important measure for consumer apps \u2014 jumped by 51% in the fourth quarter to 40.5 million. Fourth quarter revenue grew 41% to $209 million, beating analyst expectations of $205 million. Duolingo's stock fell over 7% in after-hours trading. The stock is up 57% in the past year.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Elon Musk has spent the past month destroying the U.S. federal government with his team of DOGE goons, taking a chainsaw to USAID, NOAA, Social Security, and countless other vital agencies. And while President Donald Trump is ostensibly the guy in charge of the country, most Americans understand Musk has the real power. And there\u2019s a growing movement to protest the billionaire CEO at Tesla dealerships and SpaceX headquarters. The grassroots protest movement 50501 launched a website earlier this month to let people find the demonstrations against Trump and his cronies. But if you\u2019re looking for protests that specifically target Musk, the website Tesla Takedown is the place to be. The Tesla Takedown website is searchable by zip code. For example, typing in a Los Angeles zip code right now delivers the results below for events in L.A. proper down to Long Beach and even as far away as Irvine in Orange County, California. The protests listed when you search an L.A. zip code are all at Tesla dealerships and Tesla storefronts across Southern California on Saturday, March 1, as well as Sunday, March 2. But obviously, you can search for any zip code in the entire country. Tesla Takedown was started by activist BostonJoan on Bluesky and the website was created by Alex Winter, an actor and activist, along with his production company Trouper, which has made similar call-to-action websites for various documentaries. Winter told Gizmodo over email Friday that a website like his allows for something that\u2019s very decentralized, like the anti-Musk protests, to have a central hub for people to find information. \u201cThis one worked far better than we imagined,\u201d Winter wrote about the website. \u201cIn the short time it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been up, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had over 45,000 unique visitors who are spending real time on the site to read the information. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very encouraging.\u201d Winter says there are three goals with Tesla Takedown protests, sparked by Musk\u2019s destruction of the country. \u201cFirst, to drive down the value of Tesla cars and Tesla stock, to force a shareholder vote of no-confidence in Musk, and to remove him from the company,\u201d wrote Winter. \u201cSecond, to provide a simple and effective means of protest for the millions of angry citizens who don\u2019t accept Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illegal and destructive intrusion into the US government. And third, to create a means to disseminate information on Musk and DOGE\u2019s criminal activities and help educate and inform the public.\u201d It should be noted that not every anti-Musk protest is going to be listed on Tesla Takedown. But that\u2019s the nature of a massive movement against a guy with such diversified interests. For instance, there\u2019s a protest at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, on Saturday that doesn\u2019t appear on the Tesla Takedown website. Musk is the leader of half a dozen companies. Musk has never been confirmed as a formal member of the government but has been appointed by Trump to oversee DOGE, which has gained access to federal agencies with the stated goal of shaving $2 trillion from the federal budget. That means thousands of people are now losing their jobs as the Department of Justice argues Musk isn\u2019t even the administrator of DOGE right now. This is despite Musk essentially running cabinet meetings while suggesting that he alone gets to decide what gets funded in the government. Congress is actually in charge of deciding what gets funded, but with Republicans in control of both the House and the Senate, they have no desire to stop Musk\u2019s wrecking ball act. All of that leaves regular people on the street wondering what they can do to express their displeasure with Musk, since their elected representatives are doing nothing. One small way to do something, as some see it, is to show up at a protest against Musk. \u201cThere is a growing movement to divest, Tesla stock is in a precipitous decline,\u201d Winter told Gizmodo. \u201cSo we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling bullish. Not cocky by any means, but hopeful that regular citizens can make a difference.\u201d  DOGEDonald TrumpElon Musk  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 About 10% of the NOAA workforce was laid off, according to some reports, in a move that could kneecap the agency's ability to forecast local and national weather events.                     Meet Longshot Space, a company that wants to make putting things into orbit loud and stupid.                     Justin Sun is celebrating avoiding a fraud investigation by posting handshake emojis on X.                     Musk rather amusingly calls himself a champion of free speech.                     Trump-world lost it on Thursday when the government didn't give them what they wanted.                     Musk's organization is truly having a divine impact on the federal government.

Nvidia\u2019s stock was up by around 1.4% during morning trading on Friday at around $121 per share, leaving the firm with a roughly $2.9 trillion market cap.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":" Tesla (TSLA) stock\u2019s 4% rally today didn\u2019t prevent Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle-maker from logging its worst month ever, as the post-election rally disappears and the automakers\u2019s market value holds below $1 trillion. The shares fell 28% in February, as weakening U.S. consumer spending and uncertainty about tariffs and policy changes make equity investors increasingly anxious. The stock\u2019s worst ever month was December 2022, when it declined 37%.  \u201cThe real difficulty with any stock that is as richly valued as Tesla is to be able to call a floor,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Bloomberg. \u201cSince Tesla has defied conventional valuations for so long, a bottom is more about investor sentiment than the normal metrics that value investors might use.\u201d This week\u2019s decline of 13%, was driven in part by a report on Tuesday from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association that showed Tesla\u2019s sales in the EU fell 45% in January, even as the EV market surged. The company\u2019s earnings last month were also disappointing. Musk\u2019s  political activities \u2014 including as effective head of President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 may be alienating potential car buyers, according to analysts. Musk also recently endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany party and participated in an online campaign to convince U.K. officials to release far-right agitator Tommy Robinson. There is some kind floor under the stock, even if it\u2019s hard to know where it is, said Explosive Options founder Bob Lang. \u201cHe\u2019s got a devoted following because he\u2019s made people a lot of money,\u201d Lang told Quartz. \u201cThey\u2019ll follow him until the day they die.\u201d That loyalty means that they\u2019ll continue to hold the stock. \u2014William Gavin contributed to this article.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal troubles seem to be fading away. In March 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him with manipulating the market. After Trump was elected, he dumped $30 million into the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s World Liberty Financial crypto scheme. Now a federal judge has granted him a stay in the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation. Sun is a Chinese crypto mogul who is most famous for being the guy who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall. He ate the banana in front of cameras in Hong Kong after the check cleared. That was in November, when the specter of an SEC-led fraud investigation was still hanging over his head. Sun owns several companies, including Tron Foundation Limited, BitTorrent Foundation Ltd., and Rainberry Inc. (formerly BitTorrent). According to an SEC press release from 2023, Sun was allegedly using his companies to wash trade securities, buying them with one company and immediately buying them with another. He also allegedly paid for celebrity endorsements without disclosing the agreement. When it charged Sun, the SEC also charged eight celebrities they said were involved in the scheme, including Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Soula Boy, and Lil Yachty. Several of the celebrities, including Lohan, agreed to pay $400,000 to settle the SEC investigation. Sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SEC legal troubles also seem to be over. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family has been cooking the WLF crypto scheme for a long time, but it finally bore fruit after his election and thanks, in no small part, to a big push from Sun. The way WLF worked, its founders would retain 70 percent of the project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cgovernance\u00e2\u0080\u009d tokens and would only get a big payout if the token hit a certain threshold of investment. Around the same time he bought the banana for $6.2 million, Sun \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvested\u00e2\u0080\u009d $30 million into WLF. It pushed the coin into the threshold it needed to release cash into Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pocket and netted the President around $18 million. Sun came on to WLF as an advisor. Then he dumped another $45 million into the company. According to Bloomberg, that means Trump has received around $56 million in total \u00e2\u0080\u009cfees\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Sun related to WLF. Days after the inauguration, Sun praised President Trump in a post on X. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my view, if I have made any money in cryptocurrency, all credit goes to President Trump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth Trump Coin and World Liberty Financial are bound to perform exceptionally well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On February 26, the SEC and Sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers sent a letter to the Judge for the case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this case, the Parties submit that it is in each of their interests to stay this matter while they consider a potential resolution and agree that no party or non-party would be prejudiced by a stay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the letter said. The Judge signed it and granted the stay a day later. On X, Sun reposted news of the stay above handshake emojis. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just another deal being struck by the Trump administration. \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009d\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bb\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009d\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bb\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009d\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bb https:\/\/t.co\/reuXqSG4F4 \u2014 H.E.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Director Cutter Hodierne\u2019s new film, Cold Wallet, is a parable about how the house almost always wins. by  Charles Pulliam-Moore Director Cutter Hodierne\u2019s new film, Cold Wallet, is a parable about how the house almost always wins. by  Charles Pulliam-Moore Cold Wallet, Well Go USA\u2019s new darkly comedic home invasion thriller from director Cutter Hodierne, becomes increasingly more absurd as it unfolds. At every turn, the movie\u2019s heroes \u2014 a group of excitable retail investors \u2014 make unhinged choices that make them feel more like cartoons than people who have complex lives outside of Reddit. But in the film\u2019s story about how quickly big bets on crypto can go left, you can feel Cold Wallet tapping into something very real about what makes people believe that rugs can never be pulled from beneath their feet. Cold Wallet tells the tale of Billy (Ra\u00fal Castillo), a down-on-his-luck father, who, after a nasty separation from his ex, decides to bet everything he has on a hot, new crypto coin called Tulip. Like his twitchy hacker friend Eva (Melonie Diaz) and MMA-obsessed buddy Dom (Tony Cavalero), Billy sees Tulip as an opportunity to radically change his lot in life. It\u2019s easy for the trio to pour their money into Tulip because they genuinely believe that the coin\u2019s creator, Charles Hegel (Josh Brener), wants to make the world a better place for people like them. But when Tulip\u2019s value suddenly tanks one day and Hegel \u2014 an eclectic recluse \u2014 dies under very dubious circumstances, Billy\u2019s crew is convinced that they\u2019ve been screwed over, and they set out on a deadly mission to put things right. Especially once people start speculating that Hegel isn\u2019t actually dead, Cold Wallet\u2019s plot begins to sound more and more like a heightened riff on the very real story of how thousands of people lost everything in 2018 when Quadriga cofounder Gerald Cotten unexpectedly dropped dead during his honeymoon. When I recently sat down to speak with Hodierne about Cold Wallet, he told me that he very much wanted for the movie to play like the kind of revenge fantasy people hurt by Quadriga might dream about. In Hegel, we\u2019re supposed to see shades of the greed that made Cotten a wealthy man before his death. But Hodierne also wanted his villain to feel like a larger-than-life example of the way capitalism can turn people into ghoulish caricatures, which is why he looked to Martin Shkreli for inspiration. \u201cWith Hegel, we wanted to lean into him being the kind of guy who is like \u2018the rules are here to be manipulated and taken advantage of; I\u2019m just doing my part,\u2019\u201d Hodierne explained. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of person who thinks \u2018if the rules aren\u2019t good enough to stop me, then whose problem is that really?\u2019 That kind of attitude is very dangerous and I think Hegel\u2019s character resembles a lot of the people who are taking over the country right now.\u201d Though Hodierne owns some crypto of his own, he sees memecoins like President Donald Trump\u2019s and the Hawk Tuah girl\u2019s as \u201cbastardizations of crypto\u2019s true potential\u201d that reflect the US\u2019s wealth-obsessed culture. It was important to Hodierne that Cold Wallet illustrate what makes people so game to bet on the blockchain even though the crypto space is filled with horror stories. But through Billy\u2019s character, in particular, Hodierne wanted to reinforce how quickly investing in crypto can upend people\u2019s lives in disastrous ways. \u201cWith Billy, it was about this tug and pull between enthusiasm and desperation \u2014 enthusiasm to evangelize Tulip coin\u2019s possibilities to his friends, and then his desperation when it\u2019s all gone,\u201d Hodierne told me. \u201cHe\u2019s the embodiment of a freefall event or a crash in the crypto market, and he has this level of rage that has been amplified tenfold because this was his last fucking try and it backfired.\u201d As Billy and his friends arm themselves and set out for Hegel\u2019s remote compound, Cold Wallet frames their mission in a comedic light that\u2019s at odds with the fact that they\u2019re psyching themselves up to kill a man if push comes to shove. The framing makes them feel like people who\u2019ve spent too much time watching action movies, but Hodierne told me that Cold Wallet\u2019s silliness is, in part, one of the ways he wanted to convey the sense of desperation that often leads to people putting their faith in digital currencies. \u201cThere are so many systems in place to sort of keep people just getting by, and crypto can feel like a way out,\u201d Hodierne said. \u201cI have friends who became like multi-millionaires from crypto, and that\u2019s the kind of positive reinforcement that can make people think \u2018oh, this is worth the risk.\u2019 That was the vibe when crypto had its major resurgence during the Covid era and everyone was desperate.\u201d As dark as Cold Wallet gets, Hodierne always knew that keeping the film funny would be key to making it accessible to folks who have kept their distance from crypto. Billy and his friends are supposed to feel like the sorts of ordinary people you might know and be able to sympathize with. But they\u2019re also meant to remind you that, in most cases, things like Tulip are designed to help the few and hurt the masses. \u201cUnfortunately, I think the joke is always on the little guy,\u201d Hodierne said. \u201cEven with GameStop all that stuff, ultimately, Wall Street was able to follow the movement and benefit from it. Even when the little guy is getting his public win, the big guy can always tack on to it, and it all just reminds you that it\u2019s hard to beat the house.\u201d Cold Wallet is now in theaters and available to purchase digitally.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"\"It's beginning to feel like the Wild West up here when it comes to sheep crime - it's soul-destroying,\" says farmer Colin Abel, scanning his flock high up on west Dartmoor farmland.  This winter - like most years - Mr Abel is missing more than 400 ewes. He says in the last decade he has lost nearly \u00a3500,000 worth of livestock to sheep rustling, which is pushing some farmers to the brink of quitting or bringing their flocks off the moors. Devon and Cornwall Police says livestock theft is challenging to police but its officers are \"pursuing every line of inquiry\" through \"forensics, surveillance, tracking and more\". Sheep have grazed on Dartmoor in Devon for centuries but roaming free, they are hard to keep an eye on and the national park is among the five worst areas in the country for sheep rustling.  Mr Abel's family has run Lower Godsworthy Farm in Tavistock since 1888.  He estimates more than 4,500 sheep have gone missing in the last decade and with each ewe worth roughly \u00a3120, that is more than \u00a3500,000 worth of livestock, he says. His hardy upland flock of Scotch Blackface and Welsh mountain sheep spend nine-and-a-half months of the year on the moor, where they are most vulnerable to theft. \"It impacts financially and on the viability of the business,\" he says. \"I know farmers who are thinking about whether they want to continue.\" Dartmoor's remote landscape makes livestock vulnerable to theft, while also making it challenging to police. Martin Beck, who was appointed in 2024 as the UK's first national livestock theft specialist police officer, says more than 1,300 sheep were reported stolen in Devon and Cornwall in 2024.  Of those, nearly 800 reports - or 62% - related to west Dartmoor.  According to Mr Beck, more than 10,000 sheep were reported stolen in the UK in 2024, meaning more than 10% of logged thefts were in this region.  Tracking stolen sheep is challenging, he says, adding they can end up on the illegal meat market, in other farmers' flocks, or being sold on the black market, online or at markets. With ear tags easily removed by criminals, the animals' disease and medicine status are unknown - creating a risk to consumers if they end up in the food chain. They could also be illegally slaughtered in uncontrolled conditions, he says. Mr Beck, who is based in Devon, has called for \"more investment and training in rural policing and technology\" to address the issue. There have been no prosecutions for sheep theft in the last five years for Devon and Cornwall. The challenge is complicated by the suspected involvement of people from the farming industry, says PC Julian Fry from Devon and Cornwall Police's Rural Affairs Team. \"The tragedy of this situation is that to steal livestock you have to know livestock and have the networks to shift them on.\" PC Fry, who grew up on the edge of Dartmoor and knows the farming community well, says despite the challenges, officers are working with abattoirs, commoners and farmers to build intelligence and employ \"lots of tactical options\". \"Any report of livestock theft we take seriously, investigate and pursue all lines of inquiry,\" he adds. \"We hope to make this crime a thing of the past.\" Rural insurer NFU Mutual estimates livestock theft cost \u00a32.7m in 2023, although Mr Abel says he quit reporting his losses to avoid higher premiums. Seven miles east across the moor, dense fog descends as farmer Neil Cole leads the way across a pen at his farm in Princetown. As he glances through the gloom at his huddle of shuffling and bleating Scottish Blackface sheep, he says: \"Imagine you are creating a piece of art and someone sticks their finger nails through it, that's what it's like breeding good sheep for generations and trying to do it well \u2013 for someone to nick 50 of them is soul-destroying, all that profit gone. \"It does affect our mental health. \"We turn out 220 lambs expecting to get 160 back - at \u00a3150 a lamb we're in the lap of the gods until we gather.\" Mr Cole says they lost \u00a37,000 to theft this year, amid existing financial challenges including mortgages and debts. A report on Dartmoor by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) describes farming on Dartmoor as \"economically extremely marginal\". Mr Cole adds: \"The economics of keeping sheep on the moor is becoming harder and harder so the younger generation aren't taking it on as much. \"I've heard farmers say they are ready to give up and the sheep are important for the ecology of the moor. \"It's not the sort of thing you can steal if you don't have the knowledge. It is causing divisions in the community.\" Mr Abel has trialled satellite trackers from a firm called No Fence on his livestock. But at \u00a3199 per device plus a monthly subscription, he says it is prohibitively expensive to extend the measure to his 4,500-strong flock.  \"The cost needs to come down so it's more practical to stick on the numbers of sheep that graze the commons but it is a step in the right direction,\" he says. The firm says it aims to \"drive down\" the price of collars in future.  Other advanced technology systems are also being developed and industry and policing leads hope they could provide a future solution to livestock theft. Australian firm Ceres Tag uses AI machine learning and satellite communications to track sheep with digital ear tags. \"We detect immediately if there's very high activity, so we know that the theft is taking place, and then when they leave the property, we are able to track them to their final destination,\" says CEO David Smith.  \"It's very difficult in a flock of sheep to remove the tag because there's so many of them... Even if (thieves) did remove the tag, which is highly unlikely, it's already too late - we've already recorded the thieves stealing the animals.\" Mr Smith says the price of the tech will come down as it is adopted more widely.  Police are also using forensics to track stolen sheep, while Cumbrian sheep and beef farmer Pip Simpson has trialled coded microdots on the sheep's fleece to brand his sheep.  Mr Simpson, based near Windermere in the Lake District, tells the BBC: \"I think the answer does lie in technology - what I'd like to see is ultimately a GPS tracker like a microchip in a dog so you can ringfence where it's at and receive a text when it gets stolen.\"  Back on the moor, where sheep have grazed and shaped the land for more than 6,000 years, Mr Abel hopes a high-tech solution to this ancient crime can be found soon. \"We all know that things are stretched and budgets are tight but we need more to be done - it's affecting a whole community, and it could start to impact Dartmoor itself,\" he says.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Young, fresh-faced 20-somethings are taking the housing market by storm \u2014 not by buying homes, but by selling them. After dipping in 2023, the share of realtors under the age of 30 quadrupled in 2024, rising from 1% to 4% last year, according to registration data from the National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, the median age of the average real estate agent dropped from 60 to 55 last year, the lowest since 2021. It's a lucrative time to get into the business. While new rules have affected how realtors' commissions work, real estate agents and brokers still made a collective $48 billion in revenue in the third quarter of last year, about double what they made 10 years ago. Paydays are being boosted by soaring home prices. The median sale price of a home was about $419,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024 \u2014 up 27% since the start of 2020. Business Insider spoke to three realtors who dove into the property business early, with some obtaining their license as soon as they turned 18, or pausing college studies to do so. Many described themselves as especially entrepreneurial and seeking an alternative to a typical desk job \u2014 and said they found the work rewarding, both on a financial and a personal level. Marios Milonas, a real-estate agent based in New York, started in the business when he was 19 and looking for direction in his career. He wanted nothing to do with a regular 9-to-5, and, in an effort to steer clear of student loans, was taking classes at his local community college. \"I just felt like I wanted to be able to experience financial freedom,\" he said, adding that he shied away from the idea of being forced into a job just to pay off student debt. His girlfriend's father, who had worked in real estate for more than 20 years, recommended he try it out. After a few weeks of coursework, he got his license and soon after dropped out of community college. The market was tough, at first. Milonas didn't sell a single home for his first year in the business, he said, pointing to the pandemic. His \"baby face\" also held him back, he said, recalling offhand comments from other professionals in the business. \"One person came in and said, 'Oh, I thought you were 13 years old,\" Milonas said. The comments began to subside as he began to grow more confident and worked on appearing more knowledgeable in front of his clients. Once the housing market began to heat back up, he felt things finally coming together. \"When that housing market opened up, it was crazy,\" he said, adding that he began making a six-figure salary when he was 21 years old. Milonas made over $300,000 in commission in 2024, according to financial statements viewed by BI. Chloe De Verrier, a 26-year-old realtor based in Los Angeles, also began working on getting her real estate license when she was 19. At the time, she was attending UCLA and felt unsure about her career path. She did, though, know that she wanted to run her own business, and have full control over her schedule. Real estate seemed like the right fit. \"I was kind of having that, I guess, quarter-life crisis of, 'I don't know what I want to do,'\" she said. \"I kind of just decided to take a leap of faith.\" She decided to temporarily drop out of college and pursue real estate full-time. Her first official day in business was her 21st birthday. It also took De Verrier eight months to sell her first home, which she attributes to the pandemic and the fact that she was just starting out in the industry. In the meantime, she lived off her savings and moonlighted as a restaurant hostess for extra cash. \"It was just a complete shit show,\" she said. \"I would do real estate all day during the day, go to my night shift. And it would be funny because clients would call me when I was on shift, and so I would make some excuse to go to the bathroom or step into the alleyway to negotiate deals.\" At times, she also doubted herself because of her age. \"Who's going to trust a 20-something-year-old to buy or sell their biggest asset?\" De Verrier said. But for the most part, people don't seem to care about how young she was. De Verrier says clients typically trust her because she's knowledgeable and does her best to come across as professional. \"To this day, people are like, you look 23, but you act [older],\" she said. \"Looking back, I don't think it was as big of a deal as I made it out to be in my head.\" De Verrier made over $100,000 last year, according to documents viewed by BI. Joseph Khateri, a 21-year-old real-estate agent in Virginia, said he got his real estate license when he was 18, but he was dabbling in real estate long before that. Khateri helped his immigrant parents read documents and sell their home twice when he was younger. The last time Khateri helped his parents move, the realtor who sold them their house in Virginia told him to think about getting into the real estate business. Afer obtaining his license, he plunged into the real estate business full-time, working as many as 80 hours a week his first few years. Khateri described his approach to real-estate as a kind of game, adding that he worked doggedly to bring up his hourly rate, or what his salary would be if he were paid by the hour. It was tough going, though. It took Khateri around six months to sell his first home. His commission, when subtracting fees from his brokerage and other work-related expenses, came out to a rate of around $2 an hour. \"I was just losing money every month,\" he said. \"My parents were like, 'Joseph, what are you doing?'\" He, too, said he had trouble doing deals because of his age. \"Ageism is a very big thing with real estate,\" he said. Since then, things have picked up. Last year, Khateri made around $70,000 from his real estate business alone, which includes his income from commission, referrals to clients, and consulting, statements viewed by BI show. The Gen Z realtors who spoke to BI said they all want to stick with real estate, even if its just as a side hustle. Milonas, who grew up in a working-class family in Queens, said he planned on scaling his business and building generational wealth through his real estate ventures. Khateri picked up a full-time job as a software engineer last year and said he would continue to work in real estate on the side. Money is part of the reason why, he admits, as he's a close follower of the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement. He said expects to make $200,000 in income this year. But for the most part, he just finds real estate fun. \"I'm a huge money guy, numbers guy, heavily into finance. I simply just like helping people with their investments. It's honestly fun for me,\" he said. De Verrier said she would also stay in the industry, with plans to potentially build her own team of agents one day. \"I don't know what else I would do, honestly,\" she said. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-28","content":" For years, Apple, Samsung, and Google have been battling for dominance in the smartphone arena, pushing out incremental updates and headline-grabbing flagship devices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi has been playing a different game\u2014one that\u2019s flown under the radar but has quietly secured its own territory. While the big brands fight over who has the best camera, AI assistant, or the fastest chip, Xiaomi has been perfecting something far more essential: keeping all that high-end tech powered up. The company\u2019s latest 212W HyperCharge Power Bank 25000 (or HyperCharge for short) is an absolute beast of an external battery, packing power levels that put most laptop chargers to shame. Yes, it\u2019s just a power bank, but that\u2019s like calling a Ferrari \u201cjust a car.\u201d The 25,000 mAh capacity and peak 212W output put it in a different league, built for more than just topping off your phone. This thing is designed for brute force, capable of fast-charging a MacBook Pro, juicing up a gaming handheld mid-session, or keeping multiple devices alive without flinching. Whether you\u2019re a traveler, a content creator, or just someone who refuses to see the low-battery warning, this power bank ensures you\u2019re always covered. Designer: Xiaomi        The HyperCharge comes with three ports: two USB-C and one USB-A, each optimized for different use cases. The first USB-C port hits an insane 140W, enough to handle power-hungry laptops and high-wattage accessories. The second USB-C delivers a solid 45W, perfect for tablets or ultrabooks, while the USB-A cranks out 120W, making it one of the most powerful multi-port power banks available. When all three ports are in use, the power dynamically adjusts\u201465W on one USB-C, 27W on the other, and a steady 120W on the USB-A\u2014ensuring a balanced charge across all devices.       The 90.8Wh energy capacity means it can charge an iPhone 15 around five times, a MacBook Pro nearly to full, or keep a Steam Deck running through long-haul flights. It even recharges itself at 100W, meaning it can go from empty to full in just 2.5 hours\u2014a crucial feature when you don\u2019t have time to wait around for a slow charge. And Xiaomi didn\u2019t just throw power at the problem; they also included nine layers of safety protection to prevent overheating, overcharging, and short circuits, making it as reliable as it is powerful.  The power bank adopts a transparent design aesthetic, really leaning into the theme that has now become a dominant design language popularized by brands like Nothing and Sharge. The HyperCharge power bank sports a transparent shell on three sides, revealing its internals in all their glory. The transparent design helps give the power bank more character, elevating it from a plastic slab to something little more cyberpunk. The neatly arranged circuitry, capacitors, and power distribution boards are visible through the casing, offering a rare peek into the hardware we usually take for granted. Adding to the futuristic aesthetic is a color display that provides real-time battery levels, power output, and charging status.  The HyperCharge is designed for a broad range of devices, from gaming laptops to smartphones, drones, cameras, and even the Nintendo Switch. Unlike most power banks that cap out at 30W or 60W, limiting them to phones and tablets, this one thrives in high-performance scenarios. If you\u2019re a digital nomad juggling a MacBook, an iPad, and a flagship Android phone, this is the one device that can keep everything running without needing multiple chargers.  Despite its hefty battery, it remains airline-friendly, sitting just under the 100Wh limit imposed by most airlines. That means no awkward conversations at security\u2014just toss it in your carry-on and go. And with its support for USB Power Delivery 3.1, it works seamlessly with a wide range of devices, eliminating the need for proprietary chargers.  Xiaomi has managed to keep pricing competitive too. In Japan, the 212W HyperCharge Power Bank retails for about $87, while in Hong Kong, it goes for around $77. Given that it can replace multiple chargers and extend the battery life of everything in your tech arsenal, that price feels like a steal. Moreover, it\u2019s Xiaomi\u2019s masterstroke in dominating an essential tech industry while other tech brands are busy competing over AI and silicone chips. Power banks are absolute tech essentials, and I can\u2019t recommend them enough\u2026 but more importantly, they also give Xiaomi\u2019s battery R&D an edge over other brands, which seem to be distracted by LLMs and smart assistants.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Michael Cuggino, manager of the Permanent Portfolio Aggressive Growth Portfolio (PAGRX) is BI's Investor of the Month for February. While his fund has slipped over the last week as the market has faced a few macroeconomic challenges, it was off to a hot start in February, rising 9.5% through the 18th. And on a trailing 12-month basis, it's smashing the S&P 500, returning 28% versus the index's 17%. It's par for the course for Cuggino's fund. Gaining an average of 13.28% a year over the last decade, he's outperformed the S&P 500's annualized 13.1% returns over that time. Last year, Cuggino notched a 44% gain versus the benchmark's 25%. How has he generated the impressive alpha? Cuggino attributes his success to the independent nature of the fund. It doesn't set out to track particular indexes, and it doesn't look to invest along any particular theme. \"Sometimes managers will look at the S&P 500 ratings and go, 'Well, transports are 6%, so I'm gonna go to 7% transports or 3%. We don't do that,\" he said. \"We kind of throw those weightings out and do our own.\" Instead, it simply seeks to identify quality growth firms. It does this, Cuggino said, by screening for firms with strong pricing power, earnings growth, revenue growth, who their management team is, what their total addressable market is, and whether or not its valuation sits at a reasonable level relative to other stocks in its industry. That formula has resulted in a high level of exposure to the tech sector at 38% of the fund, but also in stocks across several sectors. So while PAGRX's performance has been in part due to the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the market, it's also gotten help from a smattering of different sectors, including industrials, consumer cyclicals, and communication services. Below are the fund's top 10 holdings, their performance over the last 12 months, and their weightings. The AI trade has given PAGRX a boost over the last couple of years, and Cuggino sees it continuing to drive returns. But he also acknowledged that risks for a reversal in the rally are growing amid high valuations and geopolitical uncertainty. \"The longer you go without a correction or a consolidation makes one more likely, I think, at some point during the year,\" Cuggino said. In that scenario, he'll be looking for energy and materials to pick up the slack, given their recent underperformance. \"I think you've got to be careful, and the way you be careful is invest in areas that maybe haven't kept up,\" he said. \"I think if you're patient, you have some room there.\" Cuggino's fund has a 5.06% weighting to the energy sector and a 12.77% weighting to materials. Funds like the iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (IYM) and the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) offer broad exposure to these trades. Those considered for BI's Investor of the Month include managers of US-listed mutual funds or ETFs, those whose funds have outperformed peers in a given month, and those whose funds are outperforming a benchmark index (in most cases this will be the S&P 500) on a trailing 12-month basis. Leveraged funds are not considered. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images) Market heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) delivered blockbuster results in Q4 of its fiscal year ended January 2025, which saw revenue soar to a record $39.3 billion, up 12% sequentially and 78% year-over-year. The artificial intelligence chip leader posted $0.89 of EPS in the period, up 71% year-over-year, as the company capitalized on accelerating demand for AI-driven computing, particularly for its Blackwell AI platform, which contributed billions in its first quarter of sales. Data Center revenue hit a record $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year and 16% sequentially, fueled by hyperscaler adoption and rapid deployment of Nvidia\u2019s GB200 systems across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Meanwhile, the gaming segment softened, with revenue of $2.5 billion reflecting a 22% decline sequentially and an 11% drop year-over-year, though management remains optimistic about AI-driven gaming innovations. Looking ahead, NVDA expects Q1 fiscal year 26 revenue of approximately $43 billion, representing continued momentum despite expectations for lower gross margins of around 70.6% (GAAP) and 71.0% (non-GAAP). The company remains aggressive in its expansion, recently announcing partnerships with Verizon for AI-powered 5G, collaborations with biotech leaders in healthcare AI, and its first R&D center in Vietnam. Analysts are projecting fantastic bottom-line growth, with the consensus FY 2026 (ends January 2026) EPS estimate now residing at $4.54, up from $2.99 in FY 2025. Further, the projections for FY 2027 and FY 2028 presently stand at $5.70 and $6.46, respectively. No doubt, the growth rates Nvidia has been able to achieve are nothing short of remarkable, underpinned by revolutionary achievements in chip design. Still, even after an 8% post-earnings whack to the stock price, the market capitalization stands at $3 trillion, meaning the law of large numbers should give investors pause. After all, the more-than-$250-billion market-cap hit for NVDA on February 27 was larger in size than the entire market cap of household names like McDonald\u2019s, American Express and Walt Disney. That is not to say that I think NVDA is trading at a ridiculous valuation, as was the case for many profitless stocks during the 2000 Tech Bubble. Still, a forward P\/E ratio of 27, a price-to-sales ratio of 22.5 and a price-to-book value ratio of 37 make the stock too expensively valued for my taste, as such a lofty price raises concerns about whether the growth trajectory can match (or dare I say outpace) current market expectations. Indeed, I would bet that if someone had the Q4 results and guidance ahead of time, he or she would have been buyers of NVDA as the numbers were spectacular. While demand for AI infrastructure remains robust, much of the company\u2019s explosive growth has been priced into the stock, leaving little margin for error. Any slowdown in data center spending, increased competition from AMD and others, and potential custom AI chips developed by cloud giants, not to mention macroeconomic headwinds, could pressure margins and dampen investor enthusiasm. Certainly, I am keeping a watchful eye on NVDA and a double-digit share price could have me singing a different tune about the stock, especially as I think AI will be a major growth story for years to come. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the transformative impact of AI on global industries, stating, \u201cThe demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we\u2019re observing another scaling law, inference time or test-time scaling. The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAIs, Grok-3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute.\" For investors looking to gain exposure to AI without the premium valuation of Nvidia, I highlighted more than a dozen stocks in my latest Special Report. Investment Insight: Decoding AI and Generating Investment Ideas Nvidia\u2019s AI-fueled data center boom has turned into a gusher for the semiconductor supply chain, offering tremendous opportunity for Lam Research (LRCX). The company makes the high-tech picks and shovels\u2014etch and deposition tools\u2014needed to churn out high-bandwidth memory and advanced logic chips, both of which are in hot demand as AI workloads get more power-hungry. With memory giants like Samsung and SK Hynix cranking up production to keep pace with Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell ramp, Lam is sitting in the catbird seat. As long as AI keeps gobbling up ever-more data and demanding ever-faster chips, I think Lam\u2019s business will hum along just fine, making it another smart way to hitch a ride on the AI train at a more reasonable price tag. And LRCX even comes with a modest 1.2% current dividend yield.

(Photo by Abdullah Guclu\/Anadolu via Getty Images) See More On Trefis.com Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) experienced a 7% decline on Thursday, February 27th, as part of a broader selloff affecting chip stocks. This market reaction followed the release of Nvidia\u2019s earnings report and President Trump\u2019s announcement of increased tariffs on China, as well as the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, set to take effect next week. Separately, Should You Buy Monster Beverage Stock At $55? After its recent fall, AVGO stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $200. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AVGO stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high.  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 Broadcom has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 20.1 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 69.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 51.9 vs. the benchmark\u2019s 24.4 Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. \u2022 Broadcom has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 24.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 44.0% from $36 Bil to $52 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 51.2% to $14 Bil in the most recent quarter from $9.3 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Broadcom's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 29.1% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Broadcom\u2019s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $20 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 38.7% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. \u2022 Broadcom's Debt figure was $68 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $925 Bil (as of 2\/27\/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 6.5% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $9 billion of the $166 billion in Total Assets for Broadcom. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 5.6% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 AVGO stock fell 34.8% from a high of $62.71 on 4 January 2022 to $40.86 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 May 2023  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $249.33 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $200 \u2022 AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $27.40 on 19 February 2020 to $14.57 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Profitability: Very Strong  \u2022 Financial Stability: Strong  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Strong  \u2022 Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Many smart ring deals have hit the market over the past few years of the product category's existence, and Oura's last-gen ring has been a top-seller among them. For those who don't mind going last-gen, Amazon has knocked 17% off the Oura Ring 3's price (Heritage edition), marking $50 off the normal purchase price and bringing it down to its lowest price ever. While Oura launched the Ring Gen 4 last year, the Ring 3 has held a place at the front of the industry for years, offering a solid smart ring even by modern standards. With this deal, the Oura Ring Gen 3 is just $250, while the Gen 4 retails at $500, so it's definitely worth thinking about whether you need the newest model or not. Oura Ring Gen 3: $299.00 $249 at Amazon For a limited time, Amazon has cut 17% off the price of the last-gen Oura Ring, a smart ring that features many of the health tracking features that users love. From its long battery life to the ring's two different styles, the Gen 3 Oura Ring is almost as good as its successor, especially for those who are new to the smart ring world.  \u2705Recommended if: you want a smart ring with up to a weeks' worth of battery life; you want the basic features that come with most smart rings, such as heart rate monitoring and variability, SpO2, and temperature tracking. \u274cSkip this deal if: you'd prefer to go with the latest generation, the Oura Ring 4; you want something that pairs reliable automatic activity detection (AAD) with heart rate data; you need something with Find My Ring for Android. The Oura Ring Gen 3 is a great last-generation smart ring, offering a range of health features from temperature monitoring, heart rate tracking and activity detection, SpO2, and more. It also boasts about a weeks' worth of battery, and easy app compatibility that actually makes it pretty fun to use. It is also worth considering that the Oura Ring 4 is our pick for the best smart ring overall, though the Gen 3 is not far behind. Both include great app support, though some of the main differences between the Oura Ring 3 and 4 primarily include the next-gen ring's updated sensors for even better health monitoring, and the addition of automatic activity detection (AAD) for heart rate data. If those aren't dealbreakers, however, it's worth considering the extra $50 off to go last-gen\u2014especially if you're a casual smart ring user.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Cancer patients and others with debilitating conditions have highlighted shortages of a vital drug they say have had a \"devastating\" impact on their lives. Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert), helps digestion, but has been hard to obtain for the last year and shortages are predicted to last until 2026.  It is thought more than 61,000 patients in the UK need it, including those with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. Some patients said through Your Voice, Your BBC News that they have had to cover long distances to find a pharmacist with supplies. The Department of Health and Social care says it is working closely with the NHS, manufacturers and others in the supply chain to try to resolve the issues. Without the drug, patients lose weight and strength, which means their ability to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy is reduced. Diana Gibb, who is 74, and her husband Mick, 78, live in Tonbridge, Kent. Mick had a major operation to treat pancreatic cancer in 2023. Diana wrote to BBC News explaining that it is impossible for Mick to digest food without creon. She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine. \"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week. \"Pharmacies cannot get hold of lower dosage either and there is no alternative medication. I was worried that my husband would starve to death without them.\" Diana says for now they can get supplies of the drug but there is no guarantee week-to-week, and that is still a big worry. Bryony Thomas, who is from Stroud in Gloucestershire, needs creon after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly.  She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe.  At one stage, she says she obtained the drug from another patient, who had a surplus, against regulations via Instagram. She describes her situation as \"constantly stressful\". Leading pancreatic clinicians and charities including Pancreatic Cancer UK have written to the prime minister saying the absence of Pert can have a \"devastating impact on people's lives\", with doctors and pharmacists \"inundated with requests for help from desparate patients\".  The letter says that without the drug, people experience \"horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life\". There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".  They say that with creon running short, switching by patients has depleted stocks of the alternatives. They are calling for a national process for importing Pert. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust says the shortages have caused \"significant worry and stress for those affected\".   The charity has told patients that a \"shortage of raw ingredients is straining the manufacturing process and disrupting global supply chains\".   Production of creon is said to rely heavily on pancreatic enzymes sourced from pigs.  The Royal Pharmaceutical Society meanwhile is calling on the government to adopt a national strategy to manage medicine shortages. There have been wider problems with drug shortages. The National Pharmacy Association, representing community chemists in the UK, sought views on the issue. Of the 500 which responded, all said they were unable to dispense a prescription at least once a day because of supply problems, and a large majority said patients came in at least once a day to get medicines they had failed to get elsewhere. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We know how frustrating and distressing medicine supply issues can be for patients, and the pharmacists and clinicians caring for them. \"We've issued guidance to healthcare professionals and encourage anyone concerned to consult their clinician.\" Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Apple has offered a reason why the iPhone 16e doesn't include MagSafe, one of the more notable omissions from its latest entry-level smartphone. According to Apple representatives who spoke to Daring Fireball's John Gruber, MagSafe is not included in the iPhone 16e because \"most people in the iPhone 16e's target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable.\" These users apparently tend not to use wireless charging at all, and when they do use it, Apple believes the slower 7.5W Qi charging speed compared to MagSafe's faster rates isn't a deciding factor for the customer segment it is targeting with the more affordable device. Introduced with the iPhone 12 lineup in 2020, MagSafe uses magnets embedded in the back of compatible iPhones to align wireless chargers and attach accessories. The technology allows for faster wireless charging (up to 15W on most models and 25W on newer Pro models) compared to standard Qi wireless charging, which is limited to 7.5W on iPhones. Apple has developed a whole ecosystem of MagSafe accessories including cases, wallets, battery packs, and mounts. The magnetic alignment ensures an optimal charging position and makes attaching accessories more convenient. When the iPhone 16e was announced, there was some speculation that its new C1 modem might have interfered with MagSafe functionality, but Apple has already confirmed that this wasn't the case. Backing up Apple's claim, a prominent iPhone case manufacturer also told MacRumors that its testing confirmed that MagSafe cases don't impact the C1 modem's performance. The iPhone 16e continues the trend set by its predecessor, the now-discontinued iPhone SE, which also lacked MagSafe connectivity. However, the 16e is the first iPhone in Apple's flagship smartphone lineup to omit this feature since its introduction. For users who prefer the convenience of MagSafe, some third-party iPhone 16e cases include built-in magnets, but they won't enable faster charging speeds. Interestingly, IT Home reports that Apple retail stores have had to create a workaround for displaying the iPhone 16e with wireless charging that prevents the device from slipping off its display dock. Apple is using a special docking station that includes a bottom groove that holds the device upright, enabling wireless charging during demonstrations. This custom dock only activates charging when the phone is placed vertically \u2013 if you place it horizontally, the iPhone falls off. Apple's decision to exclude MagSafe from the iPhone 16e may be a cost-cutting measure. But as Gruber notes, \"I think Apple knows the 16e's intended audience better than I do,\" suggesting the company has done its market research on what features matter most to the target buyers of this device.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Let's stipulate that Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million. So he can do anything he wants with it. Like ordering the paper's editors not to make a presidential endorsement. Or announcing that from now on the paper's op-ed pages would only publish stuff that supports \"personal liberties and free markets,\" as he announced this week. That said, those decisions seem to be costing Bezos money, at the very least. When the billionaire announced his non-endorsement plans last fall, days before the election, hundreds of thousands of subscribers canceled their subscriptions in less than two weeks, NPR's David Folkenflik previously reported. Now Folkenflik reports that 75,000 subscribers have left the paper following Bezos' op-ed shift, announced on Wednesday. Though a Post executive told Folkenflik the paper signed up another 400,000 subscribers in between Bezos' announcements, numbers Folkenflik has seen indicate the Post has \"a net loss of a couple hundred thousand subscribers,\"  he reported. A Post rep declined to comment about subscription numbers. The important context here is that prior to Bezos' op-ed moves, he had installed new leadership at the Post, tasked with finding new readers and new ways to make money. Now, he appears to be making both things harder. It's always possible that Bezos' moves will generate more readership from people who want to read an op-ed page promoting a libertarian\/conservative point of view. Though it's hard to believe that market is \"underserved,\" as he argued in his memo announcing the changes: Among traditional media, both The Economist and The Wall Street Journal service that market today. And it's very easy to find that point of view on the wider internet (and particularly on Twitter, now that Elon Musk bought it, changed its name to X, and began amplifying right-learning accounts). It's also possible that after this newest controversy, the Post will eventually settle into another version of the Journal, which has a famously right-wing op-ed section and does respected, down-the-middle news reporting in the rest of its pages. And it's also worth noting that on Friday, two days after Bezos kicked off the latest unrest among his readers and his staff, WaPo op-ed writer Dana Milbank published a story arguing that \"the single greatest threat to \"personal liberties and free markets\" in the United States today [is] President Donald Trump.\" So we really don't know how all of this will shake out. That said \u2026 from outside the paper, Bezos' moves look like they're calculated to please a single reader. President Donald Trump. Ask Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News personality who now hosts a successful podcast\/YouTube show: \"He's doing what Joe [Scarborough] and Mika [Brzezinski] did. He's bending the knee,\" she said at an event hosted by Semafor this week, referring to the MSNBC hosts' visit to Trump days after last fall's election. Will that work? Maybe, says Kelly, who appeared onstage at a Trump rally during the last campaign. \"You win respect with Trump when you go to him and you tell him 'I like you,' which is clearly what Bezos did. The reporting is very clear,\" she said. \"I think Trump and he will be fine. But that doesn't make any difference at all to somebody like me, who's actually looking for sincerity.\" So if you follow that critique, Bezos is in a bit of a pickle: He can steer his paper in a way that could make the president of the United States happy \u2014 but will lose readers on the left, and won't gain them on the right. Maybe all of that is OK for the third-richest man in the world, who could buy another 100 Washington Posts and still have more money than Larry Ellison, who's currently one slot behind him on Forbes's tally of the world's billionaires. But then why own the Post at all? Then Bezos wouldn't have to worry about what Donald Trump, or Megyn Kelly, or anyone else \u2014 including the paper's readers \u2014 think about it.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Shares of British Airways' parent company IAG gained altitude Friday after full-year results beat analyst expectations amid strong demand for air travel. Adjusted operating profit jumped 27% to 4.4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) in 2024, surpassing the 3.7 billion euros forecast by analysts. The airline group, which owns Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling, and Irish airline Aer Lingus, said revenue rose 9% to 32.1 billion euros, also exceeding expectations. London-listed IAG rose as much as 5%, putting the stock up about 17% since the start of the year and more than 130% higher over the past 12 months.  That's better than the 105% rise for United Airlines stock over the same period. Delta Air Lines stock has gained 42% over the past year, while American Airlines stock is down about 6% and Southwest Airlines stock has fallen about 10%. IAG announced it would buy back shares worth 1 billion euros over the next 12 months. \"The announcement of a further 1 billion euro share buyback program reflects confidence from a company which is currently flying high,\" said Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor.  \"Significant cash generation has helped IAG in dealing with arguably the biggest thorn in its side, namely net debt, which represents an overhang from the days of the pandemic when the group was forced to ratchet up borrowings to survive.\" CEO Luis Gallego said in a statement: \"These results highlight the quality of our businesses and effectiveness of our strategy, underpinned by the successful execution of our transformation program across the group. We are delivering world-class margins and returns, in line with the targets we set out to the market just over a year ago.\" IAG said demand for air travel remained strong in 2025: \"Leisure travel remains robust as a major priority for households and in recent years we have seen this boosted by a shift as customers value experiences over material purchases.\" While corporate travel increased last year, the company did not expect it to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels, especially for short-haul trips. British Airways remains the market leader to North America from London. It will be the only airline offering a first class cabin from the British capital across the Atlantic by the end of the year, IAG said. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks","label":1}

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"HP is preparing for more Chinese tariffs  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  HP has announced that by the end of fiscal year 2025 the company will have moved almost all (90%) of its production for North America away from China. The change means that, from October 31, 2025, only one tenth of HP products destined for North America will come from China, with HP turning to a more diverse supply chain to both reduce its reliance on China amid ongoing trade wars and enhance its resilience more generally. The Trump administration has recently placed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, which accounts for a significant majority of laptops shipped to the US. Supply chain shifts are just some of the steps being taken by HP to mitigate the effects of ongoing changes affecting nations globally. Apart from pulling nearly all of its manufacturing for the States out of China, HP has also increased its inventory during the most recent quarter as a strategy to minimize the impacts of potential US tariff hikes. The company confirmed in its earnings release: \u201cInventory ended the quarter at $8.4 billion, up 9 days quarter over quarter to 72 days.\u201d Even in a three-month period of acquiring more inventory, HP also managed to increase revenue by 2.4% to $13.5 billion. \u201cWe are pleased with our Q1 performance, achieving revenue growth for the third straight quarter and advancing our strategy to lead the future of work,\" noted HP CEO Enrique Lores. \"We are focused on taking decisive action to address evolving market conditions in the near-term, while investing in our long-term growth.\u201d Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Many healthcare startups and investors are hoping for a fresh wave of M&A in 2025 after a slow few years for company combinations \u2014 and the right buyers might just be their startup peers. At the end of 2024, many healthcare startups were quietly raising down rounds and looking around for buyers to extend their lifespans, Business Insider reported in November. While some startups are desperate for deals, nearly a dozen investors and bankers told BI in February that few large companies had the appetite to make big acquisitions in healthcare this year. \"In digital health, it's not necessarily that it doesn't make sense to consolidate \u2014 it's there's a lack of consolidators out there,\" said Aaron DeGagne, a senior healthcare analyst at PitchBook. But those startups could find a new home with other digital health startups that are flush with cash. Several healthcare startups have been vocal about their M&A ambitions this year as they await dropping interest rates and are eager to jump on opportunities for inorganic growth. These are seven healthcare startups that appear ready to make more acquisitions in 2025. Founded: 2013 Last fundraise: $180 million in Series C extension and growth debt expansion funding in August 2024. The surgical software company Caresyntax is planning on using a fresh fundraise to power acquisitions. Caresyntax, which combines information from surgical videos, medical records, and other sources to help make surgeries safer and more profitable, grabbed $180 million in August. In a release about the funding round, the company said it was looking to make several acquisitions in 2024 and beyond. Josh Zeidman, Caresyntax's chief business officer, told BI the company was looking for acquisitions in areas such as surgical AI applications, video analytics, and data capture modules. He said Caresyntax was primarily considering deals with venture-backed startups or other small private companies rather than with private equity or public companies. Caresyntax said in its August release that it had acquired multiple surgical data and technology assets in 2023, though it didn't name those acquisitions. Zeidman told BI that Caresyntax's primary get in 2023 was acquiring the team behind health data consulting company CQInsights, including its CEO, Dr. Bruce Ramshaw, who became Caresyntax's chief medical informatics officer.  Founded: 2017 Last fundraise: $70 million from General Catalyst, as part of Commure's $6 billion merger with Athelas in October 2023 M&A is a core part of the healthcare startup Commure's playbook. Commure, the health software company cofounded by General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja, has made seven acquisitions to date. Former employees told BI in September that Commure's leadership regularly touted the slogan \"M&A is in our DNA.\" Most recently, the startup bought the care coordination platform Memora Health in December. Memora Health was another General Catalyst investment, as was Athelas, the revenue cycle management company Commure merged with in 2023. Commure also announced in July a $139 million all-cash acquisition of the public medical scribing company Augmedix. Commure didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Founded: 2017 Last fundraise: Sixth Street and other investors contributed an undisclosed amount of funding in 2021 to support Datavant's $7 billion merger with Ciox Health. The health data startup Datavant is hunting for more deals after kicking off a fresh M&A push in the fall. CEO Kyle Armbrester told BI in January that the company, which has made 11 acquisitions since 2017, planned to make at least \"one or two\" more acquisitions in early 2025. Datavant manages patient data exchanges between providers, payers, and life sciences organizations. The private equity firm New Mountain Capital is Datavant's controlling shareholder. Datavant most recently made two deals in September: It bought the data privacy organization Trace Data and two data analytics products from the healthcare AI startup Apixio. Armbrester said Datavant was looking for companies building technology for healthcare providers and life sciences organizations, especially those with existing market traction. \"We're large and diversified, and I think we're in a really good space to take a smaller smarter and apply their logic or artificial intelligence or analytics across that vast network to see a lot of benefit,\" Armbrester said. Flare Capital Partners' Parth Desai told BI in December that he expected private-equity-backed healthcare companies to make tuck-in acquisitions in 2025 as they prepare for potential IPOs in 2026. Founded: 2014 Last fundraise: $400 million in Series E funding in October 2021 2025 could be the year that Hinge Health finally goes public. Multiple investors and bankers told BI in February that the physical therapy startup was the best choice for the year's first digital health IPO, with margins more closely resembling a software company than a healthcare services provider. Hinge Health hired banks including Morgan Stanley last year to prepare for a public market debut, hoping to go public in early 2025, BI reported in September. Those ambitions shouldn't preclude the startup from making acquisitions. Similar to Datavant, Hinge Health could look to notch some deals before an IPO to further its growth. CEO Daniel Perez told BI in October 2023 that Hinge Health was actively looking for smaller companies to acquire, a sentiment the startup echoed to Endpoints News at the start of 2024. The company hasn't announced any acquisitions since then. Hinge Health declined to comment for this story. Founded: 2014 Last fundraise: $275 million in Series F funding in January 2025 Innovaccer is hoping to use a fresh mega-round to fuel acquisitions. At the start of the year, the company announced its $275 million Series F round, a combination of primary and secondary investments from investors such as B Capital Group and Kaiser Permanente. Less than two weeks later, Innovaccer announced it had bought the actuarial analytics startup Humbi AI. Innovaccer also made two acquisitions last year, scooping up the healthcare marketing platform Cured in January 2024 and the pharmacy software company Pharmacy Quality Solutions that March. The startup told Endpoints News this January that it was looking to buy more health tech companies this year. CEO Abhinav Shashank said Innovaccer was looking at companies working to enhance the patient experience, relieve administrative burdens for providers with automation, and decrease costs. \"Our acquisition strategy is to accelerate our roadmap by partnering with like-minded mission-driven companies that can help customers drive these transformations,\" Shashank said in a statement to BI. Founded: 2021 Last fundraise: $60 million in Series A funding in February 2024 Fabric, the only early-stage startup on this list, has centered M&A in its approach since its March 2023 launch. The healthcare startup said it planned to accelerate that strategy further this year. Fabric made four acquisitions in 15 months, most recently buying the physician practice group TeamHealth's virtual care business in September. Before that, Fabric bought the virtual care business MeMD from Walmart, the asynchronous virtual care platform Zipnosis from Bright Health, and the generative AI startup Gyant. Fabric sells software to help emergency rooms manage patients, including by directing them to telehealth services where appropriate. General Catalyst led its $60 million Series A round in February 2024. Fabric's founder and CEO, Aniq Rahman, told BI in September that Fabric was starting to look at bigger acquisition targets. \"A lot of the companies that are struggling to go raise capital right now, or some of these larger businesses that are reevaluating their position in the market, are creating opportunities for us as well,\" he said. \"Pretty much every week, there's inbound coming in from investors that are like, we have assets in our portfolio that may be accretive to what you're doing with Fabric.\" Rahman told BI in February that Fabric expected to ramp up its M&A strategy even more in 2025. He said Fabric had \"already met with a few dozen companies this year around M&A\" and was watching opportunities across venture-backed startups, private-equity-owned companies, and even spinouts of public companies.  Founded: 2020 Last fundraise: $126 million in Series D funding in May 2024 Transcarent, the healthcare benefits navigation startup helmed by Glen Tullman, the former Livongo CEO, kicked off the year with a big acquisition. The company announced in January that it would buy its fellow care navigation company Accolade from the public markets in a $621 million all-cash deal. It's one of at least three deals Transcarent has made to date. The startup bought 98point6's virtual care tech and physician group in March 2023 and merged with the surgical care startup BridgeHealth in 2020. Transcarent's top M&A priority for 2025 is to successfully integrate Accolade into its business, CEO Glen Tullman told BI in a statement. Still, he said the company remained strategically opportunistic and was consistently evaluating opportunities for growth and innovation. Transcarent is backed by General Catalyst, which certainly hasn't shied away from M&A for its healthcare bets, as seen through Fabric and Commure's rich histories of acquisitions. Tullman's own investment firm, 7wire Ventures, also an investor in Transcarent, has similarly combined its own portfolio companies, most recently selling the mental health startup Caraway to the pediatric care company Summer Health in February. General Catalyst and 7wire Ventures co-led Transcarent's $126 million Series D round in May. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Where you live can impact how much you pay for utilities. That's because the price of electricity depends on more than just the price of oil and gas. It is also affected by local utilities' investment in infrastructure, whether the state is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the amount of renewable energy that powers the grid. The most recent data published by the Energy Information Administration, a US government agency, showed that residents of Hawaii, Connecticut, and Alabama had the highest average monthly electricity bills in 2024. Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado had the lowest average bills. As energy bills have risen even faster than overall inflation in recent years, the greatest burden falls on the lowest earners, who tend to spend a larger share of their budgets on utilities. While President Donald Trump has promised to slash energy prices in half by pursuing a \"drill, baby, drill\" agenda on oil and gas, energy analysts and economists told Business Insider it's not that simple. Extreme weather combined with exploding costs to upgrade the infrastructure that delivers electricity across the country are fueling higher prices. Renewable energy has helped moderate prices in some states, but looming tariffs on Canada and Mexico combined with skyrocketing energy demand from data centers may only increase costs.  Energy experts shared some of the biggest factors driving energy costs and explained why there are disparities among states. Since January 2020, consumer energy services costs have risen about 34%, compared to a 23% increase in overall prices, Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed. Additionally, the Bank of America Institute found that the median utility bill payment for electricity, gas, and water rose 6% in January compared to a year earlier, double the 3% rise in overall inflation during this period. These cost increases have hit people with the lowest incomes the hardest. A Bank of America Institute note said that in 2023, US households with annual incomes below $50,000 spent 6.8% of their earnings on natural gas and electricity costs, compared to 1.2% for households with annual incomes more than $150,000. While it's no surprise that using more fuel or electricity can spike customers' energy bills, analysts told Business Insider that extreme weather, volatile oil and gas prices, and utilities' growing investments in the poles, wires, and big transmission lines that deliver power to homes are all contributing to increased costs. Freezing winters \u2014 like the subzero temperatures that blanketed the US this year \u2014 and scorching summers can spike the demand for heat and air conditioning and hike costs. Utilities are investing in aging infrastructure that carries electricity from power plants to communities and can recover those costs from their customers. Oil and gas, which still supplies the majority of US electricity, is a volatile market vulnerable to global shocks like Russia's war in Ukraine. Those shocks hit New England hard. The region, which includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, gets more than 50% of its power from natural gas. And unlike states such as Pennsylvania or Texas \u2014 where natural gas is underground in the region \u2014 a lot of the fuel for New England states is imported. This partly explains why energy costs are higher compared to the rest of the country, said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group. Dolan said wholesale electricity prices have fallen over the last two decades, but that's been offset by transmission costs soaring 800% between 2004 and 2023, data from New England's regional transmission organization showed. \"We've also seen a dramatic increase in the spending at the distribution level as we build out more substations, poles, and wires to highly electrified homes and businesses,\" Dolan said. \"Those combined elements \u2014 transmission and distribution \u2014 now make up the largest single segment of the vast majority of electricity rates across New England.\" Dolan added that New England states have more aggressive climate policies, including participation in a regional cooperative that caps carbon emissions from power plants and requires them to pay for every ton they emit \u2014 another cost that's passed on to customers. On the opposite coast in California, extreme weather is driving higher utility bills, which averaged $159 a month in 2024. Utilities have spent billions of dollars on wildfire-related costs that are partially being passed on to consumers, said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank. Those costs include investments in preventing wildfires, like managing vegetation that can catch fire and burying power lines underground, as well as legal liabilities for blazes caused by their infrastructure. Pierpont added that some states, including Colorado and New Mexico, have been able to moderate rising electricity costs in part by expanding solar and wind power. \"Many of the states with the cheapest power and lowest rate of increases have easy access to high-quality wind and solar resources,\" he said, citing a paper he authored last year. Johanna Neumann, senior director of Environment America's Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, said states that generate the highest percentage of their electricity from renewable energy sources have electricity rates that are below the national average, pointing to Iowa, South Dakota, and Oklahoma as examples. \"Renewables actually reduce wholesale electricity costs and reduce our dependence on notoriously volatile natural gas,\" she said. However, not all states that have heavily invested in renewables have electricity rates lower than the national average. Neumann pointed to Hawaii as one example, where she said benefits from renewables investments are being offset by continued reliance on imported oil. \"These fuels have to be shipped to the island across long distances, leading to higher electricity costs,\" she said. Texas is in a category of its own because the state's power grid is isolated from other regional ones. A deadly winter storm in 2021 that knocked out power and sent electricity prices soaring prompted state regulators to direct power plants to better prepare for extreme weather. While Texas has abundant natural gas resources and is a leader in solar and wind development, the state aims to build more fossil fuel and small nuclear power plants to meet growing demand, said Michele Richmond, executive director of the Texas Competitive Power Advocates, which represents companies that produce power, including natural gas, wind, and nuclear. Richmond added that Texas has a competitive, deregulated energy market that dispatches the cheapest power first to help offset some of the cost pressures. But it isn't immune from rising prices. \"We believe that having a diversified fuel mix is good for reliability because the wind doesn't blow all the time, and the sun doesn't shine all the time,\" Richmond said.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"INDIA - 2023\/02\/17: In this photo illustration, the logo of Amazon is seen displayed on a mobile ... [+] phone screen with AI (artificial intelligence) written in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) There are indications that AI-enthusiasm is leading current stock market valuations to be driven by sentiment, the psychological biases of excessive optimism and overconfidence, rather than by fundamentals. Four of the largest U.S. companies engaged in AI have announced plans to increase their capital investment by 45%, a testament to their great optimism for the technology. The four companies are Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. Of these, Amazon\u2019s share of the planned increase in capex is the largest, at almost one third. At the same time, U.S. stocks have held fairly steady, although the S&P 500 has declined by about 3% since the January 20 inauguration of President Trump. The case of Amazon provides a good vehicle for assessing the degree to which stock prices reflect psychological biases rather than underlying fundamentals. The fundamental value of the company as a whole is based on the amount of cash a company generates during a period of time which is available to be paid to both the company\u2019s debtholders and shareholders. The fundamental value of the company\u2019s stock is determined by the portion of these flows that can be paid just to the shareholders. A minority of sell-side analysts use free cash flow analysis to value Amazon\u2019s stocks. Analysts at the former Credit Suisse, now part of UBS, are among this minority. The history of their past reports, as well as their recent reports, provides important insights into the degree to which Amazon\u2019s current stock market valuation accurately reflects fundamentals. On February 27, 2025, Amazon\u2019s stock price closed at just under $210. The analyst team at UBS following Amazon set a target price of $230 for the stock. In October 2019, the team with the same lead analyst, Stephen Ju, established 2025 as the terminal year of their free cash flow analysis. In doing so, they divided their valuation number for Amazon\u2019s stock into two components, one for the five-year period 2020 through 2024, and the other for 2025 and thereafter. A point very important for readers to understand is that for Amazon\u2019s stock, the analyst team assigned about 80% of the stock\u2019s value to the period beginning in 2025. As a result, it is long-term issues that mostly drive the fundamental value of Amazon\u2019s stock, not the short-term, day-to-day fluctuations upon which investors mostly focus. The significance of the long-term approach provides the reason why discussions about capex are critical, as these expenditures significantly impact long-term free cash flows. Market psychology determines the degree to which the stock market is rational. Psychology impacts analysts\u2019 estimates of free cash flows and it impacts investors\u2019 reactions to market events. In a rational world, if analysts\u2019 forecasts of future free cash flows turn out be reasonably accurate, then there is reason to judge that their valuation estimates would be relatively unbiased. Consider two questions. In October 2019, how accurate was the UBS analyst team in forecasting Amazon\u2019s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024? How accurate was the team in forecasting what Amazon\u2019s market capitalization would be at the beginning of 2025? Based on my analysis of the UBS analyst report and Amazon\u2019s financial statements, it appears that the UBS team significantly overestimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024. The ratio of the average annual free cash flow forecast to its actual value was four, an optimistic bias of 300%. This implies that had the analyst team used the actual free cash flow values for their 2019 valuation computation, their target price would have been 25% of the figure in their actual report. The analyst team\u2019s calculations from 2019 provide an estimate of what the value of Amazon\u2019s stock would be at the beginning of 2025. The ratio of the actual value to the estimated value is 1.63, which means that the current market value of Amazon\u2019s stock is 63% higher than what the analyst calculations from 2019 implied. Juxtapose the answers to the two questions. The UBS team severely overestimated by 300% Amazon\u2019s free cash flows, and intrinsic value, during the period 2020 through 2024; and yet Amazon\u2019s stock price is 63% above UBS\u2019 valuation estimate from 2019. In a rational market, this would be very surprising. However, the evidence suggests that the market is far from rational, and this is the point. An important reason why the analyst team overestimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flows for the period beginning in 2020 is that they underestimated Amazon\u2019s capex. This, they did, to the point of assuming that Amazon\u2019s property, plant, and equipment would decline from one year to the next, eventually approaching zero. The assumption of declining PP&E is unrealistic for a company like Amazon, and has no precedent in Amazon\u2019s history. It stands completely opposite to Amazon\u2019s stated investment policy at the time, and certainly to Amazon\u2019s massive planned investment described above. Why the analyst team would make such an assumption is a matter of speculation. One thing to keep in mind is that for a given level of cash flow from operations, lower capex implies higher free cash flows. Therefore, lower capex, all else being the same, leads to a higher valuation. If the analyst team was looking for a way to construct the numbers to produce a higher valuation, this was a way to do it. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the balance sheet the analyst team presents in their 2019 report omits values for the line item PP&E. Indeed, it is the only line item in the balance sheet with blank entries. Therefore, investors interested in the analyst team\u2019s forecast for PP&E would have to compute the numbers themselves, which is what I did. For the record, consider the following fact. Suppose that in 2019, the analyst team used the actual figures for free cash flows to forecast the intrinsic value of Amazon stock at the outset of 2025. Then they would have arrived at a figure that is one ninth of Amazon\u2019s actual market cap. The difference between Amazon\u2019s market cap and the estimate of fundamental value based on actual free cash flows is important. This difference is an indication of just how much bias there is in current market valuations for tech stocks, especially for companies making large AI-related capital expenditures. In 2017, the prices of technology stocks began to increase dramatically, reflecting a discernable change in investor excitement about technology. That year Greg Ip, now the chief economics commentator for The Wall Street Journal, created a video entitled \u201cThe Economy Needs More Amazons.\u201d The website description of the video states the following: \u201cThe U.S. has observed a long period of low stock-market volatility and economic stagnation. The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip believes the economy and markets could benefit from more risk-taking companies - creative disrupters like Amazon.com.\u201d Amazon is a good company. For psychological reasons, investors exhibit a behavior pattern known as representativeness bias by assuming that good stocks are stocks of good companies. However, irrational exuberance can leads stocks of good companies to be bad stocks. Over the last five years, Amazon has been a good stock, returning 17% per year on average. The point to keep in mind is that this performance has not been generated by Amazon\u2019s free cash flows, the basis of its fundamental value. Instead, it has been generated by investor sentiment, the biased response to underlying fundamentals. Remember that the analyst team severely underestimated the rise in price of Amazon\u2019s stock, even as it simultaneously overestimated Amazon\u2019s free cash flow stream. Investing in stocks like Amazon involves bets on future sentiment as well as fundamentals. In a world of very high expectations for AI, and large capital expenditures in developing this technology, investors would do well to understand the extent to which they are relying on sustained and growing optimism to generate attractive returns. Investors should be paying attention to the differences between market caps and corresponding estimates of fundamental value. However, there appears to be little evidence of them doing so.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Wigan's fixture against Warrington on Saturday will be the first regular season Super League game to take place in the United States Rugby league history will be made on Saturday as the sport ventures stateside to try to crack the American market. Wigan Warriors' Super League fixture against Warrington Wolves, itself a hotly-anticipated game between two titans of the code, will open up a bumper weekend at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium. It is the first regular Super League fixture to take place in the United States and will be followed in the schedule by England's Women taking on Australia's Women in a huge night for the sport. But why is rugby league investing so much time and capital into a set of games that will take place thousands of miles from its heartlands? BBC Sport has taken a look at what is on the line-up and what is to be gained from putting the sport in front of a potentially lucrative audience. Just over 40,000 fans attended last year's rugby league Las Vegas event at Allegiant Stadium Saturday's festival of rugby league in Las Vegas is the continuation of an event Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) organised in 2024. Simply titled \"Rugby League Las Vegas\", Manly Warringah Sea Eagles beat South Sydney Rabbitohs and Sydney Roosters defeated Brisbane Broncos in the first event. Just over 40,000 spectators were in attendance at Allegiant Stadium, home of NFL side Las Vegas Raiders. That event triggered Wigan CEO Kris Radlinski to send a speculative email off to the NRL's organisers to see if his side could take part in 2025. An expanded event in 2025 means the usual season-opening World Club Challenge fixture between the reigning Super League champions and NRL Premiers will not take place. Wigan will open this year's proceedings against Warrington in a repeat of last season's Challenge Cup final, which was won by the Cherry and Whites. It is one of four games taking place: Wigan Warriors v Warrington Wolves (kick-off 21:30 GMT - live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 21:15 GMT) Canberra Raiders v New Zealand Warriors (kick-off 00:00 GMT) Australian Jillaroos v England Lionesses (kick-off 02:15 - live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 0200) Penrith Panthers v Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks (kick-off 04:30 GMT) The Wigan legends now making their mark as coaches Burgess to join Wire in Vegas after visa granted At attendance of 40,746 at last year's event was heralded as a success and saw almost two thirds of Allegiant Stadium filled, with a usual capacity of 65,000. It is unclear how much of a dent it made, however that has not stopped the sport - and other sports - from trying to broaden their horizons away from their traditional markets. Almost nine years ago, rugby union's Premiership held a game in New Jersey as Saracens beat London Irish in the first match to be held overseas. That fixture, played out with \"plenty of empty seats\" at the 25,000-capacity Red Bull Arena, was followed by just 6,000 attending Newcastle Falcons' game against Saracens in Philadelphia in 2017. Meanwhile in rugby league, Catalans Dragons faced off against Wigan in front of 31,555 at Barcelona's Nou Camp in 2019 as the Perpignan-based club tried to capitalise on the success of winning the Challenge Cup the previous year. On the face of it, it is an unusual move to try to break into the United States market when the predominantly working class sport of rugby league has tried - and arguably failed - to expand much in the UK outside of the M62 corridor. Rugby league will have a tough task to mimic that achievement, but if the move pays off, it could translate into increased brand recognition for the sport and its clubs in a lucrative part of the world. The sport had planned to hold the Rugby League World Cup in the United States during the 2020s, but that move fell through. In contrast, Formula 1 spent decades trying to gain a US audience and currently holds three races a season there - including Las Vegas - and recently opened a multi-million dollar purpose-built pit lane facility near to the Vegas strip, external which will open year-round. F1 benefited from a pre-established global fanbase, eye watering levels of financial backing and American ownership of the commercial arm of the sport. Even with the recent surge in US interest, however, Formula 1 still pales in comparison to the popularity of American football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey. Whether rugby league can raise long-term interest with this year's expanded event in Las Vegas remains to be seen - but an expanded event in 2025 shows the sport is taking the task seriously. A cash-filled briefcase, a missing shield and the beating of Australia Woman of Steel, marriage, Vegas - Dagger's packed 12 months While in Las Vegas, all teams involved have used the UFC's Performance Institute as a training hub. \"The UFC is a huge brand in Las Vegas and this is home for us,\" senior vice president of performance at the UFC Dr Duncan French told the BBC. \"When these teams were looking for training spaces and how to prepare for gameweek - whether that's recovery, strength and conditioning sessions, film study, catering - we can do that all under one roof so it was a no brainer for lots of these teams.\" In addition to three domestic fixtures between the NRL and Super League taking place, England's Lionesses will face Australia's Jillaroos for the first time since the 2017 World Cup. The fixture is primed to help women's rugby league develop, however England will be hoping to do better than the 38-0 thrashing they were handed the last time they met Australia. Part of the charm of using the UFC facility is sharing knowledge across sports, something French says has been particularly useful. \"It's always great to get other sporting codes to be around our athletes so they can see how others prepare,\" he added. \"There's a lot of synergy between rugby league and fighting, particularly with the demand on the body and there's a huge psychology component going into tackling or wrestling takedowns. \"The guys and girls have been sharing ideas and how they train. The brand of the UFC is strong in rugby and the teams coming in are all fans of the UFC so it's been a great week for everybody.\" Saturday's fixture presents a unique problem to both Wigan and Warrington. The game takes place eight days after Wigan's win against Hull FC and the Wire's win against Catalans. Meanwhile, Wigan will then face Huddersfield on 9 March and Warrington take on Wakefield on the same day. A 10,000-mile round trip for one fixture in a crowded schedule is not ideal, Wigan assistant coach Sean O'Loughlin admitted. \"Sports science is almost taking a back seat to what this can do for the game,\" he told BBC Sport. \"We'll try to do all the things by the book and what the sports scientists said but we know prep-wise it's not perfect or ideal. \"It'd be better if we were playing it at home but if you ask any of the lads what they wanted to do, they'll all be putting their hands up saying they'd love to play in Vegas.\" This sentiment is something echoed by fellow assistant coach Tommy Leuluai. \"It is gonna be hard, but it's the same for both teams.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Warren Buffett has spent the past 60 years transforming Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile mill into a $1 trillion company that's more valuable than Tesla, Walmart, or JPMorgan. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire in 1965 and has steadily acquired scores of businesses including Geico and See's Candies, and built multibillion-dollar stakes in public companies including Apple and Coca-Cola. But at 94 years of age, the business titan knows the end of the Buffett era is near at hand \u2014 and he's carefully paved the way for his departure. Buffett has warned his shareholders the clock is ticking on his time in charge. He's talked up Greg Abel and set the stage for his planned successor. He's also sought to protect his legacy and ensure his vast fortune isn't squandered once he's gone. \"Succession planning is the most important thing in corporate governance for a company led by an iconic CEO,\" Lawrence Cunningham, the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center on Corporate Governance and the author of several books about Buffett and Berkshire, told Business Insider. Buffett's conglomerate is \"providing an exemplary and under-appreciated model for how this can be done well,\" Cunningham continued, adding that it has \"prepared the way not only for Greg to succeed Warren as CEO\" but also prepared stockholders for their company to no longer have a controlling shareholder. \"At 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters,\" Buffett said in his recent missive to Berkshire shareholders, making it explicit he'll hand over the reins soon. The billionaire bargain hunter has repeatedly reassured stockholders that Abel is a worthy successor. In his new letter, he wrote that in those rare moments when opportunities are everywhere, Abel has \"vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie,\" referring to his late business partner, Charlie Munger. Buffett joked during last year's annual meeting that shareholders \"don't have too long to wait\" for a change in management. \"I feel fine, but I know a little about actuarial tables,\" he quipped. The investor mentioned in his latest letter that he requires a cane to walk, perhaps because he's \"considering the possibility of stepping down as CEO in the near future,\" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who's been closely following Buffett's company for four decades, told BI. He added that the nonagenarian might announce the decision as soon as Berkshire's annual meeting in May. Buffett appears to be clearing the decks before the next captain takes over the ship. Berkshire's $334 billion cash mountain may reflect a \"desire to hand a relatively clean slate to Greg\" and enable him to \"more easily perform the main function of a CEO, which is allocating capital,\" Kass told BI. More specifically, he and his investment managers have sold several small but long-held investments including General Motors and Procter & Gamble in recent years. They've also cashed in $158 billion worth of stocks on a net basis in just the past two years, which has helped to boost Berkshire's cash pile to record levels. Their efforts could leave plenty of dry powder for Abel to spend on stocks or finally bag the elephant-sized acquisition that has evaded Buffett for years. Buffett and his deputies might be pulling back on purchases, ramping up sales, and halting buybacks because stock valuations have grown too expensive. But they might also see value in leaving a treasure chest for Abel to draw from and deploy as he wishes. Buffett disclosed last year that when he dies, his roughly 14% stake in Berkshire \u2014 worth more than $150 billion \u2014 will pass into a trust that counts his three children as trustees, and they'll have to vote unanimously on how it's spent. The plan not only protects the money from the taxman and earmarks it for worthy causes, it also aims to thwart activist investors who might otherwise seek to buy up Buffett's shares once he's gone and clamor for his conglomerate to be dismantled. \"I regard Berkshire Hathaway sort of like a painter regards a painting, the difference being the canvas is unlimited,\" Buffett said in 2016, underlining his vision that the company will persist for generations. In fact, Buffett's efforts to prepare his shareholders for the inevitable, voice his confidence in Abel and set him up for success, and protect his personal stake in the business, all speak to his devotion to ensuring Berkshire thrives long after he's gone.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Unemployed Tired or stressed businessman sitting on the walkway after work Stressed businessman ... [+] concept It didn\u2019t have to be this way. But here we go. In January the American job market just finished up its four-year stint as the strongest in American history, by a long shot. Seventeen million jobs created is the most for any single-term presidency and has been topped by only one two-term president, Bill Clinton. Clinton\u2019s two terms saw a growth of 23 million jobs; Biden\u2019s rate of job creation was 40% better. A yeoman\u2019s task. The unemployment rate was historically low (at or near 4.0%) for the longest sustained time, and job growth was spread among every sector. Open jobs remained high, voluntary quits (a sign of workplace confidence) were also high. All the while, wages continued to rise. The reason for this is simple. President Biden had a deep commitment to the middle class and to its workers, and did everything he could to back up that position. It seems that has changed \u2013 in a hurry. President Trump and his chief executioner have moved huge numbers from the commuting lanes to the unemployment ranks, wielding what they see as their terrible swift sword, starting with government jobs. We don\u2019t yet know how many, as the courts have already weighed in on the issue to reverse the actions. Suffice to say, though, it will wind up being a massacre. And then there will be the ancillary effects on all parts of the workforce that depend on all those govern contracts and services. Now, not only are the job market numbers going to show measurable decline \u2013 yes, I\u2019m going out on a limb \u2013 the softer factors like consumer confidence are also in for a hit. That plays an insidious role in the job market.Those are the easy things to foretell; anyone with the slightest familiarity of the job market can get that far. What bothers me are the many dots farther away from the center that are harder to connect. What effect will Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the World Health Organization have on the scientific community and employment within it? That ripple effect goes far: the government, research institutions, skilled manufacturing, investments, and so on. Beyond that, employers both large and small were all talking loudly and hiring energetically with confidence. Have you noticed the sudden quiet and stillness? Further, what about the Infrastructure Bill, which promises to create tens of thousands of jobs, or at least it did up until last month; the CHIPS and Science Act, and the broad-based commitment to climate protection, which everyone agreed would add jobs all over the place? And by the way, how much is a dozen eggs today? Worse, when did you ever see eggs sold individually? This is reminiscent of the Great Depression. And if you never thought that international relations affected your job or company, keep your eyes and ears open. The U.S. just cast a horrible vote in the U.N., we are alienating all our key trading partners (Mexico, Canada, the E.U.), and are walking away from our long-held position of foreign aid, handing that right over to China. Most intangible of all \u2013 but certainly not the least toxic \u2013 are the divisions within us: political, social, cultural, geographical. Those are differences that should be accepted and worked with; instead, they are exploited. I\u2019ve been a job market observer long enough (28 years) to know that this spells trouble. It always does. And after the four best years our job market ever had, it took only a month. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. But here we go.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      See how fast your money can grow in today's top CDs.    A certificate of deposit can be a great place to stash cash you won't need to touch for a while. Unlike savings account rates, which can change at any time, CDs offer a fixed rate that's locked in when you open the account. So you'll continue to earn the same amount of interest even if rates go down after that. Today's best CDs boast annual percentage yields as high as 4.65% -- more than three times the national average for some terms. To give you an idea of how much interest this can net you, here's what your earnings would be if you put $10,000 into a top CD today. (And if you don't have that much to deposit, don't worry. We'll look at some other amounts, too.) Here's how much you can earn if you deposit $10,000 into a six-month, one-year, three-year and five-year CD. We're calculating your return based on the highest APYs currently available for each CD term, based on the banks we track at CNET.\u00a0 APYs as of Feb. 27, 2025, based on the banks we track at CNET. Earnings are based on APYs and assume interest is compounded annually. The national average for a one-year CD is 1.80% APY, while the average one-year CD based on the banks we track at CNET is 4.09% APY. If you deposit $10,000 into a one-year CD that pays the national average of 1.80% APY, the value at maturity would be $10,180.00. If you deposit $10,000 into a one-year CD that earns 4.45% APY (the top APY from our list), it would be worth $10,445.00 at maturity. You don't need to have $10,000 on hand to earn a competitive interest rate on your savings. Most of the CD accounts on our list don't have a minimum deposit required to lock in a high CD rate. Here's what you could earn with other deposit amounts: APYs as of Feb. 27, 2025, based on the top APY available from the banks we track at CNET. Earnings assume interest is compounded annually. When you open a CD, the APY represents the actual rate of return you'll earn on your deposit in one year. The APY reflects\u00a0compounding interest, which means you aren't just earning interest on your initial deposit -- your interest also earns interest.\u00a0 Some banks compound interest daily, while others compound interest monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. The more often interest is compounded, the more money you'll earn.\u00a0 You can use a compound interest calculator to figure out how much your money can grow in a CD. We recommend using this calculator from the\u00a0US Securities and Exchange Commission. One of the biggest trade-offs for most CDs is early withdrawal penalties. If you need to pull out your money early, most CDs charge you an early withdrawal penalty equal to a certain period's worth of interest. These penalties can eat into your interest earnings. If you'll need to access your money sooner, a high-yield savings account may be a better fit.\u00a0 CDs are a great option if you already have money saved that you don't won't need to touch for a set period. Most of us don't have a few thousand on hand that we can part with for a few years in exchange for a fixed interest rate. And that's OK. A\u00a0high-yield savings account\u00a0or\u00a0money market account\u00a0that earns a competitive APY is your best bet if you're still\u00a0growing your emergency fund, working on your savings goals or want to withdraw your money as you need it. These accounts let you build your savings as you can, while still having access to your money if you need it. Contributing as little as $100 a month can help you work up to $1,200 in savings each year. If you can contribute more, say $250 a month, you could build an emergency fund of $3,000 in a year. And that's not counting the interest you'll earn on top of your savings. Although savings accounts have variable interest rates -- meaning they can rise and fall based on the economy and your bank's discretion -- experts expect savings rates will remain high all year. Right now, you can earn up to 5% APY with some\u00a0online high-yield savings accounts. Growing a savings account takes time. Focus on what you can contribute and get into the habit of saving so it becomes a routine. You can also use\u00a0automated savings tools, like round-ups and automatic transfers, to grow your savings a little faster without taking up your time. CNET Money editors are big fans of\u00a0Ally Bank's automated savings features, but many online banks also offer helpful savings features.","label":0}

Apple's long-rumored iPhone Fold has yet to arrive, but the rumor mill still believes it is on the way. Here's all the latest rumors on release year, the screen, and other features. The iPhone 16e has already been subjected to its first teardown, highlighting Apple's custom C1 modem, a bigger battery, and lack of MagSafe. Skype will be closed down in May 2025, but it really died in 2011 when it was bought by Microsoft. It's just been a death by a thousand slow-motion cuts. ","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"President Trump has chimed in on the UK\u2019s attempt to force Apple to add a global backdoor to iCloud, likening the demand to \u201csomething that you hear about with China.\u201d  Trump met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at The White House yesterday for a wide-ranging conversation on world politics, tariffs, free speech, and more. It marked Starmer\u2019s first visit to Washington, D.C., since Trump took office last month.  In an interview with British news outlet The Spectator yesterday, Trump was asked about the UK\u2019s anti-encryption legislation. Trump said that he told Starmer that the UK \u201ccan\u2019t do this.\u201d  \u201cWe told them you can\u2019t do this. We actually told him [Starmer]\u2026 that\u2019s incredible. That\u2019s something, you know, that you hear about with China.\u201d  Trump\u2019s comments came after his Director of National Security, Tulsi Gabbard, suggested that the UK may have broken a bilateral agreement when secretly demanding Apple to build a global backdoor into iCloud. Gabbard said she has \u201cgrave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a \u2018backdoor\u2019 that would allow access to Americans personal encrypted data.\u201d  In response to the UK\u2019s request, Apple pulled Advanced Data Protection from the UK market. In a statement, the company said, \u201cwe have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\u201d Other categories of iCloud data, such as passwords, health data, and Messages in iCloud, remain encrypted in the UK.  An interesting aside: Advanced Data Protection is available in China, so users in China actually have access to an encryption feature that users in the UK do not have.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Washington, D.C., today for his first meeting with President Trump since the inauguration. The two leaders are expected to sign a preliminary deal to give the U.S. access to some of Ukraine's critical raw materials. However, it's unclear whether the deal will offer Ukraine the future security guarantees it says it needs to protect itself from Russia.                  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to journalists during press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, Wednesday.                                                           Evgeniy Maloletka\/AP                                       hide caption  Andrew and Tristan Tate, brothers facing charges in Romania for sexual abuse and human trafficking, arrived in Florida yesterday. They traveled by private jet after Romanian authorities lifted their travel restrictions. Andrew describes himself as a \"misogynist\" and has millions of followers on social media. Both brothers are vocal supporters of Trump, raising questions about whether the Trump administration may have influenced the relaxation of their travel restrictions.  Trump has spent his first five weeks in office trying to expand executive power. His attempt to slash the federal workforce has drawn several lawsuits. Two cases have just arrived at the Supreme Court, involving some $2 billion in unpaid bills, which could offer some early clues on how Trump's methods will fare. The NPR Politics team is recapping everything you need to know about the Trump administration's first 100 days each Friday morning. From Trump's meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron to the announcement that tariffs against Canada and Mexico will take effect on March 4, here is a day-by-day recap of everything that has happened in the past week.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez                                                           NPR                                       hide caption  This essay was written by Steve Inskeep, Morning Edition and Up First host The first time I spoke with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was in 2018, the morning after she stunned the political world. The 28-year-old defeated a senior Democrat in a primary election for Congress. She instantly became one of the leading characters during the first Trump administration: a progressive insurgent, a Democratic socialist, a frequent critic of her own party and a social media sensation. She was a member of \"The Squad\" of young progressives who challenged Trump and attracted his scorn. And, she was also a leading character on Fox News, a figure conservatives loved to hate. Today, Ocasio-Cortez is a bit more seasoned and mainstream, having built relationships inside Congress. When we met for our latest interview, she talked of an effort to pass a bipartisan bill with Josh Hawley, a Trump-supporting senator from Missouri. She remains convinced that government works well for the wealthy and not so well for everyone else. In saying that the government doesn't work for the working class, she resembles President Trump \u2014 though her response is different. She thinks Republicans are making \"large errors\" as they hack away at government employees and services. \"I mean to the FAA? No. To the NIH? No,\" she said. \"I actually don't want someone taking a wrecking ball to someone's chemotherapy to just see what happens.\" Check out what NPR is watching, reading and listening to this weekend: \ud83c\udf7f Movies: Several movies are coming to theaters this spring.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"XRP and dogecoin (DOGE) plunged over 10% to lead losses among crypto major as confirmation of fresh U.S. tariffs on China hit Asian markets on Friday, adding to an already tumultuous week for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 7% to near $79,000 for the first time since November, down nearly 30% since its January peak of above $108,000. Ether (ETH), Cardano\u2019s ADA and BNB Chain\u2019s BNB showed similar woes with a slide of at least 9%. Overall market capitalization fell 8% to $2.7 trillion, reversing all advances since U.S. President Donald Trump was elected in early November. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) dropped nearly 9%. A solid earnings from Nvidia on Wednesday was not enough to offset the onsetting market gloom as global equities faltered on a combination of renewed tariff concerns, a slowing economy and overstretched positioning, which has naturally spilled over to crypto given BTC's high correlation with the S&P 500 index, traders say. \u201cOn a YTD basis, ex-BTC tokens and trading sentiment have struggled mightily with liquidity being depleted from the numerous memecoin runs, and BTC also buckled from the weight of ETF selling, which hit a record high last week,\u201d Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Friday\u2019s losses in crypto markets mirrored those of Chinese stocks, which slumped after Trump announced a new 10% tariff on Chinese imports. This added to worries about a growing trade war between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies. The new tariff adds to an existing 10% tax on Chinese goods that started earlier this month. This could hurt China\u2019s economy, which faces a property crisis and falling prices. It might also stop a stock market rise fueled by China\u2019s AI advances \u2014 led by ChatGPT rival DeepSeek. The move comes ahead of China\u2019s big annual meeting, the National People\u2019s Congress, starting next week, where leaders are expected to share economic plans and growth goals. A decision of China to spend more or encourage buying to boost the economy could impact bitcoin and crypto prices and serve as a market catalyst \u2014 making it a key data point to watch for next week. However, the mood remains bearish among some bitcoin traders until then. \u201cBullish option speculators are throwing in the towel as well, with volatility coming lower against a lower spot price as calls are being dumped in favour of puts,\u201d SignalPlus\u2019 Fan said. \u201cFinally, concerns over MSTR (-10%) are adding an extra element of risk to BTC, given their convertible funded buying, putting bearish sentiment at a near-term extreme on many technical indicators.\u201d   Shaurya is the Co-Leader of the CoinDesk tokens and data team in Asia with a focus on crypto derivatives, DeFi, market microstructure, and protocol analysis.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"The year 2025 could very well mark the arrival of super slim phones. Samsung has already given us a glimpse of the Galaxy S25 Edge, and could launch it as soon as April. Apple, on the other hand, is heavily anticipated to launch an iPhone 17 Air model later this year. It seems a relatively unknown brand will beat them to the game. Tecno has today announced the Spark Slim, a phone with a thickness of just 5.75mm. Interestingly, it seems this phone isn\u2019t a one-trick pony, because the internal hardware is also fairly powerful and puts it firmly in the upper mid-range category. Now, before we get into the details, here\u2019s the disclaimer. Tecno says the Spark Slim is a concept device. That means it\u2019s merely an innovation showcase for now, and there is a 50-50 chance that it will never make it to the market as a commercially available product. Tecno says the Spark Slim will feature a dual camera setup at the back that relies on two 50-megapixel sensors. Over at the front is a 13-megapixel snapper for selfie and video-calling duties, slotted neatly in a punch-hole cutout on a 6.78-inch curved OLED screen. The display panel sounds quite impressive, as it offers a 1.5K resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, one of the best that the industry has to offer. Tecno is also touting a peak brightness figure of 4,500 nits for the screen, roughly double compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Powering the phone is an undisclosed octa-core processor. Unfortunately, the company has not shared any details about the RAM or storage figures, either. What\u2019s truly surprising, though, is the battery capacity. Tecno says the Spark Slim will come equipped with a 5,200 mAh battery, which is nothing short of astonishing. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is 8.6mm thick, but offers a smaller 5,000 mah battery. The charging stack is no slouch either. Tecno is claiming a peak wired charging output of 45W, which is far ahead of what Apple has to offer, and matches the latest and greatest phones from Samsung. Tecno will share more details about the phone at MWC, which kicks off next week. Digital Trends will be on the show floor, and we are expecting some hands-on time with the device, assuming Tecno has some working prototypes to show off. Stay tuned for that. When Apple launched the new iPhone 16e on Wednesday, the Apple Store in every region displayed one thing under connectivity: eSIM. There was no mention of a physical SIM, and I had a waking nightmare that Apple had quietly pulled the plug, and every iPhone 16e globally would be sold as an eSIM-only model. A quick search \u2014 and a look at the photos \u2014 confirmed that this hadn\u2019t happened, but my reaction kickstarted a thought about eSIMs, their promise (and what we were promised), and the current state of eSIMs globally. I\u2019ve been traveling for the past month, and eSIMs are an absolute mess. The potential was immense, but it goes against carriers\u2019 interests to make it any easier, but there is a solution. In a recent survey of iPhone owners, 48% of those now wielding Apple\u2019s smartphone had previously owned an Android phone. The data comes from an extensive report using information gathered from 4,000 individuals by analysts at Counterpoint Research, and shows despite the challenges those who switch from Android to iOS (or vice versa) often face, it didn\u2019t put almost half of current iPhone owners off. The research then states it\u2019s Samsung and Google suffering the most when someone decides it\u2019s time to buy an iPhone, to the point the paper warns Samsung may see a marked fall in S-series ownership over the next two years if the trend continues. It\u2019s added that Samsung, along with brands like OnePlus and China\u2019s market leader Vivo, are using AI and flagship specifications to differentiate devices, in an effort to entice and retain buyers. The iPhone 17 Air has been the subject of no small number of different rumors and leaks, and now the latest one suggests its screen might be up to 6.7 inches in size rather than the expected 6.6 inches. The information comes from tipster Jon Prosser on the Recycle Bin podcast. This is far from the first rumor we've heard about the screen size. Last year, Ross Young initially suggested a 6.55-inch display \u2014 that would be 6.6 rounded up \u2014 but estimates have ping-ponged since then. Few Apple devices have had as many conflicting rumors as the iPhone 17, so take this with more than a grain of salt.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"     Microsoft is hanging up on the service that helped make video calling mainstream and will focus on Teams.    The change, which will go into effect in May, marks the end of an era for the voice-over-IP calling service. Microsoft is shutting down Skype, the service that once helped put video calling on the map. The company announced on Friday it is retiring Skype in May as part of a broader effort to focus on Microsoft Teams, its conference call service, and to streamline its free consumer communications offerings. The company said customers will have access to many of the same core features found in Skype, such as one-on-one and group calls, messaging and file-sharing, via its free Teams option. The free tier also offers features such as hosting meetings, managing calendars and building and joining communities. \"This is obviously big news for us and our customers,\" Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 Collaborative Apps + Platforms, told CNET. \"Skype did pave the way for audio video calling on the web, and we learned a lot from [it] that we reflected in Teams in the last seven years.\" He added: \"We felt it was the right time to give our customers more simplicity and more innovation by really putting our focus behind Teams.\" Skype, first released in 2003, played a major role in video and voice-over-IP calling, particularly in an era when international calls were costly. From long-distance chats with friends and families to virtual classroom field trips and media companies like CNN using it to remotely bring on guests, Skype played a major role in making the technology a part of daily lives. But its role in the market evolved as consumers shifted to mobile minutes or other video-calling solutions, such as Microsoft Teams and FaceTime.\u00a0 Microsoft introduced Teams in 2017 as a hub for communication and collaboration with chats, calls and file-sharing. Its usage picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic, and so did the ways it was used. Notably, during NBA games, virtual fans \u2013 including Shaquille O'Neal and Barack Obama \u2013 were featured on displays via Teams technology.\u00a0 Adoption continues to rise. The company said Teams now has four times the meeting minutes of consumer calls compared to two years ago. Teper said the uptick in Teams usage over the past few years gave the company validation to make the change now. The company continues to add more features, such as emojis and filters. Skype retains a fan base, according to Microsoft \u2013 likely those who've been using the 22-year-old service since the beginning. The company declined to share specifics about its user base. Users will have the choice of exporting their data to retain their Skype call logs and chats or upgrading to Teams via the free offering. Users will still be able to log into their Skype account to see past calls and chats. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at market research firm Creative Strategies, said the move isn't surprising, given Microsoft's increasing focus on Teams. \"To be honest, I thought it might have happened sooner,\" she told CNET. \"From a consumer perspective, it feels like those still using Skype are doing so more out of habit than because it offers something particularly unique.\" Whether Skype represents the end of an era may dependon the age of the person you ask.\u00a0 \"It almost feels like the rotary phone of communications, something younger generations wouldn't know how to use,\" Milanesi said. \"It does mark the end of an era, though, in terms of how we communicate and the role that social media plays in messaging and calling.\" The move also aligns with Microsoft's history of phasing out older technologies, such as the Windows Phone. \"As with the sunsetting of any technology platform, there will be groups of people who are saddened by this move,\" said J. P. Gownder, an analyst at research firm Forrester. \"But Skype's heyday is in the past. This decision makes sense because the world Skype thrived in no longer exists.\"","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Key Points Current Context MicroStrategy, known for its significant Bitcoin investments, currently holds about 499,096 BTC, valued at around $42.42 billion at a Bitcoin price of $85,000 (as of February 2025). Its stock price, around $254, and market capitalization of about $65.78 billion suggest the market values MSTR beyond just its Bitcoin holdings, possibly due to its business operations and debt of approximately $4.2 billion. Potential Impact If Bitcoin hits $200,000, MSTR\u2019s Bitcoin holdings would be worth about $99.82 billion. Accounting for debt and the current premium over net Bitcoin value, research suggests MSTR\u2019s stock could rise to approximately $598, based on historical multiples. However, this could vary if MSTR issues more shares to buy additional Bitcoin, potentially diluting the stock price. Unexpected Detail An interesting factor is MSTR\u2019s \u201c21\/21 Plan,\u201d aiming to raise $42 billion over three years for more Bitcoin, which could increase both holdings and shares outstanding, affecting the stock price differently than simple valuation models suggest. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of MSTR Stock Potential with Bitcoin at $200,000 in 2025 This analysis explores the potential impact on MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) stock if Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $200,000 in 2025, considering current holdings, market dynamics, and future strategies. The company, rebranded as Strategy in early 2025, is a significant player in the Bitcoin space, holding substantial BTC as part of its treasury strategy. This note provides a comprehensive breakdown, including historical data, financial metrics, and projections, to offer a thorough understanding for investors and analysts. Background and Current Holdings As of late February 2025, MicroStrategy holds approximately 499,096 BTC, based on recent reports from financial tracking platforms like Bitcoin Treasuries. At a current Bitcoin price of around $85,000 (sourced from CoinMarketCap and Yahoo Finance), the value of these holdings is approximately $42.42 billion. This valuation is crucial, as MSTR\u2019s stock price, trading at about $254 with a market capitalization of $65.78 billion (from Yahoo Finance), indicates a premium over the net value of its Bitcoin holdings. The company\u2019s debt, estimated at $4.2 billion from recent financial reports (CompaniesMarketCap), affects net asset valuation. The net value from Bitcoin holdings, after accounting for debt, is $42.42 billion \u2013 $4.2 billion = $38.22 billion, yet the market cap exceeds this, suggesting additional value from business operations or market sentiment. Stock and Bitcoin Correlation Historical data shows a strong correlation between MSTR\u2019s stock price and Bitcoin\u2019s price, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 in recent analyses (CoinDesk and CCN.com). This relationship implies that as Bitcoin\u2019s price rises, MSTR\u2019s stock tends to follow, often with amplified gains due to leverage and market perception. For instance, in 2024, while Bitcoin rose by 120%, MSTR\u2019s stock increased by over 320%, highlighting this leverage effect (Crypto.news). Estimating Stock Price at Bitcoin $200,000 To estimate MSTR\u2019s stock price if Bitcoin reaches $200,000, we consider two primary methods: a multiple-based approach and a per-share valuation adjusted for premiums. Considerations for Future Changes MSTR\u2019s \u201c21\/21 Plan,\u201d announced in late 2024, aims to raise $42 billion over three years (2025-2027) for additional Bitcoin purchases (Forbes). If, in 2025, they raise $10 billion, they could buy approximately 117,647 BTC at $85,000 each ($10 billion \/ $85,000 \u2248 117,647). This would increase holdings to 616,743 BTC. To raise $10 billion, issuing shares at $254 would require about 39.37 million new shares ($10 billion \/ $254 \u2248 39.37 million), bringing total shares to 298.37 million. At $200,000 per BTC, the value of 616,743 BTC would be $123.35 billion. Assuming debt remains $4.2 billion, net value is $119.15 billion. If the additional value (currently $27.56 billion, calculated as $65.78 billion \u2013 $38.22 billion) stays constant, the market cap would be $119.15 billion + $27.56 billion = $146.71 billion, and the stock price would be $146.71 billion \/ 298.37 million \u2248 $491.67. This suggests potential dilution effects from share issuance. Financial Metrics and Business Operations MSTR\u2019s business operations, primarily in enterprise analytics software, generated $463.46 million in revenue in the last 12 months but reported losses of $1.17 billion, indicating negative earnings (StockAnalysis). This suggests the market\u2019s premium may be speculative, driven by Bitcoin holdings rather than operational performance. The debt-to-equity ratio, at 1.12 as of September 2024 (MacroTrends), indicates financial leverage, which could amplify gains but also risks in a Bitcoin downturn. Risks and Uncertainties The estimate of $598 assumes no significant changes in shares or debt before Bitcoin hits $200,000. However, MSTR\u2019s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy could lead to increased leverage and share dilution, potentially lowering the stock price. Market sentiment, regulatory changes, and Bitcoin volatility also play roles. For instance, if Bitcoin\u2019s rise to $200,000 is rapid, MSTR might not have time for significant additional purchases, supporting the $598 estimate. Conversely, prolonged increases could see more purchases, pushing the stock price toward $492, as calculated above. Comparative Analysis A table comparing key metrics at current and projected Bitcoin prices helps illustrate the potential: Note: The \u201cAdditional Value\u201d is derived from current market cap minus net Bitcoin value, assumed constant for simplicity, though this may vary with market conditions. Conclusion Given the strong correlation and historical multiples, if Bitcoin reaches $200,000 in 2025 without significant additional purchases, MSTR\u2019s stock could reach approximately $598, based on current valuations. However, considering potential share issuances and additional Bitcoin acquisitions under the \u201c21\/21 Plan,\u201d the stock price might range from $492 to $598, depending on the timing and scale of these actions. Investors should monitor MSTR\u2019s capital-raising activities and Bitcoin market trends for more precise forecasts. Key Citations Your future beckons you: YOUR UNIVERSE IS UNLIMITED >","label":1}

The leading crypto is 25% down from its all-time high that was reached just a month ago during Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. It recovered slightly on Friday morning, hovering around $82,000. However, investor sentiment remains pessimistic as the Trump-led crypto rally appears to be over. The prevailing question now is: How much lower can Bitcoin go? \u201cThe worst case scenario would be that Bitcoin would drop to the $72,000-74,000 range,\u201d said Sid Powell, CEO & Co-Founder of Maple, an institutional capital marketplace built on the blockchain. In an email to Quartz, Powell explained that, according to technical analysis, a breakdown below a prolonged range typically results in a significant decline. \u201cIf Bitcoin is in the $90,000-1000,000 range, as we\u2019ve seen over the last few months, it would have the potential to slide to $70,000.\u201d The latest decline may be linked to a crypto hack targeting a Dubai-based exchange named Bybit. On Feb. 21, 2025, attackers \u2014 allegedly the North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group \u2014 stole approximately $1.4 billion in crypto assets from the exchange\u2019s wallet. Adding to market jitters, the recent memecoin scandal involving Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei has reignited skepticism and negative sentiment among investors, further weighing on the crypto market. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors are at play, with Bitcoin and the entire crypto market facing pressure from the ongoing tariff war. Amid rising trade tensions, there was a broad risk-off decline across all markets, but, as Powell noted, the crypto market has been hit the hardest. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nervousness from investors on how U.S. tariffs could impact the broader landscape and the excitement over the new administration fading now that Trump has been in office for some time,\u201d he added. Once hailed as the most successful exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in history, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant withdrawals in recent weeks. Excluding two positive days, they have recorded net outflows totaling $3.7 billion this month. On Tuesday, Feb. 25th, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a record outflow of over $1 billion in a single day. This sustained outflow is naturally putting pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price, signaling that investors are no longer pouring in funds at the same pace as before. Read more: Bitcoin is better than gold. Here\u2019s why Powell believes that the Trump rally has certainly faded and that positive actions from policymakers could help improve the state of the crypto market. In recent weeks, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has emerged as a big supporter of the crypto industry \u2014 a shift that seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. For example, on Thursday, the SEC stated that most memecoins, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, are not securities under U.S. federal law. The financial watchdog explained that memecoins have limited or no functionality and are \u201cmore akin to collectibles.\u201d However, the SEC\u2019s latest stance did little to boost memecoin prices, as negative sentiment weighed on the broader crypto market. Earlier this month, the SEC, led by Hester Peirce, dropped cases against Coinbase, Robinhood, and other crypto companies that had been accused of selling unregistered securities, marking a notable shift in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. \u201cIf the SEC continues to loosen its grip and we see more pro-crypto laws put in place, Bitcoin can pull back, and we\u2019ll see another positive moment in the market once again,\u201d he added.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Cai Rang and other floating markets are in decline amid rapid economic development and improving infrastructure. Can Tho, Vietnam \u2013 As dawn breaks over Can Tho, the city\u2019s river is filled with the roaring engines of tour boats. In the distance, traditional wooden houseboats emerge through the dim light as the Cai Rang Floating Market comes into view. Cai Rang, and other markets like it, were once among the most recognisable cultural icons of southern Vietnam, with a history dating back to the early 20th Century. Before the development of roads and bridges, the myriad waterways of the delta region were the primary means of trade and transport, leading to the development of floating markets where channels converged. But over the last two decades, the markets have dwindled in size in tandem with Vietnam\u2019s rapid economic development \u2013 first gradually, then suddenly \u2013 and only two of the region\u2019s 10 major markets retain any significant presence. \u201cWhen I first visited [Cai Rang] market in 2011, it was much larger,\u201d Linh, a local guide, told Al Jazeera. \u201cNow it\u2019s about a third of that size,\u201d said Linh, who led daily tours to the market up until a few years ago. Today, Cai Rang comprises about 200 vessels, fewer than half as many as during its peak in the 1990s. Nearby Phong Dien market has shrunk to fewer than a dozen boats and has largely disappeared from tourist itineraries. Cai Be, a once-thriving market in neighbouring Ben Tre province, is among those that have vanished completely, closing for good in 2021. Historically the biggest of the delta\u2019s markets, Cai Rang still resembles a decent-sized assembly of boats \u2013 at least from afar. On closer inspection, the market looks more sparse. Nowadays, tour boats make up a significant portion of the traffic on the water. Still, the market functions much as it always has, as sampans are loaded up with produce from larger \u201cwholesalers\u201d, which is then brought back to markets on land. For many sellers, the boats double as homes. Daily life is on full display as the boat dwellers wash dishes with water from the river, cook meals over small stoves, or relax in hammocks \u2013 often with children and pet dogs in tow. Yet behind the photogenic charm, anxieties linger. \u201cBusiness is not good,\u201d Phuc, who works at the market selling pineapples to tourists, told Al Jazeera. Sometimes she sells just 10 pineapples a day at 20,000 Vietnamese dong ($0.78) each. \u201cOnly in the high season is it possible to make enough money. The rest of the time, we are barely surviving.\u201d Until two years ago, Phuc and her husband worked as wholesalers selling yams. Every week for the previous 25 years, they would travel to Long An province, near Ho Chi Minh City, to restock their boat \u2013 a process that took several days there and back. But as road infrastructure has improved in the last decade, land-based trade has become faster and more cost-effective, supplanting the need for river-based commerce. \u201cThe only people who continue to work here are those who can\u2019t afford to buy a van or a big car [to deliver produce],\u201d her husband, Thanh, told Al Jazeera. Tuyen, who works as a wholesaler selling onions, garlic and sweet potatoes, is also downbeat. \u201cTen years ago, I used to earn good money doing this, but now it\u2019s just enough to get by,\u201d she told Al Jazeera, while preparing a breakfast of fish soup on her boat. \u201cEverything is more difficult now.\u201d Tuyen said the COVID-19 pandemic was a turning point, after which many sellers, unable to make ends meet, switched to working on land. Asked why she did not join them, she pointed to the rental fees for a market spot \u2013 about five million Vietnamese dong ($195). On the boat, she has no rent to pay. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to stay on land \u2013 it\u2019s more comfortable and convenient \u2013 but I don\u2019t have the money,\u201d she said. While improved roads are often cited as the reason for the markets\u2019 decline, other factors have played a part. Many smaller markets have struggled to recover from temporary closures during the pandemic, as health and safety regulations prompted a shift to land-based markets. Poor planning has further exacerbated the situation. To address the annual flooding of the Mekong Delta, the authorities have in recent years constructed flood prevention walls along the banks of the Can Tho river, one of its many waterways. While these walls have helped reduce flooding and erosion, the absence of piers has made it harder for river-based trade to continue. Broader cultural shifts also cast a cloud over the future of the floating market. As Vietnam modernises, younger generations are turning their backs on their parents\u2019 trade, seeking better education and career opportunities. \u201cMy daughter doesn\u2019t want to work here,\u201d Phuc said. \u201cShe prefers to work on her own terms for a company and invest in stocks. She\u2019s not like us \u2013 she doesn\u2019t like this life.\u201d Though vendors may worry about the future, Cai Rang\u2019s survival appears to be of little consequence to the average resident of the nearby city of Can Tho. These days, most people shop in supermarkets and shopping malls and have little reason to visit Cai Rang. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s nothing special,\u201d a hotel receptionist, who has visited the market only once, told Al Jazeera, asking not to be named. Yet tourism contributes approximately 6 percent to the city\u2019s economy, with Cai Rang Floating Market the main draw. In 2017, the city welcomed 7.5 million tourists, according to official figures. While arrivals hit 5.9 million in 2023 after dropping off to practically nothing during the pandemic, the numbers remain significantly below their peak. Much of this is due to the consequences of the pandemic and a reduced number of flights from other parts of Vietnam, according to Son Ca Huynh, who runs a tour company in Can Tho. If the floating market should close, efforts to revive tourism are likely to become harder still. Huynh, who is branching out into cooking classes and off-the-beaten-track canal boat tours, said efforts to preserve the market could focus on its appeal to tourists, citing the floating markets of Bangkok as an example, rather than its commercial function. \u201cAt the Bangkok markets, they sell many different things,\u201d Huynh told Al Jazeera. \u201cHere, we sell mostly fruit and vegetables.\u201d But to do so, she said, the government would need to do more to encourage traders to stay, including constructing new piers for offloading goods and helping them raise their earnings \u2013 which she believes is unlikely given the cost involved. In any case, Huynh said, the market would lose its authenticity and its cultural value. \u201cIn my mind, it would not be the same,\u201d she said. By 8am, the day\u2019s trade has ended at Cai Rang. The sun has risen high above the palm-lined riverbanks, and vendors are relaxing on their houseboats. But Linh, the tour guide, doubts the serenity will last and expects Cai Rang to close within a few years. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to look for a new job,\u201d she said.

Published on20 hours ago The record-low price of the Apple AirTag 4-Pack was stuck at $69.99 for a while. Things are changing, though. Just recently, we saw it drop to $67.99, and today, it dropped to a new all-time low of $64.49! That\u2019s a $34.51 discount on the full $99 retail price. Get the Apple AirTag 4-Pack for just $64.49 ($34.51 off) This offer is available from Amazon. We\u2019re not sure how long the deal will last, but Best Buy has the same offer as a \u201cDeal of the Day\u201d sale, so there is a chance this discount will also be gone on Amazon tomorrow. At just $64.49, this is the best deal we\u2019ve seen on the Apple AirTag 4-Pack so far. If you were thinking of stocking up on these, now is the time to do it. And if you\u2019re an Apple user, it\u2019s totally worth the investment. We always focus more on fancy tech like smartphones, tablets, and such. While those are really cool, sometimes it is the accessories that make the real difference. In the case of Apple AirTags, these little trackers can save you from very stressful situations. You can attach an Apple AirTag to your valuables, such as your purse, a wallet, your keys, etc. Then, you can use the Apple Find My app to track them. These have saved me from major headaches way too many times, honestly. Again, we only recommend these to Apple users. For starters, it requires the Find My app, which is only available for Apple products. You can\u2019t even set them up without an Apple device. Android users can interact with them, but only through the Tracker Detect app, which is really only meant to find AirTags that may be spying on you. Those invested in the Apple ecosystem will love AirTags, though. You\u2019ll easily find any valuables on a map. Once you are closer to them, you can also use UWB to pinpoint the exact location, or you can make the tracker beep to find it in between the couch cushions. Not only that, but your iPhone can notify you if you move away from one of these. What has differentiated Apple AirTags from other trackers is that they are located using the Apple network. Essentially, any iPhone or iPad that gets close to an AirTag will report its location. Just think of how many people own iPhones! I do wish these were rechargeable, but replacing the battery is not much of an issue, since battery life is estimated at around an entire year. You\u2019ll also get a notification when an AirTag is running out of juice. And when it finally dies, CR2032 batteries are cheap and readily available at pretty much any general store. Thankfully, you won\u2019t have to use your Apple AirTags very often, but they will be lifesavers when you need them. They are worth every penny, especially when they are on sale for fewer pennies. Go get yours while you can! If you really want other options, or are an Android user, check out our list of the best Apple AirTag alternatives. We have plenty of great options in there. By the way, if you\u2019re in need of batteries for your AirTags, here is an awesome deal on a pack of 10 Energizer ones. This would usually cost $24.98, but you can currently get them this pack for just $9.99. You can just stock up on them for future use. I mean, if you get this Apple AirTag 4-Pack, those come with a battery already. These extra 10 units could keep all four AirTags running for over two more years. And don\u2019t worry about storing them for too long \u2014 Energizer mentions that they can hold their charge for 12 years in storage!","label":0}

However, at its flagship NYC partner event on Thursday, executives there outlined their priorities for the year ahead.\u00a0 Joined on stage by the likes of The New York Times, NBC Universal, Paramount, and Warner Bros.Discovery (among others), the narrative heralded \u201cthe rise of the premium internet,\u201d indicating its priorities on Madison Avenue for the year ahead. In opening remarks, its commercial chief Tim Sims outlined The Trade Desk\u2019s outlook on a new industry paradigm, one that\u2019s free from Google\u2019s influence. This paradigm includes the importance of authenticated audiences and a more efficient supply chain. \u00a0 \u201cToo often, the paradigm in our business has been, \u2018If I win, you lose,\u2019\u201d he said, referencing Google\u2019s strong-arm tactics laid bare in the antitrust trial which took place in September 2024. \u201cI\u2019d argue that the same mindset still exists from other players in the programmatic supply chain, this notion of high-extraction, but low value-add\u2026 the evolution of programmatic media has been the definition of that win-win.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cData-driven decision-making is adding value in the case of buyers, and increased yield is, of course, adding value in the case of the publishers, and nowhere is that playing out more so than in the world of the premium open internet.\u201d To set some context, it\u2019s worth remembering how the publicly listed demand-side platform issued its first-ever quarterly earnings miss earlier this month, despite Q4 revenues rising 23% year-on-year to hit $741 million, with CEO Jeff Green outlining a 15-point plan to regain momentum in 2025.\u00a0 However, the scale of the challenges in the year ahead was made evident the day prior (Feb. 26), when law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd issued a note seeking a lead plaintiff for a class action lawsuit, \u201cUnited Union of Roofers, Waterproofers & Allied Workers Local Union No. 8\u00a0WBPA Fund\u00a0v.\u00a0The Trade Desk.\u201d \u00a0 Part of the \u201cmissteps\u201d that caused the Q4 miss was the slower-than-expected uptake of its Kokai trading platform, a platform with forecasting tools that help with campaign execution, that it first unveiled in 2023 (see Related Insight), with this sluggishness cited by the law firm.\u00a0 \u201cThe Trade Desk\u2019s inability to effectively execute the Kokai rollout negatively impacted\u2026 revenue growth,\u201d reads the law firm\u2019s allegations, adding, \u201cdefendants throughout the Class Period made false and\/or misleading statements.\u201d\u00a0 A central part of Green\u2019s 15-point plan was \u201cpreparing for a world when Google exits the open internet,\u201d referring to the ongoing antitrust trial in which\u00a0Google faces a potential forced sale of its sell-side ad tech operations.\u00a0 Such an outlook was represented at the event, dubbed FWD 25, with The Walt Disney Company\u2019s svp of addressable sales, Jamie Power, on hand to discuss how their partnership with The Trade Desk, first unveiled a year ago, as the House of Mouse seeks to automate most of its ad spend.\u00a0 During a panel session, Power explained how programmatic ad spend is also powering the company\u2019s upfront deal with household names. \u201cWhat\u2019s more interesting [about spending patterns on Disney] is when you look at the biddable channel, 70% of biddable spend is apart from commitments,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not scatter, It\u2019s clients choosing to interact within a bidding environment.\u201d \u00a0 Conference sessions also attempted to address the questions of The Trade Desk\u2019s clients (both brands and holding companies), with McDonald\u2019s head of global media joining them on stage and agency execs packing the halls of The Times Center, NYC.\u00a0 \u00a0 Also speaking on stage was Anne Enright, McDonald\u2019s head of global media, when quizzed on her priorities in the year ahead, she noted that even as its programmatic spending rises exponentially \u2014\u00a0fellow panelist Julie Power revealed that its programmatic spend with Disney more than tripled in the last two years \u2014 brand safety was still a concern. \u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t take your eye off that, and it\u2019s so dynamic,\u201d she added, citing the company will likewise \u201cfundamentally change how we do media.\u201d \u00a0 Also taking to the stage was (arguably) The Trade Desk\u2019s newest high-profile arrival, Mike O\u2019Sullivan, GM of product, who joined via way of the company\u2019s acquisition of Sincera, a development that bucked the DSP\u2019s reputation for preferring to build rather than buy.\u00a0 \u00a0 Some have interpreted this move as The Trade Desk\u2019s effort to future-proof itself from the rise of sell-side ad curation \u2014\u00a0one of the industry buzz terms of 2024 \u2014\u00a0despite the company\u2019s vp of inventory development earlier telling Digiday, \u201cWe don\u2019t think a lot about curation.\u201d\u00a0 Addressing FWD 25 attendees on \u201cwhy you should care about the supply chain,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan explained how the company didn\u2019t think all parts of the industry supply chain are bad,\u00a0although, he did present a slide indicating that more than 169 supply-side platforms have 2,000-plus bid adapters deployed.  O\u2019Sullivan emphasized his opinion on how it\u2019s critical to minimize the negative impact of companies that take out a disproportionate amount of value. \u201cIf we clean up the supply chain, buyers will pay less for their campaigns, publishers will make more money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a win-win.\u201d    \u00a0 Lower CPMs are drawing SMB brands, from mattresses to legal and autos, into streaming ad inventory.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"The straightforward Switch successor doesn\u2019t spell the end of Weird Nintendo by  Michael McWhertor This story was first published in Switchboard, a newsletter from Polygon that delivers all the latest Switch 2 news, reporting, and rumors directly to your inbox. Sign up here to get it weekly. In the lead-up to Nintendo\u2019s reveal of the Switch 2 in January, some game writers fretted that the company behind the Game Boy, Wii, and Nintendo DS might be playing it too safe with its next-gen console. All indicators pointed to a more powerful Switch that was, well, just a more powerful Switch. At Polygon, reporter Ana Diaz wrote ahead of Switch 2\u2019s reveal of her one desire from Nintendo\u2019s next-gen plans: \u201cI hope that at least one thing about the Switch 2 is weird.\u201d Whether a \u201cwonky gimmick to the hardware\u201d or at the very least \u201can adorable jingle,\u201d Diaz pleaded, \u201cI just want to believe that Nintendo can still make something that is at least a little bit goofy.\u201d In a similar piece for Kotaku, John Walker praised Nintendo\u2019s \u201cbizarre innovation\u201d and its track record of being \u201cutterly impossible to guess what the company might create next, given the complete surprises of, say, a two-screen clamshell touch-screen portable gaming device, or a gesture-led under-TV console that shines best when the whole family is prancing around together.\u201d The Verge\u2019s Andrew Webster went so far as to call the Switch 2 \u201cboring.\u201d (He framed that as a positive.) While the original Switch was a demonstration of Nintendo\u2019s ability to surprise and swerve, the hybrid console was also lacking in some of the personality that made the 3DS, Wii, and even the Wii U appealing. There were no cute Miis, and no earworms to shop to. But the Switch was weird too, and its successor has ample room in which to get a little funky.  The Nintendo Switch came on the tail of Nintendo doubling down on creativity. During Wii and DS\/3DS era, there were dozens of wild experiments that took advantage of motion control and touchscreens, resulting in inventive oddities like Let\u2019s Tap, a game built around never directly touching a Wii Remote; Elite Beat Agents, a musical cheerleading rhythm game; and WarioWare: DIY, a microgame-making toolkit.  Ahead of the Switch launch, some critics of Nintendo unifying its console and handheld gaming business into a machine that could accomplish both at the same time would put its game designers into a tighter box. But the original Switch fostered wild swings, too, mostly notably in 2018 with the release of Nintendo Labo, a series of build-it-yourself, cardboard-based peripherals that let players drive, fish, and experience lo-fi virtual reality. Two years later, there was Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, a real-world racing game that let Switch owners turn their console into a controller for an RC car \u2014 and terrorize their pets. Thanks to the detachable Joy-Con controllers, game designers at Nintendo realized you could strap them to your thigh, giving us Ring Fit Adventure, an inventive fitness role-playing game. That idea was later applied to a Wii Sports sequel, albeit less successfully. On the software front, Nintendo has been exploiting the detachable, motion-controlling Switch Joy-Cons to great (and weird) effect. Even many years into the system\u2019s lifecycle, we got great experiments like Everybody 1-2-Switch, which integrated smartphones to let up to 100 people play that party game, and WarioWare: Move It!, a microgame collection that explored butt-wiggling as a game mechanic. Nintendo also continued to innovate outside of the Switch\u2019s boundaries during the handheld\u2019s eight years on the market. In the off years, when it wasn\u2019t pumping out Switch variants like the Lite and OLED model, it released interesting hardware: the Super NES Classic Edition retro console, Lego Super Mario sets, and Game & Watch handhelds featuring The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. Sure, those were less \u201cweird\u201d than they were shrewd business decisions, but those non-Switch hardware releases helped Nintendo\u2019s Switch-era output be anything but stale. We\u2019ve already seen one potential gameplay-changer from Switch 2: the Joy-Cons\u2019 new mouse mode. Nintendo has a brief history with mouse controls dating back to the Super NES with Mario Paint, but I expect the company to go further with its new control scheme. While a mouse controller could certainly be additive for first-person shooters and DIY games like Super Mario Maker, but the potential for creativity is what excites me most: Nintendo\u2019s game designers are probably already making hundreds of WarioWare microgame prototypes using mouse movement. Another rumored feature may be a longshot, but a recently published patent from Nintendo indicates that the console can be rotated, meaning the Joy-Cons can be attached in an upside-down position. While the main purpose of that patent seems to benefit players who might want the system\u2019s ports to be on the opposite side, Nintendo could exploit this functionality for gameplay, \u00e0 la WarioWare: Twisted! or Pok\u00e9mon X and Y. Switch 2 has other hardware features that set it apart from the original Switch, including a new \u201cC\u201d button that might be used for a new social space and a second USB-C port. The latter may be used for something as dull as charging the Switch 2 or for connecting a set of USB-C headphones, but it opens up opportunities for Nintendo to invent weird little attachments. We can\u2019t discount all the other uses that Nintendo might have for its detachable Joy-Cons. Those tiny controllers are packed with haptics, motion and IR sensors, bigger buttons, and (hopefully) more reliable joysticks. While I don\u2019t expect Nintendo to release Labo 2, it\u2019s barely scratched the surface when it comes to jamming Joy-Cons into other things to make funky controllers. But yes, like Ana, I desperately want the conservative era of Nintendo to end in one regard: Switch 2 better have a silly little jingle or some catchy, endlessly looping tunes for its version of the eShop.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound, launched a new advertising campaign on Friday warning patients about off-brand versions of its treatments, saying \u201cthey put people at risk.\u201d The campaign, titled \u201cHealthy Skepticism,\u201d will appear in print ads in select national newspapers and a video version is already live on the pharma giant\u2019s website. The video ad takes aim at knockoff versions of Eli Lilly\u2019s patented treatments \u2014 even when they\u2019re recommended by friends, family, or \u201cyour favorite podcast.\u201d The ad ends with text stating that real, tested, and federally approved medicine doesn\u2019t require \u201cfaith.\u201d It urges the viewer to be \u201ca healthy skeptic.\u201d The campaign comes as Eli Lilly steps up its crackdown on unauthorized versions of its weight-loss drugs and as Zepbound emerges from a prolonged stint on the FDA\u2019s drug-shortage list. Zepbound belongs to a popular class of medications known as GLP-1 drugs, which also includes Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy. These drugs have been in short supply since 2022. That designation allowed pharmacies, telehealth companies, and other providers to sell compounded versions of the patented drugs, which are customized formulations of approved medications. Under normal circumstances, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are identical to commercially available medications. However, when a drug is officially in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) no longer considers it \u201ccommercially available,\u201d creating a temporary loophole for compounders. Now, that loophole is closing. The FDA recently declared the shortages of Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy over \u2014 meaning companies that have been selling off-brand versions will soon have to stop.  In December, the agency also warned that it has \u201cidentified some areas of concern for compounded GLP-1 drugs.\u201d It alerted consumers that compounded medications \u201cdo not undergo FDA\u2019s review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed.\u201d But the fight isn\u2019t over, yet. A group representing compounding pharmacies has filed two lawsuits against the FDA over its decision to remove the medications from its shortage list. The Outsourcing Facility Association (OFA) argues that the agency is ignoring evidence that shortages persist and claims its decision will prevent patients from accessing medicine they need. Some doctors have come out in support of compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs. Eli Lilly has asked to join one of the lawsuits to protect its interests. The pharma giant\u2019s stock price has risen more than 50% since the FDA approved Zepbound on Nov. 8, 2023 \u2014 to around $905 per share, driving its market cap north of $800 billion. Eli Lilly\u2019s ad campaign follows a Super Bowl commercial from the millennial-focused telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS) that criticized the high price of branded weight-loss drugs. \u201cWelcome to weight loss in America \u2014 a $160 billion industry that feeds on our failure,\u201d a narrator says in the ad. \u201cThere are medications that work \u2014 but they are priced for profits, not patients.\u201d Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Eli Lilly\u2019s new campaign. Hims & Hers profited significantly last year by selling a compounded version of Ozempic. But with the drug\u2019s shortage declared over, the company will soon have to halt sales of its cheaper alternative.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Chime cofounder and CEO Chris Britt is planning to take his 13-year-old company public this year. Chime, the largest digital bank in America, grew its revenue to $1.7 billion in 2024, an increase of roughly 30% from 2023, according to a person familiar with its finances. The San Francisco company wasn\u2019t profitable for the year, but it lost less than $50 million, the person said. That was a significant narrowing from 2023, when it burned about $200 million. Chime has also reached eight million active customers, up from seven million in the first half of 2024, according to another person familiar with its business. Those positive trends all suggest it is on track with its plans to go public. A Chime spokesperson declined to comment. Founded in 2012, Chime initially grew popular by offering a free checking account and debit card where consumers could access their paycheck two days before other banks made it available. It has catered largely to younger Americans earning between $35,000 and $65,000 and has built a sticky business by requiring customers to set up direct deposit to get access to a growing list of features, including $200 worth of free overdraft protection, a secured credit card that helps build your credit score and personal loans. Chime\u2019s continued growth has been driven by heavy spending on advertising and cross-selling its customers on additional products, such as its credit builder card. It spent about $200 million on advertising in 2024, according to market research firm MediaRadar, roughly the same as what it spent in 2023. Last year, Chime also launched MyPay, a new earned wage access service that lets consumers access up to $500 of their pay before payday, and it acquired startup Salt Labs to bring earned wage access products to employers. Chime made Forbes\u2019 Fintech 50 list earlier this month for the seventh consecutive year. Since Chime doesn\u2019t have a bank charter, it partners with Bancorp Bank and Stride Bank to offer banking products like checking and savings accounts. It makes the vast majority of its revenue on interchange fees\u2013the 1% to 2% charge merchants pay to accept debit and credit cards. As of late last year, Chime had 1,400 employees. The company is planning to go public in the first half of this year, according to a person familiar with its business, and it filed confidentially for an IPO late last year, according to Bloomberg. Industry insiders expect it will be valued at $10 billion or more when it makes its public debut. Caplight, a secondary market trading and analytics firm, estimates Chime\u2019s valuation at $11 billion, up substantially from a year ago. In Caplight\u2019s estimate, the increase is driven by factors like mutual funds\u2019 valuations of their private Chime stock, secondary market trades of Chime shares and the performance of comparable public companies. One of Chime\u2019s closest competitors, Block\u2019s Cash App, has seen slowing growth recent months, with its monthly active users growing just 2% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 57 million, up from 56 million the year prior. That doesn\u2019t mean Chime is poised to see slowing growth soon too, since it has a fraction of the customer base, more room to grow and a different strategy. Historically, Chime has focused more intently on getting customers to sign up for direct deposit than Cash App. In the broader landscape of primary banking apps, Chime\u2019s market share is still only in the low single digits. Chase, for example, had 58 million active mobile customers at the end of last year.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"AMD does have eyes for the entry-level market after all.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  We may have only just heard all the details about AMD's forthcoming RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards, but I'm looking to the future for the next release. Thankfully, the red team has some news on what to expect, and when. The company confirmed multiple \"RX 9060 products\" will arrive in the second quarter of this year, which could be anytime between April \u2013 June. A later timeframe does appear more likely right now, considering the delayed launch of the RX 9070-series, but we'll have to wait and see. The RX 9060-series should be made up of more affordable graphics cards than their RX 9070-series compatriots. Considering the RX 7600 XT was priced at $329 at launch, and the RX 7600 at $269, we should expect prices for the newer models to be in this same sort of ballpark. I'd love to see a 16 GB RX 9060 XT for $329, as proper competition to Intel's 12 GB Arc B580. Then, if AMD intends to sandwich Intel entirely, an affordable addition below the $280 Arc card in the RX 9060. Though this does require RDNA 4 to be a performant architecture once limited for compute units and on a stricter power budget\u2014it should be though, AMD's not struggled massively with that in the past thanks to its know-how designing iGPUs for APUs. Generally, I'm just pleased to hear something about budget graphics cards, or presumably budget graphics cards. Nvidia has said nought on cheaper alternatives to its current RTX 50-series line-up, the cheapest of which so far announced is the forthcoming RTX 5070 at $549. Though those released in the series to date have been shooting way above MSRP for the past month, and Nvidia hasn't been known for tremendous value in the budget arena with the RTX 40-series, either. Intel has, of course, the B580, which is a commendable launch for a card under $300 (in theory, it is also in high demand), but AMD has been holding out on us.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":" Tamron Co., Ltd. announced it has begun manufacturing operations at its second factory in Vietnam, thereby strengthening its global \u201ctripolar production system\u201d approach and preparing for future business expansion.  Tamron\u2019s second Vietnam production facility is in the V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac province in northern Vietnam and cost Tamron approximately four billion yen to build, which is about $26.5 million at current exchange rates. The plant, which began operations at Thang Long Industrial Park 3 last month, is approximately 17,000 square meters (nearly 183,000 square feet) and will support 1,500 people when it reaches its full operational capacity in 2028.  The three-story factory will manufacture lenses, including photographic lenses and optics for surveillance systems and motor vehicles, like the cameras required for modern safety features.  Tamron\u2019s Japanese press release says Tamron invested in the new facility to expand its production capacity, make its supply production capabilities more stable, and improve its response to ever-changing geopolitical situations, including tariffs levied by countries like the United States against goods manufactured in China.   While the new factory is open, Tamron says it will not reach mass production capabilities until next year, and full operations will take another two years to kick into gear. However, the factory can manufacture lenses, including metal processing, molding, painting, and assembly, under one roof.  Tamron says its production capacity will increase by approximately 1.2 times compared to 2024 thanks in part to this new factory, and the company will embrace a \u201cglobal tripolar production system.\u201d The company\u2019s Japanese factory in Aomori will be its \u201cmother factory,\u201d where Tamron establishes its production technology. The company\u2019s Chinese factory handles products for the Chinese domestic market, and its two Vietnam factories produce products for the global market, including North America and Europe, two key international markets for Tamron\u2019s lenses and other optical products.  \u201cIn addition to geopolitical risks, tariff risks against China have been increasing in recent years, but in anticipation of the emergence of such risks, we have been proceeding with the construction of this factory since 2023,\u201d Tamron explains in a machine-translated statement. \u201cIn a rapidly changing society, we will continue to improve and strengthen our production system so that we can continue to deliver optical products to customers around the world.\u201d  Image credits: Tamron  Become a PetaPixel Member and access our content ad-free. \u00a9 2025 PetaPixel Inc.

{"date":"2025-02-28","content":"Huawei might not have been the first to the market with a foldable phone, but they were the first to launch a tri-fold phone. Since then, we\u2019ve heard rumors that other companies, such as Samsung, could have similar plans of their own. Now we can add another company to that list\u2014Infinix. According to an Infinix press release, the company has teased its own tri-fold smartphone ahead of MWC 2025. Now, before you get too excited, we need to clarify that Infinix isn\u2019t necessarily working on its own tri-fold device. Instead, the press release is more about showing off the company\u2019s concept and take on such a device, which they\u2019re calling the Infinix ZERO Series Mini Tri-Fold Concept Device. From the renders, it looks like this is a different take on tri-fold phones compared to Huawei and Samsung. Instead of a book-style foldable, Infinix has opted for a tri-fold clamshell. This means that it will be smaller and more compact compared to book-style foldables. The company imagines this device potentially doubling as an action camera that can be clipped onto a bag or a bike for the FPV perspective. The tri-fold design also means that users have more options when it comes to its form factor. Instead of just open and close, users can opt to have one of the displays folded down, or both, to create an even more compact device. Will Infinix actually release such a device? That remains to be seen. The company is no stranger when it comes to foldables, but hopefully, we\u2019ll learn more about their plans at MWC 2025. Your email address will not be published.
