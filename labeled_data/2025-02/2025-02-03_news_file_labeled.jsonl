Kazuhiro Nogi\/AFP                                       hide caption  Wall Street is feeling tariff whiplash. U.S. stocks pared back their losses by midday Monday, as President Trump said he would delay at least part of his threatened global trade war.  Major stock indices plunged in early Monday trading, but by midday had somewhat recovered: The Dow was trading down about 150 points or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.2% and the broader S&P 500 index fell 0.8%. Over the weekend, President Trump's announced new tariffs on the United States' largest trading partners. Starting Tuesday, imports from Canada and Mexico will pay 25% duties and those from China 10%. Energy imports from Canada will be lower with a 10% duty.  But on Monday morning, after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump announced a one-month pause on the tariffs on Mexican goods. He called the conversation with Sheinbaum \"very friendly,\" in a post on his Truth Social network.  Trump added that his administration will continue to negotiate with Mexico, \"as we attempt to achieve a 'deal' between our two Countries.\" The weekend executive action sent a wave of fear rippling through markets globally. In a note to clients before Trump announced the pause, economists from the global bank BNP Paribas said that \"the announced increase in tariffs were even larger and came faster than we had penciled in.\" The economists say tariffs would put the brakes on economic growth and U.S. consumer prices \"should rise sharply over the coming months.\" Investors in some American automakers appeared to welcome the news of the Mexican tariff reprieve: Shares in GM and Ford were each down about 1% by midday, regaining some ground from the morning. (Tesla was still down more than 4%.) Automakers run a complex supply chain web between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Many also manufacture cars in Mexico or Canada before exporting them to the U.S.  The President's tariff threats also rattled markets in Europe. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1% Monday, and Germany's DAX fell 2%. The FTSE 100 index, which tracks the hundred largest companies listed in London, was down 1%. President Trump said Sunday night that new tariffs on the EU would \"definitely happen\" but suggested he may take a softer line on the U.K., saying he had a good relationship with Prime Minister Keir Starmer but that the U.K. \"might\" still face penalties.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Cancer Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against other best cancer stocks to buy. Cancer is the second leading cause of death across the globe, second to cardiovascular disease. According to data by the American Cancer Society released in January 2023, the United States was expected to have around 1,958,310 cancer patients by the end of 2023 alone. This reflects a 28% increase from 2010. More than 2 million new cases of cancer were likely to be diagnosed in the US in 2024, with more than 600,000 deaths from the ailment expected in the same year. Like the increasing number of cancer patients, the cost of treating cancer is on an upward trajectory as well. While it cost around $200 billion to treat cancer in the US in 2020, the total expense is anticipated to exceed $245 billion by 2030. According to the \u201cOncology Pharmaceuticals Market 2024\u201d report, global funding for cancer research has grown exponentially over the past two decades. The FDA approved 161 new cancer therapies between 2017 and 2022, which reflects the fast pace with which treatment in the field is advancing. These statistics make oncology one of the most comprehensive sectors of the life science space. The oncology sector covers the entire cancer care process, from diagnosis to treatment. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies around the world are continuously striving to develop more effective cancer treatments. According to Fortune Business Insights, this endeavor is expected to continue increasing in magnitude in the coming future. The global oncology drugs market was valued at around $201.75 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3%, going from $220.80 billion in 2024 to $518.25 billion by 2032. Some of the primary factors driving the growth of the oncology drugs market include the advancements in targeted immunotherapies for cancer care and the increasing prevalence of cancer across the globe. This growth rate makes investment in oncology-related companies a lucrative bet. North America is the most dominant geographical region in the global oncology drugs market. It held a 45.92% market share in 2023. READ ALSO:\u00a012 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners\u00a0and\u00a012 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025.\u00a0 The precision oncology market reflects similar trends. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision oncology as a form of treatment where medical professionals choose treatments by keeping the DNA signature of an individual patient\u2019s tumor in view. Statistics from Grand View Research show that the global precision oncology market size was valued at $115.8 billion in 2024. It is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 8.05% between 2025 and 2030. This growth is attributed to the increasing demand for diagnostics products, technological advances, avoiding particular drug resistance, and the increasing minimizing of the side effects of therapies in cancer patients. The adoption of AI in the oncology sector is increasing dramatically. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the AI in oncology market size is expected to be around $1.98 billion in 2025, and is anticipated to reach around $9.04 billion by 2030. This reflects growth at a CAGR of 35.51% between 2025 and 2030. The increasing adoption of AI to diagnose, analyze, and treat complex datasets related to oncology is helping reduce the burden on physicians and hospital infrastructure, streamlining the process. While the largest market for AI in oncology is North America, the fastest-growing sector market is the Asia-Pacific region. We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 cancer stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Nearly two decades after her prescient warnings about the financial crisis, Meredith Whitney remains one of the more widely followed research analysts in markets.          Although no one's calls are always correct, Whitney is known for bold, outside-the-box thinking that gets gears turning \u2014 like why young people could get a leg up in the housing market, or why remote workers secretly working two jobs were at risk of getting caught.               Business Insider recently caught up with the \"Oracle of Wall Street,\" who shared in an interview the three under-the-radar economic trends she's watching most closely in 2025.               After countless hours of studying the US economy, Whitney's highest-conviction call this year is that consumer spending will strengthen across income strata and keep growth humming.               \"The takeaways are clearly that consumer spending strength is going to broaden this year, so that means it will accelerate,\" Whitney said.               In recent years, Whitney's research suggests that spending has been disproportionately driven by higher-income consumers and the mid-20s to late-30s cohort, whom she affectionately calls \"avocado toasters.\" Whitney noted last May that their young people's spending far exceeds that of baby boomers, and she now estimates their discretionary spending is five to six times higher.               Contrary to what some might suggest, these whippersnappers may not be being irresponsible. Instead, Gen Zers and millennials have been largely shut out of the housing market due to high mortgage rates and may be making up for it with retail therapy \u2014 or simply because they can.               \"The avocado toasters who don't own homes \u2014 this is the 24- to 38-year-olds who don't own homes \u2014 have more discretionary spend, because it's gotten so expensive over the last three years to own a home with rising homeowners' insurance, property taxes, homeowners' association fees,\" Whitney said.               Besides being unburdened by expensive mortgage payments, many young people are finding creative ways to team up and save money. Whitney pointed out that password sharing is the norm for younger generations, and even those who don't snag log-ins for streaming services or YouTube TV can stay on their parents' phone plans for $10 a month instead of $50 or more.               Other consumers are in a much different spot. Lower-income consumers have felt the highest inflation in a generation most acutely. In fact, Whitney said last spring that households making between $50,000 and $70,000 a year could only afford to save 0.3% of their post-tax income.               \"What has been clear is that the 52% that have been living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 over 50% of the households \u2014 are really struggling,\" Whitney said.               Consumers could make a financial comeback this year if inflation fades and interest rates inch down, Whitney said. And while some economic observers are anxious that Trump's tariffs could cause prices to reaccelerate, Whitney didn't cite that as a major near-term risk.               A long-awaited rebound for consumers, including those in the lower-income bracket, could spark a turnaround for beleaguered dollar stores and other struggling retailers, Whitney said.               \"The dollar stores and all the discounters \u2014 and I'll throw Target into the mix; it's neither \u2014 will have a great 2025 and beyond,\" Whitney said. \"They've been beat up for a number of reasons, but one of them has been that their primary customer really had a hard landing after COVID stimulus checks ended.\"               As Whitney noted, pandemic-era government aid and inflation were major tailwinds for dollar stores. Consumers of all income types flocked to Dollar Tree and Dollar General for their rock-bottom prices, pushing their shares to record levels. Dollar Tree's stock even doubled in the five months from late September 2021 to mid-April 2022.               But ever since, Dollar Tree and Dollar General have been dead money, with shares down 57% and 72%, respectively, from all-time highs. Inflation has become a major headwind by eating into profits on dirt-cheap products. Dollar Tree's earnings have been hammered, and Dollar General's operating income growth has been negative for seven straight quarters.               Dollar Tree and Dollar General's standing among investors went from bad to worse early last fall after alarming earnings reports. Both companies lost about a third of their market value as they slashed full-year guidance, blaming consumer spending weakness among income cohorts.               Whitney said she became bullish about dollar stores shortly after, and it's not because she was bargain-hunting. Instead, her research indicates that consumers may get more breathing room.               Since last summer, Whitney said property owners have increasingly taken out lines of credit from their home equity, which is a relatively cheap way to borrow money. Consumers can take this cash and use it to pay down their credit-card statement and other costlier bills, she added. Armed with money in their pocket and lower card balances, households can spend more freely.               \"What I expected was this to have almost like a trickle-down effect,\" Whitney said. \"It's happened a lot faster than I would've thought. So if you look at the same-store sales year on year, they've already picked up dramatically with the dollar stores and with Target. And when the retailers report, I think the investors will be surprised by how strong the results are.\"               Whitney's most surprising take is one that's the opposite of what she believed a year ago.               The Oracle of Wall Street had spoken for years about a so-called \"silver tsunami,\" reasoning that older homeowners would flood the housing market by listing their homes en masse. This would send property values plunging and allow younger buyers to swoop in at steep discounts.               But after examining more data, Whitney recently said that her theory is no longer likely.               Although the US population is still steadily aging, the researcher now expects older people to \"age in place\" instead of moving to ranchers, retirement communities, or nursing homes, which can be very expensive. Only about one in eight seniors can afford assisted living without tapping into their assets, Whitney noted, citing a 2023 Harvard study on housing older adults in the US.               Her change of mind comes as older property owners are seemingly deciding not to move. Instead, seniors are taking out lines of credit to renovate their homes. That could mean putting bedrooms in on the ground floor, adding walk-in tubs, or installing movable stairs, Whitney said.               If grandpas and grandmas across the country stay put, there will be fewer houses for younger buyers to choose from. That could be disastrous, if new home inventory wasn't rising like it is.               \"Their best chance of owning a home is with new homes \u2014 not existing,\" Whitney said of younger homebuyers.               Millennials and Gen-Zers might not get the revenge over owners that Whitney thought was possible last year, but they'll likely be better off than in the least affordable market of their lives.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Welcome back! Global markets have been rocked after the Trump administration ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on China, which are set to start on Tuesday. All three countries vowed to retaliate.          Business leaders are urging Trump to reconsider, fearing a global trade war that could wreak havoc on American industries.               In today's big story, last week's DeepSeek drama is a good opportunity for investors to reassess their positions.       What's on deck   Markets: Crypto coins hoping to surge thanks to celebrity endorsements. What could possibly go wrong?       Tech: Meta is showing no signs of slowing down this year.       Business: Trump's deportation plan is set to be big business for private prisons.               But first, some lessons learned.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   It was the shock heard around the world until it wasn't.           DeepSeek's arrival hit the market, especially tech stocks, hard and fast. Things eventually stabilized before turning catastrophic, but the episode provided a valuable lesson for investors on the risks that come from a market so heavily focused on one theme.               Business Insider's Matthew Fox unpacked the DeepSeek crash by looking at five investing lessons learned from the saga. His findings include everything from understanding the different layers of AI to the considerations that need to be made for cheap AI's impact on the bond market (Hint: It's a good thing.)               It's an interesting and useful exercise considering there's likely more volatility ahead due to the market's structure: a handful of stocks at record valuations all focused on the same thing dictating where the rest of the market goes.               For some, DeepSeek was the first break in the AI-built dam. \"You have a small little chip on the glass. Now they realize, oh, it's not infallible. Maybe I should revise,\" \"Black Swan\" author Nassim Taleb said last week.               Others are much less bearish, feeling it was more a product of investors rethinking the already sky-high valuations in the tech sector.               Regardless of where you fall on the AI-belief spectrum, it's not something you can ignore as an investor. With seemingly everyone talking about how the tech will impact their industry, failure to acknowledge feels akin to investing negligence.               So, the key lesson from DeepSeek might be that, for better or for worse, AI rules the roost.       1. Who's behind the celebrity meme coin scams? Celebrity meme coins are prime targets for classic pump-and-dump schemes, which can leave investors with suddenly worthless tokens. One crypto sleuth tracked down the culprit but was left with a bigger question: Were the celebrities in on it?       2. Trump might need to get out of his own way regarding the Fed. The president has repeatedly demanded the Fed lower interest rates, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell has shrugged off. Though Trump blames Powell for inflation, Wall Street forecasters think the bigger obstacle to lowering it is the president's own trade plans.       3. #noregrets. Okay, well maybe a few \u2014 but these four older Americans told BI how they eased into retirement without much they'd change in retrospect. \"Do I wish I had more money? Yes, but I would not have done anything different,\" one said.       1. Can't stop, won't stop. If the first few weeks of the year are any indication, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making good on his promise that 2025 will be the company's \"year of intensity.\" It's already made content moderation changes and realigned itself with Trump, and there are shifts in the workforce and AI development still to come.       2. President Trump's proposed US government stake in TikTok could be a legal nightmare. The government owning a piece of a major social app would be new territory \u2014 and for it to work, the dealmakers would need to set up editorial guardrails to protect users' First Amendment rights. Still, legal analysts told BI that TikTok's content moderation could create an avalanche of legal challenges and make the app hard to run.       3. The race is on to recreate DeepSeek's market-breaking AI. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft have already adapted versions of the R1 model for their cloud platforms. Many are also attempting to replicate it from the ground up \u2014 and putting DeepSeek's claims to the test. As DeepSeek's model continues to gain traction, some cloud service and AI interference providers say they're noticing increased demand for Nvidia H200 chips.       1. The quiet winner of Trump's mass deportation plan. Trump's aggressive stance on immigration has already propelled stock prices in one industry: private prisons. The sector, which was on the outs with the Biden White House, stands to rake in millions more from immigrant detention.       2. Hotels for the homeless. Some US cities are taking part in a bold new experiment: buying and renovating hotels to house the homeless. Affordable converted hotels can be a \"lower-barrier-for-entry option\" for those struggling to find a home \u2014 especially as neighborhoods like Brentwood in Raleigh face threats of urban sprawl and gentrification.       3. Trump issued a series of executive orders aimed at reshaping the American education system. They examine redirecting federal funds to private schools that align with the president's politics, and changing curricula. It's unclear how his plans will be implemented, and the orders will likely face legal challenges. Still, they could have \"a chilling effect\" on schools, one education expert told BI.      Mark Zuckerberg said he has no plans to change Meta's hybrid work policy: 'The status quo is fine.' Blue Origin New Shepherd rocket launch.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Shein is re-entering the world's biggest consumer market, India, nearly five years after it was banned there in 2020.          India's Ministry of Information Technology banned Shein and dozens of other Chinese apps including TikTok in 2020, citing concerns over national security and data privacy.               But Reliance Industries, a multinational conglomerate owned by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, is bringing Shein back into the country under a new platform called Shein India Fast Fashion.               Business Insider's checks showed that a new Shein app was available on Apple and Google's app stores as of January 27. The app listing showed it was operated by Reliance Retail, Reliance Industries' consumer arm.               \"The fashion OG is back!\" a pop-up message on the app wrote.               According to a memo on the app seen by Business Insider, the brand currently ships products only to select regions, such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Bangalore, India's tech hub.               \"Pan-India shipping very soon,\" the notice said.               When BI searched the App Store in India for the original Shein app, a notice said it was not available.               The Reliance and Shein agreement was brought up in a parliament address in December when India's commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, said the two companies had entered into a technology agreement to develop an e-commerce platform.               \"The platform is intended to create a network of local manufacturers and suppliers who will manufacture products under the brand of Shein and sell them domestically and globally,\" Goyal said.               Re-entry into India, the world's most populous country with nearly 1.43 billion people, comes at a crucial time for Shein as it faces a reckoning in the US. The US is its largest consumer market, according to GlobalData estimates seen by Reuters.               But President Donald Trump imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China on Saturday, along with a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. During his 2024 campaign, Trump said he planned to impose tariffs of 60% or higher taxes on Chinese products.               Jeffrey Towson, the founder of US and China-based retail consultancy TechMoat Consulting, told BI in November that Shein and Temu, another budget Chinese retailer, won't be able to escape the consequences of the tariffs.               \"Shein and Temu excel at very low prices. That's why American consumers love them. But there is nothing left to squeeze out of their China supply chains,\" Towson told BI.               He said that consumers are likely to see price increases due to the tariffs unless \"the supply chains are redirected,\" which he said was \"very likely.\"               Representatives for Shein and Reliance Industries did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -U.S. companies will look to the Middle East and India for more aluminium and to Chile and Peru for copper as they seek to circumvent sweeping tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, according to industry sources.  Trump's orders for additional levies of 25% on imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, as well as 10% on goods from China, have been light on detail.  U.S. users depend on aluminium producers in Canada such as Alcoa and Rio Tinto for more than half of their imported needs and will look for alternative supply, analysts said. NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global markets buckled up for a turbulent session on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war with sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China that threaten to undermine economic growth and reignite inflation.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced plans for retaliatory tariffs on imports of goods from the United States, the first of which also would take effect on Tuesday. In a previous article about Roth conversions, an advisor wrote: \"For many folks, a prime time for Roth conversions takes place during the years after retirement but before Social Security and RMDs kick in.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"US stocks were sent on a wild ride on Monday as investors reacted to President Donald Trump's tariff threats against Mexico, Canada, and China. The day opened up with steep losses for major stock indexes and cryptocurrencies, while the dollar and oil both gained. However, by the end of the day, the largest moves had been reversed. Here are some of the day's big swings.  The sharp downside volatility was sparked by investors' fear that 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs against China would drag down economic growth and rekindle inflation, leading to a potential stagflationary environment. But risk assets staged a turnaround after news of a constructive phone conversation between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum delayed the implementation of the Mexico tariffs by one month. Sheinbaum said Mexico would deploy 10,000 troops to the Mexico-US border in a bid to stem the flow of illegal fentanyl into the country, a key sticking point for Trump's tariffs. \"President Trump is taking bold action to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country,\" Trump's executive order tied to the tariffs said. Now, investors hope that a similar development will set the stage for tariffs on Canada to be avoided or delayed. Otherwise, duties on imports from Canada will fully go into effect at 12:00 a.m. on Tuesday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Trump were expected to speak Monday afternoon, continuing talks from earlier in the day.  The consensus on Wall Street is that the proposed tariffs against Mexico and Canada will likely be temporary if they are implemented. \"We still think that permanent tariffs on the US's allies (Canada, Mexico) will not be a thing. That's because concessions are an 'easier' way to deal with Trump's 'problems' (from a cost-benefit and game-theoretic perspective), and Trump likes to make 'deals'. Political and market pressure will also weigh on the parties to make concessions, as in 2018,\" Thierry Wizman, strategist at Macquarie, wrote in a Monday note. Meanwhile, analysts at Bank of America said that while they expect potential tariffs against Mexico and Canada to be short-lived, the 10% tariff against China will likely be permanent, granted that's far less than the 60% tariff Trump floated against China during his campaign. \"While there might be some reductions or exclusions, we think tariffs will largely remain in place, like those implemented in 2018,\" Bank of America said of the China tariffs on Monday. But for now, with no sign that China is eager to retaliate, investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the tariffs' impact on the broader economy, similar to what happened in 2018 when Trump launched a series of tariffs. \"Perhaps because the effect of tariffs is so hard to model, stock traders initially ignored the threat of tariffs in 2017 and in H1 2018. It was only after the economic impact was felt that equity prices fell in the US and globally, in H2 2018,\" Macquarie's Wizman said. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks","label":1}

With an estimated personal fortune of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, Kevin O\u2019Leary is clearly a rich man. However, in a recent video posted on YouTube, the entrepreneur insists that the pursuit of money is not what drives him. \u201cYeah, I woke up rich one day but I didn\u2019t care, and now I work harder than I ever did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the personal freedom, not the money.\u201d A near-record number of Americans are grappling with $1,000 car payments and many drivers can't keep up.

Entrepreneurs pursue risky ventures because they\u2019re focused on curing pain points for specific customers, O\u2019Leary argues. He believes a similar mindset could help most people accumulate wealth faster. \u201cYou\u2019ll wake up one day and be a multi-millionaire if you solve big problems for people,\u201d he said in the video. Other successful entrepreneurs have also echoed this approach.

Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead As O\u2019Leary suggests, some companies were created to solve specific problems. If the problem is big enough, and the solution is potent, a business can be relatively lucrative. Cybercrime, for instance, is a huge problem. In 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) saw a 10% surge in cybercrime complaints year-over-year. Americans collectively lost $12.5 billion to such crimes, up 22% from the previous year. Companies like Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) and Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) are problem solvers in this space. According to Palo Alto Networks, its enterprise firewalls have prevented over 13.46 billion attacks, while Crowdstrike has 17.7% market share in endpoint device security. Another widesweeping problem is how painful, uncomfortable and risky medical surgeries can be. Surgeons across the world are increasingly adopting robotic assistants to make their procedures less invasive, more precise and more successful. One of the leading problem solvers in this arena is Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). The company claims that its da Vinci System has been involved in over 12 million surgeries and over 60,000 surgeons have been trained to use it \u2014 and the stock is up 200% over the past five years. Climate change is another problem that innovative companies are trying to mitigate. In 2024, there were 27 major climate disasters across the U.S. that caused damages exceeding $1 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is one of many companies investing billions into building out renewable energy infrastructure to mitigate the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although its earnings are robust, the stock is down almost 20% over the past year. This price correction has pushed the dividend yield up to 6.8%.

Air New Zealand Limited (NZSE:AIR), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NZSE over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Air New Zealand\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.  View our latest analysis for Air New Zealand  According to our valuation model, Air New Zealand seems to be fairly priced at around 17.31% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Air New Zealand today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth NZ$0.54, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Air New Zealand\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Air New Zealand's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AIR\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value? Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AIR, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop. So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Air New Zealand at this point in time. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Air New Zealand, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"In what could be SoftBank\u2019s newest trick to make ungodly amounts of money disappear, the Japanese investment firm will pay $3 billion a year to force companies in its portfolio to experiment with AI agents. SoftBank and OpenAI announced Monday that they were forming a joint venture to develop and market a new product called Cristal Intelligence, which will build off of OpenAI\u2019s latest reasoning models to create AI agents that will complete tasks without human intervention. SoftBank said in a press release that it plans to automate over 100 million workflows among its companies, which could include generating financial reports, drafting documents, and managing customer inquiries. \u201cBy automating and autonomizing all of its tasks and workflows, SoftBank Corp. will transform its business and services, and create new value,\u201d the company said. OpenAI has already launched a preview of its agentic tool Operator for its top-tier subscribers, who pay $200 a month and now have the privilege of not clicking buttons\u00c2\u00a0to schedule their own haircuts. The new Cristal Intelligence system will create similar agents, but they\u2019ll be trained on corporate customers\u2019 data and customized for their systems and needs, SoftBank said. At least initially, it will be marketed exclusively to \u201cmajor companies in Japan.\u201d SoftBank, led by its Chairman Masayoshi Son, built a strong reputation in the tech venture space with early investments in companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Alibaba. But in recent years, its bets have been notably less successful, particularly when it comes to transforming the nature of work. It lost billions\u00c2\u00a0on WeWork, for example, and threw $375 million at now-defunct Zume, which promised to automate and disrupt the creation of pizzas. The Cristal Intelligence partnership deepens its financial stake in OpenAI. SoftBank is reportedly in talks to invest $25 billion directly into the company and it has already announced a collaboration called Stargate, another joint venture including OpenAI that plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years to build out AI infrastructure like data centers. The firm\u2019s big money bets come amid a lot of hype about the potential of AI agents, but also as as breakthroughs by the Chinese company DeepSeek have raised questions about whether cheaper, more efficient AI developers will undercut OpenAI, which is losing money on its most expensive subscription plan because of the cost of running the technology. \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r       Best of CES 2025 Awards \u00e2\u009e\u009c We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites. \u00c2\u00a92025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Chinese fast fashion app Shein has relaunched in India five years after it was banned by Delhi, under a deal with Indian firm Reliance Retail. An official from Reliance Retail, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC the firm has entered a long-term licensing deal with the parent company to sell products manufactured and sourced in India on the platform. The group has not yet made an official announcement. Shein's re-entry to the Indian market comes with strict terms, which include saving all data within the country, India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said in December. In 2020 India banned Shein and dozens of other Chinese apps including TikTok. It said this was in response to data security concerns and it followed a spike in tensions with China after clashes between the two countries' armies in a disputed Himalayan border area. The app was launched in India on Friday night and has so far been downloaded by more than 10,000 people. It is offering fashionwear for as little as 199 rupees ($2.30; \u00a31.90).  Shein is currently delivering to consumers only in the cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, but will soon offer services across India, according to a notification on the app. Over the last decade, Shein has gone from a little-known brand among older shoppers to one of the biggest fast fashion retailers globally. Today, it ships to customers in 150 countries across the world. Before the ban it became a big hit in India as it gave people a variety of options to buy trendy designs at an affordable price. The ban initially left a vacuum in the Indian market which was later filled by many local players.  Experts say that with Shein India, Reliance Retail - owned by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani - is diversifying from its existing strategy of selling international brands through its flagship Ajio online retailer. The revival comes with strict conditions that give Reliance Retail full control over its operations and data while Shein will be a technological partner, Goyal told the Indian parliament in December.  All customer and application data will be stored in India and Shein will not have any access rights, he said.  Goyal also clarified that the app was banned in India, not the \"sale of Shein-branded products\". Shein will use India as a \"supply source for its global operations\" and will help Reliance Retail in \"building the network\" and training Indian garment manufacturers, as it aims to promote export of textile and garments from India, an official from Reliance Retail said.  Shein's comeback under the deal with Reliance Retail is a rare exception to India's ban on more than 200 Chinese apps over the last five years.  At the time, Indian officials said the ban followed many complaints against the apps for \"stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner\". ByteDance's TikTok and popular combat and survival game PlayerUnknown's Battleground (PUBG) were also banned.  However PubG was later rebranded and launched for the Indian market under the name Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), which is held by Krafton India.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Surprise! I bet you didn\u2019t have Apple launching a revamped calendar app on your Monday morning bingo card, but here we are. Over the weekend, Bloomberg\u2018s Power On newsletter hinted about an upcoming new calendar app from Apple for iOS 18. Confetti or Invites (no one knows what it\u2019s called) is an iCloud-based calendar app that could launch this week. Apple has been \u201cseeking to revamp its calendar app\u201d for years, and this is merely the first stage of change. As Bloomberg describes, the festive-sounding codename Confetti could be Apple\u2019s way of gussying up a typically stuffy and regimented calendar app. We don\u2019t know what Apple will call this app. If you look up information about what\u2019s to come, the app is called \u201cInvites.\u201d Like Evite, Partiful, and the ever-enduring Facebook, the app will focus on sending and receiving invitations and managing those guestlists. There\u2019s speculation that Genmoji would play a role in all this as a way for you to customize the Invites you send out with a signature bit of Apple flair. Whether this would be a separate app or a feature within the stock iOS Calendar app is unconfirmed. This rumor has been percolating for a while. 9to5Mac was among the first to report on it after browsing iOS 18.3\u2019s beta code. The blog\u2019s code sleuths also found a web version of the invitations, which suggests that this is a way for Apple users to replace all the other third-party invite services out there with something more well-integrated and almost proprietary. It\u2019s unclear how this would work with non-Apple-using users. I imagine you won\u2019t be able to make the Apple-styled invitation without an iOS device or Mac. Invites would likely feed into Apple Intelligence\u00c2\u00a0since that\u2019s the name of the game lately for all in consumer technology. The app would pull data from an iOS daemon\u00e2\u0080\u0094a process that runs constantly in the background\u00e2\u0080\u0094called GroupKit. GroupKit manages database models for groups of people based on your contacts. Apple Intelligence could be the brain that manages those lists for you and suggests them when the timing is right based on the type of event you\u2019re hosting and who you\u2019re inviting. Other tidbits to know are that it\u2019s likely to be ad- and tracker-free, making it a better choice than Facebook and all those others and helping Apple hone in on that privacy narrative it\u2019s been polishing all these days. There might also be Apple Photos integration for the ease of collecting pictures after the event and multiple calendar integration. The advent of \u201cConfetti,\u201d or Invites, or whatever it will be called, will likely coincide with another iOS 18.3 push. The software started rolling out to iPhones and iPads last month, and according to 9to5Mac, we\u2019re just waiting for Apple to activate it.  iOS 18iOS 18.3  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 If you really hate it, you can turn it off entirely in the iPhone settings.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"     Tariffs and labor data could spark volatility in the mortgage market this week.    Mortgage rates fluctuate daily, so a little volatility can always be expected. On Monday, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was around 6.96%, according to Bankrate data, which is 0.15% lower than January's peak of 7.11%.\u00a0 But February could see more turbulence than usual.\u00a0 Last month's labor data, which will be released this Friday, and ongoing news on tariffs are the key economic factors affecting rates this week. Both have the potential to make bond yields rise or fall, which in turn would drive mortgage rates up or down.\u00a0 Economists are rightly concerned that President Donald Trump's threats to place sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China will increase consumer prices. Tariffs are also expected to negatively impact housing affordability, putting upward pressure on borrowing rates and the cost of building materials, like lumber, used to build new homes.\u00a0 \"Tariffs won't have an immediate effect. Yet, long term, they will cause mortgage rates to rise as investors demand better returns,\" said Nicole Rueth, SVP of the Rueth Team Powered by Movement Mortgage.\u00a0 Friday's Bureau of Labor Statistics report for January will also impact mortgage rates, perhaps more so than headlines on inflationary trade wars, according to Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire. If the labor market weakens with higher unemployment figures, it could actually push both bond yields and mortgage rates down.\u00a0 Short-term volatility aside, most economic forecasts call for a gradual decline in mortgage rates over the course of 2025, but not by much. Fannie Mae expects average 30-year fixed mortgage rates to hold above 6.5% until mid-2025.\u00a0 The direction of mortgage rates ultimately depends on the economic impact of policies enacted by the Trump administration and the projected pace of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. \"Markets will take their biggest cues from actual changes in economic data,\" said Matt Graham of Mortgage News Daily.\u00a0 Last week, on Jan. 29, the Federal Reserve's decision-making body voted to pause its cuts on borrowing rates, leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials are waiting to see if inflation eases or the labor market softens and aren't hurrying to lower interest rates. \u00a0 As of now, experts project one or two rate cuts this year. \"There is a lot of change happening at the beginning of the new presidential term, and depending on policy, we could see inflation turn upward,\" said Rueth.\u00a0 The Fed typically responds to high levels of inflation by hiking interest rates to slow the economy, as it did starting in early 2022.\u00a0 Though the Fed's monetary policy decisions only indirectly impact the mortgage market, higher inflation and steeper interest rates usually translate to more expensive mortgages for borrowers.\u00a0 Despite the president's claims that he would bring mortgage rates down to 3%, the White House doesn't set rates on home loans. Moreover, those kinds of rock-bottom pandemic-era rates would normally indicate that the country is in a severe economic crisis.\u00a0 If Trump's policies recharge inflation or boost government debt deficits, more affordable mortgages and housing will be difficult to achieve, particularly in time for the spring homebuying season. Here is where some of the major housing authorities expect mortgage rates to land this year.\u00a0 Even if mortgage rates do eventually come down, prospective homebuyers will still have to grapple with a\u00a0long-standing housing shortage, expensive\u00a0home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation. It's never a good idea to rush into\u00a0buying a home\u00a0without knowing what you can afford, so establish a clear home-buying budget. Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home:\u00a0 \ud83d\udcb0 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate. \ud83d\udcb0 Save for a bigger down payment.\u00a0A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance. \ud83d\udcb0 Shop for mortgage lenders.\u00a0Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders. \ud83d\udcb0 Consider renting.\u00a0Choosing to rent or buy a home isn't just comparing monthly rent to a mortgage payment. Renting offers flexibility and lower upfront costs, but buying allows you to build wealth and have more control over your housing costs. \ud83d\udcb0 Consider mortgage points.\u00a0You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate.","label":0}

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you managed to purchase an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 or RTX 5080, which is easier said than done, it's time to install the latest driver from NVIDIA. The Game Ready Driver will help deliver the best gaming experience for multiple titles and also adds support for several new features. DLSS 4, DLSS 4 Overrides, an improved NVIDIA Broadcast, and NVIDIA Smooth Motion all ship with the latest driver from NVIDIA. DLSS 4 with multi frame generation works with Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Star Wars Outlaws following once you install this driver. Even if you don't care about those specific features or games, you need to install the driver, since it is mandatory for an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 to work. Unlike the graphics cards that are very difficult to find in stock, the new NVIDIA driver is easy to locate. You can download the new Game Ready Driver from the NVIDIA app or through GeForce.com. NVIDIA shared a quick rundown of what ships with the latest driver, including its links to find out more about several features. NVIDIA app | Free at NVIDIA This app helps you get the most out of your NVIDIA-powered PC. It features overlays to record and enhance gameplay, tools to keep your system up to date, and ways to optimize your system for apps and games.  Establishing the worth of a graphics card is always a bit difficult since ultimately it comes down to a person's budget and what they value. The RTX 5090 is the best consumer graphics card on the market. It's more compact than the previous generation, supports new features like DLSS 4 with multi frame generation, and has other improvements such as a power cable that's less prone to melting. The card also has a, quite frankly, ridiculous 575W power draw that requires a 600W cable and a 1000W+ power supply unit. The RTX 5090 is overkill for most people as well, since few systems will push the GPU's limits. \"While NVIDIA's admirable efforts to redesign and slim down its flagship GeForce RTX graphics card have paid off with a performance bump comparable to its MSRP, it's still practically impossible to recommend the RTX 5090 FE to any levelheaded PC gamer,\" said Ben Wilson in our RTX 5090 review. \"Sure, it's technically the best in its category; this stands as the world's best consumer GPU, but the RTX 5080 remains a more sensible high-end pick for anyone who isn't in a professional field working with AI.\" The RTX 5080 is easier to recommend, assuming you have a budget of around $1,000 for a graphics card. \"In a pure numbers game, the RTX 5080 Founders Edition comes out as the new king of the hill for sane gamers, offering a reasonable high-end without needing to spring for the absurd $1,999 MSRP of an RTX 5090 FE,\" said Wilson in our RTX 5080 review. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The RTX 5080 is slimmer and lighter than previous generations and supports new tech like DLSS with multi frame generation. If you take advantage of all the features available to the RTX 5080, you should be able to enjoy smooth gameplay at 4K for the best PC games. The only caveat I'd add is that if you already have an RTX 4080 SUPER or RTX 4090, it's likely not worth the upgrade to the RTX 5080. With many gadgets, I'd just place a block and share some links to help you make a purchase. Unfortunately, buying an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 is more complicated than that. The launch of the new cards has been called \"the worst when it comes to availability.\" Wait times are expected to be at least three months for most people. I've seen some go as far as to call the release of the cards a \"paper launch,\" though that term does not have a firm definition. Regardless, if you're reading this in the first quarter of 2025, you probably do not have an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080. If you do want to buy one of the new cards, your best bet may be to purchase a pre-built PC with an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080.

Here\u2019s how it works.  In July 2025, Windows 10 will officially hit ten years old, and in October 2025, Windows 10 will also hit end-of-life status. Indeed, Microsoft typically only supports its Windows operating systems for \"free\" up to a certain point, with development work and security updates focusing on the more modern versions after a certain point. Microsoft's current policy grants Windows versions 5 years of broader support, and then an extended 5 years of security updates support. After that point, it expects consumers and businesses alike to begin upgrading to the latest version to maintain security updates. Businesses have the option to pay hefty fees to retain Windows security support for older versions, but the idea is that it should be more cost effective to simply upgrade at that point. RELATED: Everything you need to know about Windows 10's end of life Windows 10 has been a particularly \"sticky\" operating system for a variety of reasons. Anecdotally, consumers seem distrustful of the amount of telemetry and \"online\" features Windows 11 seems to foist on users, in-shell Windows ads notwithstanding. Additionally, Microsoft is requiring users upgrade their hardware in some cases to get Windows 11. Windows 11 has a TPM 2.0 requirement, which some motherboards simply don't support. There have been ways to get around Windows 11's TPM 2.0 requirement, but Microsoft isn't particularly supporting of these workarounds. Microsoft is actively enforcing the TPM 2.0 hardware requirement on Windows 11 installs, which it hopes will guide users to upgrade to new PCs through 2025. Their efforts may be working. The latest operating system share data just hit StatCounter.com, and it shows a pretty strong uptick for Windows 11, which has now hit 36.65% \u2014 the highest it has had thus far.  By comparison, Windows 10 continued its gradual decline, hitting 60.33%. The next most popular version of Windows remains Windows 7, which is hovering around 2.4%. Many large businesses which use embedded apps and services on older Windows versions often prefer to simply pay up for on-going security support, rather than update their internal networks. The UK national health service was notoriously still languishing on Windows XP for years, until finally upgrading to Windows 10 back in 2018. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. RELATED: How to prep your Windows 10 PC to upgrade to Windows 11 Microsoft and its PC manufacturer OEM partners are likely hoping that Windows 10's \"end of life\" status will spur users to upgrade to new modern PCs through the year. However, trade wars instigated by the United States government threaten to increase prices on electronics, with tariffs and restrictions targeting chip manufacturers and PC builders across Asia. It's entirely likely that Microsoft and PC OEMs may find itself in the midst of fresh road bumps as a result along the road to grow Windows 11's market share, as firms race to figure out exactly how best to mainstream much-hyped AI features with consumers. Although it's doubtless a smaller sample size, Valve's Steam Hardware Survey also has been updated for January, and interestingly shows Windows 11 actually losing a sliver of market share to MacOS and ...

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Hyundai has spied a design opportunity in India. That country, the world's most populous, is home to 1.46 billion people. But car ownership is extremely low\u2014just 6.7% of Indian households own automobiles. Instead, 75% of vehicles on the road in India have two wheels. For Indians who can't afford a car but need more than a two-wheeler, the three-wheeled auto-rickshaw is a popular choice. \"Roughly 8 million auto-rickshaws are on the roads across the country,\" wrote the ClimateWorks Foundation in 2020, \"and they are the main source of daily income for millions of drivers as well as a major mode of transportation across income groups.\"  These auto-rickshaws\u2014called tuk-tuks outside of India\u2014have dated designs that look decades old:   Hyundai asked their design team to develop something better. The result is this Electric Three-Wheeler Concept, designed specifically for conditions in India, from both manufacturing and UX standpoints.   Let's start with the UX. The vehicle has a flat floor and a wheelbase longer than typical in the category, to provide more legroom for the passengers and a better sitting position for the driver. The tires are larger than usual, better allowing them to deal with poor road conditions. There's a recovery hook, allowing the vehicle to be pulled if it gets stuck in a bad pothole. The Indian climate was also taken into account for the design. The vehicle can increase its ride height, allowing it to ford waterlogged streets during the monsoon season. While the interior materials haven't been settled upon, Hyundai says they're \"exploring water resistant materials.\" And the plan is for the roof to use a type of low-gloss paint that will allegedly reduce the interior temperature in sweltering Indian heat. The vehicle uses mostly flat panels, for ease of manufacturing, and would reportedly incorporate recycled plastic. The company says they're \"adopting a modular approach to ensure simple and practical manufacturing. The materials suggest a harmony between local sourcing and the potential for sustainability.\"   Hyundai's design team also produced the four-wheel concept you see above, but say that they're \"exploring global opportunities\" for that model rather than pitching it for India. Lastly, the company says they're in talks with TVS Motor Company, an Indian manufacturer of auto-rickshaws, about possible production.   it won't be as cheap or easy to fix as the original.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"The Nasdaq and other stock market indexes began Monday morning by dropping sharply in the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs, which are poised to kick in Tuesday. The market decline reversed somewhat in the afternoon after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced a pause on Trump\u2019s new import tariffs. In the late afternoon, the Dow fell by 0.02%. The S&P 500 lost 0.45%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 0.85%. Additionally, Bitcoin fell to $95,000 in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, reaching $100,000, as it has become increasingly reactive to President Trump\u2019s actions. The CBOE Volatility Index, a popular metric to judge the market\u2019s expectations for volatility over the next 30 days, was up 21%. Trump, citing the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl and undocumented immigrants into the U.S., on Saturday announced new taxes on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, the country\u2019s top trade partners. That includes 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and 10% on imports from China. All imports from Canada are set to be taxed at 25%, although energy imports will be taxed at a lower rate of 10%.  Canada responded by issuing 25% tariffs on $107 billion worth of U.S. goods, although just $20.4 billion would be taxed on Tuesday. The remainder of the tariffs would become active in 21 days.  Mexico said it will announce retaliatory tariffs but has not released additional details. Its tariffs will likely target food products, such as cheese, pork, and whiskey, along with manufactured steel and aluminum, Reuters reported last week. \u201cThese announcements have come as a shock to many investors who expected tariffs would only be imposed if trade negotiations failed,\u201d Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts said in a  note Sunday.  Goldman estimates that Trump\u2019s tariffs would reduce its S&P 500 earnings per share by roughly 1% to 2% for every 5-percentage-point increase in the tariff rate. Without taking into account any additional impacts, the investment bank estimates a 2% to 3% hit to the S&P 500 companies\u2019 earnings per share.  Between January and November 2024, trade with Canada came out to $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The U.S. imports $157.2 billion more worth of goods from Mexico than it exports, while its trade deficit with Canada is about $55 billion. China was the U.S.\u2019s third-biggest trade partner last year, with overall trade as of November totaling more than $532 billion and a trade deficit of $270 billion. Amid the ongoing crisis triggered by DeepSeek and the recent announcement of Trump\u2019s tariff plans, AI stocks are trending downward. On Monday morning, stocks of Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Microchip Technology (MCHP) were among the worst performers. Crypto stocks like Coinbase (COIN) and MicroStrategy (MSTR) were also down following Trump\u2019s announcement. Shares of major automakers plummeted on Monday following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. In the U.S., Tesla (TSLA), General Motors (GM), and Ford (F) saw significant declines. Among U.S.-listed companies, Japanese auto giants Toyota (TM) and Honda (HMC) also dropped sharply.  Today, Palantir (PLTR) will report its earnings after the closing bell. Known for its advanced AI-driven analytics, particularly in defense and intelligence, the company has gained prominence amid the ongoing AI boom.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Two of Nvidia\u2019s best graphics cards finally hit the market last week, but it was really more of a brief appearance. The RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080 are sold out pretty much everywhere, and if you\u2019re waiting for a chance to buy one, don\u2019t hold your breath. According to Overclockers, a UK retailer, the new Nvidia flagship may not be back in stock for up to 16 weeks. Overclockers, one of the biggest PC hardware stores in the UK, posted a stock update for the RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080. According to the retailer, both cards are sold out, and the store is also not accepting preorders anymore. The demand was so high that some people are in a preorder queue; those customers can either wait it out or cancel and get a refund. \u201cWe have no plans to take pre-orders for any 50 Series cards until we have greater clarity on availability and have fulfilled the pre-orders we have taken,\u201d says Overclockers UK. The worst part of it all is the estimated time for the RTX 50-series to be restocked. Overclockers estimates that the RTX 5090 should come back within three to 16 weeks, and the RTX 5080 \u2014 two to six weeks. On the lower end of that scale, it\u2019s not so bad for either card. But, in the worst-case scenario, people who want to buy Nvidia\u2019s new halo card may have to wait until the end of May. Considering the card launched in January, that\u2019s a pretty long delay. It\u2019s hard to say how long it\u2019ll take for U.S. retailers to get more RTX 5090s. The cards are all but gone from Amazon, Newegg, and other retailers. Newegg says that it\u2019ll \u201creplenish stocks as soon as possible,\u201d which could mean just about anything. The only place to get an RTX 5090 right now appears to be eBay, but that place is flooded with scams where people are selling .jpg files of the RTX 5090 for $2,000. If you want the actual GPU, you might have to pay up to $7,000. Meanwhile, the RTX 50-series launch in Japan resulted in chaos, including a broken kindergarten sign. Rumors about the limited availability of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series spread far and wide prior to the launch, but still, the harsh reality of high demand and low stock is only just starting to hit. The GPUs are sold out at all the major retailers, leaving many to wonder where to buy an RTX 5090 or an RTX 5080 today. The answer to that question is pretty much nowhere, unless you\u2019re willing to spend $2,600 on the one RTX 5080 that\u2019s currently available on Amazon, but you\u00a0really shouldn\u2019t. At this point, all we can do is wait. Nvidia's RTX 5090 is almost here, but the January 30 release date doesn't necessarily mean immediate availability on the shelves. So far, it seems like stock levels will be highly limited for a while, which prompts some retailers to get creative. One Japanese retailer is now hosting a lottery, and the prize is a ticket that allows you to spend $2,000 and more on Nvidia's best graphics card. Meanwhile, even MSI confirms that availability is going to be pretty scarce. The store, called \"Goodwill Nagoya Osu,\" said that it'll begin selling the RTX 5090 on January 31, but you can't just walk in and shell out some of your hard-earned cash on a GPU. You'll have to gamble and hope for the best. Sales begin at 11 a.m., but only those who are lined up outside the store at 10.20 a.m. will be given a ticket. This peculiar ad was spotted by VideoCardz. Tents are already starting to pop up outside of the Tustin, California Micro Center location in anticipation of the RTX 5090 release later this week. As you can read in our RTX 5090 review, it's undoubtedly the best graphics card you can buy, but the campers might not be in it for the frames. Photos of the campers were shared on the unofficial Micro Center subreddit (spotted by IGN), where two tents are currently set up outside of the Tustin location. Micro Center has discouraged eager customers from camping outside of its locations, though it shared a lengthy video about buying an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 on release day. In that video, Micro Center says \"we suggest coming early.\" Nvidia\u2019s upcoming GeForce RTX 5090 is expected to face limited availability from board partners, potentially leading to frustration for gamers eager to secure the flagship GPU. As per reports, the scarcity stems from Nvidia\u2019s tight pricing margins on the RTX 50-series, which have reportedly made it increasingly difficult for board partners to profit from custom GPU designs. According to VideoCardz, Nvidia\u2019s approach to maintaining aggressive profit margins is placing significant financial strain on its manufacturing partners. One anonymous board partner even described the MSRP pricing structure as feeling \u201clike charity,\u201d highlighting how little room there is for profitability despite the premium retail cost of Nvidia\u2019s flagship GPUs. This strategy, while beneficial for Nvidia\u2019s bottom line, is creating a challenging environment for partners producing custom RTX 50-series cards.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"President Donald Trump has begun a new trade war with Canada, Mexico, and potentially China, and this has had a significant ripple effect on the broader financial landscape, including the cryptocurrency market. Trump\u2019s latest move involves imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, while Chinese imports will be taxed at 10%.  While these tariffs are not expected to directly affect the cryptocurrency market, they have still contributed to broader market volatility. Over the past 24 hours, the entire cryptocurrency market has seen a sharp decline of more than 7%. Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has fallen below $95,000, reflecting a more than 5% drop. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been hit even harder, suffering a loss of over 17% in the same period, hovering just above $2,500. Other major cryptocurrencies such as Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano have experienced declines of 16%, 23%, and 24% in the past 24 hours, respectively. The downturn has extended to crypto stocks as well. Coinbase (COIN), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., saw its stock drop over 2.5% on Monday. Tesla (TSLA), the electric car company led by Elon Musk, which holds over 11,500 Bitcoins, saw a 4.7% decrease in value. MicroStrategy (MSTR), the business intelligence firm with the largest Bitcoin holdings among publicly traded companies\u2014444,462 BTC\u2014also saw a 1% dip in its stock price. Other cryptocurrency-related companies, including mining firms like MARA Holdings (MARA) and Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY), saw their stock prices fall by 3.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Despite cryptocurrencies not being directly impacted by the tariffs, the broader economic uncertainty and market instability have clearly shaken investor confidence, leading to a significant sell-off in both the crypto and traditional markets. This highlights two trends concerning the expanding cryptocurrency market:  Since Donald Trump declared himself a \u201ccrypto candidate\u201d in 2024 during his election campaign, the cryptocurrency industry has been closely monitoring his every move, paying close attention to his actions and statements. Now that he has assumed office, the crypto market has become highly sensitive to his decisions.  This became evident when Trump announced new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China\u2014an announcement that, despite having no direct impact on the crypto market, still sent cryptocurrencies into a sharp decline. The market\u2019s reaction underscores how even unrelated political moves can trigger significant volatility in the cryptocurrency space. Cryptocurrency is steadily becoming more mainstream, and with each passing day, its ties to the broader financial market grow stronger. Whenever there\u2019s a selloff in tech or AI stocks, the crypto market and crypto-related stocks are directly affected. This was evident recently when the DeepSeek-induced selloff of Nvidia impacted the whole crypto market. Additionally, macroeconomic factors continue to play a significant role in shaping the performance of the crypto market. For instance, the latest favorable inflation data led to a boost in Bitcoin\u2019s price above $100,000. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  In a rocky month filled with geopolitical tension and artificial intelligence breakthroughs, the biggest names in the $4.5 trillion hedge fund industry still made money.          Walleye, which runs $5.8 billion in its multistrategy fund, led the way with a 3.6% gain in January, a person close to the firm told Business Insider. Larger rivals like $22 billion Balyasny and $12 billion Schonfeld were also up in January, making 2.5% and 2.2%, respectively, people familiar with the managers told Business Insider.               January markets were choppy, thanks to President Donald Trump's trade and immigration policy plans and a breakthrough from Chinese artificial intelligence darling DeepSeek.               The S&P 500 finished the month up 2.7%, but there was a significant sell-off of big-name tech stocks like Nvidia in mid-January. The chipmaker is down more than 10% for the year after a blockbuster 2024, though other tech giants are up for the year, including Facebook parent Meta and Amazon.               Multistrategy funds, which have become LPs' favorite thanks to their ability to handle volatility, were mostly able to shrug off the tech sell-off and macro jitters. While ExodusPoint, Citadel, and Millennium didn't match the monthly returns of the market, the managers made 2%, 1.4%, and 0.5% in January, respectively, people close to the firms said.               At Ken Griffin's Citadel, the $65 billion manager's stockpickers had a strong start to the year. The firm's Tactical Trading strategy, which blends quant and fundamental equity portfolios, was up 2.7% for the month, according to a person close to the Miami-based firm.                More firms will be added as returns are learned. The managers declined to comment.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

My background in PC gaming comes from a celebrated story of being cheap in 2012 when I built my first PC. \u2022 Pricing & specs\u2022 Design and build quality\u2022 Gaming experience\u2022 Competition\u2022 Final thoughts It took about 6 months before I realized my HP mouse and keyboard were not going to cut it when it came to the original DayZ mod on Arma 2. Damn those free PC peripherals from my college computer facilities. From there, I stole from the pros. I used Logitech, Zowie, Razer, and whatever else became popular at the time. My lust for new gaming mice came to a screeching halt when I came across the first Logitech G Pro X Superlight. I had found my style of mouse. No longer would I be bound by the weight of 70 grams or more. I've been gaming and playing on PCs for 25 years. Since the turn of the millennium, I've seen and played with just about every type of mouse. I was a former pro competitor during the 360 era, and I test everything using my own setup and favorite games. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by NZXT. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.  \u2022 Price: $79.99 at Best Buy\u2022 Sensor: PixArtPAW339 optical sensor, 26,000 PDPI, 650 IPS, 50 g max acceleration\u2022 Switches: TTC Optical 60 gF switches, 0.2ms response time, 100 million click lifetime\u2022 Connectivity: Wireless up to 4,000Hz (dongle included), wired via USB Type-C up to 8,000Hz\u2022 Features: Five onboard DPI profiles, mouse grip tape in the box, up to 70 hours battery life (@ 1,000Hz)\u2022 Dimensions: 118.8 x 60.8 x 38.3mm (4.68 x 2.39 x 1.51in)\u2022 Weight: 57g (Black) \/ 57g (White) The NZXT Lift Elite marked a new milestone in my journey toward mouse perfection. Before, I thought the weight of 63g was fine; now, I'm not so sure. Coming in at $79.99, this 57g mouse altered my expectations of what a lightweight mouse could feel like. While I had heard of other mice dropping below the 60g mark, I never thought it would make much of a difference. Compared to the likes of the Razer Viper V3 Pro, which boasts a negligible weight of 54g, the price mark seems even better. At twice the price, the $159.99 mouse is only 3g less than that of the NZXT. For $79.99, you get an affordable mouse that matches some of those $100+ competitors in key areas, like 4k wireless polling rate alongside 8k wired. Maybe you'll be interested in the 26,000 DPI or the sub-1ms response time. Whatever your fancy, this NZXT mouse is looking to swim with the big brands. NZXT Lift Elite \u2014 White | BlackA fantastic mouse that holds its own against the competition. Coming in hot at a price point that beats the likes of Corsair, Steel Series, and Logitech with both lighter weight and better polling rates! \ud83d\udc49See at: Best Buy  At first glance, the NZXT Lift Elite seemed like it must be poorly built. How could a mouse of this size and weight not have some sort of build flaw? Surely something has to be wrong, right? Wrong. I'm pleased to report that the design is very sturdy and rigid despite the lack of a floor! When you turn the mouse over, you'll find the flooring mostly removed, replaced by a crossbar that reinforces the device from outward pressure. According to NZXT, the mouse is rigorously tested using approximately 11 lbs, or 50 Newtons of force, to ensure no deformation or cracking occurs under pressure. You have to make sure the removal of a subfloor doesn't let the house fall apart! Designed with a medium size in mind, the mouse comes in a small form factor that boasts sleek rubberized side grips with laser-etched texture. Provided in the box are two optional pieces of grip tape that can be applied to the right and left mouse buttons. I didn't find the need to use these, and the applied plastic coating is slightly coarse, so I'm already applying more grip than my current Logitech Superlight. The side buttons are overly sized to provide an easier-to-press experience. However, the side buttons are not swappable even with a symmetrical mouse shape. Instead, they are solely placed on the left side, with no left-handed version yet announced. I wasn't too thrilled about these buttons, as I accidentally hit them more often than not. This reminded me of the clumsiness I experienced when learning how to use my Azeron Cyborg, a device notorious for accidental clicking. In my 40 or so hours of use, I didn't quite reach the point where I had entirely negated that mistake.  I measured the issue by putting mouse one inputs on mouse four (That's the left click on the front thumb button). This meant that every time I clicked it, I did a main action by mistake, and in most instances, it gave away my position in either Counter-Strike 2 or Arma Reforger. Needless to say, I got myself killed a few times. The battery was also another slight sore spot for me. I mentioned before that I spent around 40 hours with the device, and I managed to run out of battery in the first 15 hours of use. NZXT claims that the mouse will last upwards of 70 hours on a single charge at a 1k polling rate. The price of speed, I guess. A quirk of their \"no floor\" design led me to notice some extra frictional noise emanating from the device while in use. Compared to my Superlight, which uses ESPTIGER mouse skates, I could hear the NZXT mouse moving across my NZXT Zone mousepad. I did a quick test using my phone to check the difference in noise level between the two. This sound was produced when going up and down only, which means there's a small amount of extra fiction, noticeable enough that a decibel meter could pick it up, coming into play. During use, I didn't notice anything at all in terms of performance. Only when I took a step back and carefully looked it over did this become an issue. This review was also performed on the NZXT Zone, not to be confused with the new Elite version. I chose the regular Zone initially as I wanted white to match the keyboard and mouse, and their Zone Elite only comes in black. The Zone serves as a slower mat, but one I wasn't incredibly impressed with compared to their Zone Elite. I would soundly recommend the Zone Elite as a mousepad to use alongside this mouse! NZXT Zone Elite Premium Gaming Mouse Pad - BlackA great mousepad that pairs well with the NZXT Lift Elite. You'll want a speedy\/soft pad like this one for the best possible precision. \ud83d\udc49See at: Best Buy  The NZXT Lift Elite works flawlessly once you've downloaded their CAM software. From there, it's as easy as installing and updating to the latest firmware, where you'll gain access to five onboard memory profiles, up to five different DPI settings, and multiple poll rate settings. It's a breeze to set up, which I was thankful for since there were no instructions included in the box! The Lift Elite felt like a true extension of my arm, the lightness causing it to disappear under my hand. Perhaps I've grown accustomed to the Superlight series, but this truly felt next level when it came to weight. When I tested the difference between 1k and 4k polling rate on my 240hz monitor, I could sense a disparity. It wasn't a placebo effect either, as I had my wife mindlessly adjust settings for me to see if I could tell the difference. I was surprised to find out I could, so I tested 4k to 8k rates. There, I found the limitations of my gaming powers, as I couldn't tell the difference between the two. I was thankful for this because the Lift Elite doesn't offer 8k polling when wireless, and I refuse to use a wired mouse with today's tech.  It's still a bummer, though, as the Razer Viper V3 Pro offers 8k polling while wireless for just $10 more, and that mouse has been on the market for over two years. Even at the cost of battery life, I'd rather see the ability to push my mouse wirelessly to a higher rate. Even if it's a placebo, I want my mouse to drive the latest speeds. However, when I looked at other mice in the same price range, the NZXT Elite is the only other mouse that offers 4k polling support. So, while Razer might have an edge (pun intended), NZXT is currently polling ahead of everyone else (pun intended). Getting in on at least 4K should be the bare minimum today for all competitive gamers, and the Lift Elite is currently the cheapest wireless variety on the market\u2014a sound plus for NZXT.The Lift Elite also features great macro support that's easy and super intuitive. I'd say it's even better than GHUB. On top of it, you can remap any button, and I mean any button. I could remap the on\/off switch underneath the mouse. I have no clue what I'd do with it, but hey, it's there!  I touched on this area briefly, but our main competitors in the market are Razer, Corsair, Logitech, and Steel Series. Name brands that I've been aware of for over a decade now are being tackled by a brand I first became aware of when I bought a 360mm cooler for my CPU. Now, they're taking on the giants of the market, and for the most part, they're winning. For example, let's look at the Logitech G X Pro Superlight, not to be confused with its brother, the Superlight 2. The original still retails for around $100 today, placing it ahead of the Lift Elite by $20. For that extra $20, you lose out on 4k polling, add five extra grams of weight, and have a slightly lower peak DPI. So why would you even consider the Superlight? NZXT is taking them to the cleaners here. This also holds true for other competitors, like the Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro and SteelSeries Aerox 5. The one mouse that still seems to be able to withstand this new-fangled device is the Razer Viper V3 Pro. With double the polling rate, it still weighs less than the Lift Elite. However, it has a slightly higher price point; pick your poison.  \u2705 You don't want to break the bank on a premium gaming mouse.For not too much, you get access to quality features that other mice in the price range simply don't have, like 8k polling rates, macros, and more. \u2705 Looking for a cheap, lightweight gaming mouse.Another great feature is it's lightweight. They've even managed a lighter mouse than Logitech's Superlight lineup. \u274c You want a something that lasts a long time without a charge.The battery doesn't last long. Its 1,000Hz polling rate charge data is the same as my five-year-old original Superlight. \u274c You're looking for a perfect high-end experience.The side buttons aren't my favorite, and I wasn't entirely pleased to feel any increase in friction if I paid more attention. I wasn't sure what to expect when it came to a premium, competitive gaming mouse scene. This Lift Elite seems to be their first step into the lands of more premium quality peripherals, and they've done quite well for themselves. For the price point, this mouse is pretty spectacular. It comes down to what you're looking for in your device. There's no RGB getting in the way here; it's a lightweight gaming mouse built to give the user the best chance of victory. What it will come down to is your personal preference. Do you want to spend a little more and go with the team that's been around for over a decade, or give the new guy a shot? I'm going to team NZXT on this one. Great job guys.   A fantastic mouse that holds its own against the competition. Coming in hot at a price point that beats the likes of Corsair, Steel Series, and Logitech with both lighter weight and better polling rates!

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Stock markets in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea fell as US prepares tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. Asian stock markets have dived over fears of a global trade war as the United States prepares to impose trade tariffs. Indices retreated in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea by about 2 percent as they opened on Monday, after US President Donald Trump confirmed he would impose sweeping tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. The mainland China market was shut for Lunar New Year holidays, but its currency, the yuan, dropped 0.4 percent to the dollar. The US tariffs, set to go into effect on Tuesday, impose a 25 percent tax on all imports from Canada \u2013 except for energy \u2013 and Mexico, as well as a 10 percent levy on goods from China.      Though widely expected, the dramatic trade move hailed by Trump threatens some of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers, who will likely have to contend with weakening demand from the world\u2019s top economy and a downturn in global growth. Automakers, many of whom have operations in Mexico from which they export to the US, were among the hardest hit. Toyota, the world\u2019s top automaker, and smaller rival Nissan fell more than 5 percent. South Korea\u2019s Kia Motors, which has a factory in Mexico, tumbled more than 7 percent. Shares of Taiwanese tech companies with factories in Mexico also fell, with Foxconn down 8 percent, Quanta down about 10 percent and Inventec down 8 percent. \u201cI don\u2019t believe market participants have fully grasped the extent of the potential fallout yet, especially as responses from affected countries unfold,\u201d said Tareck Horchani, head of prime brokerage dealing at Maybank Securities in Singapore. US markets are unlikely to be spared the pain. US stock futures fell more than 2 percent before the market opened Monday morning. And analysts warned of likely domestic price hikes on goods across the board. Canada, one of the US\u2019s top trading partners, announced its own tariffs on the US, with 25 percent taxes on up to $155bn in imports. Mexico also announced it would implement retaliatory tariffs. Trump, who defends tariffs as protecting local jobs and manufacturing, acknowledged on Sunday that the US may feel a \u201clittle pain\u201d in the \u201cshort term\u201d. However, in a post on social media, he said it would \u201call be worth the price\u201d. He also doubled down on his pledge to impose tariffs on the European Union, which he blames for not importing enough US products, telling reporters the tariffs are coming \u201cpretty soon\u201d. A spokesperson for the European Commission, alongside several officials from various member states, warned over the weekend that the bloc will retaliate in the event that the US introduces tariffs.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Prominent economists including Paul Krugman, Larry Summers, Steve Hanke and Robert Reich have been airing their views on President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.          Trump said the plan to impose 25% levies on tariffs on most goods entering the US from its northern and southern neighbors, and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, could cause \"some pain\" but would be \"worth the price.\"                They were due to take effect on Tuesday, but Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday they would be delayed by a month following a \"good conversation\" with Trump.       Krugman, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, said in a Substack post that tariffs threaten global faith in America.               \"And even if some of the tariffs prove temporary, the Rubicon has been crossed,\" he wrote. \"We now know that when the United States signs an agreement, on trade or anything else, the president will treat that agreement as a mere suggestion to be ignored whenever he feels like it. That revelation in itself will do huge long-term damage.\"               The former MIT and Princeton University professor also cautioned the modest slump in stocks on Monday might herald a steeper sell-off. \"This market complacency is a self-defeating prophecy: muted market reaction makes it likely that Trump will continue and expand his trade war,\" Krugman said.       Summers, a former US Treasury chief and Harvard University president, said on X the tariffs were \"inexplicable and dangerous.\"               They stand to raise the prices that Americans pay for many things including cars and gas, make US firms less competitive, stymie job creation, increase unemployment, and trigger retaliation from other countries that harms the US economy, he said.               They could also destabilize the Mexican economy, spurring more of its citizens to head for the US border, and lead to other countries viewing the US as a \"bad partner\" that's willing to \"arbitrarily impost tariffs as a form of hostage-taking for leverage,\" Summers said.               In a follow-up post, Summers said that \"bullying doesn't win over time on the playground or in the international arena.\" He said this \"self-inflicted supply shock\" was a gift to Chinese leader Xi Jinping and made China look relatively better to the rest of the world.               He added that price hikes could accelerate overall inflation and force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates instead of cutting them, curbing economic growth.       Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on X that research shows US consumers and businesses \u2014 not foreign exporters \u2014 pay virtually the entire cost of tariffs.               \"Tariffs = a hidden tax on Americans,\" wrote the former economic advisor to Ronald Reagan.               Hanke also dismissed the idea of a domestic jobs boom. \"The idea that tariffs will increase jobs is nonsense. Manufacturing output in the US is up, but manufacturing jobs have been declining for the last 40 years \u2014 tariffs or no tariffs.\"               He added that tariffs rob Americans of purchasing power.               Moreover, the president's tariffs threaten the entire North American economy and thus growth, inflation, and investor and business confidence across the world, Peel Hunt economists said in a research note.               \"Although the US appears strong, momentum is narrowly driven by fiscal excesses and consumer exuberance,\" senior economist Kallum Pickering and his team wrote. \"If tariffs lead to a spike in bond yields that, in turn, prick the US equity market bubble, the need for sudden fiscal discipline and a more cautious consumer could destabilise the upswing.\"               \"Whether it happens through inflation, higher interest rates, or increased future taxes to cover the deficit-financed tax cuts which Trump proposes to offset the import levies, US consumers will pay for tariffs,\" they added.       Reich, who advocated for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during his tenure as labor secretary, said on his Substack that Trump is using tariffs to demonstrate his power and unpredictability.               Reich said Trump's actions tend to be for his own benefit. He dishes out tax cuts and regulatory relief to US executives, and special treatment on trade, energy, and intelligence to foreign oligarchs, in exchange for lucrative business deals, information, campaign funds, and positive publicity, Reich said.               \"Trump says he's doing this for American workers,\" Reich wrote. \"Nothing could be farther from the truth. He's doing this for himself and for the world's oligarchy, which, in turn, is busily siphoning off the wealth of the world.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Donald Trump's tariff offensive has thrown the auto industry into chaos \u2014 and it could make your next car more expensive.          The president announced 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico and a 10% levy on China on Saturday, a move Jefferies analysts warned could add $2,700 to the average price of a new car in the US.               The import taxes sparked global market uncertainty on Monday after all three countries vowed to retaliate. Canada has already done so, saying it will put a 25% tariff on $30 billion of US goods.               While Trump said on Monday the introduction of tariffs on Mexico would be paused for a month, if implemented, they will significantly impact US carmakers.               Lured by low labor costs and cheap parts, automakers have built up their presence in Mexico over the past few decades. Detroit's \"big three\" of Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, as well as foreign powerhouses like Toyota and Nissan, all build vehicles in Mexico to import to the US market.               Even car companies that assemble their vehicles in the US, such as Tesla and Rivian, are likely to face higher costs thanks to the levies extending to vehicle and engine components.               In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts estimated that a 25% levy on goods imported from Canada and Mexico would add $43 billion to industry costs, with Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis being the most exposed.               Other estimates were equally dire. In a note seen by Business Insider, analysts for research firm Wolfe Research said the average price of a new car may climb by around $3,000.               Patrick Anderson, chief executive of consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, told The New York Times the tariffs could add $10,000 or more to the price of trucks and large vehicles imported from Mexico.               Auto executives have been bracing for the impact of Trump's tariffs ever since the Republican won the presidency for the second time in November.               In an earnings call last week, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said there was \"a lot of uncertainty\" around the taxes.               \"Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any will have an impact on our business and profitability,\" Taneja said.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Robotics startup Roboforce has raised $10 million in an early-stage funding round led by Nobel laureate economist Myron Scholes. Gary Rieschel, who previously spearheaded Softbank's U.S. venture capital group, and Carnegie Mellon University, the alma mater of Roboforce co-founders Leo Ma and Calvin Zhou, also participated in the round.          The Milpitas, Calif.-based startup, which launched in 2023, makes AI-powered robots that carry out manufacturing tasks. The company's robots use artificial intelligence to move themselves and perform duties that require fine motor skills, like screwing in nuts and bolts, with one millimeter of accuracy, Ma told Business Insider.               The robots are also capable of working on physical projects in tough outdoor conditions, like installing solar centers in deserts, he said. They are controlled by an AI model, developed in-house at Roboforce, and some human intervention, though the company intends for the robots to reach full autonomy.               The 15-person company will use the funding to double the size of its team, scale its robot development, and roll out pilot projects with early customers. Currently, Roboforce has a fleet of under ten robots and hopes to reach double digits this year. Veeral Hardev, who runs business development, said the robots will be leased to customers through a subscription model.               Ma previously co-founded and led engineering at Cyngn, an autonomous industrial vehicle company that went public in October 2021. \"Building AI robotics is all I do,\" Ma said. \"My heart is in building AI robotics.\"               Ma, whose parents work in manufacturing, has been interested in automating production since childhood. Over the past decade, he has visited over 200 factories to study industrial automation. \"The most tedious, demanding, repetitive, and dangerous work\u2014we really shouldn't have to have a human do it,\" Ma said.               Ma and Roboforce's co-founder and vice president of engineering, Calvin Zhou, met while they were studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon. Zhou previously worked at Cruise, a self-driving robotaxi subsidiary of General Motors.               A handful of other companies are also developing robots with human-like capabilities. Elon Musk unveiled his robot, Optimus, at Tesla's Robotaxi Day in October 2024. Figure, which raised a $70 million Series A in 2023, builds robots that can complete general tasks autonomously. And Sanctuary AI, another labor market-focused robot startup, is on the market for more funding, The Logic reported on Tuesday.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Traditional media companies that have launched stand-alone streaming services should pivot hard, TD Cowen analysts argued in a recent report.          The analysts say Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, and Paramount should return to the wholesale business rather than continuing to build direct-to-consumer products.               Their overall vision is a \"mega-streaming bundle\" distributed by Apple, Amazon, Google, or cable companies like Comcast.               \"Everyone's producing more content than they used to,\" Doug Creutz, a senior research analyst at TD Cowen, told Business Insider. \"Everyone's advertising for their content more than they used to, and consumer dollars haven't increased that much.\"               A bundle would help players spread the risks associated with content marketing and production. Creutz said he foresees a bundle happening in the next two to three years.               \"Bundling is the right way to go,\" Wedbush Securities managing director Michael Pachter told BI, similarly predicting a three-year timeframe. Pachter said a bundle would aid content discovery in a fragmented content landscape and make subscriptions stickier.               TD Cowen predicted that WBD and Disney would see single-digit DTC profitability in 2025 and that Paramount and Comcast would reduce their DTC losses.But Creutz said the picture isn't improving enough to make these DTC efforts the best path forward. He said Disney+ had already expanded into essentially all the markets it can \u2014 though its standalone ESPN product remains an open question \u2014 and Comcast and Paramount still aren't close to DTC profitability.               Creutz added that streaming services are trying to reach profitability by variously cutting spending, increasing ad loads, and raising prices.               \"You're heading to a place where the consumer experience is getting significantly worse,\" Creutz said.               The big player that doesn't need to bundle imminently is Netflix, which appears to be the clear winner of the streaming wars. (Apple and Amazon exist somewhat separately, Creutz added, given their streamers are tied to other business objectives.)               Netflix recently reached a larger market cap than Comcast, Disney, Paramount, Fox, and WBD combined, as media analyst Rich Greenfield noted.               A Netflix spokesperson pointed BI to its Q3 shareholder letter, which said the breadth of its content made bundling unnecessary \u2014 unlike for competitors.               That doesn't mean Netflix couldn't be impacted by a potential mega-bundle, however. Creutz said that while Netflix has a \"huge advantage\" competing against streamers individually, a mega-bundle \"could be an obstacle to their path to world domination.\"               And Pachter said bundling could be welcomed by Netflix if the streamer could dictate the terms.               Disney is another company that complicates the picture. Creutz said the Mouse House harbors ambitions of being the last man standing with Netflix, and if its stand-alone ESPN product succeeds, \"then I think their need for other people diminishes.\" Disney also offers its own in-house bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+.               That said, Disney has already shown a willingness to bundle with outside companies. It partnered with WBD on a service that includes Disney+, Hulu, and Max.               Creutz acknowledged that assembling a bundle would be difficult, likening it to \"herding cats.\" Other outstanding factors include David Ellison's plans at Paramount, and the speed of linear TV deterioration.               There could also be regulatory challenges. TD Cowen referred to recent developments at Venu as \"a step backwards,\" after ESPN, Fox, and WBD killed the sports streaming venture amid legal headwinds.               For his part, Pachter said he felt a bundle hadn't happened yet because of inertia.               \"Everybody's too inwardly focused and looking at the past,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"President Trump, as promised, set off a tariff war over the weekend, triggering an immediate response from some of America\u2019s closest allies. Under the new tariff policy imposing what are effectively new taxes on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China, it is expected that Americans will pay more for everyday goods like maple syrup and PC hardware. The tariff policy has received bipartisan backlash, with the likes of Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell coming out against the impositions. They have already been temporarily paused on Mexico while the two countries work out a deal. One positive, perhaps, is that Temu and SHEIN will have a harder time supplying teenagers with disposable garbage from China, some of which is believed to be manufactured by forced labor. Trump\u2019s executive order announced over the weekend imposes tariffs of 25% on goods shipped from Canada and Mexico, plus a 10% tariff on China, under the guise of various arguments, including that the countries have not spent enough on national security, such as stopping distribution of fentanyl. It also specifically ends the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption that allows packages shipped into the U.S. that are worth less than $800 to avoid tariffs. That exemption allowed discount Chinese retailers like Temu and SHEIN to ship directly to customers in the U.S. without paying many fees. Another point of contention over the years has been in the way the United States Postal Service has charged Chinese customers lower fees to deliver to the U.S. compared to what they charge domestic customers. Bizarrely, it is often cheaper to ship a package to the U.S. from China than it is to ship a package from one state to another. Both of these factors enabled Temu and SHEIN to compete against Amazon and explode in popularity by quickly identifying popular trends in America, rapidly spinning up the production of cheap knockoffs that they would heavily market through social media. These companies are essentially H&M or Forever 21 of yesteryear but on AI-powered steroids. According to eMarketer, Temu alone will sell $30 billion worth of products in the U.S. in 2025. TikTok and Amazon both have recently spun up competing budget stores in response to the rise of budget Chinese e-commerce. Walmart, which allows third-party merchants to sell on its website, has seen an influx of cheap products meant to mimic the likes of the Herm\u00c3\u00a8s Birkin at much lower prices. Regardless of the store, we\u2019re still mostly talking about products that come from China. Amazon could be negatively impacted by the new tariffs as well, since much of the product on its website is shipped to American warehouses from China, but at least it will be on more level playing field with Temu and SHEIN. Many of these products sold by Temu and SHEIN are, of course, cheap and disposable. The $3 earrings and $5 dresses found on SHEIN are often made out of cheap materials and are good for a few uses before they go in the trash. Sometimes they are even dangerous, as outlets have reported products from the sites including dangerous levels of lead. But these services enable teenagers to access the fashionable looks of their favorite influencers on a budget. Whatever people say about their concerns regarding the environment, ultimately consumers care about value over all else. Anyone old enough to remember Forever 21 will understand that we seem destined to go through this cycle with every new generation. Once people start to earn money, they realize a couple of quality pairs of clothing are better than twenty pairs of junk. Reuters reported last week that the European Union is planning to enact a new policy that would make Temu, SHEIN, and Amazon liable for dangerous or illegal products sold on their platforms. It is worth noting that even though these Chinese companies may be bad and worthy of scrutiny, President Trump\u2019s action to implement blanket tariffs risks being regressive, harming lower income Americans disproportionately by making everyday goods more expensive\u00e2\u0080\u0094because Americans will pay the tariffs, not the Chinese. Other, less harmful manufacturers will also be impacted, including clothing makers in America that import materials. Unfortunately, President Trump\u2019s closure of the de minimis loophole does not mean Temu and SHEIN are going anywhere. The two companies, particularly the former, have been reducing their reliance on the shipping loophole over the years, in part because they understood that operating through sneaky tricks is not sustainable, and also because under their current model of direct shipping, customers often have to wait up to 10 days to receive orders\u00e2\u0080\u0094something the two companies wanted to fix. TEMU now ships a lot of products in bulk to warehouses closer to the United States rather than sending them directly to customers, meaning the loophole was becoming less important. The companies will have to pay the new 10% tariff on those bulk shipments, however. Those skeptical the changes made by President Trump will have a big impact also say that Customs and Border Protection does not have the resources to inspect every package coming into the country, especially the often very small ones from the likes of Temu and SHEIN, to ensure compliance with duties. Which is all to say, they might be hampered somewhat by the new policy, but the flow of garbage is likely to continue.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Apple isn\u2019t the only big tech facing antitrust investigations as Google has also come under scrutiny for its dominant position in the market. Even the deal between Google and Apple over Safari\u2019s default search engine was considered a violation of antitrust laws, and a court has now ruled that Apple cannot intervene in the case. US District Court Judge Amit Mehta this week rejected an emergency request from Apple to suspend a trial that could profoundly change how Google Search works. As reported last week, Apple wanted to be involved in the case to defend its own interests as it considers that changes to Google Search would cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the company. However, according to the judge\u2019s ruling (via The Verge), Apple did not provide clear evidence of how it would suffer from such changes. \u201cBecause Apple has not satisfied the \u2018stringent requirements\u2019 for obtaining the \u2018extraordinary relief\u2019 of a stay pending appeal, its motion is denied,\u201d says the ruling. In any event, Apple (again) fails to provide any specifics. It does not explain why party status is necessary to offer the evidence it wishes to present, or even how that evidence will differ from what the court already heard during the liability phase. It likewise fails to identify any daylight between the remedy Google has proposed and its own preferred remedy. Lacking such information, the court cannot find that Apple will suffer the \u201ccertain and great\u201d harm required to justify a stay. Apple\u2019s move comes as no surprise. Even though it\u2019s not directly involved in the case, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be Safari\u2019s default search engine. It\u2019s estimated that Apple gets similar payments every year to keep the agreement. If Google is eventually forced to end the deal, Apple\u2019s services revenue would be heavily impacted. An antitrust lawsuit filed by the US Department of Justice against Google in 2020 accused the company of anti-competitive practices when it comes to its search engine and online ad platform. Judge Mehta ruled last year that Google is indeed a monopoly. Google is still appealing the ruling, but the company may end up being forced to split off some of its operations such as Android, Chrome, and Search. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"The billions of dollars invested by top AI labs are used to mitigate inference computing prices, not to train AI models.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Last month, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made headlines after unveiling its R1 V3-powered AI model. At a fraction of the development cost, this model surpasses OpenAI's proprietary o1 reasoning model across several benchmarks, including coding, math, and science. Consequently, the news caused a dramatic shift in the market, causing NVIDIA to lose up to $600 billion in market valuation in a single day. As a result, NVIDIA fell behind Microsoft and Apple as the third-most valuable company in the world. However, Meta's lead AI scientist, Yann Lecun, says there's a \"major misunderstanding\" about the billion dollars invested in AI and how the resources will be used. The executive claims that the money invested in US-based AI firms was dedicated to inference, not to train AI models. For context, inference is where AI models leverage their trained knowledge to new data. According to the scientist, the cost of inference will likely rise as AI models become more advanced: \"Once you put video understanding, reasoning, large-scale memory, and other capabilities in AI systems, inference costs are going to increase. So, the market reactions to DeepSeek are woefully unjustified.\" While speaking to Business Insider, Positron founder Thomas Sohmers shared Lecun's sentiments about the market's reaction to DeepSeek, indicating: \"Inference demand and the infrastructure spend for it is going to rise rapidly. Everyone looking at DeepSeek's training cost improvements and not seeing that is going to insanely drive inference demand, cost, and spend is missing the forest for the trees.\" All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. R1 is an open-source AI model, trained using $6 billion and the reinforcement learning technique. On Apple's App Store, the model dethroned ChatGPT as the most downloaded free AI app in the US. As such, DeepSeek will need to invest in inferencing as the model rapidly gains popularity and adoption to handle user requests. Related: Meta AI lead scientist claims \"open-source\" is the secret ingredient to DeepSeek's triumph Following DeepSeek's R1 launch, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella touted the model as super impressive, saying that AI developments from China should be taken very seriously. He further indicated that DeepSeek is good for business amid rising concern among investors over the company's spending on AI despite little profit returns. \"DeepSeek has some real innovations,\" Nadella added. \"When token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll be more apps written.\" Kevin Okemwa is a seasoned tech journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya with lots of experience covering the latest trends and developments in the industry at Windows Central.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"An eight-year-old boy who was killed in the Omagh bombing had been told by his mother that the Good Friday Agreement peace deal had brought an end to bomb attacks.  Oran Doherty from Buncrana, County Donegal, was one of several schoolchildren who died as a result of the Real IRA explosion in 1998. His family has been sharing their memories of him at a public inquiry into the attack.  In a written statement, Oran's mother Bernie said her family will never forgive the bombers. She said they had brought a large bomb into a crowded market town and so they knew \"exactly what could happen\".  The Real IRA bomb killed 29 people, including a woman who was pregnant with twins. The statement from Oran's mother was read out by his sister Lisa Dillon.  \"My family and I were so happy in April 1998 as the Good Friday Agreement had just been signed,\" it read.  \"Oran had asked me what the agreement meant and I told him it meant there would be no more shootings or bombings in the north. \"Four months later, Oran was blown up in the Omagh bomb.\" Oran had travelled to the County Tyrone town with his friends that day after a day trip to the Ulster American folk park.  His heartbroken family has kept a jar of his sweets from 1998. They said when he grew up, he wanted to play football for Celtic or be a shopkeeper. His mother's statement criticised the indiscriminate nature of the attack.  \"I have listened to and read all the excuses about the fact they didn't mean to get the bomb go off at the time and in the place, and they didn't expect anyone to be in the area at the time. \"I do not accept this and I never will. \"If you are prepared to transport a bomb of that magnitude into a crowded market town, then you know exactly what could happen. \"It was a despicable act inflicted upon people of all ages and from both sides of the political divide and all in the name of what?\" The Omagh bomb, which exploded on 15 August 1998, resulted in the biggest death toll from any one single incident during the Troubles.  After years of campaigning by relatives, this inquiry was set to up examine if the bombing could have been prevented by UK authorities. It has resumed for its second week and is continuing to hear from relatives as they give individual accounts of their loved ones and the impact of their loss.  On Monday the inquiry also heard from the family of one of Oran's friends, 12-year old Shaun McLaughlin, who was killed alongside him in the bomb. They said Shaun personified hope on the island of Ireland after the Good Friday Agreement. The schoolboy had presented a poem to the then Irish president, Mary McAleese, just months before the attack. Shaun's poem read: \"Orange and green, it doesn't matter, united now won't shatter our dream.\" The inquiry heard that the child was so badly disfigured in the explosion that his father could only identify him from his watch. A statement from Shaun's mother Patricia was read by his aunt Marjory McDaid. Patricia's statement described her son's funeral as a \"total farce\" with the family's grief overshadowed by the presence of too many politicians. \"They all even had reserved seats, but there was no reserved seats for the three families who were burying their children,\" the statement said.  \"My son was buried before I could even get near his grave.\" She also described the traumatic impact his death had on his younger brother and sister, saying they were left in \"complete pieces\". Patricia's statement went on to say the battle to find out what happened on the day of the bomb has been \"relentless\". \"I hope this inquiry will provide answers.\" The day's final inquiry witness was Ronan McGrory, who was best friends with Shaun McLaughlin. He was badly injured in the bombing \u2013 he was 14 at the time. He found out about the deaths of Shaun and Oran on the TV news a few days later, while recovering in hospital. He said he was overcome with guilt because he was responsible for looking after them. \"Every day I think about the bomb and it never leaves me,\" he said. \"I dearly miss my friend Shaun and I resent the fact his life was taken from him too soon.\" The inquiry also heard that a Sunday school teacher was on the \"brink of a new life\" when she was killed. Esther Gibson, 36, was engaged to be married when she was fatally wounded. Photos of her growing up were shown at the inquiry and a statement was read on behalf of her family. The statement described Ms Gibson, who was shopping on the day of the attack, as a devoted Christian. \"She was a young woman with much to look forward to,\" her family said. \"Her faith was strong and she was preparing to embark on a new chapter of her life with her fianc\u00e9.  \"Esther's murder cut short a life that was rich in kindness, love and promise.\" The inquiry resumes on Tuesday. Meanwhile the father of one of victims of the bomb has said an \"important discussion\" on an inquiry in the Republic of Ireland should wait until after the current hearings.  Michael Gallagher told Good Morning Ulster that conversation should be parked until \"we get these memorial hearings over\". It comes after former Irish government minister Charlie Flanagan said Ireland should have established its own parallel inquiry. He said he was concerned vital evidence may not be seen by the Northern Ireland inquiry. It cannot compel anyone from outside the UK to give evidence, such as current or former members of An Garda Sioch\u00e1na (Irish police). The Irish government has promised to help and pledged that, if needed, it will pass legislation to address co-operation.  Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she agreed with Mr Flanagan as there was an issue over compelling people to give evidence. Stormont Justice Minister Naomi Long told Good Morning Ulster she would be supportive of the Irish government \"taking forward an inquiry\". However she had concerns that two parallel inquiries may mean people having to give evidence more than once and \"may mean people having to be retraumatised\".  The bomb exploded in Omagh town centre on a busy Saturday afternoon on 15 August 1998. The attack took place four months after the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The RIRA - a dissident republican paramilitary group - disagreed with the Provisional IRA's decision to call a ceasefire ahead of the talks and continued to plant car bombs in towns across Northern Ireland. But the Omagh bomb was by far the RIRA's most deadly attack. In addition to the dead, more than 200 other people were wounded, some of whom survived with life-changing injuries. Three days after the 1998 attack, the Real IRA released a statement claiming responsibility for the explosion. It apologised to \"civilian\" victims and said its targets had been commercial. Almost 27 years on, no-one has been convicted of carrying out the murders by a criminal court. In 2009, the judge in that case ruled four of the men - Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were all liable for the Omagh bomb. The four men were ordered to pay a total of \u00a31.6m in damages to the relatives, but appeals against the ruling delayed the compensation process. A fifth man, Seamus McKenna, was acquitted in the civil action and later died in a roofing accident in 2013. Two 19-year-old men appear at Lisburn Magistrates' Court charged over an attack on Friday morning. The 31 year old's sister describes him as \"everybody's friend\" as police launch a murder investigation. A man in his 40s has sustained injuries to his upper body and a serious laceration to his foot.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"The U.S. stock market sold off Monday morning as Wall Street digested President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canadian, Chinese and Mexican goods set to go into effect Tuesday, before recovering some after Trump announced the Mexican levies won\u2019t start for at least a month. Stocks slumped Monday in response to Trump's impending tariffs. Broad indexes tumbled Monday morning, as the benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.5% by mid morning, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1%, or 470 points, and the tech-concentrated Nasdaq dipped 1.9%. Once Trump confirmed the Mexico tariffs would be delayed a month, markets bounced back some, with the Dow closing down just 0.3%, the S&P 0.8% and the Nasdaq 1.2%. After more than 90% of the S&P\u2019s 500 constituents were negative early Monday, less than 60% were down by late morning, and the companies hardest hit by the tariff slide largely fell into four buckets: alcoholic beverage purveyors, automakers, multinational technology firms with heavy China exposure and cryptocurrency-focused companies. Shares of Constellation Brands (-4%), which controls the U.S. distribution for Mexican beers Corona and Modelo, tanked to their lowest level since October 2020, though the stock had dropped as much as 8% earlier. American car companies, an industry heavily reliant on Canadian and Mexican imports, also flailed, with car stocks declining across the board, including Ford (-2%), General Motors (-3%), Jeep parent Stellantis (-4%) and Elon Musk-led Tesla (-5%), though losses were much thinner than they were earlier, when Ford and Tesla traded down 5% and 7%, respectively. Tesla was particularly battered as it joined Apple (-3%) and Nvidia (-3%), as American multinational companies with the highest proportion of sales in China. Crypto-heavy stocks pared back a stark morning drop as crypto prices recovere from their weekend dive as shares of leveraged bitcoin whale MicroStrategy turned what was an 8% loss to a nearly 4% gain, while exchanges Coinbase (-2%) and RobinHood (down less than 1%) and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (-2%) stayed red. About 5%. That\u2019s how much of a hit the S&P\u2019s fair-value price would take, Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a late Sunday note to clients. Goldman estimates a 2% to 3% total hit to corporate earnings directly from the tariffs and a further ding as policy uncertainty causes the market to reassess the historically lofty price-to-earnings ratios now enjoyed by American stocks. Digital asset prices have tanked in recent days, with bitcoin down 5% since Friday to about $99,000, while the next most valuable crypto tokens, ethereum network\u2019s ether and Ripple\u2019s XRP, are down more than 10% apiece since Friday. The selloff has wiped off nearly $300 billion in market value for crypto since Friday, according to CoinGecko, as the global crypto market fell to its lowest level since mid-November at $3.37 trillion. The crypto correction came as investors largely fled riskier assets and the dollar strengthened, a negative for bitcoin as it tends to weaken when the dollar shows its weight as the de facto global reserve currency. Should the tariff-inspired losses continue, it\u2019ll be the second consecutive brutal start to the week for U.S. equities. The S&P and Nasdaq fell 1.5% and 3.1%, respectively, last Monday as the market reacted to the release of a comparatively cheaply developed artificial intelligence model from China\u2019s DeepSeek. Nvidia also led those losses, falling 17% and losing a record $590 billion in market value. The American AI leader Nvidia fell to its lowest intraday share price since early September this Monday. Stocks recovered some of their DeepSeek losses last week, as the S&P rose 0.5% and the Nasdaq 1.5% from Tuesday to Friday, before falling further Monday. How Wall Street reacts as the trade conflict progresses. \u201cThe equity market had been leaning toward a gradual\/measured approach on China and tariffs on Mexico\/Canada that either wouldn't be imposed or would be very short-lived,\u201d according to Morgan Stanley chief equity strategist Michael Wilson, who predicted the \u201cmarket's previous baseline view is likely to be tested the longer these tariffs stay on.\u201d \u201cThe fundamental concern raised by the latest announcements is that tariff policy applied towards achieving non-economic objectives may broaden and tilt the US policy mix into a far less business-friendly stance,\u201d Bruce Kasman, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s global head of economic research, wrote Monday, signaling the broader Wall Street agita that Trump may pursue further actions unpopular among growth and bottom line-focused investors.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"By: Becky Little Updated: February 3, 2025  | Original: March 5, 2018 President Donald Trump has argued\u00a0that \u201ctrade wars are good and easy to win.\u201d But many economists have disagreed that raising tariffs sharply can improve the economy.\u00a0In particular, experts have pointed to the failure of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, passed in June 1930, to protect U.S. industries from tariff increases. Although this came several months after the stock market crash of 1929, the U.S. hadn\u2019t yet entered \u201cthe full onset of the Great Depression,\u201d says Claude Barfield, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The thinking among Congress and President Herbert Hoover was that by raising taxes on thousands of imports no matter what country they came from, the act would protect American farmers and secure the nation\u2019s economy. But experts disagreed. \u201cEconomists around the country argued to the Republican Congress that this would only hurt the world economy, and the United States economy,\u201d Barfield says. (Before the political parties realigned in the mid-20th century, the Democrats were the \u201cfree trade\u201d party.) And they were right. Although it did not cause the onset of the Great Depression, it did help extend it. After President Hoover signed the bill into law, stocks dropped to 140. Other countries responded to the United States tariffs by putting up their restrictions on international trade, which just made it harder for the United States to pull itself out of its depression.\u00a0Imports became largely unaffordable and people who had lost their jobs could only afford to buy domestic products.\u00a0Global trade tanked 65 percent. In effect, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act \u201cprolonged [the depression] and possibly deepened it around the world, not just in the United States but for other countries,\u201d he says. Ultimately, this influenced the country\u2019s long-term trade policies. Beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, and continuing with other acts throughout the century, the United States began to negotiate trade policies individually with countries, instead of imposing unilateral tariffs across the board. America used relief from tariffs as a bargaining chip. \u201cWhat we would do was to say to a country, \u2018If you lower your tariffs on such and such, we will lower our tariffs,\u2019\u201d Barfield says. \u201cSo you had then a whole group of reciprocity agreements negotiated in between 1935 and 1941.\u201d The premise was that negotiating deals with other countries to reduce tariffs promotes economic growth.\u00a0Since 1945, both Republican and Democratic presidents have mostly sought to lower trade barriers and negotiate reciprocity agreements. Those efforts have been reflected in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u00a0 The Great Depression was the worst economic downturn in the history of the industrialized world, lasting from 1929 to 1939. By 1929, a perfect storm of unlucky factors led to the start of the worst economic downturn in U.S. history. Were financial institutions victims\u2014or culprits?

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly. The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs. Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\" The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\". One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America. He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\". The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\" So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America. The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data. But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn. How can both be true? The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade. One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures. Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods. But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out. In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade. If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures. Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn. While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them. There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries. Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects. If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive. \"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025. Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers. Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets. One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen. \"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop. \"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\" Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules. Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? The White House said South Africa's new law amounts to race-based discrimination.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Sir Keir Starmer is heading to Brussels to join a gathering of European Union leaders \u2013 the first time a British prime minister has done so since Brexit. Starmer is heading over the English Channel for talks focused on defence and security co-operation and will also meet Nato secretary general Mark Rutte. The trip is part of what he calls a \"reset\" between the UK and the European Union. The government has promised the UK will not re-join the EU's single market or customs union, or sign up to freedom of movement. But ministers do want what they see as a better relationship on defence and security, crime and trade. They hope to sort this out by the spring and finalise it at a UK-EU summit, possibly in April or May. Leaders of the European Union's 27 member states are gathering for what is described as an \"informal retreat\" at the Palais d'Egmont in Brussels - a 16th century palace in heart of the Belgian capital. The backdrop is clear: the ongoing war in Ukraine and the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The EU acknowledges it needs to take greater responsibility for its own defence \u2013 a key and recurring demand of President Trump, as he threatens the bloc with import taxes or tariffs. The prime minister said: \"President Trump has threatened more sanctions on Russia and it's clear that's got Putin rattled. We know that he's worried about the state of the Russian economy. \"I'm here to work with our European partners on keeping up the pressure, targeting the energy revenues and the companies supplying his missile factories to crush Putin's war machine. \"Because ultimately, alongside our military support, that is what will bring peace closer.\" But Trump's cryptic, threatening and yet tantalising comments overnight on trade with the UK, where he said Britain was \"out of line\" on trade things \"can be worked out\", neatly illustrate a dilemma Whitehall's been conscious of ever since the president's re-election. If the UK shimmies towards Brussels that will likely tread on Washington's toes; overdo the overtures in the Oval Office and the EU will be miffed. After Monday's visit to Brussels, the prime minister is expected in the US in the next few weeks. The UK is also exploring closer ties with the EU on dealing with serious and organised crime, and, crucially, trade. Allowing food and animal products to be traded more freely is being discussed, as is cooperation on energy with a possible tie-up between the UK and the EU's emission trading schemes. The mutual recognition of professional qualifications and allowing touring musicians to travel more easily are also themes of interest. Plenty in the EU are keen on a youth mobility scheme allowing young people from the UK and the EU to travel much more easily. But such a scheme will sound to some rather like freedom of movement, albeit for a narrow chunk of the population and so may be a hard sell for the UK politically. It is also likely, given the respective sizes of the EU and the UK, that more young people from the EU would come to the UK than vice versa. Ministers have rejected the idea so far. The EU has also floated the UK joining what is known as the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention. The Convention isn't quite a customs union but removes customs on the components that go into a product that are sourced from the other countries signed up to it. Notably, the UK has not ruled out signing up to this and it is not seen by the government as a breach of its red lines. Some sectors, such as the car industry, with its 'just in time' supply chains, would likely welcome such a move but other manufacturers would be exposed to greater competition. Leading the technical negotiations for the UK is Michael Ellam, who worked in Downing Street when Gordon Brown was prime minister. Ellam has been tasked with managing what is known as the \"EU Relations Secretariat\" within the Cabinet Office, which the prime minister set up shortly after the general election to lead on his planned \"reset\" with the EU. As the negotiations continue, Starmer knows he faces political pressure from both sides of the argument. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed \"the Labour government are trying to reopen the divisions of the past and edge us back into the EU\". Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said the government should be negotiating to re-join the customs union.

But then NVIDIA launched the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, and it all went horribly wrong. It won't be getting better anytime soon, either, at least not if the words of one of the UK's top retailers for this type of product are anything to go by. Online stock for the two graphics cards went almost instantly. There were tragically hilarious reports from folks lining up at physical stores to be met with signs saying there were only FOUR RTX 5090s in stock. Now, Overclockers UK (via Tom's Hardware) has delivered the bleak news. RTX 50 Series Stock Update 31\/01\/2025Stock UpdateRTX 5090 sold out and pre-orders ceasedRTX 5080 sold out and pre-orders ceasedDue to incredibly high demand and limited stock, all 50 Series cards sold shortly after launch with some pre-orders taken in restricted quantities.\u2026January 31, 2025 The short version is that it could be as long as 16 weeks before RTX 5090 stock is replenished, and up to 6 weeks for the RTX 5080. Pre-orders already placed but not fulfilled are now in a queue, and no further pre-orders will be taken until existing ones have been fulfilled and there is better clarity on availability of these things. Granted, 3\u201316 weeks is a big window, but besides the potential bleakness, it also shows how incredibly uncertain the whole situation is. This launch has been nothing but a disaster, and I have to question why NVIDIA went through with it at all?  Who benefits? NVIDIA hasn't made many of these GPUs so it's not like Jensen Huang will be doing his best Scrooge McDuck impersonation. Is it that old friend \"being first\" or just plain arrogance and disregard for the consumers? It's disgraceful, really, that crypto mining scalpers are no longer our enemy, and still it's so atrocious.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Semi truck approaching a border ahead highway sign. Composite image. Updated, Feb. 3, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the timeline on when the tariffs will go into effect in each country. The next few months will offer a clear test of who is right about President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies in the wake of his announcement of higher tariffs for Mexico, Canada and China. CNN reports that in order to put the tariffs in place, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which authorizes a president to manage imports during a national emergency. The emergency that Trump cited in his social platform was \u201cthe major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\u201d Investors have been supportive of Trump\u2019s policies of tax cuts and deregulation thus far, and many are hopeful they will usher in \u201ca golden age of America\u201d as Trump noted in his inaugural address. But sentiment could shift decidedly if Trump\u2019s tariffs are maintained and spread to other countries. Economists Phil Gramm and Larry Summers warn in a Wall Street Journal commentary that a trade conflict could disrupt the global economy. They flat out reject the claim that the implementation of broad-based tariffs will reverse the hollowing out of American manufacturing and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. They conclude: \u201cWe are united in our belief that broad-based tariffs will impede economic growth, risk triggering a trade war, and inflicting long-term harm on the economy.\u201d Prior to last week, many investors clung to the view that Trump\u2019s threats to raise tariffs were part of a bargaining strategy to extract concessions from America\u2019s trading partners. However, Trump followed through with his pledge to boost tariffs on Mexico and Canada by 25% and on China by 10% with few limits. A Financial Times article quoted Trump as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not a negotiating tool. It\u2019s pure economic. We have big deficits, as you know, with all three of them.\u201d This reflects Trump\u2019s view that international trade is a zero-sum game. The winners are countries with trade surpluses, while the losers run trade deficits. He sees tariffs as a way to level the playing field and reduce the size of U.S. trade imbalances. As shown in the table below, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit has increased from nearly $800 billion when Trump became president in 2017 to a record $1.2 trillion last year. While the bilateral trade deficit with China narrowed by about $100 billion over that period due to tariffs imposed in Trump\u2019s first term, it has been more than offset by increased deficits with Mexico, Canada, the European Union and other countries such as Vietnam. US Merchandise Trade Deficit Note: Bilateral trade imbalances are as of November 2024. This is what Trump appears to be trying to stop. Bloomberg reports that Trump also said he would impose tariffs on a wide range of imports in coming months, and he indicated the U.S. would \u201cbe doing something very substantial\u201d with tariffs targeting the European Union. Imports from Mexico, Canada, China and the EU represent about 60% of total U.S. imports. The Economist states that the tariffs announced on Saturday should erase any doubts about Trump\u2019s resolve to take a hard line on trade, while ignoring warnings from businesses, diplomats and economists about the potential fallout. They are more sweeping than Trump\u2019s tariffs on China in his first term that applied to about $370 billion of imports and are estimated to cover roughly $900 billion of imports from Mexico and Canada. Trump sees both Canada and Mexico in weak bargaining positions because the vast majority of their exports are to the United States. One concession Trump was willing to make was to announce a lower tariff on Canadian crude oil and electricity of 10% instead of 25%. The primary reason is that the Midwest and several other regions import a large amount of their energy from Canada. In the case of Mexico an agreement was reached on Monday to delay implementation of tariffs for a month, as Mexico said it would immediately supply 10,000 National Guard troops to police its border with the U.S. Trump acknowledged Americans could temporarily feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the tariffs. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates the tariffs announced on Saturday would result in an average tax increase of $830 per U.S. household in 2025. The items that will be impacted the most include autos, agricultural products, energy and lumber. Goldman Sachs economists estimate that if sustained, the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would increase U.S. core prices by 0.7% while GDP would be hit by 0.4%. Goldman\u2019s equity researchers estimate that every 5-percentage point increase in the U.S. tariff rate would reduce S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1% to 2%. The actions announced on Saturday are estimated to increase the effective U.S. tariff rate by 7 percentage points, and it is likely to climb further as tariffs are announced on other countries. The backlash over Trump\u2019s tariff pronouncements is just beginning. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Editorial Board did not mince words, labeling the actions against U.S. allies \u201cThe Dumbest Trade War in History.\u201d The WSJ editorial depicts how interdependent trade has become in North America, and especially in auto production, since NAFTA was launched in 1994 and then supplanted by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in mid-2020. The Journal points out that the U.S. willingness to ignore its treaty obligations, even with friends, won\u2019t make other countries eager to do future deals. Meanwhile, Canada, Mexico and China are prepared to retaliate even though Trump\u2019s orders include clauses that will increase U.S. tariffs if they respond in kind. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately announced reciprocal tariffs of 25% on U.S. goods totaling more than $100 billion, while Mexico\u2019s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, promised new levies before the agreement was reached on a one month delay. Both China and the EU will be watching what happens very closely as they map out their own strategies. So, what should investors do when faced with these prospects? In a previous commentary, I noted that financial market volatility increased when Trump launched a trade war with China in his first term. The announcements this weekend suggest he is prepared go much further and is willing to risk a global trade war. The main thing that could stop him would be a stock market selloff, which could cause investors to hedge some of their equity exposure.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":" Samsung\u2019s innovation in the foldable smartphone market continues to generate buzz, with rumors swirling around two anticipated devices: the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the tri-fold Galaxy G Fold. Both models aim to push the boundaries of mobile technology, offering unique features and designs that cater to different user preferences. Designer: Samsung Before we get to the tri-folds, here\u2019s a brief update on the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold7. The device is expected to build upon the foundation laid by its predecessors, introducing subtle yet meaningful enhancements. Reports suggest that the device will maintain a similar design to the Z Fold6, with a focus on refining existing features rather than overhauling the design. This approach indicates Samsung\u2019s commitment to perfecting the foldable experience. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 Special Edition Under the hood, the Z Fold7 is rumored to be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, promising improved performance and efficiency. Additionally, it is expected to feature an upgraded speaker system, potentially offering better audio quality for media consumption. Storage options are expected to remain consistent, with configurations of 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB, all paired with 12GB of RAM. While these specifications mirror those of the Z Fold6, the upgraded processor could offer a noticeable boost in daily operations.  In terms of display, the Z Fold7 may feature an 8-inch main screen, slightly larger than its predecessor\u2019s 7.6-inch display. This screen will borrow improvements from the Special Edition variant for better screen clarity and usability. The cover display is also expected to see an increase, potentially reaching 6.5 inches. These adjustments aim to enhance the user experience, providing more screen real estate for multitasking and media consumption. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 Special Edition Pricing for the Z Fold7 is anticipated to remain in line with previous models, starting at around $1,899. However, some reports suggest a potential increase due to rising component costs. The official unveiling is expected during Samsung\u2019s mid-2025 Unpacked event, typically held in July or August. Samsung\u2019s foray into tri-fold technology is embodied in the rumored Galaxy G Fold. This device is expected to feature a unique G-shaped folding mechanism, allowing the smartphone to fold inward from both sides. When fully unfolded, the G Fold could offer a display nearing 10 inches, providing a tablet-like experience in a pocketable form factor.  The G-shaped design aims to protect the internal display by keeping it enclosed when folded, potentially enhancing durability. This inward-folding approach contrasts with other designs that leave parts of the screen exposed, thereby reducing the risk of scratches and damage. While detailed specifications remain scarce, the G Fold is expected to compete directly with devices like Huawei\u2019s Mate XT, which also explores tri-fold technology. Pricing is anticipated to be premium, possibly exceeding $2,000, reflecting its advanced design and capabilities. A limited production run of around 200,000 units is speculated, indicating Samsung\u2019s cautious approach to this new form factor. The Huawei Mate XT tri-fold is ready to enter the global market as it has cleared the TDRA certification. The device has appeared on the UAE\u2019s database, suggesting that Huawei may soon introduce the foldable for global consumers. Originally launched in September 2024, the Mate XT sparked speculations about a wider release, and recent rumors claim that it could debut globally in the first quarter of 2025.  Designer: Huawei The Mate XT has received the UAE-based TDRA certification, which is a necessary step for telecommunication devices to be sold in the region. The listing shows that the device carries the model number GRL-LX9, with its registration valid until January 30, 2025. This certification strongly hints at an impending international launch. Mate XT features three display panels, each boasting a 90Hz refresh rate, 1440Hz high-frequency PWM dimming, 240Hz maximum touch response, and a P3 wide color gamut. The display configurations include:  The device is powered by Huawei\u2019s Kirin 9010 chipset and a 5600mAh battery, supporting 66W fast charging, 5W wired reverse charging, 50W wireless charging, and 7.5W wireless reverse charging. The Mate XT also includes a triple-camera setup with a 50MP main shooter, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP periscope sensor with 5.5x optical zoom. The 8MP front-facing camera supports various shooting modes for both photo and video content. Several distinctions emerge when comparing the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy G Fold, and Huawei Mate XT. The Z Fold7 continues the traditional book-like fold, offering a balance between smartphone portability and expanded screen space. Its design refinements and hardware upgrades aim to enhance the user experience without drastic changes. Samsung Galaxy Ring and Fold6 The G Fold\u2019s tri-fold mechanism represents a more radical innovation, targeting users seeking maximum screen real estate in a mobile device. The G-shaped fold not only increases display size but also prioritizes screen protection by folding inward. Meanwhile, the Mate XT challenges Samsung\u2019s tri-fold entry with its own unique approach. With a global launch on the horizon, Huawei\u2019s take on the tri-fold format will soon become available to a wider audience, possibly increasing competition in this emerging segment. As Samsung and Huawei explore these diverse foldable designs, we invite readers to share their thoughts. Does the refined approach of the Galaxy Z Fold7 appeal to your sense of familiarity and incremental improvement? Or does the ambitious design of the Galaxy G Fold\u2019s tri-fold mechanism capture your imagination? Perhaps the Huawei Mate XT, with its imminent global release, is the device to watch.

Instead, I've picked up a few simple, cheap longevity habits.               Hearing researchers, doctors, and nutritionists lay out their arguments for why certain activities, foods, and pills were good for my long-term health, I eventually incorporated a few research-backed changes into my routine.               Here are my seven favorite daily longevity tips.               Nuts and seeds are great sources of protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and \"healthy\" fats. In short, it's all the good stuff that our ultra-processed diets often lack.               At home, I regularly stock different nuts and seeds. I keep a bag of ground flaxseed in the freezer to sprinkle over yogurt, oatmeal, and salads. I also ensure I have chia seeds \u2014 a staple for the breakfast balls I often prep in the summertime. And I like having pumpkin seeds around for a midday snack or sprinkled into dinner.               There's one kind of nut in my cupboard that deserves a special shoutout: the walnut.               Walnuts have the highest omega-3 concentration of any nut, which is a big reason Loma Linda cardiologist Gary Fraser puts them on his morning cereal, and why leading nut nutrition expert Joan Sabat puts them in his daily longevity smoothie. I enjoy walnuts in Greek yogurt or on a lunchtime salad.       Green leaves are rich in nutrients like magnesium, iron, and nitrogen, and they help with digestion and gut health. Greens have also consistently been linked to better long-term brain health and cognition.               Dr. Dean Sherzai, half of the husband-and-wife team known as \"The Brain Docs,\" says if you want to pick out one thing to improve your longevity, \"just add green.\"               Sherzai recommends getting two servings of greens into your diet a day. When I'm doing my grocery shopping, I always add a bag of greens to the haul, whether it's arugula, spinach, or a spring mix.               I've become one of those people who track their sleep and try to improve their sleep \"hygiene\" accordingly.               It started in 2024 when I attended a longevity conference in Singapore. It seemed like everyone there was tracking somethingwith a smartwatch or ring. The experts doing some of the most cutting-edge research on how to help people stay fit and sharp into old age were tracking the quality of their sleep.               After a few weeks of using my own smart ring, I started to appreciate the daily insights.               The ring notices, for example, when I drink a beer right before bedtime. That's when my REM sleep (the memory-storing kind) decreases and my nighttime temperature goes up.               Sleep tracking has encouraged me to drink more herbal tea before bed, take more baths in the evenings, and be gentler to myself when I'm premenstrual. All of these changes have added up to slightly better daily sleep scores, as the quality of my sleep has trended upward.               Any longevity expert worth their salt will tell you the best longevity treatment we have right now is exercise. Some of the most promising research into longevity drugs aims to mimic the many positive effects of exercise.               I used to only do half of the job, though. I loved cardio training and hated weightlifting. My wake-up call came when I suffered a stress fracture from running too hard, too fast, without prioritizing cross-training.       Building muscle through strength training as we age is good for bone health, pain management, and fat burning. In recent years, I've started adding more squats, lunges, and deadlifts into my routine. These are not just helping me get stronger, they're also improving mobility and making me less likely to get injured in the years to come.               I've started replacing some of the butter and seed oil in my life with olive oil. This is less about butter being \"bad\" (though there are plenty of nutrition experts who'd tell you it's not the best choice) and more about the health benefits of olive oil.               Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is rich in plant compounds called polyphenols, which are great for brain health, heart health, and reducing inflammation.               Nutrition expert Dr. Artemis Simopoulosrecommends mixing olive oil 1:1 with butter for a healthier spread on toast. I haven't tried that yet, but I do sometimes replace butter for 100% EVOO on my toast, and I also sub out prepackaged salads and dressings for greens and olive oil.               Over the past two years I've upped my daily berry intake, simply due to learning more about their health benefits. Berries are so rich in chemical compounds that they're like power fuel for our cells. Plus, they're better for digestion and gut health than anything sweet I might pick out of a vending machine.               I try to stock at least one to two kinds of berries in the fridge when they're in season, including blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.       Supplements aren't magic pills, but as the name suggests they can help supplementwhat a person's diet or lifestyle isn't covering. While nutraceutical supplement companies in the US don't have to abide by the same rigorous standards as pharmaceutical drug companies, there are third-party supplement testing outfits that certify some brands.               In longevity circles, people tend to subscribe to a highly personalized version of supplementation. Often, they'll use blood tests and other \"biomarkers\" like cholesterol, blood pressure, and genetic testing to come up with a daily pill strategy.               About a year ago, on the recommendation of the Miora longevity clinic at Life Time Fitness, I did some bloodwork and started taking magnesium. It's a mineral that most Americans don't get enough of.               The magnesium supplement I buy sets me back about 28 cents per day. It is United States Pharmacopeia (USP) verified, meaning I can be reasonably confident that what's advertised on the label is in the bottle.               I got another blood test recently, and I'm no longer deficient in magnesium. I can't say the difference is obvious, but I have noticed marginal benefits for my muscle relaxation, sleep, and digestion.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Nobody lost more money Monday as the stock market reacted to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs than Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d and the world\u2019s richest person, as shares of Musk\u2019s electric vehicle company Tesla struggled as the import taxes the company describes as a drag on profit await. Tesla CEO Elon Musk celebrates at the inauguration.  Tesla stock declined 5%, the largest percentage loss of the 46 American public companies valued at $200 billion or more. The dip knocked $11.8 billion off of the net worth of Musk, according to Forbes\u2019 real-time billionaires list, by far the biggest loss of any billionaire; Musk is Tesla\u2019s largest individual shareholder with a 13% stake and a further 9% equity bonus awaiting appeal. Tesla shares tanked as much as 7.5% in the morning, touching their lowest intraday level since Jan. 2. The slump came as part of a volatile broader trading session that dragged down the S&P 500 by as much as 1.9% in the morning before climbing back to a 0.8% daily loss, as the one-month pause on Mexico tariffs provided relief that the impact of tariffs will be less stark than Trump has vowed. Tesla had the unfortunate luck to belong to the two main groupings of stocks suffering the most Monday from tariff prospects: Car companies reliant on a symbiotic North American supply chain and companies which do significant business in China. In the company\u2019s earnings call last week, Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, warned \u201cthe imposition of tariffs, which is very likely\u2026will have an impact on our business and profitability\u201d as Tesla is \u201cstill very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses.\u201d Artificial intelligence semiconductor architect Nvidia and iPhone maker Apple, both of which bring in at least 15% of their overall revenues from China, also suffered losses Monday. $20.9 billion. That\u2019s how much revenue Tesla brought in from China in 2024, accounting for more than 21% of the company\u2019s global sales. \u201cThings that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good,\u201d Musk said in May about tariffs on Chinese EV imports to the U.S. enacted by then-President Joe Biden. Musk has been uncharacteristically quiet on his X social media platform regarding tariffs, only responding \u201cOh well\u201d to a post on an Ontario official announcing he intends to cancel the Canadian province\u2019s $68 million deal with Musk\u2019s SpaceX in response to the tariffs. Despite the threat of tariffs and the potential rollback of federal tax credits for EV buyers, Tesla stock has still performed remarkably well since Trump won in November, gaining 53%. With a net worth of $410 billion, Musk is more than $150 billion billion richer than he was on Election Day and about $160 billion wealthier than the next-closest billionaire, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

But there might be a grain of truth to all of that when you read stories like today\u2019s latest from the AI wave. An AI-powered camera operator is taking aim at social media creators even though its applications are actually much, much broader. Roll Cam AI shows off a variety of use case scenarios including the aforementioned social media content creation as well as real estate agents. You can watch a video over on YouTube about the Roll Cam AI and its initial specs at this link. What is it? Basically, as multiple websites are pointing out, it is a tripod on wheels that uses AI to keep subjects in frame. It can support everything from traditional cameras to smartphones and is still in the development stages pending a launch on Kickstarter in March. The company is asking users to sign up for a VIP list, promising initial enlistees a 65% discount on the device when it launches which puts it at $USD 259 (or over $USD 700 without the discount we estimate). Roll Cam AI promises a variety of tracking modes and options when it comes to filming. And if users want to take control of everything themselves, the company is also promising and manual mode to let users control the mobile tripod. The device promises smooth, quiet movement at up to 5 mph which seems fast enough for its stated use case scenarios as well as approximating what a human camera operator could accomplish.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  As President Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promises to crack down on immigration, questions remain about what might happen to skilled workers who come to the US on H-1B visas.          Trump targeted the H-1B visa program in his first term when he signed the \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order to rein in potential abuses. Ahead of the second term, however, he told the New York Post that he \"always liked the visas,\" which US companies use to hire foreign workers with specialized skills, often in science and technology.               \"I've been a believer in H-1B,\" he told the Post in December. \"I have used it many times. It's a great program.\"               Still, the program's future remains very much up in the air: Last week, two Republican senators introduced a joint resolution to strike down a Biden-era rule allowing such visas to be automatically extended for 540 days, instead of 180 days.               As such, Business Insider has run the numbers to find out which US financial services companies stand to be affected the most if these visas are tamped down again. BI used data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration data to analyze which financial giants file the most H-1B requests. The data covered the 2024 government fiscal year (the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024) and was collected from applications submitted by businesses that wish to sponsor a skilled worker's visa.               We found that some of the largest banks, credit card companies, and asset managers are among the most active sponsors of these visas, including JPMorgan and BlackRock. While many of the filings seek tech and software workers, some firms have used them to hire investment bankers or investment professionals.               Of course, not all filings lead to a hire and some filings may actually be for the same hire, as firms will refile to reflect amendments or to extend an existing visa. Still, the publicly available data provides a good indication of the H-1B visa demand among major companies.               The firms listed either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record.               Check out which financial firms are sponsoring the most H-1B visas, including the types of roles they are looking to fill:       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":" The Dallas Mavericks aren't pursuing Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant or Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler on the trade market, according to NBA insider Jake Fischer. Fischer noted that Dallas is \"definitely not done looking for upgrades\" via trade, though. On Sunday, the Mavericks made the surprising decision to deal superstar Luka Don\u010di\u0107 to the Los Angeles Lakers in a massive three-team swap. Dallas received a package headlined by Anthony Davis and a 2029 first-round pick in return. Butler indicated to the Heat on Jan. 2 that he wanted to be traded, with ESPN's Shams Charania listing Dallas as a team that the six-time All-Star would be open to joining. In 25 starts this season, Butler has averaged 17.0 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game while shooting a career-high 54 percent from the field. Durant hasn't requested a trade from the Suns, although Fischer noted on Monday that Phoenix was still listening to offers from opposing teams. The team doesn't have plans to move the two-time Finals MVP, though. While the Suns only sit at No. 8 in the Western Conference standings with a 25-23 record this season, Durant has remained one of the most efficient volume scorers in the association. He's averaging 26.9 points and 6.1 rebounds per game on 52.5\/40.5\/82.7 shooting splits.

Per ESPN's Bobby Marks, Dallas can trade first-round picks in 2025, 2029 and 2031 to upgrade its roster. After moving on from Don\u010di\u0107, the Mavericks may remain active on the trade market ahead of Thursday's deadline at 3 p.m. ET.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Some Americans facing return-to-office mandates are doing whatever they can to keep working from home.          Take Richard, who began working for Amazon last year as a finance manager. He said the company's three-days-a-week in-office policy wasn't ideal because his prior job was fully remote, but he accepted the role because he felt Amazon offered better growth opportunities.               However, when the company announced that it would be ramping up its return-to-office policy in 2025 to five days a week, Richard decided to try to jump ship.               \"I immediately started applying for remote jobs,\" said Richard, whose identity was verified by Business Insider but asked to use a pseudonym for fear of professional repercussions. \"I wanted to get ahead of the rush of people that would be applying once the policy went into effect.\"               Richard is among the Americans reacting to their companies' return-to-office mandates. In recent months, corporate giants like Amazon, AT&T, and JPMorgan have issued timelines for when employees must return to the office five days a week. In response, some workers have begun searching for remote or hybrid jobs so they can quit and avoid returning to the office full time.               In a Pew Research survey of 2,315 US adults conducted in October, 46% of respondents who worked from home at least some of the time said theywould be very or somewhat unlikely to stay in their role if their employer no longer allowed them to work from home. This included 61% of respondents who worked from home all the time. However, finding a new remote role isn't easy: Job seekers have encountered a challenging labor market and intense competition for roles that allow working from home.               Richard, who's in his 30s, said he hadn't had much luck in his job hunt so far and expanded his search to hybrid roles. He hopes that hiring will pick up later this year.               \"There are less and less fully remote roles and more people trying to fill them,\" he said. \"It has been hard to get far in the interview process.\"               In a September memo to employees, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said, \"The advantages of being together in the office are significant.\" In a January memo, JPMorgan's operating committee said it thought bringing workers back to the office was \"the best way to run the company.\"               Some Americans managed to secure work-from-home roles before the market became more challenging.               In 2022, George was working remotely as an IT professional in the financial industry. When his employer began discussing return-to-office plans \u2014 some teams were asked to switch from remote to hybrid \u2014 he found a new remote role.               George, 39, kept his original job and juggles both roles simultaneously to help ensure he'll always have at least one remote gig. He's earning about $250,000 annually \u2014 roughly double his prior income.               \"I ultimately decided to try it since I could easily just drop one if it was too much,\" George, whose identity was verified by BI but asked to use a pseudonym for fear of professional repercussions, previously told BI.               While some workers might be fine with hybrid working arrangements, there's no guarantee a company won't later issue a stricter return-to-office mandate. This is among the reasons Steven, an e-commerce professional in New Jersey, prioritized a fully remote working arrangement during his job search.               After being laid off two years agofrom a job that allowed him to work remotely, Steven applied for a mix of in-person and remote roles. Last February, he landed an offer from JPMorgan that would require him to work from the office three days a week in Manhattan.               As he mulled over the offer, he estimated that his commuting time would total nine hours a week \u2014 or roughly 450 hours a year. Parking at his local trainstation and taking the New Jersey Transit would cost him roughly $7,200 in annual commuting costs.               Around the same time, Steven received another job offer \u2014 this one for a remote position that offered an annual salary that was about $5,000 lower than the pay for the JPMorgan role. When he compared the jobs in terms of the money he'd earn for every hour he'd have to \"invest\" in them \u2014 including commuting time \u2014 he said it was an easy choice to pick the remote role.               \"JPMorgan just could not compete,\" he said, adding: \"A 40-hour week plus nine commute hours is basically a 50-hour week for the salary that they were offering.\"               Steven said he's particularly grateful he turned down the offer because on January 10, JPMorgan announced that most employees would be required to work from the office five days a week beginning in March.               Meanwhile, Richard is still looking for a remote role while commuting to his current job. Because of space constraints at his office, he said, he doesn't have to comply with Amazon's five-day-a-week policy until April. In the meantime, he's found ways to minimize his in-office time.               Richard said he typically goes into the office three days a week but estimated that he works from there only betweennine and 12 hours a week across the three days. He thinks he can get away with this because he's the only one from his team who works at that office location.               \"I would go into the office for a few hours, avoid rush hour, and fulfill my badging requirement,\" he said, adding that he planned to take a similar approach once the five-day-a-week policy took effect.               George said his second employer appears to have permanently embraced remote work but that he still has some concerns that his original employer will eventually require him to return to the office. He said he lives roughly 14 miles from the nearest office \u2014 an hourlong commute with traffic and about 30 minutes without.               Steven said his employer had called some workers back to the office but that he'd been told this wouldn't affect him because he was designated as a remote worker when he was hired. He thinks his company offers workers in certain roles this perk to attract and retain talent.               \"If you want to be able to find the right kind of people,\" he said, \"you're going to be much more successful at finding people if you allow remote work.\"       Has your employer asked you to work from the office more?

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Car supermarkets and franchised dealers see increased inventory, but longer selling times impact conversion rates. Car supermarkets and franchised dealers began the year with stronger used car inventories compared to January 2024, but vehicles remained on forecourts for longer, according to the latest Market View from MOTORS. The start of the year saw a decline in sales conversion rates for these dealers, with car supermarkets experiencing an 11% drop and franchised dealers down 13% year-on-year. In contrast, independent dealers saw a modest 1% increase in sales. Overall, January\u2019s used car sales volumes declined by 4% compared to the same period last year.

(Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) Alcoa latest earnings report for Q4 2024 showed strong financial improvements with the company reporting sales of $3.49 billion, a significant increase from $2.6 billion in Q4 2023. It also swung to profitability, reporting net income of $202 million, compared to a net loss of $150 million a year ago. Earnings per share came in at $0.77, a sharp turnaround from the loss per share of $0.84 in Q4 2023. In spite of the positive results, the stock declined by almost 6% in the last five days. For 2025, Alcoa expects alumina production to decline slightly due to the curtailment of its Kwinana refinery, but aluminum production is expected to rise due to smelter restarts. The company also anticipates a $60 million sequential negative impact in Q1 2025 due to seasonal factors and other operational changes. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. The increase in AA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 159% in 2021, -23% in 2022, -24% in 2023, and 12% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AA face a similar situation as it did in 2022, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? We are positive on Alcoa stock, primarily due to higher aluminum demand, driven by the automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy sectors, which could boost the company\u2019s revenue. Additionally, the company has successfully improved profitability through efficiency measures. In Q4 of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA surged 196% sequentially to $1.6 billion, driven by higher alumina and aluminum prices and lower raw material and energy costs, though these gains were partially offset by increased production costs. Alcoa ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash, and its profitability improvement program exceeded targets, achieving $675 million in improvements over the year. We value AA stock at around $48 per share, which is around 36% ahead of the current market price.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Caterpillar excavators are seen in Warsaw, Poland on April 23, 2024. (Photo by Jakub ... [+] Porzycki\/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) recently released its Q4 results, with revenue missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported revenue of $16.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.14 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $16.4 billion and $5.02, respectively. Lower dealer inventory levels weighed on the company\u2019s top-line. Furthermore, the company expects sales and profitability to trend lower this year. Separately, after announcing good results, Buy, Sell, Or Hold ABBV Stock At $185? This didn\u2019t sit well with the investors, and the stock saw a 5% dip on Thursday, January 30. CAT stock, with 29% returns since the beginning of 2024, has performed in-line with the S&P 500 index, up 27%. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Caterpillar\u2019s revenue of $16.2 billion in Q4 was down 5% y-o-y. Looking at segments, the Construction Industries revenue was down 8%, Resource Industries sales were down 9%, while Energy & Transportation revenue were flat y-o-y. Caterpillar saw its adjusted operating margin contract by 60 bps to 18.3% in Q4. A decline in sales clubbed with margin contraction resulted in earnings of $5.14 per share, versus $5.23 in the prior-year quarter. Caterpillar\u2019s sales were weighed down due to lower dealer inventory levels as overall demand remains soft. This can be attributed to elevated interest rates and a high inflationary-environment. Looking forward, Caterpillar expects dealer inventory levels in 2025 to remain similar to levels seen toward the end of 2024. Taking into account the soft demand, Caterpillar will find it difficult to push the pricing higher. In fact, the company expects a slight decline in revenues this year, after seeing a 3% y-o-y decline in 2024. Although Caterpillar posted better than anticipated earnings, a top-line miss and a bleak outlook resulted in its stock seeing a 5% fall post the results announcement. Notably, CAT is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last 4 years. But, that still wasn\u2019t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the stock were 16% in 2021, 19% in 2022, 26% in 2023, and 25% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and geopolitical tensions, could CAT face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2014 or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for CAT to reflect the latest results, we think its stock is appropriately priced despite its recent decline. At its current levels of $375, CAT stock is trading at 17x trailing earnings of $21.90 per share. This compares with the stock\u2019s average P\/E ratio of 19x over the last five years. However, a slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the underwhelming outlook for sales as well as profitability in the near term. While CAT stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Caterpillar\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  It's hard to know where to look in the flurry of activity from the opening days of President Donald Trump's second administration. There's Elon Musk at DOGE, a potential trade war with Colombia, a sweeping pardon of Capitol riot participants, and the chaotic back-and-forth of the funding freeze. On immigration, the president is moving swiftly, cracking down on immigrants who entered the United States illegally. While all these moves have attracted copious attention, flying under the radar so far is one industry that stands to see a major windfall as Trump's plans fall into place: private prisons.          The president signed a barrage of executive orders and actions on his first day in office. Among them: the revocation of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden directing the Department of Justice not to renew contracts with private, for-profit prison companies to house people convicted of federal crimes. By late 2022, the Bureau of Prisons had ended all its contracts with private prisons, per Biden's order. Now, under Trump, the flip has been switched back on again. The move isn't surprising \u2014 for a decade, private prisons have been in a bit of an on-again, off-again situation with the DOJ. The Obama administration moved to phase them out, Trump 1.0 reversed it, Biden phased them out again, and Trump has once again reversed that decision. The industry anticipated as much. George Zoley, the executive chairman of the GEO Group, a for-profit prison company, said on an earnings call in November that he expected Trump to reverse all of Biden's orders on \"day one.\"               While private prison companies won't mind getting business back from the BOP, that's really not where the opportunity is. CoreCivic, another major US private prison operator, acknowledged in an investor call in 2021 that the bureau didn't really have much of a need for private facilities anymore since the federal inmate population had declined \u2014 and less than 10% of those inmates were in private prisons. The opportunity is Trump's plans for the mass detention and deportation of immigrants. Both Democratic and Republican administrations kept up work with for-profit prisons on immigration \u2014 the Biden administration, for example, deported more people than Trump's first administration did and often detained those people in private prison facilities. But Trump says he plans to really ramp things up now, moving hundreds of thousands of migrants through the system in a way that would be a huge boon for the companies.               \"This is, to us, an unprecedented opportunity to assist the federal government and the incoming Trump administration towards achieving a much more aggressive immigration policy,\" Zoley said on the earnings call.               Despite going relatively unnoticed in the opening days of the administration, private prison companies are a secret weapon for the president in his war on immigrants, and they stand to reap some major profits in the process.               While the average American may not be aware of how good Trump's immigration plans might be for private prisons, Wall Street certainly is. The stock prices of GEO and CoreCivic have soared by 105% and 50% since the 2024 election.               \"The thing that really has driven the stock price since the election basically is Trump's stance that he's going to deport millions of people,\" said Joe Gomes, a managing director of equity research at Noble Capital Markets.               There are three main areas in which the private prison companies stand to make money on Trump's deportation plans, said Bianca Tylek, the founder and executive director of Worth Rises, a group that advocates against the commercialization of the criminal legal system. One is detention, as in holding migrants in facilities until their court hearings or until they're expelled from the country. The second is surveillance of migrants who aren't detained, and the third is transportation around, and possibly out of, the US.               Immigration and Customs Enforcement has funding to maintain 41,500 beds for detained migrants, but the president's border czar, Tom Homan, has suggested he needs at least 100,000 beds to carry out Trump's deportation plans. The recently enacted Laken Riley Act that requires the detention of migrants accused of crimes such as theft could necessitate 60,000 more beds. Private prison operators will be key to helping this expansion, though they won't be the only ones \u2014 Trump has said he also plans to use space at Guantnamo Bay to house detainees.               GEO, the largest contractor for ICE, has about 13,500 beds for migrants, but executives said it was well positioned to scale up to more than 31,000 beds in the near future. Similarly, CoreCivic told The Wall Street Journal it could get its capacity to 25,000 beds by reopening facilities it recently closed. It has also looked into sites for detaining families, and its CEO told the Journal that the company was \"very willing\" to discuss detaining unaccompanied children, too.               GEO also operates ICE's Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which monitors migrants as they go through legal proceedings as an alternative to detention. GEO says that about 182,500 people participate in that program daily, but that number could grow significantly. On the company's earnings call, Zoley said GEO believes it has the technology and resources to scale up the ISAP contract to \"several hundreds of thousands and upward to several millions of participants.\"               About 11 million people are thought to be living in the US illegally. Gomes said that if the government were to monitor a certain percentage of those people, it would be a \"huge positive\" for GEO and could bring in others, too. \"If that contract got extremely big, there would potentially be other players like CoreCivic that could potentially also benefit from that,\" he said.               On the transportation end, private prison companies contract with ICE to move migrants on the ground and in the air. GEO said on its earnings call that it expects its air subcontracting services to generate $25 million in annualized revenue and that it believes it could scale if need be, too.               In a statement to Business Insider, a GEO spokesperson said the company was investing $70 million toward \"increased housing, transportation, and monitoring capabilities and services to meet the anticipated requirements of the federal government's immigration law enforcement priorities.\" A CoreCivic spokesperson said the company \"stays in regular contact with ICE and all our government partners to understand their changing needs, and we work within their established procurement processes.\"               It's not an accident that the private prison companies wound up in this situation. For years they've been hard at work buttering up public officials, lobbying, and making campaign donations, especially to Trump and other Republicans. While many corporate executives have come around to the idea of wooing Trump in his second term, the private prisons were there all along.               In the 2016 election, GEO donated $225,000 to the pro-Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now through a subsidiary. (The advocacy group the Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, saying the money violated a ban on political contributions by federal contractors, but that was dismissed because of a deadlock on the FEC.) GEO and CoreCivic each gave $250,000 to Trump's 2016 inauguration. GEO held its annual conference in 2017 at the Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami, and one GEO executive who lobbied the Trump administration stayed at Trump's hotel in Washington, DC. Pam Bondi, Trump's new attorney general, lobbied for GEO as recently as 2019.               Early in 2024, GEO maxed out its donation to Trump's campaign and gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Trump-affiliated super PAC Make America Great Again Inc. Individual executives at GEO and CoreCivic have made large donations to Trump and affiliated PACs as well. An ABC News analysis found that private prison companies donated more than $1 million to Trump's reelection, and now they're hoping all their efforts pay off.               \"We can assume, given their exuberance after the election, that they are really excited about the possibilities for making money and expanding the 'demand' that will be going up for them and their services right now,\" said Setareh Ghandehari, the advocacy director at the Detention Watch Network, an advocacy group that opposes immigration detention. She added, however, that expanding detention capacity isn't something the administration can achieve overnight. \"It's going to take time to build the infrastructure,\" she said.               Trump's plans won't just take time \u2014 they'll also take a whole lot of money. Companies such as GEO and CoreCivic are hoping to get a cut of that cash, but it's unclear where exactly it would come from. Even before the president took office, ICE was facing a $230 million budget shortfall, NBC News reported, citing two US officials. To execute Trump's immigration plans, the administration could move money around within the Department of Homeland Security from places such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Coast Guard, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It may also pull in other agencies for assistance. But ultimately it would need Congress to appropriate more money toward its project.               \"That's also a huge tax on taxpayers,\" Tylek said. \"Their entire business is reliant on the government paying for more people to be incarcerated.\"               PJ Lechleitner, who served as the ICE director under Biden and spent 20 years at DHS, said that adding 10,000 to 15,000 beds in a few months was feasible, \"perhaps twice that many.\" But the numbers the Trump administration is floating, he said, would require \"years of infrastructure for the high-end estimate.\"               \"If they're going to aggressively continue to pursue this, which I have every indication that they are, they're going to need a lot more money and find places to put these people,\" Lechleitner told me.               Even if every dollar is approved, building new facilities takes time. That may force the Trump administration to employ the practice known as \"catch and release,\" Rick Su, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, told me. While it may not be exactly what Trump had in mind, it's a good deal for private prison companies, which will be eager and able to help with migrant monitoring.               Whatever your position on immigration, the idea of criminal detention being a commercial enterprise is uncomfortable. \"What's best for my shareholders\" does not always align with what's best for the community or country or public safety. Also uncomfortable is the way the stocks of private prison companies seem to ping-pong based on which party is in the White House. Back in 2016, private prison stocks crashed when Hillary Clinton had a good debate performance. Though, for what it's worth, these companies have fared quite well under administrations of both political stripes \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans have employed them for various immigration-related reasons.               \"Both the Obama administration's and the Biden administration's relationships to private prisons set some guardrails,\" said Matt Nelson, the executive director of Presente, a national civil and human rights organization, but neither addressed the federal government's biggest use of private operators, which was immigration and ICE. \"If you look at even what Trump did, he didn't have to roll back very much,\" he said.               Now companies such as GEO and CoreCivic find themselves at the center of what's likely to be a very lucrative storm for them. Their executives may not have been seated behind Trump at the inauguration, but they didn't need to be \u2014 they might prefer to fly under the radar anyway, and they're already on track to get what they've wanted. They need Trump, but Trump also needs them, and everyone knows it.       Emily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"The price of Bitcoin rose back to $100,000 on Monday afternoon after dropping to $95,000 in the morning. This volatility was sparked by President Donald Trump\u2019s new trade tensions with Canada, Mexico, and potentially China, which created turmoil in the crypto market. Over the weekend, Trump announced new taxes on imports from the U.S.\u2019s top trade partners. Imports from Canada and Mexico will be taxed at 25%, while Chinese goods will be taxed at 10%. Trump made an exception for Canada\u2019s energy exports, which the U.S. relies on, and issued a lower 10% tariff. He also reiterated a threat to issue tariffs on imports from the European Union, which said it would \u201crespond firmly\u201d to any action. Canada has already announced its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, beginning with a 25% tariff on $20.4 billion worth of goods. Mexico said it will announce retaliatory tariffs but has not released additional details. China has said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization. Although cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t directly impacted by tariffs, the economic uncertainty that can emerge as a result can affect them. During such times, investors tend to be willing to snag a profit when they can from volatile assets and rely on more stable alternatives. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, fell to $95,000 in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, hovering around $101,000. As a result, the entire crypto market bounced back by the afternoon as investors may have seen it as a buying opportunity. In the afternoon, Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was down by almost 7.6%. Tesla (TSLA) CEO and senior Trump advisor Elon Musk\u2019s favorite meme coin, Dogecoin, was down by almost 0.37%, while the president\u2019s $TRUMP meme coin\u2014 which he announced late last month \u2014 fell by almost 8%. First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s own meme coin, $MELANIA, was down 9%. Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and business-intelligence firm Microstrategy (MSTR), which has kept up its Bitcoin buying spree, recovered by the afternoon, too. It\u2019s not just crypto that\u2019s going through a rollercoaster ride. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were down at market open but recovered by the afternoon. \u201cThese announcements have come as a shock to many investors who expected tariffs would only be imposed if trade negotiations failed,\u201d Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts said in a note Sunday.  Goldman estimates that Trump\u2019s tariffs would reduce its S&P 500 earnings per share by roughly 1% to 2% for every 5-percentage-point increase in the tariff rate. Without taking into account any additional impacts, the investment bank estimates a 2% to 3% hit to the S&P 500 companies\u2019 earnings per share.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"For most active investment managers, the goal is clear: to achieve consistently strong, long-term outperformance in any market environment. But this is easier said than done. And some do it better than others.   Since 1937, T. Rowe Price has been anything but a typical active manager. Our investment professionals aren\u2019t content to merely edge out the returns of indexes and passive peers. They ask better questions to pursue better long-term outcomes for our clients. They go against the grain to search for investment opportunities that are undervalued or underappreciated. And over the last two decades, there is one portfolio manager who has been on an unprecedented run of performance: David Giroux of the Capital Appreciation Fund, who recently marked a record-setting streak of beating the competition. 17 Years of Better Returns At T. Rowe Price, we strive to instill confidence in our investors. And while past performance does not guarantee future results, our clients can feel good about Giroux's track record of consistently strong returns. For the 17th consecutive year, his Capital Appreciation Fund reported better returns than the average of funds in Morningstar\u2019s Moderate Allocation category. No multi-asset or U.S. equity mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) has had a longer streak under the same portfolio manager. The analysis compared the fund with more than 3,000 funds since 1925, the launch of the oldest mutual fund.1 Over time, this performance offered the potential for a strong, positive impact on client portfolios.

Capital Appreciation Fund Risks: The fund is subject to the inherent volatility of common stock investing. The value approach carries the risk that the market will not recognize a security\u2019s intrinsic value for a long time or that a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced. Because of the fund\u2019s fixed income holdings or cash position, it may not keep pace in a rapidly rising market.  Capital Appreciation and Income Fund Risks: The fund is subject to the inherent volatility of common stock investing. Fixed income securities are subject to credit risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall.  Capital Appreciation Equity ETF Risks: The ETF is subject to the inherent volatility of common stock investing. The fund's value and growth investing styles may become out of favor, which may result in periods of underperformance. The fund is \"nondiversified,\u201d meaning it may invest a greater portion of its assets in a single company and own more of the company\u2019s voting securities than is permissible for a \u201cdiversified\u201d fund.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"If you live in the European Union, you can now have a dedicated pornography app on your iPhone for the first time ever, in case that\u2019s a thing that you\u2019ve just been absolutely fiending for. Hot Tub, a porn search engine, is the first native porn app that can be installed on iOS devices through legitimate means, per TechCrunch, thanks to the recent enforcement of the EU Digital Markets Act that requires Apple to support third-party app stores. Hot Tub, which is available through the alternative app store AltStore PAL, allows users to search and watch content across a number of popular porn sites including PornHub, XVideos, XNXX, and XHamster. The app is billed as \u201cPorn Without the Pop-Ups,\u201d as the app prevents the slew of shady advertisements that you\u2019ll get served visiting these sites on a browser. It also saves you the hassle of having to open an Incognito tab for your search\u00e2\u0080\u0094though let\u2019s be real, if you\u2019re downloading a dedicated porn app, you\u2019re not really all that worried about discretion. Alternative app stores have been allowed on devices in the European Union since last year, but Hot Tub is still the first porn app to get all the way to market. That\u2019s in part because Apple continues to maintain a Notarization process designed to ensure apps meet \u00e2\u0080\u009cbaseline platform integrity standards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The app, which was developed by developer and iPhone jailbreaker c1d3r, successfully went through the Notarization process and was approved for use on iOS. Third-party app stores are still a very new phenomenon for the average user (though people who are involved in the jailbreak community have been sideloading apps for years), and it still comes with a fair amount of hurdles and risks. But there is some evidence to suggest that folks are interested in breaking out of Apple\u2019s walled garden approach to apps. A survey by MacPaw (which operates its own alternative app store, so keep that in mind) found that 80% of users expressed interest in trying a third-party app store. Also, maybe surprisingly, lots of people watch porn on their phones. Reportedly, 69% of porn viewership happens on smartphones, and an estimated 20% of all searches from mobile devices are porn related. So obviously there\u2019s a market for Hot Tub\u2019s services. The AltStore is taking advantage of its successful launch of a porn app to donate its earnings to sex workers and LGBTQ causes, announcing that it will donate its monthly earnings from Patreon to organizations like The Trevor Project and Red Umbrella Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0094a decision that it says was made in part to combat recent policies aiming to ban porn outright and remove protections for marginalized communities on social media.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. If you\u2019re familiar with cryptocurrencies, you\u2019ve likely heard of stablecoins. These are a type of cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar, gold, or other financial instruments. Some of the most popular stablecoins include Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and PayPal USD (PYPL) (PYUSD). When entering the crypto market, investors typically convert fiat currency like the U.S. dollar into cryptocurrency. The easiest way to do this is to purchase stablecoins pegged to fiat value. A stablecoin acts as a digital dollar for crypto investors and becomes a medium for them to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For example, converting U.S. dollars to crypto often involves buying Tether (USDT). Stablecoins have emerged as a major trend. Let\u2019s take a look at how they are evolving. In its recent annual \u201cState of Crypto\u201d report, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said stablecoins have been gaining widespread adoption due to cost reductions in executing crypto transactions. Stablecoins offer a level of stability not typically seen in other cryptocurrencies, making them more appealing for everyday transactions and as a store of value. This reliability has driven increased usage across various sectors, from remittances and e-commerce to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, further boosting overall activity in the crypto ecosystem. Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that stablecoins fall under its jurisdiction and should be registered as securities. The financial watchdog sued many stablecoin issuers, saying they violated laws designed to protect investors. With Gensler\u2019s resignation on Jan. 20 and the shifting dynamics under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, there are widespread speculations that stablecoins may receive regulatory support from the SEC and soon be free from legal challenges. USDT, the largest stablecoin, is the world\u2019s most traded cryptocurrency, often exceeding the combined trading volumes of Bitcoin and Ether. According to Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s report, stablecoins account for a third of crypto user activity. Moreover, Tether accounts for over 50% of the daily trading volume of Bitcoin and up to 70% of some other major cryptocurrencies. Tether is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a market cap of $139 billion. Circle\u2019s USD Coin is the eighth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $52 billion, according to crypto tracking website CoinMarketCap. Early crypto exchanges lacked direct access to U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies, making stablecoins essential as fiat equivalents. Their price stability made them the preferred tool for traders on non-fiat exchanges to enter and exit trades. Payment giants like PayPal and Visa (V) have embraced stablecoins for cross-border payments, as they offer a seamless way to convert fiat into crypto. As a result, stablecoins are becoming a vital part of the global financial system, combining the stability of traditional assets with blockchain technology. Stablecoins are gaining popularity as a hedge against inflation, particularly in regions facing economic instability. By pegging their value to assets like the U.S. dollar, stablecoins help individuals and businesses preserve purchasing power and shield their assets from the volatility of local currencies. In countries like Argentina, where hyperinflation is a major concern, stablecoins have become a safe haven. They allow people to protect their savings from the devaluation of the Argentine peso (ARS). Argentina leads Latin America in crypto adoption, surpassing Brazil in crypto inflows despite Brazil\u2019s larger economy. Over the past two years, stablecoin usage in Argentina has surged, now making up 62% of all crypto transactions. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"POLAND - 2024\/11\/17: In this photo illustration, the AbbVie company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) recently released its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings comfortably above the street estimates. It reported sales of $15.1 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $14.8 billion and $2.11, respectively. AbbVie continued to benefit from strong sales growth for Rinvoq and Skyrizi. The company\u2019s outlook was also better than the estimates, faring well for its stock. Separately, see What\u2019s Next For CAT Stock After a Bleak Outlook? ABBV stock, with 24% returns since the beginning of 2024, has marginally underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. An increased competition and a mid-stage clinical trial failure for schizophrenia treatment last year are some of the factors that have weighed on its stock price growth lately. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. AbbVie\u2019s revenue of $15.1 billion in Q4 reflected a 5.6% y-o-y growth. Looking at immunology, while Humira sales plunged 49% to $1.7 billion, Skyrizi sales surged 58% to $3.8 billion and Rinvoq sales grew 46% to $1.8 billion. Oncology sales growth of 12% was bolstered by higher Venclexta sales. Neuroscience sales benefited from gains in Qulipta and Ubrelvy. Overall, AbbVie has been able to more than bridge the gap from falling Humira sales, as it faces biosimilar competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are used to treat plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and they have been gaining market share lately. AbbVie\u2019s bottom line of $2.16 reflects a 23% y-o-y decline. This can be attributed to a one-time charge of $0.88 per share toward acquired IPR&D and milestone expenses. Looking forward, AbbVie expects its 2025 earnings to be $12.22 at the mid-point of the provided range, versus the $12.18 consensus estimate. The company continues to project high single-digit compound annual revenue growth through 2029, while simultaneously boosting its 2027 revenue expectations for Skyrizi and Rinvoq by $4 billion. Amid a Q4 beat and solid outlook, ABBV stock surged 5% post the results announcement. However, looking at a slightly longer time frame, the increase in ABBV stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 32% in 2021, 24% in 2022, 0% in 2023, and 19% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. As markets grapple with uncertainty surrounding interest rate policies and newly imposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, is ABBV likely to mirror its underperformance versus the S&P 500 from 2023 and 2024 this year, or are we positioned for an upswing? Despite its recent rise, ABBV appears to have more room for growth. At its current levels of $184, it trades at 5.8x trailing revenues, slightly higher than the stock\u2019s average P\/S ratio of 5.0x over the last three years. However, a rise in valuation multiple for ABBV seems justified, given how the company has bridged the gap from falling Humira sales and positioned itself for strong growth in the coming years. While ABBV stock looks like it may see higher levels, it is helpful to see how AbbVie\u2019s peers fare on metrics that matter.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 31: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters after signing an ... [+] executive order, \"Unleashing prosperity through deregulation,\" in the Oval Office on January 31, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump spoke to reporters about tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico and how the newly confirmed Interior Secretary Doug Burghum will coordinate with the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images) According to his famously short-lived communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, the key to understanding President Donald Trump back in 2016 was not to take his impromptu statements literally but to take them \u201csymbolically.\u201d Either way, it turned out the biggest mistake was not taking them seriously. Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks on tax policy were one instance when taking him at his word was likely to give listeners a headache, and that is still true today. For example, when the president says things like he did to podcast host Joe Rogan just before the election about being open to replacing income taxes with tariffs \u2014 \u201cYeah, sure, why not\u201d \u2014 the correct interpretation is that he\u2019s intent on raising tariffs. This was confirmed by Trump\u2019s January 20 inaugural address, in which he touted tariffs as the alternative to \u201ctaxing our citizens to enrich other countries.\u201d Trump followed this up by declaring that he would establish the External Revenue Service to collect tariffs, duties, and revenues. The caveat about taking Trump literally does not apply with equal force to the statements he puts in writing. Today we\u2019ll examine an executive order, a White House memorandum, and some scripted remarks to consider what may be in store for tax legislation in 2025. Trump repudiated the Green New Deal in his January 20 executive order, \u201cUnleashing American Energy.\u201d The Green New Deal wasn\u2019t passed in its original form as introduced by Democrats, but many of its elements were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act. The executive order criticized \u201cburdensome and ideologically motivated regulations [that]  Because the IRA is not synonymous with the Green New Deal, most of the energy tax credits probably aren\u2019t in much danger. In his January 23 teleconferenced remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump invited \u201cevery business in the world\u201d to \u201ccome make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth.\u201d Then he promised to bring taxes down \u201cvery substantially, even from the original Trump tax cuts.\u201d Those statements, together with details of the executive order, suggest that the administration isn\u2019t looking to significantly alter the IRA\u2019s credits, save for perhaps the electric vehicle credits. \u201cDrill, baby, drill\u201d apparently has a new counterpart in the form of \u201cmine, baby, mine.\u201d The executive order announced that the administration\u2019s policy is \u201cto establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals.\u201d The key words there are \u201cproducer and processor.\u201d Last February, Energy Deputy Secretary David Turk explained the state of domestic mining and processing of critical minerals to Congress during what amounted to a post facto hearing on the IRA credits. (Prior analysis: Tax Notes Federal, Feb. 19, 2024, p. 1356.) China does almost all the processing of graphite that is necessary for individual EV battery cells. As of February 2024, the United States was targeting a 16% share of the market by 2027. Lithium and cobalt processing are also done mostly in China. Achieving leadership in the market for minerals like these will likely require even more investment by the United States, and Trump knows it. In 2017 he issued Executive Order 13817, \u201cA Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals,\u201d which struck a different note on U.S. policy, saying it was \u201cto reduce the Nation\u2019s vulnerability to disruptions in the supply of critical minerals.\u201d Leading the production and processing of critical minerals wasn\u2019t mentioned. Trump\u2019s January 20 executive order also sets out the policy to \u201celiminate the \u2018electric vehicle (EV) mandate\u2019 and promote true consumer choice . . . by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable.\u201d In other words, unsurprisingly, the administration wants to put sections 30D, 25E, and 45W on the chopping block. Eliminating those credits would require legislation. Section 3 orders an immediate review of all existing agency actions that might burden the development or use of domestic energy resources, identifying \u201coil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources\u201d as resources to which the agency heads should pay \u201cparticular attention.\u201d Mapping those priorities onto the IRA tax credits reveals some interesting contrasts, even if it is a perilous exercise in speculation. For instance, blue hydrogen \u2014 produced through steam methane reformation of natural gas with carbon capture \u2014 might be given greater latitude, and any disappointment in the biogas industry following the release of the final hydrogen and tech-neutral regulations might now be mitigated. (Prior analysis: Tax Notes Federal, Jan. 27, 2025, p. 677.) A January 20 White House memorandum to the Treasury secretary and others on the administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade policy addresses the creation of an External Revenue Service. The secretaries of Treasury, commerce, and homeland security are directed to \u201cinvestigate the feasibility of establishing and recommend the best methods for designing, building, and implementing an External Revenue Service to collect tariffs, duties, and other foreign trade-related revenues.\u201d The memorandum says the Treasury secretary is to consult the others, which seems to imply that the External Revenue Service is supposed to be part of Treasury. As a historical matter, the U.S Customs Service was part of the Treasury Department from its inception in 1789 until 2003, so if customs collections revert to Treasury, it wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented. According to Trump\u2019s remarks at the World Economic Forum, Republicans will pass \u201cthe largest tax cut in American history, including massive tax cuts for workers and family and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers.\u201d That announcement was followed by a bit of optimism: \u201cAnd we\u2019re working with the Democrats on getting an extension of the original Trump tax cuts, as you probably know by just reading any paper.\u201d Trump can\u2019t unilaterally bring bipartisan tax legislation back, but he can at least court the opposition. Bipartisanship is fine, but making tax bills great again will also require legislative niceties that Congress has dispensed with in recent years, like public preliminary drafts and pre-vote congressional hearings. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks about the mid-air crash between ... [+] American Airlines and a military helicopter at the White House on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chen Mengtong\/China News Service\/VCG via Getty Images) The possibilities floated for individual tax cuts are largely mundane, albeit with some semi-novel twists. Trump is still talking about eliminating income taxes on tips, a promise that the campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, also adopted. \u201cYour tips will be 100 percent yours,\u201d Trump told a crowd in Las Vegas on January 25. Other exemptions may be proposed too. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said on the social platform X that he loved a proposal he received from a 15-year-old to eliminate taxes on workers under 18. Massie explained his rationale in a numbered list: \u201c1. They need experience to pick a college major 2. They need to develop a work ethic 3. The economy needs more workers 4. They don\u2019t get to vote.\u201d A few details might need to be added to this type of exemption to prevent family businesses from paying too-generous wages to their children. And children who don\u2019t earn more than the standard deduction amount ($14,600 for 2024) wouldn\u2019t benefit, because they don\u2019t owe federal income tax anyway. The blue-state Republican members of the SALT Caucus still want to raise the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. Trump said on the campaign trail that he\u2019d restore the deduction. Reducing the corporate tax rate to 15% might be the most ambitious piece of Trump\u2019s plans, and it\u2019s unclear how exactly he\u2019ll do it. He told the Davos audience in response to a question from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan that \u201cwe\u2019re going to bring it down to 15 percent if you make your product in the USA.\u201d Trump said he expected that to create a \u201ctremendous buzz.\u201d The debt limit might also block the president\u2019s tax ambitions, as it is another hurdle for congressional Republicans, and they may need agreement from Democrats.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"FC Barcelona announced an outgoing player transfer via its official website and social media on ... [+] Sunday afternoon. FC Barcelona announced an outgoing player transfer via its official website and X social media account on Sunday afternoon. \u201cFC Barcelona and FC Cartagena have reached an agreement to end the loan of the player Lucas Pocho Roman to the Murcian team,\u201d a statement on the matter began. \"At the same time, FC Barcelona and Club Atletico Independiente have reached an agreement for the transfer of the Argentine winger. The agreement includes a percentage of a future sale of the player to the Club. FC Barcelona wishes him the best of luck and achievements in the future, both personally and professionally,\" it added. Barca explained how Roman arrived at the club in January 2023 from another Argentine outfit Ferro Carril Oeste. \u201cIn his first half season as a Barca player, he participated in 11 games and scored one goal. In the 2023\/24 season, the Argentine played a total of 16 games and scored another goal. \u201cAt the start of the current season he was loaned to Cartagena in the Second Division, with whom he has played 22 games (19 in La Liga and three in the Copa del Rey) and has scored two goals. \"Starting this January, Pocho returns to the Argentine league to continue growing at CA Independiente de Avellaneda,\u201d the Catalans further detailed. Citing anonymous sources, SPORT gives further information surrounding the deal. The paper says that the Argentine giant will retain 60% of Roman\u2019s rights and he has a contract with them until 2027. Barca has 30% of any future sale, though, as the remaining 10% belongs to the player and his camp. Meanwhile, Independiente will have to transfer Roman to another club if an offer of $5 million or more comes in for the winger, who as said scored two goals in 19 appearances for Barca Atletic this term. This development comes after Barca beat Real Madrid and Cadiz to the signature of another forward in Alan Godoy, whose transfer was announced at the weekend. While there have been plenty of transfers in and out of Albert Sanchez\u2019s reserve side, with Unai Hernandez\u2019s sale to Al-Ittihad in Saudi Arabia another, the first team overseen by Hansi Flick is still yet to see any in the soon-closing winter market.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Last week, shortly before the start of the Chinese New Year, when much of China shuts down for seven days, the state media saluted DeepSeek, a tech startup whose release of a new low-cost, high-performance artificial-intelligence model, known as R1, prompted a big sell-off in tech stocks on Wall Street. China Central Television showed footage of DeepSeek\u2019s bespectacled founder, Liang Wenfeng, meeting with Premier Li Qiang, the second-highest-ranking official in the Chinese government. A few days earlier, China Daily, an English-language news site run by the Chinese Communist Party, had hailed DeepSeek\u2019s success, which defied U.S. restrictions on the export of high-performance semiconductor chips used to train A.I. models, as \u201cnot an isolated phenomenon, but rather a reflection of the broader vibrancy of China\u2019s AI ecosystem.\u201d As if to reinforce the point, on Wednesday, the first day of the Year of the Snake, Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant, released its own new A.I. model, which the company claimed \u201coutperforms\u201d competing products from U.S. companies like OpenAI and Meta \u201calmost across the board.\u201d Alibaba\u2019s claims haven\u2019t been independently verified yet, but the DeepSeek-inspired stock sell-off provoked a great deal of commentary about how the company achieved its breakthrough, the durability of U.S. leadership in A.I., and the wisdom of trying to slow down China\u2019s tech industry by restricting high-tech exports\u2014a policy that both the first Trump Administration and the Biden Administration followed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, described R1 as \u201csuper impressive,\u201d adding, \u201cWe should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.\u201d Elsewhere, the reaction from Silicon Valley was less effusive. OpenAI said it was \u201creviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.\u201d The Chinese company claimed it spent just $5.6 million on computing power to train one of its new models, but Dario Amodei, the chief executive of Anthropic, another prominent American A.I. firm, described this achievement as merely \u201can expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve,\u201d which U.S. firms would soon match. Amodei did acknowledge the novelty in a Chinese firm being \u201cfirst to demonstrate the expected cost reductions,\u201d and he argued that DeepSeek\u2019s progress makes \u201cexport control policies even more existentially important than they were a week ago.\u201d Such comments demonstrate that how you see the DeepSeek story depends partly on your vantage point. To get an unofficial view from the other side of the Pacific, I arranged a Zoom call with a longtime China watcher, Louis-Vincent Gave, a co-founder of Gavekal, a Hong Kong-based financial services company. Gave, who is fifty and originally from France, moved to Hong Kong in 1997, shortly before the United Kingdom restored control of the former British colony to China. He has lived there ever since, analyzing and writing about China\u2019s remarkable transformation into the world\u2019s second-largest economy and its biggest exporter of goods. On Monday, the day Nvidia, a U.S. semiconductor company that produces the high-end chips most American A.I. firms rely on, lost more than half a trillion dollars in market value, Gave circulated a commentary entitled \u201cAnother Sputnik Moment\u201d to his firm\u2019s clients, which include investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies around the world. (The term \u201cSputnik moment\u201d had first been applied to DeepSeek by the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.) Given China\u2019s formidable strength in computer engineering and basic scientific research, Gave\u2019s piece said, \u201cfighting a tech battle against (it) always seemed a short-sighted strategy.\u201d In our conversation, he reiterated this argument and said imposing the export restriction on China had been a big mistake, because \u201cit forced them to be very focused.\u201d The battle that Gave referred to started in 2018, when the Trump Administration banned the export of some key components for semiconductors to a Chinese telecommunications company and chipmaker, citing national-security grounds. The Biden Administration strengthened these restrictions several times, particularly as they applied to the most powerful chips made by Nvidia. In announcing the latest set of rules, last month, just a week before Trump\u2019s second Inauguration, then Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, \u201cThe U.S. leads the world in A.I. now, both A.I. development and A.I. chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way.\u201d By then, though, DeepSeek had already released its V3 large language model, and was on the verge of releasing its more specialized R1 model. The firm says it developed both models using lower-end Nvidia chips that didn\u2019t violate the U.S. export bans. \u201cDid DeepSeek happen in spite of the restrictions, or did it happen because of the restrictions?\u201d Gave asked me. To answer his own question, he dived into the past, bringing up the Tiger 1, a German tank deployed during the Second World War which outperformed British and American models despite having a gasoline engine that was less powerful and fuel-efficient than the diesel engines used in British and American models. \u201cI think you could find hundreds of examples through history of necessity being the mother of invention,\u201d he said. \u201cYou build a ten-foot wall; I\u2019ll build an eleven-foot ladder. China\u2019s just done this, and everybody is acting surprised.\u201d Some people in the U.S. tech industry have made similar comments. In a post on X, Pat Gelsinger, the former chief executive of Intel, wrote, \u201cEngineering is about constraints. The Chinese engineers had limited resources, and they had to find creative solutions.\u201d These workarounds seem to have included limiting the number of calculations that DeepSeek-R1 carries out relative to comparable models, and using the chips that were available to a Chinese company in ways that maximize their capabilities. In another post on X, Andrej Karpathy, a prominent computer scientist who was a co-founder of OpenAI and a former director of A.I. at Tesla, said that DeepSeek was \u201cmaking it look easy\u201d by training a \u201cfrontier-grade\u201d large language model \u201con a joke of a budget.\u201d Although the theory that imposing resource constraints spurs innovation isn\u2019t universally accepted, it does have some support from other industries and academic studies. A 2014 study of Swiss manufacturers found evidence to support the hypothesis. More recently, in a study of U.S. software startups published in December, two researchers at Harvard Business School and the University of Texas at Austin found firms that didn\u2019t receive any outside funding until later in their development tended to \u201cengage in a greater amount of experimentation with technologies, and also were more likely to carry out more significant changes to their technology stacks.\u201d The evidence is far from definitive; the intuitive counterargument is that having ample access to technical and financial resources facilitates more experimentation than conditions of scarcity. But, in any case, Gave insists that many Westerners have been greatly underestimating the ability of Chinese firms to innovate, rather than merely copy. He said that this tendency was now evident in many industries, including nuclear power, railways, solar panels, and electric vehicles, where the Shenzhen-based BYD has overtaken Tesla as the biggest E.V. producer in the world. In fact, Gave drew a direct comparison between A.I. and the auto industry. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all the criticisms that, if it wasn\u2019t for OpenAI, DeepSeek couldn\u2019t happen, but you could say exactly the same thing about car companies,\u201d he said. \u201cBYD wouldn\u2019t be here without Tesla. Sure, of course. But the fact remains that BYD is here. And it\u2019s a better car at a cheaper price.\u201d Elon Musk might strenuously dispute that final assertion, but there can be no doubt that the sudden arrival of DeepSeek, following on the heels of the rise of BYD and other Chinese E.V. manufacturers, has raised some awkward questions. \u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call to the West that there is no industry that is one-hundred-per-cent safe,\u201d Gave said. In the American A.I. industry, he went on, the belief had been that if you invested enough in A.I. hardware, you could create a big moat and a lasting monopoly. \u201cThat belief has been exploded as well,\u201d Gave added. I asked him what policy guidance he would give to the new Administration in Washington. \u201cMy job isn\u2019t to tell policymakers what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to say, Well, this is happening, how do we make money out of it?\u201d Still, Gave did offer some indirect advice. \u201cThe first thing is to acknowledge the reality that China is now leapfrogging the West in industry after industry,\u201d he said. In his opinion, this success reflects some fundamental features of the country, including the fact that it graduates twice as many students in mathematics, science, and engineering as the top five Western countries combined; that it has a large domestic market; and that its government provides extensive support for industrial companies, by, for example, leaning on the country\u2019s banks to extend credit to them. \u201cThey said, \u2018No more lending to real estate. We need to be an industrial superpower.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Gave\u2019s argument is that this strategy has already succeeded, and the emergence of DeepSeek is the latest and most dramatic evidence. His manner during our conversation was serious but also wry. He noted that, when he posts his arguments about China\u2019s economic progress on YouTube, as he occasionally does, they attract comments that he is spouting C.C.P. propaganda. This seemed to intrigue him rather than worry him. \u201cWhen it comes to China, there is an emotional response that makes it hard for people to accept simple facts,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u2666 Searching for the cause of a catastrophic plane crash.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"POLAND - 2025\/01\/28: In this photo illustration, the Deepseek logo is displayed on a smartphone with ... [+] stock market percentages in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) Both the stock and crypto markets took a hit after DeepSeek announced that they had created a version of ChatGPT, allegedly at a fraction of the cost\u20145.8 million, as compared to 17.9 billion. More significantly, the model was made free and open source, challenging the dominance of AI providers. With its cost-efficient Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the China-based AI model DeepSeek could shift AI leadership away from the US. In the short term, investor fear has definitely driven volatility, as seen by the AI coin sector dropping by 10%, reflecting concerns over potential disruptions to AI-based financial services. Dr Ben Goertzel, the CEO of SingularityNET and co-founder of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance comments: \"DeepSeek caused a crash in AI equities which has spilled over to a crash in AI tokens, which you see in FET price but also TAO, RNDR, etc. This is not really rational since DeepSeek is favorable for decentralized AI if you think about it logically\", highlighting the sentiment-driven crypto market. If DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model proves sustainable, it could change the dynamics of how AI is integrated into crypto\u2014but does lower cost always mean long-term efficiency? Well, there are a number of unquestionable angles where crypto, and AI agents specifically, will benefit from it, as listed by one of the crypto researchers, Alex Wacy. The AI sector is notoriously expensive, with large language models (LLMs) requiring billions in investment and computational resources. This high cost has traditionally limited AI development to major tech companies with significant capital and infrastructure. However, DeepSeek disrupts this status quo with an alleged new way of training models that is more cost-efficient. Unlike conventional AI models, which activate all parameters for every input, DeepSeek\u2019s MoE selectively engages with different experts for different tasks, which makes it far more efficient and reduces cost. As a result, this has enabled DeepSeek to not only challenge existing AI providers but also outperform Llama 3.1 405B and GPT-4o in key benchmarks, particularly in coding and math tasks, which is quite astonishing. Some AI-focused crypto projects that deal with model training and use ChatGPT have integrated DeepSeek-V3 into their platforms. So if DeepSeek\u2019s cost efficiency proves sustainable, it could significantly reduce the financial burden of AI-powered crypto applications, allowing decentralized AI services, onchain intelligence, and AI-enhanced DeFi tools to scale more efficiently.\\ At first, many investors started to speculate about the need for AI infrastructure, which caused the NVIDIA stock price to plummet. Yet, AI researchers pointed out Jevon\u2019s paradox, which states that greater efficiency will lead to increased demand. In other words, AI innovations will intensify with a lower infrastructure cost, driving investor interest. The open-source concept is not alien to crypto folks, where decentralization and transparency are core principles. However, the fact that a model performing better than some of the biggest plays in the space has been opened to the public is mind-blowing. This lowers the barriers to entry for AI-driven crypto applications without reliance on centralized providers. Yet, with accessibility comes risk. It is unclear if something like this could cause cybersecurity threats. With deepfake generation, automated phishing scams, and more, these bad actors now have access to unprecedented tools for malicious activity, where blockchain networks must adopt AI-native defenses just to keep up. However, leading voices in AI and crypto, such as the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI), take a different stance. Rather than viewing DeepSeek as a security risk, ASI sees it as \u2018a step towards democratizing AI within the crypto sector\u2019. A more positive approach yet highlighting a key philosophical divide in the AI and crypto sector. FOMO and capital movements always go hand in hand with significant market news, and DeepSeek\u2019s announcement was no exception. The initial panic saw AI-related crypto projects drop, reflecting concerns over disruption to AI-powered financial services. However, the market reaction appears to be stabilizing, with several major AI crypto projects like Bittensor and ICP recovering. While DeepSeek has undoubtedly made the topic of AI an even hotter topic of conversation, its long-term impact on the crypto sector remains uncertain. If its cost efficiency and open-source model prove sustainable, it could accelerate AI adoption in DeFi, blockchain security, and onchain intelligence. However, the balance between accessibility, decentralization, and security risks will ultimately determine whether DeepSeek is a catalyst for innovation or a challenge to existing AI-integrated crypto ecosystems.

All rights reserved. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Last updated 2 days ago To celebrate 2025, I compiled Apple's top ten major areas of innovation over the past 25 years. Let's look at the decisions that led to this blockbuster success of the iPod and implications for new products today. \r The first segment discussed Apple's 2000 release of Mac OS X Public Beta, its most important innovation in the last 25 years. The second segment focused on Apple's reinvented retail operations. The third segment looks at iPod. \rApple cheats death with a strategy of innovationIf the \"Apple Computer\" of the new millennium had only focused on retrofitting the Macintosh to sell as its principal money maker, it is unlikely it would have survived a decade. At the time, Apple was selling about 3 million Macs annually. Apple was beleaguered. \rApple was also innovating. It had launched a series of well received Mac products, from the original 1998 iMac G3, to the 1999 iBook, the 1999 \"supercomputer\" Power Mac G4 and the titanium PowerBook G4 in early 2001. Cautious optimism was beginning to sprout about the company's turn around under the initial years of Steve Jobs' charismatic and pragmatic reinvention of the company. \rConcerns arose from dark clouds during the Dot Com boom. Apple's PowerMac G4 Cube, released just as the market peaked, faced tepid sales. The stock market crash further affected demand. The fancy but pricey Cube was a less than compelling choice for many core customers in creative markets or education. Apple misjudged its potential audience right before its buyers were increasingly forced to retreat away from luxury purchases.\rIt appeared there was an inherently limited potential audience for Macs, and that was a problem for Apple. Increasing competition from cheap commodity PCs further eroded sales prospects for high-end desktop and laptop computers. Apple really needed something to goose its sales. \rTo boost Mac demand among professionals, Jobs' Apple focused on producing exclusive new software titles. Apple acquired Final Cut from Macromedia in 1998 and relaunched it as Final Cut Pro in 1999. Three years later, it acquired Logic from Emagic. One of Apple's greatest innovations was to leverage great software to help sell its hardware. \rAt the same time, Apple embarked upon a similar strategy for home and education users, launching iMovie in 1999 as an easy to use movie editor alongside the New iMac DV. That same year, Apple bought SoundJam MP from developer Casady & Greene, with the intent to turn the music library software into iTunes. \r Apple pursued an innovative strategy of launching creative, easy to use new first party apps to drive interest in its Mac hardware. This created a \"digital hub\" for users, where the Mac transformed from being just a browser and email machine into a creative center for a user's increasingly connected \"digital life\" of movies, photos and music.\rApple wasn't making tremendous revenues from selling its software. These new titles existed primarily to drive Mac adoption. But having its own bundled software opened up new opportunities for the company, with the first clearly being its new accessory for iTunes that acted as a remote \"pod\" for taking desktop music anywhere. \rThe revolution of portable media with iPod in 2001Apple didn't invent portable music. While the company did pioneer key elements of desktop editing of digital audio and even digital video a decade earlier with QuickTime in the early 90s, its reliance on third party developers to actually make use of its QuickTime middleware to deliver powerful Mac apps began to falter with the release of Microsoft's Windows 95. \rThe creative tools industry, including Adobe and Macromedia, began to focus on volume PC customers with Windows versions of their products. Microsoft was also doing all it could to scuttle Apple's QuickTime. It pushed its partners to stop using and distributing Apple's software in favor of its own. Microsoft even stole code from Apple's QuickTime to improve the performance of its own media software for Windows. \rOn the music front in particular, Microsoft also began to pursue a strategy of tying all commercial music to its own proprietary players via its Digital Rights Management security software. It wouldn't matter how attractive Apple's music hardware and software were if its much more powerful PC competitor controlled the spigot of all licensed music and could turn this off for Mac users on a whim. \rApple's iTunes strategy recognized this threat. It attempted to create an alternative to Microsoft's Windows Media and Sony's parallel efforts to lock up commercial music with its own DRM. In 2001, iTunes launched with the advertising campaign \"Rip. Mix. Burn,\" alongside a new iMac with Apple's first CD-RW optical drive. \r Apple wasn't first to install rewritable disc recorders in a PC, but the combination of iTunes' ease of use within the overall Mac package resonated with users. Part of Apple's strategy of innovation was simply recognizing what people wanted to do, and doing the work to make that easier. \rBy freeing users to ingest their existing CD libraries and burn selected playlists onto standard CDs they could use anywhere, an iMac running iTunes offered a vastly better experience than the complex and restrictive rule sets Microsoft and Sony were attempting to push on users. \rMicrosoft was catering to its music partners, offering them broad flexibility with Windows Media to limit how users could use their own songs. Sony was largely working to link media sales to its own hardware, notably its new MiniDisc portable format that encouraged users to buy another new media format. It even limited what users could put on their own MDs. \rApple was selling a superior experience directly to its customers. Its entire strategy was designed explicitly for its customers, not for its partners. Many recording labels were initially hostile to the concept of users making copies of their own music, even though music piracy had already become well established. While Microsoft and Sony were trying to put that cat back into the bag, Apple was offering an entirely new way to think about music\u2014  initially to sell Macs, then to sell its own music player.\rThe revolution of portable media playersMP3 players had already become popular devices by the late 90s, but they had a few significant shortcomings. In order to store more than just a few songs, they either had to use rewritable optical media or a conventional hard drive, both of which were bulky and fragile. \rNavigating the music on such a device quickly became unwieldy as song libraries expanded. The connectivity between players and a PC capable of copying song files to the portable device was also problematically slow. Battery life was an issue. Solid state storage was still too expensive to use liberally. \rApple fortunately had a variety of solutions already. Its work with digital video had resulted in Macs getting fast Firewire ports starting in 1999. The new iTunes offered a way to organize and sort files on a powerful computer, and to apply metadata to help navigate large libraries on an external device. \rToshiba had developed a compact hard drive it was shopping around to buyers without finding much interest. Seeking to enter the music player business, Apple launched a team under Tony Fadell to turn the concept into an attractive product. \r Apple's limited experience in consumer products outside of Macs meant that much of the iPod's details were contracted to others. PortalPlayer software and a UI system by Pixo helped Apple focus its internal work on the hardware experience and its integration with iTunes. The result was a luxurious 5MB portable system with fast FireWire connectivity. Bulky HD and optical players suddenly looked really old fashioned, and their serial or USB 1.1 speeds felt anemic in comparison. \rApple also benefitted from its prior decade of experience with laptops and batteries, but it still had to develop significant elements of iPod's portable hardware from scratch, or rely on third party chips and other components. The real product Apple was selling was the iPod experience. \rToday, Apple has the size and resources to custom develop its own software from apps to the OS to the underlying firmware. It designs its own hardware right down to the silicon in many cases. But what Apple continues to sell is still an overall experience.\rThe revolution of a portable AppleInitial sales of iPods were, by today's standards, relatively limited. In 2002, its first fiscal year of iPods, Apple had sold fewer than 400,000 units. In 2003 it sold nearly a million. But in 2004 that figure jumped to 4.4 million, followed by more than 22 million in 2005 and almost 40 million in 2006.\rThe exploding growth and expansion of the iPod family of devices radically shifted Apple from being a fringe computer maker to being a very high volume device manufacturer. Apple was not only selling incredible volumes of devices, but also buying up vast strategic reserves of components such as RAM and hard drives.\rApple's high volume purchases for iPod also helped improved its negotiating power for Mac components. It also took lessons learned from iPod to its Mac models. Experience with iPod also helped to commodify components of the Mac. \rWhile FireWire was initially much faster than USB 1.1, Apple quickly incorporated early support for USB 2.0 to help sell iPods to Windows users. It also ported iTunes to PCs, giving many Windows users their initial introduction to the Apple world.\riPod also played a key role in the company's newly built Apple Stores. It brought in an entirely new group of users and introduced them to the Mac. It also helped establish the Apple Store as a showplace for regular new introductions of iPod models.\rHigh volume iPod sales also helped Apple partner with third party accessory makers. Apple's own clumsy attempts to deliver accessories, ranging from iPod Socks to iPod HiFi, made it essential for the company to work with smaller developers who could try out a range of options to fit users needs. \rDid it have to be iPod?In retrospect, Apple's monumental success with iPod and all of its surrounding innovations, the halo it cast over the Mac, and the foundation it helped lay for Apple's forthcoming portable and wearable products, all seem as if they could have been applied anywhere.\rWhy did Apple pick portable music as its focus, rather than say, digital photography? Was iPod just the success Apple created from of a random strategic choice and just a lot of clever marketing? Could the same amount of effort just as well have been invested into an \"iCam\" with the same results?\rThe Apple of the 1990s had actually already pursued multiple experiments in portable devices categories. It most famously began work on a \"digital assistant\" that became the Newton MessagePad in 1994.\rApple spent tremendous funds developing custom OS software, a unique programming environment, innovative stylus-based apps and services, and even bespoke ARM chips suited to the mobile device. \rRather than being a smash success, Newton actually suffered from being excessively ambitious\u2014  it wasn't quite finished at launch and cost too much to be broadly attractive for what it could do. \rIt's less well known that Apple also pioneered digital photography, working with Kodak to deliver QuickTake cameras starting in 1994. Like iPod later would, this product also leveraged Apple's multimedia software to manage and organize its digital files. Unlike iPod, Apple's QuickTake cameras arrived without the showcasing power of its forthcoming Apple Stores. \r QuickTake 100Like Newton, QuickTake cameras were quite expensive and limited in what they could actually accomplish. Also like Newton, the QuickTake line was quickly discontinued by Jobs after his return to Apple in order to simplify operations.\rWhat prevented Apple from returning to digital cameras in 2001, rather than shifting its mobile focus to digital music with iPod? \rIn part, digital cameras offered Apple a lot less commercial opportunity. By 2001, digital imaging technology had improved significantly, but most of the value in the industry was being captured by high end camera makers selling professional digital cameras priced closer to $8,000. \rPro photography users could afford to benefit from the advantages of shooting digitally, but they represented a much smaller market with limited potential for growth. \rConsumer digital cameras priced around the $800 range of QuickTake offered limited advantages over more affordable, standard film cameras. Quality at that price point was still struggling to catch up to film, while film photos could already be digitized after they were developed, even put on a Photo CD for use with computers. \rApple's digital camera competitors were also a lot better established and competent than makers of MP3 players. Apple had less to offer in terms of improving upon the experience of cameras compared to what it could do to make a better MP3 player. \rAmong camera makers, there were lots of very competent, highly competitive manufacturers already well versed in advanced optics and increasingly sophisticated custom chips and digital sensors, and were adept in delivering general usability. These makers were also already making money from their film cameras. \rMP3 manufacturing was scattered across smaller players making bulky optical or hard drive players, or very limited Flash Memory devices. USB had arrived but was still slow. It would be easy to liken the MP3 market in 2001 to where mobile phones were in 2007, or smart watches in 2014, or VR headsets in 2024. \riPod's music supplyAnother strategic element essential to iPod was missing in the market for digital photography. While end users could create their own music just as they would take their own photos, most music listeners would be trying to listen to commercially recorded music.\rDigital cameras weren't similarly offering to play TV and movies or offering users a library of stock photography to view. In fact, a major reason why Apple pursued iPod was the parallel potential offered by what would become the iTunes Music Store. There was no analog for digital cameras.\rToday we may think of the iTunes Music Store as a major new profit center for Apple, but its original impetus wasn't making lots of money. Instead, much of Apple's strategy for iTunes was simply aimed at making a parallel source for commercial content for Macs and iPods. \rApple was focused on selling hardware and earning the majority of its profits from Macs and later iPods. It frequently acknowledged, initially, that it was running iTunes Music Store at break-even.\r Around 2000, the digital music industry was being held back by Microsoft and Sony's rival efforts to push their own DRM. If Microsoft and Sony had succeeded in locking up commercially recorded music with their DRM, the market for all of Apple's hardware would have been imperiled. \rThere is limited appreciation of Apple's expertly delicate dance over the 2000s\u2014  first embracing ripped CDs, then transitioning to single track music sales in the iTunes Music Store, and then introducing FairPlay DRM to appease music labels without turning off its customers. \rThe development of iTunes in parallel with iPod required an entirely new way of thinking about digital content that is remarkable enough to deserve its own top ten article. \riPod legacyBefore looking at the iTunes Store, consider the lasting legacy of Apple's investment and innovation in its digital music hardware.\rApple's initial, incremental sales of iPods helped the product to rapidly improve. Between 2001-2003, consumer demand for more storage took the original 5GB iPod to 10GB and then 20GB models, facilitated by the shrinking sizes and increasing densities of hard drives.\rApple didn't develop these hard drive mechanisms. Instead it relied on a series of competitive suppliers all seeking to deliver better components to win Apple's high volume business. Today, Apple similarly doesn't create all of its own components. It relies on Sony and Samsung for cameras and displays, and uses storage and RAM developed by others. \rWhile Jobs was credited with the vision of what iPod should look like and how it should feel, it was Apple's operations executive Tim Cook that brokered the company's exclusive component deals, giving it competitive advantages over other companies seeking to enter the music player market. \rIf Apple had tried to build everything on its own, it would end up heavily invested in high risk industries like memory and sensors just like Sony and Samsung, and reliant on others to help it sell what it had developed. \rInstead, Apple has selected certain strategic areas where it can beat the rest of the industry\u2014  such as today's Apple Silicon\u2014  while relying on many commodity parts advanced by others. Much of the innovation was driven by gathering the understanding of where it could add value, and where it could lean on partners. \rApple not only negotiated massive supplier deals for iPods, but also expanded sales of iPods with key partners. In 2004, the significantly larger HP began licensing Apple's iPod instead of developing its own product. \rThat same year, Microsoft rushed out its own Windows Portable Media Center and began licensing its designs for Portable Media Players with Samsung, Creative, iRiver and other PC and device makers. \rMicrosoft's failure to beat Apple's iPod with its \"Windows\" branded alternatives cast the first serious doubts over Microsoft's supremacy in the tech world. The company sealed that fate with the Zune, introduced in 2006, even before Apple's iPhone obliterated Microsoft's other mobile efforts. This dramatically shifted views on Macs as well. \rApple didn't just sit back and rake in iPod profits. Instead, it relentlessly innovated in creating new tiers of iPods. In 2004 Apple launched iPod mini using an even smaller, thinner hard drive. It was offered it multiple colors as a more affordable option. Its high volume sales continued to keep Apple a competitive component buyer and honed its design capabilities. \rApple's increasingly precise and exacting design and manufacturing capacity greatly improved the Mac as well, helping to transform the iMac into a tightly integrated package behind an LCD. This also helped Apple to increasingly improve upon the size and durability of MacBooks and their batteries and storage.\r In 2005 Apple introduced iPod nano using Flash Memory instead of a hard drive. The company preferred to rapidly cannibalize its own product lineup to stay competitive and innovative. The nano accelerated the mini's focus on fashion and helped Apple shift away from tech specs into being an aspirational brand.    \rApple's mass consumption of Flash Storage for years of iPod nano helped prepare the company to pioneer the use of SSD storage in the forthcoming MacBook Air in 2008.\rAlongside iPod nano in 2005, Apple introduced iPod Shuffle, an ultra-portable version with no screen, emphasizing simplicity and affordability. Its smaller size and random music playback focused on a new role in running and workouts. \rParallel with these two new smaller directions for iPod, 2005's iPod Video shifted the high end iPod into being a more sophisticated multimedia device for presenting TV shows, movies and music videos. That functionality expanded Apple's media leverage beyond music and acted as a shoulder for iPhone to stand on at its launch two years later. \rNot only did iPod blossom into iPhones, but the wrist-wearable 6th generation iPod nano effectively inspired the later development of Apple Watch, completely shifting the company from being a device maker to being a lifestyle brand selling luxury wearables. \rYou could even make the case that iPod played a role in defining today's Vision Pro. Unlike many others in the AR\/VR space, Vision Pro was created as a standalone, self contained device that can sync with your other devices as a peer, rather than being tethered from them as a mere peripheral.\riPod defined the decade of the 2000s. It shaped the development of Apple's global supply chains for consumer devices, and helped revolutionize how we use digital media. It survives, not as hardware, but as software functionality. Its hardware wasn't even officially discontinued until 2022.\r Vision Pro is an iPod for your eyesiPod wasn't one single innovation or invention but rather a continuation of strategic developments that successfully pursued increasing areas of utility, multiple price points, and radically shifting form factors. \rImagine if the world had paid attention to early critics pouting about missing features or had cared that early sales took some time to really shift the computing landscape and change everything! \rThat provides some perspective for Vision Pro today, at a time when Apple has far more market power and the ability to develop its own custom silicon and even produce its own bespoke immersive content. Vision Pro is, effectively, an iPod for your eyes.  The first segment discussed Apple's 2000 release of Mac OS X Public Beta, its most important innovation in the last 25 years.

If Microsoft and Sony had succeeded in locking up commercially recorded music with their DRM, the market for all of Apple's hardware would have been imperiled. \r There is limited appreciation of Apple's expertly delicate dance over the 2000s\u2014  first embracing ripped CDs, then transitioning to single track music sales in the iTunes Music Store, and then introducing FairPlay DRM to appease music labels without turning off its customers. \r The development of iTunes in parallel with iPod required an entirely new way of thinking about digital content that is remarkable enough to deserve its own top ten article. \r Before looking at the iTunes Store, consider the lasting legacy of Apple's investment and innovation in its digital music hardware.\r Apple's initial, incremental sales of iPods helped the product to rapidly improve. Between 2001-2003, consumer demand for more storage took the original 5GB iPod to 10GB and then 20GB models, facilitated by the shrinking sizes and increasing densities of hard drives.\r Apple didn't develop these hard drive mechanisms. Instead it relied on a series of competitive suppliers all seeking to deliver better components to win Apple's high volume business. Today, Apple similarly doesn't create all of its own components. It relies on Sony and Samsung for cameras and displays, and uses storage and RAM developed by others. \r While Jobs was credited with the vision of what iPod should look like and how it should feel, it was Apple's operations executive Tim Cook that brokered the company's exclusive component deals, giving it competitive advantages over other companies seeking to enter the music player market. \r If Apple had tried to build everything on its own, it would end up heavily invested in high risk industries like memory and sensors just like Sony and Samsung, and reliant on others to help it sell what it had developed. \r Instead, Apple has selected certain strategic areas where it can beat the rest of the industry\u2014  such as today's Apple Silicon\u2014  while relying on many commodity parts advanced by others. Much of the innovation was driven by gathering the understanding of where it could add value, and where it could lean on partners. \r Apple not only negotiated massive supplier deals for iPods, but also expanded sales of iPods with key partners. In 2004, the significantly larger HP began licensing Apple's iPod instead of developing its own product. \r That same year, Microsoft rushed out its own Windows Portable Media Center and began licensing its designs for Portable Media Players with Samsung, Creative, iRiver and other PC and device makers. \r Microsoft's failure to beat Apple's iPod with its \"Windows\" branded alternatives cast the first serious doubts over Microsoft's supremacy in the tech world. The company sealed that fate with the Zune, introduced in 2006, even before Apple's iPhone obliterated Microsoft's other mobile efforts. This dramatically shifted views on Macs as well. \r Apple didn't just sit back and rake in iPod profits. Instead, it relentlessly innovated in creating new tiers of iPods. In 2004 Apple launched iPod mini using an even smaller, thinner hard drive. It was offered it multiple colors as a more affordable option. Its high volume sales continued to keep Apple a competitive component buyer and honed its design capabilities. \r Apple's increasingly precise and exacting design and manufacturing capacity greatly improved the Mac as well, helping to transform the iMac into a tightly integrated package behind an LCD. This also helped Apple to increasingly improve upon the size and durability of MacBooks and their batteries and storage.\r In 2005 Apple introduced iPod nano using Flash Memory instead of a hard drive. The company preferred to rapidly cannibalize its own product lineup to stay competitive and innovative. The nano accelerated the mini's focus on fashion and helped Apple shift away from tech specs into being an aspirational brand.    \r Apple's mass consumption of Flash Storage for years of iPod nano helped prepare the company to pioneer the use of SSD storage in the forthcoming MacBook Air in 2008.\r Alongside iPod nano in 2005, Apple introduced iPod Shuffle, an ultra-portable version with no screen, emphasizing simplicity and affordability. Its smaller size and random music playback focused on a new role in running and workouts. \r Parallel with these two new smaller directions for iPod, 2005's iPod Video shifted the high end iPod into being a more sophisticated multimedia device for presenting TV shows, movies and music videos. That functionality expanded Apple's media leverage beyond music and acted as a shoulder for iPhone to stand on at its launch two years later. \r Not only did iPod blossom into iPhones, but the wrist-wearable 6th generation iPod nano effectively inspired the later development of Apple Watch, completely shifting the company from being a device maker to being a lifestyle brand selling luxury wearables. \r You could even make the case that iPod played a role in defining today's Vision Pro. Unlike many others in the AR\/VR space, Vision Pro was created as a standalone, self contained device that can sync with your other devices as a peer, rather than being tethered from them as a mere peripheral.\r iPod defined the decade of the 2000s. It shaped the development of Apple's global supply chains for consumer devices, and helped revolutionize how we use digital media. It survives, not as hardware, but as software functionality. Its hardware wasn't even officially discontinued until 2022.\r iPod wasn't one single innovation or invention but rather a continuation of strategic developments that successfully pursued increasing areas of utility, multiple price points, and radically shifting form factors. \r Imagine if the world had paid attention to early critics pouting about missing features or had cared that early sales took some time to really shift the computing landscape and change everything! \r That provides some perspective for Vision Pro today, at a time when Apple has far more market power and the ability to develop its own custom silicon and even produce its own bespoke immersive content. Vision Pro is, effectively, an iPod for your eyes.  Dan worked as a journalist covering the tech industry, and in particular Apple, for more than 15 years.

Layden believes that Microsoft can benefit from having a wider market to sell its games to as part of its new multiplatform strategy, but the downside to this is that it could possibly make it harder for the company to attract more people to its platform. \"Multiplatform is a strategy, particularly in a world where the cost of development is increasing dramatically,\" Layden said to YouTube channel Kiwi Talks. \"Multiplatform means widening your addressable market, as the marketing guys say. How do you create the fear of missing out, trying to do that by bringing everyone to your platform? Saying, 'If you're not here you're missing out,' but if it's available on all platforms, that's one of your marketing tactics. You can't say it's only available here if it's available everywhere. So it's a balancing act, right? I'm increasing my addressable market, that's good. I'm making it harder to sell only on my platform.\" As Layden noted, there was precedent for this shift in business tactics, as following the launch and poor sales of the Dreamcast, Sega dropped out of the console hardware race to focus on developing and publishing video games. \"We've seen it before. I mean I was in the business when Sega brought their Dreamcast titles to PlayStation 2. And in time, Sega became a software-only company and have been a great transformation in that respect,\" Layden said. Microsoft has two big games on the way to PS5 consoles this year. Last year it was confirmed that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would reach that platform several months after its Xbox and PC launch, and last week, the company revealed that Forza Horizon 5 will also race onto PS5 in spring. In terms of hardware, Xbox Series X|S sales are reportedly behind the Xbox One at the same point in both of their lifecycles, while the PS5 is outpacing the PS4. The good news for Microsoft is that its multiplatform approach appears to be paying off as it was apparently the number-one video game publisher in December 2024 thanks partly to its Call of Duty games.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Tesla sales in Europe are plummeting fast. Electrek reports that, year over year, sales are down 18 percent in the United Kingdom, 31 percent in Portugal, more than 40 percent in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands, 63 percent in France, and a whopping 75 percent in Spain. Overall, the takeaway seems to be that Europeans want Elon Musk and his fancy car company to fuck right off. Some media outlets have linked the company\u2019s cratering sales to its CEO\u2019s growing unpopularity. That would make sense, since Musk has spent the last several months openly meddling in political systems all over Europe. Musk has used his social media platform, X, to attack European leaders (including the prime minister of Britain and regulators in Ireland), has endorsed a far-right party in Germany that is alleged to have ties to neo-Nazis, and has fostered ties to Italy\u2019s rightwing prime minister. Musk has also attempted to conjure a MAGA equivalent in Europe dubbed \u201cMEGA,\u201d or Make Europe Great Again. It would appear that Musk\u2019s favorability in many of these countries is quite low. A recent YouGov poll found that most citizens of Germany and the UK thought Musk was ignorant of their countries and should stay out of their politics. Musk and Tesla also recently engaged in a high-profile battle with a number of Scandinavian unions, tarring his image with organized labor on the continent. As fun as it is to imagine that Europeans are boycotting Elon\u2019s cars because they hate him so much, other factors may also be at play. Tesla\u2019s sales were already declining in Europe prior to the recent numbers. Indeed, the company\u2019s EV sales saw a 13 percent drop in the EU last year, experiencing declines in Germany, Italy, France, and other places. Some of Tesla\u2019s declines could also be explained by the introduction of rival EV companies to these markets, as well as by increasingly steep regulatory hurdles that car companies need to jump through. Tesla\u2019s sales also recently plummeted in California, which is the company\u2019s biggest market in the U.S. by far. Bloomberg reports that sales of the Model 3\u00e2\u0080\u0094considered the company\u2019s second most popular model\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u201dplunged 36%\u201d from the previous year. Overall, California sales for Tesla fell approximately 8% in 2024\u2019s fourth quarter and were down 12% for the year. This represents the first annual drop in sales for Musk\u2019s company in the state. The California New Car Dealers Association said, of Tesla: \u201cThings aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking so golden for EV automaker Tesla in the Golden State. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominance in the electric vehicle market continues to falter as the brand reported its fifth consecutive quarterly registration decline.\u201d Maybe this has something to do with the fact that Musk has compared California to communist China, and encouraged companies and people to move out of the state. Or maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s hitched his wagon to Donald Trump\u2019s star\u00e2\u0080\u0094a politician most Californians hate. Or maybe it\u2019s because he recently made what looked a whole helluva lot like a Nazi salute\u00c2\u00a0at a political rally. All of these seem like viable possibilities. Tesla\u2019s sales were down globally by 1.1 percent last year, the first decline for the company in over a decade, the Associated Press has reported. In short: Elon Musk may be such a huge asshole that it is effectively killing his business. Of course, now that Musk has effectively hijacked the U.S. government, there are numerous ways that the billionaire can leverage its powers to privilege his businesses and keep them booming. That may be the only way Musk can keep his companies ascendent since people all over the world increasingly seem to hate him.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Climate change could wipe out a whopping $1.47 trillion in real estate value over the next 30 years and fundamentally transform the housing market, according to a new report.  The study from First Street found some troubling results for the residential real estate industry, currently valued at $50 trillion. It said climate change is transforming the housing market via \u201csoaring insurance costs and shifting consumer preferences.\u201d  The trends are creating a so-called \u201cfeedback loop where climate risks drive population movements and reshape property values across the nation, fundamentally altering traditional patterns of real estate growth and community development,\u201d the report said. In many climate-change prone places, insurance costs are rising much faster than mortgage payments, made worse by that the fact that the states where people are moving to in the Sun Belt are the same ones absorbing most of the natural disaster costs. Since 1980, 40% of the $2.8 trillion in natural disaster costs have been in Florida, Texas, and California. Insurance costs in these states have risen exponentially, making it harder for people to afford to protect their home. The report found the five largest metro areas facing the highest insurance premium increases are Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, New Orleans, and Sacramento. The report also predicts in the next few decades, climate changes and insurance costs will cause 55 million Americans to \u201cvoluntarily relocate within the U.S. to areas less vulnerable to climate risks by 2055.\u201d This, in turn, has the potential transform local markets, affecting more than 70,000 neighborhoods in 84% of all census tracks and decreasing home values. Combined with rising insurance costs, some communities might be all but abandoned and many could become economically untenable for homeowners.  \u201cEconomic strength alone may not be sufficient to retain population in areas facing severe climate impacts, as evidenced by projected \u2018tipping points\u2019; in some currently growing metropolitan areas,\u201d the report said.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  For American automakers, the consequences of President Donald Trump's tariffs are likely unavoidable, even for those with a strong US manufacturing presence, such as Ford, Rivian, and Tesla.          A 25% levy on incoming goods from Canada and Mexico will impact almost all US carmakers because they've come to rely on their North American partners for not just large tasks such as vehicle assembly but also for smaller components such as engines, seats, and wiring.               The effects won't be even across the board.       General Motors, for example, could feel more of the blowfrom Trump's tariffs than others. In 2024, GM produced nearly 900,000 vehicles in Mexico, according to Statista data.       GM CEO Mary Barra said in an earnings call in January that the automaker has measures that it could take to soften the impacts of tariffs, in part by looking toward its other international sources.               \"So there's plays that we can do on that perspective to minimize the impact if there are tariffs either on Canada or Mexico,\" Barra said at the time.               A spokesperson for GM did not respond to a request for comment.               Even companies that manufacture most, if not all, of their cars in the US will have to strategize around mitigating the costs of tariffs.               Final assembly for Teslas, for example, takes place in the US. Still, a filing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that between 20% and 25% of the components from Tesla's 2025 model-year vehicles come from Mexico.               \"There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs,\" Tesla's Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said in an earnings call on January 29. \"Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any will have an impact on our business and profitability.\"       Rivian, an EV startup based in southern California, also produces pickup trucks and SUVs in Illinois, with another Georgia plant planned for construction.               Still, CEO RJ Scaringe recognized the importance of Mexico's role in the US auto industry during a roundtable interview with reporters in January. He has also said that the company has been bracing for tariffs from the Trump administration.               \"The auto industry, uniquely for the United States, is dependent on Mexico as a source of a lot of our supply chain. That's sort of been built over many, many decades,\" he said, adding that the sourcing will need to be \"remapped\" if tariffs were implemented.               Vidya Rajagopalan, Rivian's senior vice president of electrical hardware, told reporters during a tour of the company's Palo Alto office thatcontract manufacturers haven't \"been sleeping\" and will start to ramp up sourcing in Vietnam or other countries not levied with tariffs.               Spokespeople for Tesla and Rivian did not respond to a request for comment.       Ford\u00a0might not feel the effects of Trump's tariffs as much as its legacy counterpart, GM, even though it, too, produces some of its vehicles in Canada and Mexico. The Bronco Sport, Maverick, and Mustang Mach-E are assembled south of the border. The company announced last year that it would assemble its F-Series Super Duty pickup trucks in Ontario, Canada, starting in 2026.               At the Barclays Global Automotive and Mobility Tech Conference in November, Ford's Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said that the carmaker is the \"number one producer in the US,\" but the impacts of tariffs will be uncertain.               \"Remember, it's four years,\" Lawler said at the time, appearing to reference the length of Trump's second term, \"and we don't know how lasting this will be.\"               A Ford spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  When Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas saw the news that his company had unseated perennial winner Costco as the top-rated retailer for customer satisfaction, he was understandably pleased \u2014 but he didn't bask in the feeling for long.          \"There's more to do,\" he told Business Insider in an interview. \"Nothing happens by accident.\"               The jump in Sam's Club's score \u2014 leapfrogging Costco's similarly strong rating \u2014 follows a busy year in which the Walmart-owned warehouse club rolled out new futuristic tech intended to make shopping easier and more enjoyable.               It was one year ago that the company announced its AI-powered exit gateways that are doing away with one of the biggest frustrations of shopping at a warehouse club: receipt checks at the exit. And in October, Sam's Club opened its first location without traditional checkout lanes.               It's a bold bet as some other retailers, like Amazon, pulled back from using AI-powered \"Just Walk Out\" cashierless tech at its Fresh stores in favor of smart carts, and others, including Target, have put new limits on self-service options at many locations.               For Sam's Club, it's part of a longer-term strategy to give it a high-tech edge in the historically low-tech warehouse retail segment. The company says more than half of customers at locations with the AI scan-and-go option use the tech, and it's helped the shoppers get out the door 23% faster.               \"This is all a result of working really hard at the inputs and then the outputs heal themselves,\" Nicholas said. \"Because we're building digital products for our associates as well as for our members, it means you create connected experiences that allow people to self-solve and work together on having a delightful experience.\"               One advantage that warehouse clubs, in general, have over their traditional retail counterparts is much more detailed information about shoppers' purchase histories, as a membership is required for every purchase. (General retailers can still piece together a profile using payment or loyalty cards, of course.)               At Sam's Club, however, member profiles are augmented by massive amounts of digital data, plus additional insights from the 50,000-strong Members Mark community of shoppers that share feedback on products and services.               \"It's certainly true that we've had this treasure trove of data, and we've been on this journey the last couple of years to really hone it so that we understand and can use this data more specifically,\" Nicholas said.               Although Sam's Club doesn't publicly report detailed financial results, one consistent bright spot in Walmart's earnings in recent years has been the growth of revenue from memberships and from retail media.               In addition, Nicholas notes that much of the tech investment expenses for Sam's Club are borne by Walmart's deeper pockets, since the club has often served as an innovation lab for the world's largest retailer.               With all of this data, Nicholas says he decided to put one person in charge of turning it into a more effective flywheel for the business.               \"The faster the flywheel spins, the more that virtuous circle helps you open up even a deeper gap versus everybody else,\" he said.               In this spirit, Sam's Club has appointed Diana Marshall, who was previously chief growth officer, as its new chief experience officer. Marshall will report directly to Nicholas.               CXO is a title that Constellation Research founder Ray Wang told BI is more typically found reporting to the CEO at tech, hospitality, travel, or financial services companies than at retailers. Sam's Club said it consulted with Wang on the strategy.               \"We see chief experience officers, in general, playing a bigger and bigger role because you're basically differentiating on time and experience,\" Wang said. \"If they are saving time, they'll pay a premium. If they get a better experience, they'll pay a premium.\"               Nicholas said that Sam's Club is committed to the long-standing warehouse club business model of earning most of its profits from membership income. That means any revenues \u2014 say, from the expected $100 billion retail media advertising market \u2014 will be reinvested in the business in the form of better technology, higher wages, and lower prices.               \"I think we can create these unexpected, unforgettable, connected experiences from members, and I believe genuinely that that's going to redefine what the future of retail looks like,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  President Trump's Saturday executive order placing tariffs on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico sent shockwaves through global markets.          But another part of the order has also had e-commerce brands scrambling for solutions. It targets a loophole in US customs law that has been used by e-commerce disruptors like Shein and Temu and many American companies.       Section 321, also known as de minimis, allows importers to avoid paying duty and tax on shipments that are valued at less than $800 and going directly to customers. Shippers using de minimis do not have to provide as much information to US Customs and Border Protection as shippers using more traditional methods would. Opponents of the provision have argued that since de minimis shipments are often not inspected, they have allowed bad actors to import illicit goods like fentanyl into the US.               Saturday's executive order closes that loophole, at least in part. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the future of de minimis.               The executive order imposes tariffs on goods originating in China, Mexico, and Canada and specifically calls out Canada for its failure \"to do more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept DTOs [drug trafficking organizations], other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.\" It does not mention de minimis shipments originating in countries aside from the three listed, leaving open the possibility that the loophole could still be used elsewhere.               Companies that have relied on de minimis are trying to quickly make changes to their business models.               Maggie Barnett, CEO of third-party logistics provider LVK, said that some direct-to-consumer brands she spoke with over the weekend are facing cash-flow issues because they have relied on the de minimis provision to import their goods into Mexico or Canada before shipping them to customers in the US duty-free. They may have to raise their prices.               \"They're used to not having to pay this money upfront before sales come, if at all,\" Barnett told Business Insider.               She said the company is advising its customers to weigh their options before revamping their supply chains in response to the executive order.               \"Making changes to your supply chain can be very costly, and you wouldn't want to completely change your supply chain and then have a new announcement drop,\" she said. \"I would urge all brands to be very cautious and to find optionality in their approach to their supply chains.\"               That could mean working with a US-based third-party logistics company if they don't already, or starting to work with suppliers in countries not affected by the executive order.               Portless, a startup that replicates Shein's model by fulfilling online brands' orders in China and then shipping them directly to customers, told BI on Monday that it would shift to using other methods like Entry Type 11. Entry 11 is faster than traditional types of import, but it does require importers to pay tax.Portless will now pay its customers' import duties upfront and then issue a monthly invoice for brands to cover.               \"We've been preparing for this potential change over the last few months,\" CEO Izzy Rosenzweig said.               Some US politicians have called for reform to the de minimis provision in recent years, arguing it creates unfair competition for American companies and furthers trade of illicit goods.               The rise of Shein and Temu has brought further attention to the loophole. An interim 2023 report from the US House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said that Shein and Temu \"likely\" account for more than 30% of all shipments made to the US under the de minimis provision. It added that almost 50% of all de minimis shipments to the US come from China. Both Shein and Temu have pushed back on the notion that they rely on de minimis to grow their business.               Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on the US following Trump's executive order. The tariffs on Mexico, meanwhile, have been delayed a month after Trump reached an agreement with Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday.       Do you have a story to share?

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"According to the rumors, Samsung could name its upcoming tri-fold smartphone the Samsung Galaxy G Fold. While Samsung has dominated the foldable market with its Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip series, this will be the company\u2019s first tri-fold smartphone, although the company wouldn\u2019t be the first to the market with such a device. Some of you might recall that in 2024, Huawei launched the Mate XT tri-fold smartphone. However, unlike Huawei\u2019s Mate XT, which featured an outward-folding design, the Galaxy G Fold will take a different approach. Samsung\u2019s version will have inward-folding displays. This offers better protection against scratches and damage when closed. Reports indicate the Galaxy G Fold measures 9.96-inches wide and 6.54-inches tall. It is also expected to weigh around the same as the Huawei Mate XT. Samsung is likely to unveil the Galaxy G Fold alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, which are expected to debut later this year. Samsung has not announced pricing details yet. However, given its complex folding mechanism and the additional foldable display, the Galaxy G Fold will likely cost significantly more than the Galaxy Z Fold 7. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is currently priced at $1,900. So it\u2019s not hard to imagine the Galaxy G Fold could be priced over $2,000. Either way, take it with a grain of salt. Hopefully we\u2019ll have more details to share in the coming months. Your email address will not be published.

{"date":"2025-02-03","content":"President Trump enacted tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China on Saturday. (Photo by Anna ... [+] Moneymaker\/Getty Images) Key Takeaways Markets are coming off a week of modest losses with the Nasdaq Composite down the most at 1.5%. The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 each lost 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was relatively unchanged. This week is filled with more earnings and economic data. However, new tariffs implemented on Saturday by the Trump administration sent futures plummeting when they opened for trading on Sunday night. President Trump is enacting 25% tariffs on goods arriving from both Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% tariff on China. The Canadian tariffs do have a carve out for energy imports which will only see a 10% tariff. In response, Canada announced their own 25% tariff on over $100 billion U.S. goods. As of this writing, Mexico has not announced how they will respond, but according to an article in The Wall Street Journal, Mexican officials are considering carousel retaliation by which the products hit with tariffs would rotate. What is effectively a trade war comes at a tenuous time. While inflation appears to be under control, the Federal Reserve has recently become less dovish with respect to interest rate cuts. The next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting doesn\u2019t take place until March 19 and currently, the overwhelming expectation is that rates will be left unchanged. Whether or not the effects of the tariffs will be quantifiable by then remains to be seen; however, it is anticipated they will increase inflationary pressures. Turning to earnings, we're just over one-third of the way through reporting season. Of the companies that have reported, 77% have beaten estimates. According to FactSet, the blended earnings growth rate (based on those companies that have reported and estimates from those that will report) is 13%. If there is a caveat to this, it's the blended growth rate for revenues, which is just 5%. That suggests profits are more a result of lower costs and\/or greater efficiency than it does more goods are actually being sold. This is something to keep an eye on as 131 more companies will report this week. Of the companies that will report, some highlights include: Advanced Micro Devices and Alphabet, after the close on Tuesday. Uber and Disney are scheduled to announce before the open Wednesday. Then later in the week we'll hear from ARM Holdings, MicroStrategy and Amazon. The economic calendar is also crowded this week with JOLTS coming before the open Tuesday and on Friday, the monthly employment numbers for January. We also have members of the Fed speaking all week and in light of the newly enacted tariffs, I think these speeches will take on added importance. Also, while it\u2019s not a number I typically discuss, on Wednesday we will get reports on Imports, Exports and the Trade Balance for December. Part of the reasoning for the Trump tariffs was related to perceived trade imbalances. Therefore, I think these reports could garner more attention than usual. I don't know that any changes in the number vs. prior months is particularly important, but I think the number itself will be a baseline used to gauge effectiveness of tariffs moving forward. For today, I\u2019m watching the automakers. The implementation of tariffs is a major threat to this group as a whole and I'm interested in how they respond. Related to that, I'm also interested if we see a divergence between the S&P and Nasdaq. With so many car manufacturers in the S&P, we could see more turbulence in that index than we do in the tech heavy Nasdaq. Lastly, I'll be watching food companies, especially those who are heavily reliant on imports such as sugar or avocados.
