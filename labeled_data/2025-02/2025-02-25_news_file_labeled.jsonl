{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, MSI Claw: The Steam Deck is bigger than them combined. Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, MSI Claw: The Steam Deck is bigger than them combined. by  Sean Hollister Today is the third anniversary of Valve\u2019s Steam Deck, the handheld gaming PC that all but created the market for handheld gaming PCs. It was a mess to start! But three years later, The Verge has data showing how it has dominated the nascent market. While Valve told us in November 2023 that it had sold \u201cmultiple millions\u201d of the AMD-powered handheld, we\u2019ve never had a good glimpse at how big it is or how Windows competitors stack up\u2026 till now. It seems the Steam Deck, so far, has been bigger than all its competitors combined. Market research firm IDC uses supply chains to estimate just how many handheld gaming systems have shipped around the world, and creates spending forecasts. When I asked IDC market research analyst Lewis Ward if he\u2019d be willing to isolate SteamOS and Windows gaming handhelds from that data, he said yes. So here are the estimated combined shipments of the Steam Deck, and the Windows-based Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and MSI Claw from 2022 through 2024, and an estimate for 2025: Add it up, and that\u2019s just under 6 million shipments in three years. One way to view that: it\u2019s small and it\u2019s not really growing. IDC\u2019s forecasting under 2 million shipments in 2025, rather than any major expansion. Another is that it\u2019s simply early days for the category: Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans only sold 2 million pairs between October 2023 and February 2025, but its maker is taking that as a sign it could soon sell 10 million each year. \u201cI think it\u2019s amazing,\u201d AMD gaming marketing boss Frank Azor tells me, discussing IDC\u2019s numbers for handheld gaming PCs. \u201cThis didn\u2019t exist three years ago; we went from nothing, zero, to incremental category creation in the millions of units.\u201d But out of those 6 million shipments, the lion\u2019s share have been the Steam Deck itself, according to IDC\u2019s estimates. All of the 2022 shipments are the Steam Deck, and Ward tells me upwards of 50 percent of the 2023 shipments and 48 percent of the 2024 shipments are the Deck as well. Doing the math, Valve has now shipped upwards of 3.7 million Steam Decks and has quite possibly crossed 4 million by now. (Note: IDC\u2019s numbers do not currently include Chinese handhelds from companies like GPD, Ayaneo and OneXPlayer, though it seems possible they are small players based on their public backer numbers on Indiegogo.) With as few as 2 million Windows handhelds shipping in two years, it\u2019s not a huge surprise that AMD and Intel aren\u2019t spending big on more custom chips like the one that\u2019s still working perfectly well for the Steam Deck \u2014 particularly if the rumors are true that early Windows handheld buyers returned their purchases at unusually high rates. (Anecdotally, I\u2019ve seen lots of open-box stock of the Asus ROG Ally when I\u2019ve looked at Best Buy online and in-person.) But I hope AMD will invest in making that Steam Deck lightning strike again. Because when every other low-power gaming chip is originally aimed at laptops rather than handhelds, we get disappointments like the new Lenovo Legion Go S, which couldn\u2019t stand up to the three-year-old Steam Deck\u2019s one-year-old OLED revision in my review, or the original MSI Claw. Or, we get pretty good handhelds like the ROG Ally X that offset power hungry chips with a bigass battery, but cost $800 or more. Not that chips are the only reason the Steam Deck has come this far, not by a long shot! It\u2019s the combination of Valve\u2019s pick-up-and-play SteamOS \u2014 which lets you simply press a button to easily sleep and resume \u2014 and its Proton compatibility layer and precompiled shaders that, incredibly, often make Windows games run on Linux better than they run on Windows. Then there\u2019s its infinitely customizable and comfortable controls that make decades of older games playable. It\u2019s also the price \u2014 think console, not gaming laptop \u2014 and how incredibly easy Valve makes it to temporarily tweak performance in exchange for more battery life, and how many additional things you can do with a Steam Deck if you try. (Epic Games Store and Ubisoft and even Blizzard games are playable if you jump through a couple hoops; it can easily stream your PlayStation with the Chiaki app you can find in the Linux desktop app browser, letting the handheld double as a PlayStation Portal.) No other shipping handheld has come close, and while a combination of the Asus ROG Ally X and the SteamOS not-quite-a-fork Bazzite can feel like the best of both worlds, you\u2019ll pay twice the price of an entry level Steam Deck to get it. I mistakenly thought the most important handheld at CES 2025 was the Lenovo Legion Go S, because Valve\u2019s Steam Deck designers had given it their blessing to become the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld, but I was wrong. Here\u2019s how I ended my Legion Go S review: \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for a $499 Legion Go S with SteamOS, here\u2019s my advice: just buy a $530 Steam Deck OLED instead.\u201d While it\u2019s true that new triple-A PC games now require more power than the Steam Deck can comfortably give you, Valve has consistently said that it will wait until it can provide a \u201cleap\u201d in performance without sacrificing battery life before it introduces a Steam Deck 2, and that it won\u2019t be using this year\u2019s AMD Z2 chips. Between that promise, the many excellent new games that do target Steam Deck, the high prices of new Nvidia GPUs, and the idea that new Microsoft and Sony handhelds are likely a few years away, I don\u2019t think there are all that many reasons to wait to buy today\u2019s Steam Deck \u2014 unless the Nintendo Switch 2 somehow supplants the Steam Deck as the handheld that game developers prefer to target with games.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Here's what consumers overseas and Canada could see for Google's next budget phone.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Google's next budget phone remains the culprit of another string of leaks purporting its price across various overseas regions. This report concerns pricing leaks for several countries in Europe; however, Android Headlines states consumers in these areas will see familiar prices. According to the publication, many countries in Europe will (allegedly) see similar prices across both the Pixel 9a's 128GB and 256GB storage options. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain will supposedly see a \u20ac549 starting price for the 128GB configuration and a \u20ac649 tag for the 256GB choice. Prices differ in Ireland, which may see things listed at \u20ac559 and \u20ac659. The U.K. was highlighted, with the post claiming those consumers could see the following prices: \u00a3499 (128GB) and \u00a3599 (256GB). Lastly, the publication mentions the Canadian market, which could see $679 and $809 starting prices, respectively. It's explained that the \"similarities\" in pricing across the previously mentioned regions regard Google's pricing of the Pixel 8a in 2024. So, perhaps consumers in these areas won't see a drastic rise in pricing for an expected budget phone from Google later this year.  The alleged U.S. pricing was mentioned today (Feb 25), but it remains the same as a leak from late January. Rumors stated U.S. consumers could see a similar starting price as the Pixel 8a's launch, which is right around $499 for its base model and $559 for 256GB. Those rumors also claimed the next A-series Pixel could feature a small 8GB of RAM alongside both storage choices. It's worth mentioning that these storage options don't differ from last year's budget model as Google is placing its attention elsewhere. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android There was a major leak in mid-February that placed a bright spotlight on the Pixel 9a's specs and purported hardware changes. The leak claimed the phone would feature a 6.3-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate and Google's Tensor G4 SoC. The display may fall victim to slightly thicker bezels when compared to the flagship Pixel 9 series. More importantly, the largest design change is the dual camera array, which forgoes a thick camera bump (looking at you, Pixel 9) in favor of one that's flush to its back. The camera strength is projected to arrive similar to the base Pixel 9 model, which boasts a 48MP primary lens with OIS and a 13MP ultrawide lens. While Google's budget device typically launches earlier in the year (springtime), rumors suggest March 26 could be the date this time.

China has aspects of a command economy, and if a market segment is targeted in the State plan they may pump a lot of money in to make sure it succeeds. Did those AI engines \"steal\" their data? It is admittedly very funny that OpenAI has complained that these folks are using their model to train DeepSeek's version, when literally all the AI companies are doing just that with content provided by everyone else for free.

Generating the inferences can be a significant ongoing compute expense that is usually offset by user fees. What I'm seeing from this article is that DeepSeek's fees are \"20-40 times cheaper\" than the competition, which seems a little unrealistic. \"Generating the inferences can be a significant ongoing compute expense\" What if that cost is easily covered by their investment gains (on their own stock even)? It seems like other companies would have that same advantage in the current investment climate. \"Adnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI's scaled-down model.\" They are running the inferences on \"a large A100 cluster\", so similar hardware to the Western competition. But they potentially take 3 times the amount of compute resources.  C'mon. How much did OpenAI pay for your data online? Even though there is no definite proof, I am pretty convinced that they indeed used ChatGPT data. Like literally a thousand other models you can download, as many of the open datasets (e.g. on Huggingface) are created using ChatGPT.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Microsoft recently appeared to scale back its data center development pipeline, which would be an extraordinary step back after a period of furious growth by the tech giant. But did it really? The concerns about whether air was coming out of a data center bubble were raised by a TD Cowen analyst, Michael Elias, in a report dated February 21. Elias wrote that Microsoft, one of the largest data center operators in the country, had recently torn up leases for \"multiple +100 megawatt deals in multiple markets that were in early\/mid-stages of negotiations.\" Elias also said the company had let go of more than a gigawatt of preliminary data center commitments it had made and also five longer-term development deals in prime data center markets. The company's decision-making was \"tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position.\" Microsoft's pullback sent a shudder through the data center market, which has seen staggering forecasts for growth in the coming years. For some, however, the news simply reflected a more modest revision of the sector's extraordinary recent projections for growth. \"I can't think of the big five that haven't done this every 12 or 18 months,\" said one data center development executive, referring to the industry's largest users: Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle. The executive did not want to be identified by name because major customers in the industry prize confidentiality. \"This is not new and definitely not the biggest one we've had in the last three years,\" the executive said, saying that Meta had canceled major data center commitments it had in recent years in order to reset its strategy, including its data center business's customer and technology focus. After that reevaluation, Meta rebooted its torrid growth, including the recent announcement of a $10 billion data center campus in Louisiana. A spokeswoman for Meta  declined to comment.  Dan Thompson, an analyst at S&P Global who covers the data center industry, said that the magnitude of the data center boom was bound to modulate because the projections included speculative projects and, potentially, the double counting of tenants who may have expressed interest in multiple projects and\/or regions for the same requirement. \"Some of these announcements are not going to get built,\" Thompson said. \"I don't see it as a reflection on the data center industry.\" Thompson said that there was a need to differentiate between credible growth and the frothiest forecasts for the industry's expansion. He said that S&P plans to reorganize its data center projections this year into buckets that group projects based on their likelihood of coming to fruition. \"We are modifying our reports this year, for every market, basically draw the line in the sand and say, OK, this is the part where we think: that is real,\" Thompson said. What is clear, nonetheless, is that a data center boom is afoot across the nation. S&P Global projects that the industry will grow from about 35.4 gigawatts of capacity today to almost 82 gigawatts by the end of the decade, an 131% increase. There have been even more ambitious projections that more than 90 gigawatts of data centers could be online by 2029. The development is being undertaken to commercialize and develop artificial intelligence and also cater to society's yawning digital footprint. Data centers provide the computing and storage that power the internet and a host of increasingly vital functions, such as autonomous vehicles, Zoom meetings, and cloud computing. A spokeswoman for Microsoft suggested in a statement that the company had pumped the brakes on development, while also highlighting the enormous scale of its data center expansion. \"Thanks to the significant investments we have made up to this point, we are well positioned to meet our current and increasing customer demand,\" the spokeswoman stated. \"Last year alone, we added more capacity than any prior year in history.\" Microsoft \"will continue to grow strongly in all regions,\" she said, and that the company's plans to \"spend over $80B on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.\" Elias's report didn't cite specific examples of Microsoft's retrenchment, except for the recent news of its decision to reevaluate a large data center campus it is building in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, outside of Milwaukee. Reached by phone, Elias declined to comment further. Sean Ryan, a spokesman for the Village of Mount Pleasant, said that Microsoft had \"paused in some of its construction work in order to incorporate new data center designs\" and that \"Village officials have no reason to believe this will affect the overall scope or nature\" of the project.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Shopify has stepped up its acquihiring as the race for AI talent heats up. CFO Jeff Hoffmeister said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this month that Shopify had done six \"tuck-in\" acquisitions in the previous year. He said that while the deals were small from a financial perspective, they've been an important source of talent and a tactic the company plans to continue. \"These have been very tactical, thoughtful AI hires and we want to continually be thoughtful, proactive, and judicious on thinking about the cash,\" he said. Many of the founders that Shopify has hired now hold leadership positions in the company's product org. That includes Nicolas Grasset, the former CEO of AI-driven analytics startup Peel Insights. Shopify brought on the Peel team in May, and Grasset is now a director of product. Relay Commerce acquired the business itself. Ray Reddy, cofounder and CEO of mobile ordering app Ritual, became a VP of product for retail at Shopify this January as part of an acquihire deal that also included his cofounder, Larry Stinson, and some engineering staff. \"I'm inspired by the opportunity to help local businesses adapt and thrive as generative AI reshapes customer expectations\u2014a moment that reminds me of launching Ritual over a decade ago during the rise of mobile internet,\" Reddy wrote in a LinkedIn post about his joining Shopify. \"I'm excited to join a team poised to help businesses of all sizes succeed as technology rapidly evolves.\" Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said Shopify's increased acquihire activity is likely a product of the \"white-hot\" market for engineers with AI credibility. \"Hiring individuals is sometimes too slow or too expensive,\" Luria said. \"Sometimes it's easier to just buy a small company that has AI engineers just for the talent.\" Rousseau Kazi, former CEO of workplace communications platform Threads, joined Shopify's product org when Shopify acquihired the startup's team in June. Michael Averto, cofounder and former CEO of inventory operations platform ChannelApe, began working on inventory management as a product leader at Shopify as part of a deal in July. Shopify also hired the team behind Stellate, a startup that made developer tools. Cofounder and former CEO Max Stoiber is now a director of engineering leading teams working on Liquid, Shopify's template language for storefronts. In September open-source developer group The Guild acquired Stellate's product and customer base. Shopify also acquired Checkout Blocks, a checkout customization app, in June and hired Gil Greenberg as a product lead working on checkout extensibility. The Checkout Blocks app is still available for download in the Shopify App Store. Luria said that Shopify's growth over the years has largely been organic and not from acquisitions. Shopify did invest billions into building its fulfillment network, acquiring Deliverr for more than $2 billion before selling it and the rest of its logistics business to Flexport. Shopify has since described its fulfillment work as a \"side quest.\" The past year is not the first time Shopify has used acquihires to bring on valuable talent. In 2018 it acquired the team behind Swedish shopping startup Tictail, and many of those leaders were key to the growth of its Shop app. It also acquired the B2B commerce marketplace Handshake in 2019, and those founders have gone on to hold product leadership roles at Shopify. Shopify is also doubling down on AI talent in other ways. In August, the company hired Mikhail Parakhin as its new CTO. Parakhin led AI advancements like Copilot at Microsoft and also developed search engines and cloud services for more than four years as Yandex's CTO. Hoffmeister also said during the earnings call that Shopify would continue to make strategic investments in startups building tech that its merchants would find valuable. Its 2024 investments included participation in a pre-seed round for Convergence, which is building an AI agent called Proxy. Got a tip?

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Tesla has started rolling out driving-assistance features to some cars in China that are similar to the Full Self-Driving (FSD) system in the US, according to a software update log. Tesla said the new features allow Tesla owners in China to use driver-assist features on controlled-access and city roads. These include guiding vehicles to exit ramps and intersections, recognizing traffic signals, making turns, and managing lane changes and speed adjustments. It does not incorporate all of Tesla's FSD features, including autonomously navigating complex urban environments such as parking lots. Tesla is not branding it as Full Self-Driving. \"For some features, the time of implementation and results may vary based on the vehicle's model and configuration,\" the company said, adding that the range of models will be gradually expanded. Bloomberg first reported Tesla's planned deployment of FSD features in China. The move comes after BYD, Tesla's biggest rival in China, announced earlier this month that it would equip nearly all its models with advanced self-driving tech at no extra cost, and other rivals followed suit. In contrast, Tesla owners in China have had to pay about $8,800 extra for self-driving features \u2014\u00a0a sum nearly as high as the cost of BYD's cheapest model. BYD has racing ahead in China's fiercely competitive EV market. In January it sold sold nearly twice as many EVs as Tesla, with the US carmaker's sales down 11% compared with the same month in 2024. BYD sold a record 66,000 vehicles outside China in January, indicating that a push to expand outside its home market is starting to pay off. Last month, BYD overtook Toyota to become Singapore's best-selling car brand and also beat Tesla in the UK for the first time. Other Chinese brands such as NIO, XPeng, MG, and ORA are also notching up higher sales of their affordable electric and hybrid vehicles outside China amid intense competition in the domestic market.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"    And by lately, I mean the past several years or more.\u00a0 The value of the S&P 500 index of stocks, where most of us hopefully have a good chunk of our retirement savings stashed into index funds, is up about fifty seven percent in just the past two years. And it has more than doubled in the past five. This means that on a net worth basis, if you felt like you were only halfway to retirement as recently as the Covid Era, you may have suddenly blown right past the finish line. And some of us who were already retired long before that, may find ourselves eyeing up expensive properties or engaging in other money-burning-a-hole-in-our-pocket behaviors.\u00a0 Is this real? Or is it all a bubble or some other sort of financial illusion? As one reader recently asked me in an email: \u201cThe market seems to be in a huge bubble right now due to all sorts of hype around Artificial Intelligence. Does this make it more vulnerable to a huge crash in the future, and will it affect my retirement?\u201d To answer this question, let\u2019s take a closer look at our current somewhat unprecedented financial world and stock market. And to understand that properly, it helps to go back to the roots of what a stock is:\u00a0 A stock is a magical business arrangement which is really just a much more convenient version of a rental house. When you own a rental house, you are entitled to collect rent. After you cover all the expenses related to the house, you get to keep the rest, and this amount is your profit.\u00a0 If the average sale price of rental houses in your area goes up but the tenant keeps paying you the same amount forever, it may look good on paper but it doesn\u2019t really mean anything unless you sell the house. And then you\u2019d just have to turn around and pay that same higher amount for a different rental house. Your paycheck remains unchanged unless you can make your little house rental business more profitable. So you might squeeze in a basement apartment, do some renovations, streamline expenses, or do other things to increase your net earnings.\u00a0 When you eventually sell that house to another investor, the price they are willing to pay should be based on that future stream of income. For example, if the house brings in $2000 per month ($24,000 each year) and the sale price is $240,000, the next investor is buying a business with a price-to-earnings ratio of 10, because 240k\/24k=10. But if you manage to convince someone to hand over $480,000 for that same house, you\u2019ve sold at a P\/E of 20. This is a much better deal for you as the seller, but quite obviously a less rosy future for the investor buying it. Now back to the stock market. If you put $100,000 in the market in 2019 and reinvested the dividends, today you\u2019d already have an astonishing $256,960 (a 157% gain on your original investment) But in that same time period, your share of company earnings from that $100,000 basket of stocks has only gone from $5290 to $7540 (a measly 42% gain) \u2013 information you can get from handy analysis sites like multpl.com In other words, the Price-to-earnings ratio has risen from about 20 back then, to about 30 today. So as stock investors here in 2025, we\u2019re just like rental house investors finding that house prices have more than doubled while rents are only up by a bit. Which makes the landlord business a lot less profitable, and we should expect exactly the same thing as stock investor: lower future profits as a percentage of our portfolio value. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unprofitable to own either one of these things \u2013 stocks or rental houses. But it does mean that we should expect our future income from buying them at today\u2019s higher price-to-earnings ratio should be lower than if we could get them on sale. It\u2019s just basic math. But Wait! What if the Earnings are Rising? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re considering a rental house which is a bit overpriced based on today\u2019s rent, but you happen to know that a big Apple campus is about to get built right nearby. At that point, you expect that rent will start climbing rapidly for many years to come. In this situation, you should be willing to pay more for those future earnings when you buy the house. This is exactly why the price of an individual company\u2019s stock will tend to rise when some good news comes out about the company. During the Covid era, people started buying more Peloton bikes so they could exercise at home, and investors (foolishly) believed this would be a permanent trend. So Peloton stock went way up. Later, reality sunk in that this was just a fad and Peloton sales returned back to normal levels, and so did the stock. But what does it mean when the entire market goes up to much higher levels? Does it mean our entire economy is expected to grow much more quickly?\u00a0 In the case of the current stock market euphoria, not exactly. Because if you dig into the share prices of the 500 big companies that make up our famous S&P 500 index, it turns out that almost all the recent growth \u2013 about three quarters of it \u2013 came from just the seven biggest companies, known as the Magnificent Seven: Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and sometimes Tesla. These are all high-flying, super profitable tech companies who have seen a lot of growth and hype recently, which has caused investors to get excited and bid up their share prices in hopes of even more future growth. Collectively, they make up over 25% of the entire market value ($17.66 trillion!) and have much more expensive P\/E ratios than the rest of the market (a weighted average of about 45) If you exclude these seven biggest companies and just consider the remaining 493, you will find a P\/E of only 20, which is more reasonable although still much higher than average. What this tells us is that while investors expect the overall US economy to be fairly healthy in the coming years, they expect the biggest tech companies to continue to enjoy much faster growth.\u00a0 What Does This Have To Do With Artificial Intelligence? There\u2019s one common theme in the big tech company boom right now: recent advances in AI have surprised the business world as software is suddenly able to display human-like reasoning in a rapidly growing number of fields. And because of this, the entire business world is fired up into a frenzy.  Six of those Magnificent Seven companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to build preposterously large warehouses full of supercomputers, and the lucky seventh (NVidia) is on the receiving end of those billions since they make the supercomputers and the incredible demand allows charge insane prices while still shipping them out by the trainload. But that\u2019s just the first level of this boom, the AI Infrastructure. As you move down the chain, every other industry hopes we have entered a new era of productivity and thus profits will grow faster than ever. They may actually be right: You can now do things like feed in an entire novel or legal document or piece of code and ask the AI to answer detailed questions about the characters, or identify loopholes in the contract, or even find and fix bugs for you. AI can also drive cars, identify melanoma from photographs of your skin, design medications thousands of times better than what we\u2019re used to, and even bring humanoid robot bodies to life as mechanical workers. The idea is that we\u2019re on the verge of having an infinite workforce of highly intelligent AI employees who will work for us for free, eliminating the biggest constraint that humanity has had in the past: a finite supply of both intelligence and labor. Having followed the field in some detail for a while, I personally think all this will come true, although the timeline is uncertain. And the people bidding the share prices up to these levels obviously believe it too.\u00a0 But the question is, will the profits of these companies really come through at the levels they forecast? Or will there be surprises down the road: cost overruns, competition, or unexpected disasters as these newly smarter-than-us computers decide that they no longer want to be bossed around?\u00a0 And what if we end up with massive unemployment and resulting social upheaval if this amazing technology puts us all out of work, leaving only Sam Altman atop his personal mountain of $100 trillion dollars taunting the world forevermore with an annoyingly quiet monotone cackle? There\u2019s Only One Real Answer: Nobody Really Knows! While the future is unknown, it can still be useful to use the past as a guide. After all, if you look at the history of US economic growth over time, it averages out to a surprisingly steady figure, decade after decade: about 3% after inflation.\u00a0 One thing I noticed when making this graph: recent decades have actually seen slower than average growth, which is even less reason for the stock market to be priced the way it is. So What Does it all Mean? Should We Do Anything About It? As I said earlier, it\u2019s still going to be profitable to own stocks for the long run, just a bit less profitable than those times when we got to buy our stocks on sale. Of course, there will be occasional manias and panics and crashes. But as always, it will be a losing game to try to time them \u2013 for example by selling all your stocks now and hoping to buy them at a cheaper price at some point in the future. And over the long run, even if stocks return to more typical valuations, the end result would be something like the yellow line in this graph: Our economy will continue to grow and company earnings will grow along with it, but future investors might choose to pay a lower multiple for those earnings. Just like when you eventually sell that rental house, you shouldn\u2019t expect someone to pay you a million dollars for a place that only brings in $3000 of rent. Final Thoughts And Alternative Strategies Everything we\u2019ve covered so far is talking about the entire US stock market as a whole. And that\u2019s what I usually focus on most because I still think this country is a uniquely good place to run a business. But what about other investing options? It\u2019s always fun to at least look around and understand the larger investing world. For starters, there\u2019s Vanguard itself, the bedrock of the index fund world. Every year they gaze out at the investing horizon and make a ten-year forecast (guess) at future returns. This year they came up with these numbers: Vanguard\u2019s updated 10-year annualized return projections: Wow look at that. Vanguard is forecasting that International stocks of all kinds and even bonds will outperform US stocks in the coming decade.  On the surface, this makes sense because the P\/E ratio of the international stocks (for example the VXUS fund) is only 15.9, meaning those European stocks are on sale at almost 50% off compared to ours! Just one note of caution however: Vanguard has been making this same prediction for several years and just been wrong so far. Part of the reason is that most of the AI boom seems to be happening in the US.\u00a0 The Betterment Portfolio\u00a0 Longtime readers know that I\u2019ve had a growing portion of my investments in a Betterment (robo-advisor) account over the past eleven years (see the ongoing report here). I decided to try this for precisely the reasoning above: by allocating money across more categories than just US stocks and automatically rebalancing, we should be able to see slightly higher returns with slightly lower volatility, and some tax advantages as well.\u00a0 So far, my experiment has drawn some heat because in retrospect, a US-only portfolio has outperformed any other option over this time period. The Betterment portfolio comes close, but the exposure to bonds and businesses in other countries has held it back, just as you\u2019d expect. But if you believe that things will eventually balance out again in the coming decades as the Vanguard analysis suggests above, it still has a chance to catch up.\u00a0 Looking at my investments there, you can review the betterment core portfolio and calculate that the weighted average of all those holdings gives us a P\/E ratio of about 22. What Does Warren Buffett Say? It\u2019s always worth checking in with The Oracle on matters of the economy while we\u2019ve still got this wonderful old sage around (see this year\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder letter if you want some further deep reading). And Warren is signaling that things are overvalued and bargains are few and far between. So Berkshire is holding $334 billion of uninvested cash for now, not even repurchasing its own shares which it considers slightly overvalued at the current P\/E ratio which averages out to about 21 in recent years. What About Paying Off Your House? Over the long run, you usually do better if you keep a mortgage on your house and pay it off slowly, while directing all the surplus cash into index funds. But there is some point at which the opposing factors of lower expected stock returns and higher interest rates meet in the middle and this situation flips.  If you have a 7% mortgage right now, it might be a fairly close tradeoff at this point. But the real factor is how you feel about paying off your house. I happen to love being mortgage-free so I paid off my last mortgage over ten years ago and have never looked back. Another way to think of this is that paying off your house is like buying a 7% bond. Definitely one of the best guaranteed returns around, and much more sensible than leaving tens of thousands of dollars in a checking or savings account unless you have a clear use for that cash. The Final Word If you\u2019ve read any of my stock investing articles before, you\u2019ll know that we always end up at the same place: Just relax, enjoy your life, keep investing, ignore the daily news headlines* and don\u2019t worry.\u00a0 Then reinvest that time that everyone else spends worrying into enjoying more time engaged in hard physical stuff in the great outdoors. That\u2019s the only place where you\u2019ll get guaranteed market-beating returns, every time.  In the Comments: what are your thoughts on the current stock market boom, future crashes and busts, and the role of Artificial Intelligence in our future? All the other MMM Stock Market Articles from past years: *although in my opinion it\u2019s okay to check in weekly with The Economist, which has been my favorite source of world economic news for 32 years and counting.   Liface February 25, 2025, 8:33 am  Love the article, but please no more AI-generated images :( They immediately leave a \u201cpoor taste\u201d impression on the reader.  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 9:52 am  I hear you \u2013 AI is divisive and some of us love it, some hate it. I happen to be on the \u201clove\u201d side because it gives me some good laughs. My nineteen year old son looked over my shoulder this morning and clucked his tongue telling me I shouldn\u2019t be using those dirty images. I\u2019m going to keep having fun with them, but I feel they\u2019re especially appropriate in this article because it\u2019s specifically about AI changing our economy and way of living.  Plus, did you notice how cool it is that there are SEVEN robots at the trading table? Very appropriate.  Noah February 25, 2025, 12:50 pm  I laughed at your AI image and I\u2019m glad you included it. It\u2019s fun to see a blogger who\u2019s been around for a while embrace a new technology. I really don\u2019t understand the hate.  Dave February 26, 2025, 9:35 am  Yeah, but I thought the AI image of the millionaire leveling the concrete floor was COMPLETELY unrealistic  \/s  Tim February 27, 2025, 6:39 pm  I too that one was a bit off\u2026.     Good Catch!  Tom February 25, 2025, 8:34 am  Great insights MMM. A lot of things my partner and I have been talking and thinking about over the last couple of years. I think of AI right now a little bit like the dotcom bubble, but I think it will pop and recover at a much faster rate (and be much more transformative to all parts of society and industry much faster). Regular people see AI right now and think of gimmicky generative stuff or writing term papers. They have no idea what\u2019s about to hit them. Anybody in their earning years over the next decade better be figuring out how to use these tools to do their job better and faster than their peers (better yet get themselves jobs building the tools themselves) or they are going to be left behind. Part of me thinks we\u2019re going to enter a very different economic order over the next decade especially when it comes to white collar work.  That aside \u2013 not much has changed in our investing strategy \u2013 we\u2019ve mostly bought VOO and VTI but we have been investing new money primarily in BRK.B. Will likely be down compared to the US market in the long run (but probably not by too much) but am hoping for a bit more stability over what seems like a possibly churny decade.  Who knows though maybe the magnificent seven will be the for bearers of this AI revolution and I\u2019ll be wishing I had stuck the S&P.  Rudy Rudolf February 25, 2025, 8:36 am  MMM thank you for your perpetual optimism and sage financial analysis. A rising tide raises all ships, but what if the tide is a creating super-intelligent huminoid robots? Do the big 7 just inevitably gobble up every other industry in their quest to create an  infinite labor source (thinking, Tesla swallowing Uber, Amazon swallowing the construction\/retail\/service industry, etc.). Is it a better move to push more of one\u2019s portfolio straight to the Seven and ride the wave? Thank you for always keeping it positive and fun!  \u2014 Rudy  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 9:49 am  Great question! The fundamental idea of index funding is \u201cAbsolutely Not!\u201d \u2013 for at least three reasons: 1) Because that shift of money into the big 7 tech companies has already happened. They\u2019re valued at EIGHTEEN TRILLION DOLLARS!! 2) By continuing to own just the index, you will continue to participate in any growth of these companies, as well as all the unexpected rising stars yet to come. 3) Because actively jumping out of the index into individual stocks in an attempt to outperform the market is a proven losing strategy. Everybody thinks they know better, they don\u2019t, collectively they fall into a random distribution and their overall performance defines \u201cthe market\u201d.  Matt McLaughlin February 25, 2025, 8:47 am  As usual, a wait well-deserved for a good read. I believe AI will usher in a lot of great possibilities. Like you, I believe most of the prognostications will be true in time. And things will rapidly change, much more quickly than we\u2019re used to seeing.  Ashu B February 25, 2025, 9:33 am  Thank you for the post. I pretty much only buy VTI on a bi weekly schedule when my paycheck hits. I noticed how pretty much every stock I looked at were at 52 week highs and stopped buying anything for the last two months. I\u2019m not really sure if this is the best way\/ logic but I know that I\u2019m not the brightest in this regard and I\u2019m not gonna think too hard about it lol. Your article helped a little though so thank you.  Brian Slattery February 25, 2025, 10:17 am  I have concerns but I\u2019m not market timing them yet. The amount of US government debt and personal debt seems unrealistic and NO ONE is event remotely trying to reduce either. This bubble and continue to run! For now anyway Is Buy and Hold Always the Best Strategy? History Says\u2026 Not Always. Yes, over the last few decades, the buy-and-hold strategy has worked incredibly well, with U.S. stock markets delivering strong returns. But that hasn\u2019t always been the case. There have been entire decades where buy and hold yielded little to no real returns\u2014or worse.  The 1930s: The Great Depression saw the Dow Jones lose nearly 90% of its value from 1929 to 1932. Even though the market eventually recovered, it took 25 years (until 1954) for stocks to fully regain their pre-crash levels. The 1970s: Stagflation (high inflation + stagnant growth) crushed stock returns. The S&P 500 gained only 5% total from 1969 to 1979, which was a negative real return after inflation. The 2000s: After the Dot-Com bubble burst in 2000 and the Financial Crisis of 2008, the S&P 500 produced negative total returns from 2000 to 2009\u2014dubbed the \u201cLost Decade\u201d for stocks. While stocks historically tend to rise over long periods, these examples show that timing, valuation, and diversification matter. Simply buying and holding without considering macroeconomic conditions or valuations can lead to lost decades for investors  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 10:34 am  Some of those stories about past periods of low stock returns are true, but I encourage readers to remember three more things: 1) They are usually cherry picked, for example starting from the exact peak of the 1929 bubble. In reality, investors at the time had probably accumulated most of their investments at lower prices, so they were net-positive far sooner than 1954 2) Many of the analyses you see online happen to leave out the most important reason we own stocks in the long run: DIVIDENDS \u2013 so ensure that any past simulations you run are using a data set that includes dividends (Nick Maggiulli from Of Dollars and Data is a great author who understands this: https:\/\/ofdollarsanddata.com\/sp500-calculator\/) 3) It\u2019s easy to tell stories about the past and imagine that we all have a crystal ball. But remember that people back then had NO IDEA when the crash would come. In fact, I have been receiving emails non-stop since I 2013, shortly after I started writing this blog stating that it\u2019s \u201ctime to go to cash because the market is overvalued\u201d. In retrospect, not only our share prices but our economic growth and company earnings have been spectacular since then. And perhaps most importantly 4) Ten years is a TINY time horizon to be thinking about investment performance for FIRE people. I\u2019m personally less than a third of the way through my seventy year retirement, so I think in much longer time periods. A 10-15 year stretch of minimal stock growth is all built into the safety margin. Oh and a note about the national debt! There is definitely a limit to how much a nation can safely borrow as a percentage of GDP. But this is very different from the crap the politicians sling around to rile up their base and justify cutting the programs they just happen to dislike for ideological reasons. In a worldwide currency and debt market like we have, if you borrow too much the market sends you a signal in the form of lower demand for your dollars which leads to a decline in your currency\u2019s value. Then you need to offer higher interest rates in order to keep borrowing money. In recent decades the US has had the opposite \u201cproblem\u201d \u2013 we issue higher and higher amounts of debt for sale, and buyers keep vacuuming it up which keeps our dollar strong. So like a drunk teen at the liquor store with his Mom\u2019s credit card, we keep taking advantage of the free sauce.  To the extent that our government uses this borrowed money to build infrastructure that actually helps our country: transportation networks, ports, power production, educating our populace, even incentivizing things like Arizona semiconductor fabs, we are actually getting ahead because we are using other people\u2019s money to build our own wealth. It can also help to use this implicit subsidy to just lower taxes on businesses and average workers, because this will trigger more company formation and wealth and employment. But if we go too far and see our dollar drop more than we want *or* lose our status as the world\u2019s reserve currency, we will have to go on a serious spending diet.  But the issue is best discussed by a group of well trained economists and business leaders with a set of spreadsheets rather than a shouting political candidate at a rally. The best approach is somewhere in between: run a sensible budget, but also bend the rules a bit and borrow a safe amount for the long run to continue juicing our own economy.  Brian Slattery February 25, 2025, 11:27 am  The results were cherry picked except for the people that retired at the start of those periods. For them it was real! For the early \u201970s retiree, the 4% rule just about held up, but with little margin for error. Wade Pfau\u2019s international study found that for a 50\/50 portfolio in U.S. history, 4% was roughly the \u201cSafemax\u201d (worst-case sustainable rate) \u2013 it survived about 30 years by the skin of its teeth, supporting only ~29 years of inflation-adjusted withdrawals in the most challenging stretch\u200b RETIREMENTRESEARCHER.COM . In practical terms, this means a 4% initial withdrawal did eventually work out for a 1970s retiree but only because subsequent decades (the 1980s and 1990s) were very strong. The retiree would have seen their nest egg shrink alarmingly in the first 5\u201310 years, likely coming close to depletion by the early 1980s, before the tide turned. T. Rowe Price analysts, for instance, note that a 1973 retiree\u2019s portfolio (with a roughly 4% starting withdrawal) began at $500k, sank to ~$328k by 1974, but then recovered to over $500k by 1982 and ultimately grew to over $1 million by the end of 30 years\u200b TROWEPRICE.COM \u200b TROWEPRICE.COM . In hindsight the 4% rule \u201cworked\u201d for that retiree \u2013 but if inflation had stayed high longer or if the 1980s boom had been weaker, the outcome could have been a failure.  The Orchard February 26, 2025, 1:33 pm  It\u2019s not a coincidence that the 4% rule just barely worked for 1970s retirees. That was the worst time period for investors in the 20th century, and 4% was chosen because it\u2019s the maximum withdrawal rate that survived even that period.  Brandy Dalton February 25, 2025, 10:26 am  Hi, Do you have an opinion of the infinite banking concept? Buying dividend paying whole life insurance ad starting my own bank. I\u2019m trying to decide between this and VTI. Thanks!  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 10:37 am  I totally recommend AGAINST whole life insurance.  While the concept sounds cool on the surface, when you look into the details the combination of active management and high fees and commissions doom the programs to underperformance at best.  At worst, you end up with scams where people lose all their money due to fine print about having to keep up payments for life, or the underwriting company being corrupt or going out of business.  Paul February 25, 2025, 10:48 am  Been following this blog for a few years now, moved closer to work, started biking everywhere, maxing retirement accounts and dumping excess money in low fee index funds. In 2019 my 401k was about $35,000 and is now about $255,000! The last section about not stressing about the news has really helped me and made me a lot less worried about most things. Love to see posts still coming and I still go back and reread the old ones every 6 months or so  Not Michael Saylor February 25, 2025, 10:58 am  How do you feel about index funds including things like $MSTR, which seems to have gamed the inclusion criteria into some ETFs? It should be self-correcting but it is likely misallocated capital  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 11:12 am  Yeah, good point. For the uninitiated, $MSTR is Microstrategy, a crazy ponzi scheme based on leveraged bets on Bitcoin.  I would prefer not to own any of that, and if there were a customized index fund that could skip companies like that which are definitely fraudulent, I\u2019d prefer that over the entire index. https:\/\/www-ft-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu\/content\/738546c5-a3f8-4d2a-ad49-ec1627dea1f7  Vine February 26, 2025, 11:14 am  If MSTR gets included into the SP500 it\u2019s really going break some peoples brains. Lots of automatic allocation into the ETFs that track that\u2026 People will learn, or they wont. You can at least easily short it.  Robert February 25, 2025, 11:07 am  The thing that I find interesting is all the doomsayers (i.e., those prognosticating some sort of nigh-apocalyptic destruction of the stock market) seem to operate under this bizarre assumption that the behemoths (i.e., the Magnificent 7 and others near the top of the pile) are just going to sit there and allow themselves to get trampled by some upstart. Or that they will just shrug their shoulders, say something like \u201cwell, I guess it was fun while it lasted, time to pack up the toys and go home\u201d and then it will all be over. Will there be disruption? Absolutely! Will it somehow upend the US stock market? I highly doubt that. The companies in the S&P 500 are economic engines, and their fuel is not just natural resources from Canada, Brazil, and Russia, but also other smaller companies. As soon as some small company comes along with a potentially disruptive change, you will absolutely see the big boys try to get in on the game (both by attempting to acquire the upstart, and also by starting or accelerating their own efforts in that space). There is a good chance that some of the economic benefit will be \u201clost\u201d (i.e., those who get in early will reap an outsized gain, while those of us index-only investors will have to wait for that disruptive technology to go mainstream), but in the end that disruptive technology will become *part* of the engine of our economy, rather than wrecking it.  Ipsum February 25, 2025, 11:13 am  New-ish reader here, soon to graduate college and aiming to get started on compounding returns as soon as possible. My question is: how do you think this scenario effects the first couple (investing) steps on the MM path?  150% higher buy in and the potential for overvaluation being recognized\/a bubble bursting seems like it poses a huge risk in particular for us people who don\u2019t yet own much at all. Does this mean that even more focus than before should be on simply paying off student loans? Still maxing out any job matching program is pretty obvious but that\u2019s still a while out. Until then, is putting most saved money into a Roth account or vanguard index still a good idea from your perspective?  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 12:35 pm  Great question Ipsum and congratulations on getting started early! Starting your career and serious investments right now is pretty similar to me as a 1997 Computer Engineering graduate. Nobody knew it at the time, but we were climbing the final wall of the 2000 Dot Com bubble, which subsequently burst and led to one of those occasional \u201clost decades\u201d we get. If you have any high interest debt (6% or more), you might enjoy paying that off as part of your early savings. And yes, take advantage of any employer matches.  And aside from that, just VTI and Chill and enjoy your life! There will be stock market crashes and flat spots along the way, and you will automatically get more shares at better prices during those time periods.  Your overall investment performance will be the average of the market over your accumulation period \u2013 the price of these shares you buy in the first few years won\u2019t matter much at all. One more thing: If you\u2019re entrepreneurial and love houses and managing people, also look into the whole real estate world (at the very minimum renting out an apartment in your own house). It\u2019s usually a solid way to exceed the returns of the stock market in exchange for putting in some work and skill \u2013 in other words a second fairly highly paid job.  Dan Mahoney February 25, 2025, 11:21 am  Hello Mr. Money, I\u2019ve enjoyed you stuff over the years and took early retirement myself a few years ago from my job reselling IT products and solutions.  I enjoyed it but I enjoy retirement even more. With regards to Mr. Buffett, I\u2019m a shareholder in Berkshire and in 2018 during the annual shareholder meeting ol Warren took a 15-minute break and instead talked about how he bought his first stock during WWII and he said, \u201d the best thing I could of done was to have bought an S&P 500 Index fund.  $10,000 then would be worth 51 million. Then he went on to explain why he recommends the S&P. He essentially gave a 15 minute lesson in investing.  In my opinion, you can get an MBA in investing in 15 minutes watching this lesson. I have it on my website.  I invite you to check it out. I\u2019ve been a student of Mr. Buffett and that I believe is his recommendation as far as investing goes. I\u2019ve carefully watched to see if he recommends bonds or international and each time, he says the S&P is the one you want. His reasoning he outlines in this lesson I believe. After seeing this I checked his recommendation out by doing a deep dive on his lesson and I got other facts and proof that backs up everything he teaches. It\u2019s on my website. Dan Mahoney Thanks for the info over the years.  Andrew S February 25, 2025, 11:24 am  Long time reader, glad you still find time to put an article out now and again\u2026it\u2019s a fun surprise nowadays when these pop up in my inbox. It\u2019s all groovy baby, there\u2019s always a market collapse or some other calamity coming, don\u2019t worry so much about it and just focus what\u2019s in our own control.  People and businesses will continue to work hard to make a profit, some companies will fail (even some AI companies), but I think the main point is that as long as the US is where the globes idea-generators want to build their companies, then long term we\u2019ll be alright. Also, I couldn\u2019t agree more about your point on time horizons, you can barely notice the exponential nature of growth on timescales less than 10-15 years. I have been heeding Mr. Buffet\u2019s advice a bit though and carrying more than my typical level of cash (which was basically no cash!) in my investing accounts just so that I can pounce when the next down-turn comes.  Alan Donegan February 25, 2025, 11:32 am  Love your articles MMM and then analysis you do.  I enjoyed reading it a lot.  Donegans currently hold global index funds, which are primarily US as that makes up most of the investible global market.  It is interesting to see how much people are worried about over valuation.  We can\u2019t wait for more hiking, food and chatting to friends whilst we enjoy the rocky ride of the investing rollercoaster.  LOVE your content.  LOVE the AI images you have generated for this article.  it makes is fun.  Alan  Daniel February 25, 2025, 11:35 am  Have been following this blog for many years. As usual, excellent post, and excellent comments too.  The low on the last bear market was on March 9, 2009, almost exactly 16 years ago. Unusually long time since the last big crash. Since then, up and more up, except for a brief period when the Covid pandemic started. Not only is the market overvalued, but I feel there is a lot of tinder and the tiniest spark will start the fire. High P\/Es. China and Taiwan. Ukraine and Russia (still) at war. Threat of tariffs. High public debt. Buffett selling \u2013 not only selling but not even repurchasing Berkshire\u2019s own shares. I will never fully time the market, but I feel this is a time I need to be no more than 40% in stocks. Rest in \u201cunloved\u201d investments \u2013 bonds \u2013 and cash. House has been paid off long ago, I am close to retirement, won\u2019t lose sleep (even I may lose on some additional returns).  Philip Mallory February 25, 2025, 11:37 am  The chart captioned \u201cThe real cause behind our raging bull market\u201d  is pretty confusing. I\u2019m a fairly numerate fellow and it took a few minutes to reproduce the chart to understand what you\u2019re communicating. I didn\u2019t know what these percentages were fractions of until I went and made my own graphs. A y-axis label like \u201cone year increase in market cap\u201d would help, and maybe explicitly explain in the preceding paragraph how you made the mental leap to \u201call the recent growth \u2013 about three quarters of it \u2013 came from just the seven biggest companies\u201d would make it easier to follow. anyways, this is another fine article. I started following the blog about 15 years ago when I was a college student with vague ideas about how I should be frugal and save up for a house. 15 years later, I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m \u201cretired\u201d, but I am a homeowner in the middle of my second long term sabbatical, and I feel zero pressure to do any work that isn\u2019t something I really want to do. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a good journey :)  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 3:03 pm  Good suggestion Philip and I was thinking the exact thing as I rushed to publish this. Shoulda remade that image with a better label. Even worse, now it has already gone out to 150k+ newsletter subscribers in email form so it\u2019s locked in!  Dave February 25, 2025, 11:38 am  Thanks MMM for this article, which directly hits what I have been thinking about lately.   Periodically reallocating seems to be the way to go, but there is so much variance between what long-term retirement age-based formula, one should go with, e.g., 90% in stocks, 120 minus age in stocks, 110 minus age, etc.   It seems with how overvalued and volatile things are, it would be best to shift to a more diversified and conservative allocation, e.g., 110 minus age\u2013and then continue periodically reallocating.  And then when (not if) the market corrects itself and stocks are at more bargain levels, consider shifting to a more aggressive allocation, e.g., 120 minus age.  Thoughts on this?   Really appreciate all your transparency and simple explanations!  Stephen February 25, 2025, 12:00 pm  Thanks MMM! I similarly have viewed paying off my house like buying a ~7% bond and wanted to add that the taxable equivalent yield is even higher depending on your tax bracket. It could be closer to a 9-10% bond depending on individual circumstances. Also, these days most folks no longer benefit from deducting mortgage interest with the higher standard deduction we have had since 2017, which used to be a factor in making this decision.  Melissa P February 25, 2025, 12:07 pm  Would love to hear if your opinion on Musk\/Tesla has changed.  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 12:27 pm  I\u2019d say it\u2019s roughly the same opinion as always but adjusted to his most recent behavior: Musk: extremely abrasive personality and doesn\u2019t understand human nature very well at all. Does however understand efficient manufacturing and is good at simplifying stuff down to its essence. Have always been surprised that people are willing to work in the environments he creates, but the company products speak for themselves.  But I think he gone a little further  off the deep end every month since about 2020, and is now a net drag to his companies, which are otherwise still full of brilliant people. Shouldn\u2019t be CEO of anything, and definitely shouldn\u2019t be in his current no-rules government role. Tesla: still the best cars on the US market by a very wide margin for the things I value (space and energy efficiency, performance, rock solid simple reliability, sheer joy of taking on cross-country camping and road trips, and of course doing most of the driving for me). But their competitors in China like BYD and Xiaomi and others have now fully caught up.  Also, Tesla still has the best grid-scale energy storage product on the world market and they do deserve the large share they are earning in that market which is a lot bigger than automobiles. No comment on Robotaxis until they prove it with a multi-billion-dollar stream of reliable profits. Unlike many people in the recent trend, I don\u2019t put much weight in my car-buying decisions on whether Musk is a CEO or shareholder of Tesla. Sure it\u2019s a factor, but given that the next best car (Ioniq 5) is so far behind the Model Y in all the measures I care about, it\u2019s too big of a jump to make just for a political statement.  Plus to be consistent, I\u2019d need first need to study the entire personal and professional life of the Hyundai CEO (I don\u2019t even know his or her name!), and weigh that against my best guess at Elon\u2019s lifelong virtue in a big spreadsheet.  It\u2019s not as simple as just reading a few New York Times headlines and then declaring \u201cI\u2019LL NEVER BUY A TESLA!\u201d  Andrew February 26, 2025, 5:53 am  Elon Musk has severe TMS but doesn\u2019t know it. That\u2019s his problem.  Troy February 26, 2025, 3:29 pm  Always appreciate your well thought out takes. Thanks for taking the time to answer this.  Dom S February 25, 2025, 12:18 pm  Imagine a S&P 493 leaving out the magnificent 7. The steady growth of the remaining market, while lower, would be much more stable and able to withstand large corrections (maybe). I think the overall theme is \u201csteady as she goes\u201d and don\u2019t let the market scare you into a foolish move. However, the ongoing political upheaval may subsequently impact the market as people flee for a safer haven (wherever that may be). Interesting times.  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 12:39 pm  And you can approximate this pretty well if you like \u2013 just look for the \u201cMid Cap\u201d or \u201cValue stock\u201d index funds, some of which are mentioned in this article. But note that over time (not just today\u2019s MAG7 era), a big portion of S&P gains do tend to come from the high flyers of the market. Much like Google, they push the envelope as they grow to massive capitalizations with some lofty P\/E ratios during those early years.  But then the earnings turn out to be real and sustainable, and you\u2019re left with a big profitable company that pays dividends and you\u2019re glad you held the stock along the way for that big rise.  Sam February 25, 2025, 12:24 pm  This could be the most bearish blog post I\u2019ve read from MMM about the market yet (still relatively optimistic compared to cable news headlines though!). Personally, I think I\u2019m finally ready to add some international exposure to my portfolio, but I still don\u2019t foresee US equity returns to be as dreadful as Vanguard predicts. I have a feeling that we will have more market crashes that follow the pattern of COVID\u2014sharp drops followed by swift recoveries\u2014rather than extended downturns.  Canadian friend February 25, 2025, 12:32 pm  Great food for thought as always, thank you.  In your mortgage pay-down versus invest in stocks comment, just curious why 7%?  I\u2019m looking at a mortgage renewal around 4-4.25% and still considering harvesting from the portfolio to pay a big chunk down to take advantage of selling near all-time highs.  I\u2019m in Canada and also trying to lower mortgage obligations as job loss feels like a real possibility if major recession occurs due to tarrifs.  Not living in fear but trying to make balanced financial decisions as I\u2019m only about half way to FI number.  The Orchard February 26, 2025, 1:37 pm  7% is close to the average long-term return of the stock market, so that\u2019s the interest rate where paying off a mortgage has the same expected value as investing.  Robin Mason February 25, 2025, 12:51 pm  Great post MMM! Thank you! There\u2019s going to be a wealth transfer in Canada and the US over the next decade that\u2019s the biggest in history. Won\u2019t this make the bull run in the market continue? All these folks are going to be putting quite a bit of inheritance money to work! No?!  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 3:07 pm  The quick answer is that you can\u2019t predict the future direction of the stock market based on any factors or theories.  All that info is already out there, and  it\u2019s priced in, and then it goes into the big blender of Bullshit Random Estimates as well as unforseen future world events which makes the prices whip around.  But in the long run, share prices are based on only one thing: company earnings which are based on continued human productivity.  Eric February 25, 2025, 12:54 pm  I\u2019m always a bit confused why so much of the FI world seems to think valuing the stock market is so impossible. The current situation reminds me a lot the of the dot com bust and the housing bubble with the stock gurus loudly stating to keep investing. They all disappear when the bubble bursts and retirement portfolios are ripped apart for a decade. It is easy enough to set buy or sell orders based on market conditions. There are also studies showing that investing in the S&P 500 at its current valuation holds on average an annualized return of -2-2%. The real question is about the opportunity cost of investing in the stock market versus other opportunities.  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 2:13 pm  I believe you, but do you care to share any of those studies or backtesting tools so we can get into some more detail? There\u2019s no such thing as an index fund portfolio being \u201cripped apart\u201d \u2013 at worst, what happens is that your neighboring farmers start shouting different estimates of the value of your farm over your fence for a while. As long as the businesses you own continue to produce valuable products and services for their customers which they can sell at a profit, you\u2019re happy to own them. Just like a rental house.  Eric February 26, 2025, 5:24 pm  Hi, the reference to the study is included in the following article, with the analysis originally coming from JP Morgan Asset Management. https:\/\/www.oaktreecapital.com\/insights\/memo\/on-bubble-watch  . I don\u2019t have a link to the original research, and I also need to correct that this is the only study I have. There are multiple as originally claimed.  Eric February 26, 2025, 5:25 pm  There are NOT multiple as originally claimed.  Joe February 28, 2025, 12:49 am  I think there is an issue with the data of that study Howard Mark\u2019s quotes?  It\u2019s the J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has a square for each month from 1988 through late 2014, and then shows the subsequent 10 year returns based on entry PE.  The problem is that there aren\u2019t that many 10-year periods in that time to make that claim, and that all of them are rolling it month to month, so the 324 observations are not really 324, but actually the same 10-year period multiple times since they\u2019re not independent. But I agree that the logic does make sense though that higher PEs should be lower returns intuitively.  Mike February 25, 2025, 1:03 pm  MMM \u2013 have read you for over a decade and have the utmost respect and gratitude for you. However I must admit I am a bit astonished as to your optimism over AI \u2013 this from the guy who (apparently correctly) told us a few years ago that crypto was essentially a bunch of B.S. coming from the usual tech bro types. Instead of arguing your AI summary point by point, can you give an example of a medication that AI has designed (not will design, but *has* designed) that is \u201cthousands of times better than what we\u2019re used to?\u201d Because the state of \u201cAI\u201d that I see is a ton of hype about what it will do followed by the release of another Large Language Model that doesn\u2019t think, reason, or actually know anything. (I don\u2019t mean for this to sound as argumentative as it might, I am genuinely curious and yes, a little frustrated).  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 2:10 pm  Thanks for the challenge Mike.  I view crypto and AI as totally different things. Crypto is a neat technology but the idea of treating it as an \u201cinvestment\u201d is just a misunderstanding of the difference between gambling versus investing. Logically, blockchain technologies should be interesting to computer scientists but utterly boring to Miami Influencer Bros. Their very presence on the scene proves that it\u2019s a fad. AI is a shockingly powerful way to get machines to be intelligent. The deeper you dig, the more amazing you realize the results are. The LLMs are definitely thinking and reasoning, even if their current lack of long-term contextual memory limits some aspects of this intelligence. But Claude and GPT4 have already earned spots the top 100 list of world coders, beating almost all humans even when solving novel non-Googlable coding problems. And they write really clean code with super helpful comments as well! I may need to fix that sentence: I think Deepmind\u2019s Alphafold is thousands of times better at designing new drug candidates than the former method of human intuition, and it should soon get better at predicting the outcomes of clinical trials which can help us design better, shorter ones. But we\u2019re only starting to see the results of that with a few new things  so far. Big hype in 2021: https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/robtoews\/2021\/10\/03\/alphafold-is-the-most-important-achievement-in-ai-ever\/ A tempered but still real world usefulness as of 2024: https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41592-023-02087-4  Anand February 25, 2025, 1:57 pm  Great Article, i have been researching this on my own lately and considering.  a. Instead of just S&P 500 index, what about equal weighted S&P 500 \u2026 This way you do participate in the M7 on the AI rally as well as rebalance with other 493 companies in the index.  is it true equal weight vs regular indexing as higher returns 1% more . ..?  b. Rebalancing and increasing the % of investments in  Value Growth stocks in an index  vs S&P 500 index  what are your thoughts..?  Gary Grewal February 25, 2025, 1:58 pm  A good seasonally-adjusted reminder to invest for the long term and disclosure that stocks are expensive right now, investors being willing to pay a premium. Many of us have been waiting a while to buy stocks on sale! AI sure has a lot of \u201cpros\u201d to it, seems like we should be telling the next generation to do what it can\u2019t like construction, trades, comedy, acting, or building awesome trails.  AI Ponderer February 25, 2025, 2:00 pm  Do you have any broader thoughts on AI, MMM? I\u2019ll be honest, the whole thing kind of depresses me, even as I acknowledge its potential benefits. But I was wondering if an eternal optimist like you can give me the face punch I need. In part it\u2019s because it will likely directly eliminate my job in the next few years. Oh well, I\u2019ll get a new job. But just in general it feels like it\u2019s eliminating the last few realms where everyday people could outperform machines and derive meaning even just as hobbyists.  Mr. Money Mustache February 25, 2025, 2:55 pm  There\u2019s definitely a risk of that \u2013 but people have also said the same thing about every other efficiency boosting technology since the beginning and yet here we are more prosperous than ever.  Could it be different this time? Of course, the future is always uncharted.  But optimism is also always the best strategy, partly because worrying saps your energy and becomes self-fulfilling. https:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2012\/10\/03\/the-practical-benefits-of-outrageous-optimism\/  RichardP February 25, 2025, 3:01 pm  In broad strokes, I think the AI situation is going to play out like the dotcom bubble.  I think some companies are going to make a fortune and we\u2019re going to see permanent and dramatic changes in business, society, etc.  I also think some companies are going to go bankrupt because they didn\u2019t execute well enough or some other company just did it better and \u2018ate their lunch\u2019. As for the current market valuation, I think some selling might be appropriate.  Having said that, we need to distinguish between \u2018timing the market\u2019 and following the old adage of \u2018buy low, sell high\u2019.  Market timing is when you buy and sell based on what you think is going to happen in the future.  Bad plan.  No one has been able to do it consistently.  But we should be looking at the market and asking, \u201cIs it cheap or expensive RIGHT NOW?\u201d  I think the answer is pretty obvious and it makes sense to react to current conditions.  Will February 25, 2025, 3:14 pm  After an afternoon doomscrolling political and economic news,  feeling like the market is indeed a house of cards teetering on the brink of a collapse it may never recover from, this is exactly the article I needed to read. Think I\u2019ll head out on a brisk hill walk. Cheers! P.S You were my introduction to the FIRE movement 10 years ago, and just might have changed my life (for the better!)  CaptainFI February 25, 2025, 3:29 pm  Totally agree with paying off the mortgage, as our family has grown our appetite for debt has decreased \u2013 my plan is to pay off our hobby farm ASAP (looking like 5 years if I keep aggressively shovelling money into it) and switched the investment property to interest only. We are doing our stock market investing through our retirement scheme (superannuation here in Australia) mostly into my wife\u2019s account and then anytime we get small windfalls my wife invests into her brokerage account \u2013 it\u2019s going really well, and we are hoping to be debt free soon  Alec February 25, 2025, 4:19 pm  Hi MMM, Thanks for posting this and all your great work over the years!  I have a question about the \u201cWhat happens if stock valuations return to normal\u201d chart.  I don\u2019t understand a couple things \u2013 first, what is the y axis?  second, why does the red line start at a lower value than the yellow and blue lines on the left edge?   I just ER\u2019d at 59.  I\u2019m still trying to figure out a proper asset allocation given currently high valuations.  It\u2019s always tricky.  I want to participate in the market but I don\u2019t want to worry about a big downturn in markets given that I\u2019m no longer contributing and so will not have the benefit of decades of time and dollar cost averaging.  Daniel February 26, 2025, 7:44 am  Y axis is S&P500. On x-axis, Year 0 means \u201cright now\u201d. The x-axis means \u201cfuture\u201d. The red line starts below yellow and blue because stocks are overvalued, i.e. have a higher P\/E. The red shows what S&P SHOULD BE if P\/E was typical, not very high as it is now. Basically, if the market crashed right now and reversed to a normal P\/E. The blue line shows what S&P would be in the future if the current trends continue (unlikely). As mentioned above, the red line shows what S&P future will be if stocks would suddenly revert to a typical P&E now. The yellow line is similar to the red line, but shows a more gradual reversal to typical P\/Es, over time. M&Ms point is that even the worse case scenario \u2013 red line \u2013 is still pretty good.  Alec February 26, 2025, 12:04 pm  Thanks for the explanation Daniel!  Daniel February 26, 2025, 3:37 pm  You are very welcome, Alec.  Aaron Hemry February 25, 2025, 5:20 pm  Great article! I\u2019m curious how much the simple supply and demand curve influences stock prices. Surely as millions of retail and professional investors put upward buying pressure on stocks, the stock price goes higher than historical P\/E ratios suggest they will eventually be. Unless companies are issuing new shares, the supply is limited, so up goes the price. Indexing surely has a similar effect. Lots of us are buying cap weighted index funds and therefore driving the prices up, especially of the biggest companies. It makes sense to value only the \u201crent\u201d received from these shares, but what choice do people have but to buy in whatever the price? Acting in any other way is market timing, right? So, if you are going to need that invested money anytime soon, you have to consider market timing, or value capturing if you want to call it that. What say you?  Jenny February 25, 2025, 5:22 pm  I have all my money in VTSAX like you recommended way back in the olden days. But now you recommend VTI.  Is there much difference? I\u2019m hopeful that AI will improve and lengthen our lives even though a lot of people don\u2019t want progress and hinder it as best they can.  Bob February 26, 2025, 7:32 am  VTI is the ETF versions of VTSAX.  No appreciable difference.  Rob from Montreal February 25, 2025, 5:39 pm  Great Blog Pete! Wondering if the tariffs threats that are causing consumer jitters in the USA is causing some of this volatility in the stock market?  carl February 25, 2025, 5:57 pm  \u201cIn other words, the Price-to-earnings ratio has risen from about 20 back then, to about 30 today.\u201d One thing I\u2019ve wondered about is if there are other factors at play here. One of them is market participation. Looking at multpl, the PE bounced up and down in pretty much the same band from the 1800s all the way to about 1990. From that point on, it\u2019s been mostly higher. In 1974, the IRA was invented. Then came the 401k in 1978 and the Roth IRA in 1997. It\u2019s never been easier to invest in the markets than it is right now. Growing up, my parents didn\u2019t know anything about the stock market and had nothing directly invested in it. Now, I have money in it as do all of my siblings. So, maybe the PE is destined to be permanently higher because more people are investing? Could another factor be wealth? Most are better off now, so there is more money to play with. Dunno.  Paul February 27, 2025, 11:22 am  I think you\u2019re spot on that easier access to the stock market is a big factor. Your comment got me curious about what else might be at play, so I had AI dig into it a bit (seemed fitting for this article, right?). I thought the research was pretty interesting and worth sharing: https:\/\/chatgpt.com\/share\/67c0ac37-a0f0-8005-b15f-2f098024630f  Mr. Money Mustache February 27, 2025, 12:25 pm  Nice work Paul! I especially enjoyed how most of the references are from my blogger colleagues \u201cA Wealth of Common Sense\u201d and \u201cConversable Economist\u201d \u2013 they publish good stuff. Yes, more participation in the stock market does add demand for shares. But in theory, the bigger flow of investment money should ALSO lead to a bigger supply of shares via increased company formation and more IPOs. More investment should lead to our economy growing faster, as well as more competition for our consumer dollars which is a nice deflationary force.  But would the end point still be an equilibrium point of higher P\/E ratios? I can\u2019t answer this because I think we just pushed this discussion a bit above my pay grade.  Any other economists (certified or armchair) want to weigh in?  Kevin OBrien February 25, 2025, 6:04 pm  I took off from work to go snowboarding with my childhood best friend and I get MMM article on the same day. Doesn\u2019t get much better than that. Great article and thanks for your insights.  Rob February 25, 2025, 7:36 pm  Some context regarding the accuracy of Vanguard\u2019s previous predictions: https:\/\/www.mymoneyblog.com\/vanguard-10-year-stock-market-forecast-2025-2035.html TL:DR \u2013 not accurate.  Brad February 25, 2025, 7:50 pm  I must admit it does feel a bit like 1999. Even if I had a crystal ball, I\u2019m not sure I would do much differently. In December and again in January I took some tech stock profits off the table. I\u2019m now sitting on what I like to call my five year emergency fund. it\u2019s earning 4% interest and it feels sort of good to have as a bridge over troubled waters if needed. And it\u2019s never a bad idea to follow Warren Buffett\u2019s lead.  Dharma Bum February 25, 2025, 7:55 pm  It sounds weird, but I\u2019m kind of glad to be getting old. Most of this AI stuff is not really going to affect me too much. I retired early on MMM\u2019s recommendation. Fortunately I\u2019ve been investing in the stock market since the early 90s, so I can\u2019t even remember how many times the money has doubled (Hint:start EARLY kiddos!). I feel blessed to have mostly dodged the major financial bullets over the decades, but either way, the key was to stay fully invested and diversified throughout the ups and downs.Oh, and NEVER believe the hype or listen to financial pundits and gurus (well, maybe other than the Buffet).  Andy February 25, 2025, 8:50 pm  I feel like everything that was promised in the dot com era was eventually fulfilled, just some years after the crash.  AI is very promising but the timing of the monetization of AI is the key. I shifted out of US funds and into international funds, particularly a high dividend yield fund with a PE ratio of just 12. The idea for that came from that vanguard forecast you mentioned. I read another report, from fidelity I think,  that said international would outpace US stocks for at least 20 years.  Who knows how their models work, but it\u2019s interesting that they are in some agreement.  Scott Trench February 25, 2025, 9:03 pm  MMM \u2013 Great thoughts here. I am certainly one of those who is concerned about the extremely expensive stock market, and worry that stocks are priced with expectations of incredible golden age type profits being just around the corner.  I love the rational take here, the reassurance that the long-run still offers good returns for even expensive US stocks, and I also like the fact that there is some very reasonable puts around the benefits of paying off a higher interest rate mortgage.  Given that I have spent so much time around real estate, I\u2019m just more comfortable with it, and the \u201cP\/E\u201d ration real estate (cap rates) in my local area, relative to the. S&P 500 right now. And, I\u2019m reluctant to and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m really doing when I invest in international stocks.  TomP February 25, 2025, 9:55 pm  Thank you, this confirms many of my thoughts so far. I guess we\u2019ll finally see that overdue decade of MSCI World outperforming SP500 before things turn around again for a decade or so. Meanwhile, on the us side, do you think it would make sense to invest preferentially in SP500-MAG7 ? I also look forward to what AI will bring. If done right it will also largely compensate for demographic issues and ageing populations in the developed world.  John February 26, 2025, 1:00 am  I\u2019m retired and trying to decide whether to keep my house, or sell it and put the money in VTSAX or similar. Is there a formula for the net rental income that I receive vs safe withdrawal rate if invested in stocks. I\u2019ve been using the 4% rule as how much I should net from my rental house, compared with stocks. For example if I can net $1M selling my house, I could get $40K a year at 4%. If I net more than $40K annually from rent, keeping the house is a better deal. But being a landlord sucks, especially in NYC, so passive income is more appealing, all things being equal. Any advice\/comments?  Alan February 26, 2025, 1:29 am  Dear MMM and all other readers Thank you for getting to the point of the complicated. As you said, it\u2019s just simple math. Regarding the 330+ billion cash Warren Buffett has invested in short-dated government bonds. Compared to the S&P500 with a P\/E ratio of 27.8, the government bonds are yielding 4 to 5% without risk. The S&P500 yields around 3.6% (risky \/ inverse of 27.8). Here too,  it\u2019s just simple math. Best wishes from Switzerland, Alan  Jujubean February 26, 2025, 2:06 am  There\u2019s was a fascinating article in the New Yorker last year by Ted Chiang: \u201cWill A.I. Become the New McKinsey?\u201d I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on it.  Austin February 26, 2025, 3:27 am  Any recommendations for a \u201creal return\u201d percentage for a retirement calculator looking ahead 20-30 years. I often hear people using 6-7% real, but based on the current valuations, I\u2019m thinking that may be way too optimistic.  HarryH February 26, 2025, 4:09 am  I\u2019ve started investing about 8 years ago. I\u2019ve decided, and stuck with, a two prong approach. Half in well known index etf\u2019s, half in about 20 handpicked stocks that I liked. If i screw up myself, I would still have the etf\u2019s. For my own hand picked stocks, I choose to stick to about 20 stocks. Research has shown multiple times that 20 stocks will yield the same results as an index consisting of hundreds or even thousands of stocks. You don\u2019t need an index, you just need 20 random stocks and they\u2019ll perform the same. My 20 stocks I keep as a hobby and to learn about new companies, how companies are run, new insights etc. It keeps me interested in the stockmarket. The stocks that I pick are companies I\u2019m familiar with, or believe will do well. I avoid hype like the plague. I avoid high PE\u2019s. I try to follow Buffets advice as best I can. Don\u2019t loose money. Buy low, sell never or at least very high. I\u2019ve sold Tesla at a loss in 2019, never owned it again. I\u2019ve never owned Meta, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia. Or AMD, or any other recent 10bagger. I have stuck with boring, mostly relatively unknown stocks. Or where I saw a real opportunity.  The real kicker? About 70% of the stocks are European. I barely own any US stocks.  The results: My own hand picked 20 stocks have done better than the S&P500.  I\u2019m not a great stock picker. I didn\u2019t invest in NVidia, Google, AMD. I sold Tesla at a loss before it went time 20. I still hold a 50% on a significant Intel stake. I stuck to Europe while the US outperformed. And yet, my returns have beaten the S&P500.  There are some great stocks in Europe. There is also a lot of not so great stocks. Picking the great ones isn\u2019t hard. Most can see the bad ones from far away and avoid them like the plague. The real problem for Europe, is the lack of representative indexes. The European indexes just simply suck. Not enough stocks in them. Every country has their own indexes of just a few stocks. And maybe an even bigger underappreciated problem comparing the US to the EU: dividends. The US companies barely pay dividends, while EU companies still pay a good deal. The difference adds up over the years, but most indexes don\u2019t compare the total return. As for these high markets: please keep in mind: we\u2019ve had some serious inflation. Inflation adjusted returns over the last years aren\u2019t out of the ordinary. Especially comparing inflation adjusted returns to something like a zero risk tips ladder. Your S&P500 without the magnificent seven looks less impressive. But instead of taking out the best performers, maybe do the same but also take out the absolute worst performers. And then do both. You might be surprised to learn the whole market is actually doing really pretty well. Conclusion: I\u2019m really not worried. Taking a broader look and accounting for inflation and zero risk treasuries, returns aren\u2019t extraordinary. We live in a world where in one generation, huge countries go from poor to rich, and they all want stable investments for their retirements. We live in an age where a growing number of retires will keep demand high because they don\u2019t have to fear for their incomes. House payments look high, but the total mortgage debt in many western countries is actually quite low. If there ever was a golden age, it\u2019s now. We\u2019re deadsmack in the middle of the best economic boom in history, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be ending anytime soon (if you take a worldwide broad look). Don\u2019t focus too much on the numbers. Look around the world, see how much things are improving in just one generation world wide. You can only conclude demand for stocks will keep increasing, and companies will keep improving profits as demand keeps increasing. Will there be shock and crashes? Sure, but nothing to worry about for a early retiree.  Joe February 26, 2025, 4:49 am  I also like to think of the property pay down as an after tax return, since you need to earn the money first , then pay taxes to pay the mortgage. On the US vs International shares,  people recommending to stay US only, I wonder if there\u2019s bias because the US has done well and whether that position would\u2019ve been very different if we were looking at a period where US had seen a weak decade, like post 08?  pat February 26, 2025, 5:18 am  Having started investing in real estate before the 18% mtg rates, then watch my collegues sweat out Black Monday Oct 19\/87, Iam glad we stayed 100% RE. Passive income allowed me to retire in 1998 & over the years we have also unloaded many high cap. appreciated investment properties, often holding the notes @ 10-12% with a 5yr balloon. We still buy using cash from our 401(k)-solos. Real Esatate has been our \u2018annuity\u2019 & has outperformed most of those we know who have invested heavily in the equities market.  Over the years the odd bad tenant, bloodied knuckles & rehab costs have never been as stressful as our friends who said they refused to look at their 401(k)\u2019s as the mkt swooned. All have since worked until their late 60\u2019s. In fact my business consultant, equities investor friend, who told us we would go broke in real estate, suffers very poor health & still has to work at 70. Thanks to my wife all of our kids are heavily invested in real estate & have enough passive income to cover their respective mortgages.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"\u201cThe product I started the company to create,\u201d says CEO. \u201cThe product I started the company to create,\u201d says CEO. by  Sean Hollister Framework, the modular repairable computer company, says budget laptops generally suck \u2014 and it plans to fix that this year. Today, it\u2019s previewing a computer called the Framework Laptop 12 that\u2019ll be its smallest laptop yet, its first with a touchscreen, its first with a 2-in-1 convertible hinge, and its first with a rubber-esque shock absorbing TPU outer edge to make it more suitable for kids and students, too. \u201cWe build products to fix what we see as a broken industry, and few categories are as emblematic of the problems with consumer electronics as entry-level laptops,\u201d writes Framework CEO Nirav Patel, continuing: They tend to be janky, locked-down, disposable, underpowered, and frankly, boring machines. Shamefully, these are the products that PC brands market for use by students and young people around the world. Instead, we believe these are the people who most need thoughtfully designed, long-lasting computers. Patel says the Framework Laptop 12 \u201cis in many ways the product I started the company to create,\u201d and that it will be \u201cour easiest product ever to repair\u201d \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t say how, exactly, and it sadly didn\u2019t have any internals visible at its event in San Francisco today for us to check out. We did get to take one for a spin, though, and it feels well-built! Though I did keep making mistakes when I intended to hit its unusually small Shift key \u2014 I goofed and wound up typing on an international layout, it seems. The active stylus has both a USB-C charging port and a replaceable battery inside \u2014 just use a paper clip or SIM card tool to pop off the end first. The laptop will come with a 13th Gen Intel Core i3 or i5 chip (circa 2023), a 1920x1200 screen at over 400 nits of brightness with both touch and stylus support, up to 48GB of RAM and up to 2TB of NVMe storage, and Wi-Fi 6E. It\u2019s also got four of Framework\u2019s Expansion Card slots, which is how Framework lets you pick your own ports. Despite the claim that the Framework Laptop 12 is designed to fix entry-level laptops, Framework isn\u2019t sharing any idea of pricing today, beyond that it will be \u201clower cost\u201d compared to the Framework Laptop 13, which typically starts at around $750 for a DIY model with previous-gen chips or $1,100 for a prebuilt with the latest ones. When I corner the CEO, though, Patel does hint to me that it won\u2019t try too hard to match the competition. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be down in the bottom-end Chromebook rung,\u201d he tells me. But while Framework products often cost more than you\u2019d pay for the same specs with Dell, HP, or Lenovo, it is the first and only company that has repeatedly delivered on the promise of modular upgrades, letting you easily swap out the entire motherboard and processor as a single module for a new one down the road. For example, Framework is also announcing a new AMD mainboard for its Framework Laptop 13 today, one that can breathe new life into any previous iteration of that laptop, even the original Intel version it released in 2021. Framework says it\u2019ll open preorders in April and ship in \u201cmid-2025.\u201d Framework also announced the Framework Desktop today. Update, February 26th: Added a short hands-on video; we also added a quote from Patel and early impressions yesterday following the event. Correction, February 26th: I originally wrote Framework was using a small split shift key that tripped up my typing; on closer inspection, it also had demos with larger shift keys, and I may have been using an international layout by accident.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"A gauge of consumer confidence registered its largest monthly drop since 2021. Consumer confidence plummeted in February, indicating worry about the direction of the U.S. economy under President Donald Trump. A gauge of consumer confidence registered its largest monthly drop since August 2021, the nonpartisan Conference Board said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the share of consumers who expect a recession within the next year surged to a nine-month high, the data showed. A growing portion of consumers believe the job market will worsen, the stock market will fall and interest rates will rise, the report added. Trump has issued a flurry of economy-related directives since he took office last month, including tariff proposals, spending cuts and an assault on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Earlier this month, Trump announced 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada as well as 10% tariffs on products from China. Trump paused the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month after striking a deal with each of the two countries on drug trafficking and border security. On Monday, Trump said he plans to go forward with the tariffs when that pause lifts next week. Seven of every 10 American adults believe tariffs will raise prices, an Ipsos survey found last week. Concern about rising prices coincides with a bout of resurgent inflation that stretches back to the final months of the Biden administration. Consumer prices rose 3% in January compared to a year ago, registering a percentage point higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%. Egg prices, a closely watched symbol of rising costs, soared 53% in January compared to a year ago. An avian flu has decimated the egg supply, lifting prices higher. \"Consumers who fear the impact of higher tariffs, spending cuts, and deportations are getting worried and are likely to be more cautious,\" Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Dallas, told ABC News. Meanwhile, U.S. hiring slowed at the outset of the year. The nation added 143,000 jobs in January, far fewer than the 265,000 jobs gained a month prior, government data showed. Still, some measures of consumer sentiment improved this month. Consumers\u2019 assessment of current business conditions moved higher, while an uptick in purchasing plans for a home extended a monthslong recovery. The fresh data follows a report last month from the University of Michigan showing that its gauge of consumer sentiment had declined for the first time in six months. The results showed a sharp disparity between Democrats and Republicans, however. Attitudes among Democrats worsened while sentiment among Republicans improved. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Hold on before you buy a brand-new iPhone. Apple dominated refurbished smartphone sales in 2024 with 56% of the market \u2014 a 5% increase from 2023, according to a report from Counterpoint Research. That\u2019s faster growth than the new phone market, which grew only 3%. Apple drove the majority of growth in the market. In several regions, the supply of refurbished phones outpaced sales. In fact, there were so many in-demand models that the average sales price dropped to $394 from 2023\u2019s $445. There are multiple factors at play driving the cost down. Inflation and the rising costs of goods have resulted in more frugal spending for many families, but another aspect to examine is what phones offer. The iPhone 16 lineup introduced many new features, but its overall performance isn\u2019t much greater than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Sure, you get things like Apple Intelligence, an Action button, and some other useful features, but the core applications for a phone \u2014 talking, browsing socials, etc. \u2014 are virtually the same. With that in mind, customers are using their phones for longer. Devices have become more durable in recent years, making it easier to get through a standard two-year generation without cracking a display or otherwise breaking the phone. The only risk to using an older model device for an extended period is that security support will eventually end. Apple is notable for providing extended support for its phones, with many devices remaining viable five to seven years after they are no longer for sale. As a result, the iPhone 11 will likely receive support until 2026. Android devices tend to receive only two to three years of updates, although Google has raised the bar with the Pixel line and offers up to seven years of support. Qualcomm recently announced a program that would allow manufacturers to offer up to eight consecutive years of Android updates, allowing the non-iPhone market to offer longer support windows. However, it\u2019s up to the manufacturers how long support lasts. With talk of the iPhone 17 already creating headlines, you could get your hands on one of the iPhone 14 line for a bargain. Now that Apple has killed off its budget lineup, it would be no surprise to see second-hand sales continue to grow over the next year. Apple has started taking pre-orders for its latest smartphone, the iPhone 16e, in the U.S. and elsewhere. The rather divisive budget-focused smartphone from Apple is a major evolution over the now-defunct iPhone SE and sits underneath the mainline iPhones with a bunch of similarities and some serious feature-trimmings, as well. It starts at $599 in the U.S. for the 128GB storage variant, while the 256GB and 512GB variants will have you parting ways with $699 and $899, respectively. In a recent survey of iPhone owners, 48% of those now wielding Apple\u2019s smartphone had previously owned an Android phone. The data comes from an extensive report using information gathered from 4,000 individuals by analysts at Counterpoint Research, and shows despite the challenges those who switch from Android to iOS (or vice versa) often face, it didn\u2019t put almost half of current iPhone owners off. The research then states it\u2019s Samsung and Google suffering the most when someone decides it\u2019s time to buy an iPhone, to the point the paper warns Samsung may see a marked fall in S-series ownership over the next two years if the trend continues. It\u2019s added that Samsung, along with brands like OnePlus and China\u2019s market leader Vivo, are using AI and flagship specifications to differentiate devices, in an effort to entice and retain buyers. What a shame the Apple iPhone 16e isn\u2019t more fun. I don't mean exciting, and I\u2019m not talking about the specification, or that a modem is the most technically interesting aspect (it\u2019s important, but modems are inherently a bit dull) of the phone. I mean fun, and I\u2019m specifically talking about it coming in only two colors, and the ones Apple chose are as vanilla and ordinary as you can get. Two colors The iPhone 16e is available in black or white. These are the most Apple colors it could have chosen, and fitting as the brand which arguably launched the white smartphone craze in 2008 with the iPhone 3G, when it joined the safe choice black iPhone 3G. What\u2019s old is new again, but things have moved on since the days of a white iPhone capturing attention. Apple has actually moved on too, as we'll soon show, which makes the whole situation feel out of place. There just can\u2019t be any fanfare around a new 2025 iPhone where the choice is either boring black, or overdone white.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Chegg is sort of on its last dying breath at this point, but it will go out fighting. The online education company, which started out renting textbooks and later expanded into online homework help, sued Google on Monday for anticompetitive practices, saying it is unfairly scraping material from Chegg for its AI-powered search results. The lawsuit is not anything groundbreaking or novel\u00e2\u0080\u0094Google has been attacked over the years by the likes of Yelp over claims it uses its search dominance to copy products and keep users on its own website. Chegg argues that by scraping websites and surfacing snippets directly in the search results page, Google is killing demand for original content and eroding the financial incentives for companies like Chegg to actually invest in producing the material that powers AI programs. It will be all AI models of dubious quality citing other AI generated content of dubious quality. While big tech companies have lined up in support of President Trump, some of the new administration remains skeptical of the industry, so it is not a guarantee that Google will be able to dodge the case. Though, it is notable that Chegg\u2019s stock is down 30% the day after the lawsuit was filed. Google and others in tech have argued their use of others\u2019 material in chatbots is fair use because they are transforming the content significantly. And they say new tools like AI-powered summaries do not reduce traffic to third-party sites because they can help users find the information they want faster; people will always want to dive in deeper when they find something of interest. But with a website like Chegg that can provide straightforward answers to math problems to lazy students, it seems users could simply copy-paste the response from Google and move on. Chegg has had a rollercoaster of a ride since 2020. Besides textbook rentals, the company offers the ability to seek homework help from a group of human experts, and demand for its services immediately skyrocketed at the onslaught of the pandemic. The return to classroom instruction and the launch of ChatGPT reversed all those gains, however. Chegg\u2019s stock is trading at just $1 per share today, down from a peak of $113 in 2021 after shedding hundreds of thousands of subscribers in 2024. The company, by suing Google for scraping websites to use in chatbots, does have a point that the tech giant is supporting the dead internet theory, the idea that the internet is being overrun by bot activity and automatically generated content (see: Facebook, YouTube AI slop). Chegg itself has rushed to compete with its own AI-assisted answers, and users on forums like Reddit have alleged the provided solutions are regularly not correct. In a sense, companies like Google are to blame for that. Chegg had to do something to try and keep up, but its answers are hard to trust at this point (besides the vetted textbook solutions). Other websites like StackOverflow, a Q&A website for programmers, have similarly been hollowed out by the advent of chatbots. Something that is overlooked about using a site like StackOverflow is that struggling through problems helps one gain foundational knowledge more than getting an answer returned immediately with no reasoning. StackOverflow requires one to read multiple expert discussions to get the full picture. It is slower, but one comes out better understanding not just the solution to a problem but why it worked. Chegg has said it wants to target \u201ccurious learners\u201d with more comprehensive and vetted answers, assisted of course, by AI. Chegg might not be the most sympathetic character, but there is real concern about what tools like Google\u2019s AI summaries are doing to the internet if websites like theirs and StackOverflow cannot survive and produce the detailed, step-by-step knowledge that supports AI models in the first place. Unfortunately, it seems like many consumers do not care, however, and will accept Google\u2019s AI answers out of sheer laziness even if they are aware it is prone to making errors.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"The Nvidia RTX 50-series is one of the most controversial graphics card launches in many years, but that doesn\u2019t stop the top cards being some of the best you can buy \u2014 if you can find them at a fair price. Two of the top options worth considering are the RTX 5080 and 5070 Ti: two powerful GPUs with lots of fast memory, plenty of CUDA cores, and the latest generations of RT and tensor cores. But how do these two cards stack up? With prices flying wild, here\u2019s how to nail down which graphics card is best for you. Both the RTX 5080 and RTX 5070 Ti are\u00a0technically available in that they have both been officially launched and have their recommended retail prices: $1,000 and $750, respectively. However, those aren\u2019t realistic, as third-parties control pricing for the 5070 Ti, and have vastly outstripped it; The ongoing Trump tariffs are driving prices higher across the board, too. Stock levels are almost non-existent due to ongoing production problems \u2014 leading some cards to ship without the right internal hardware \u2013 so pricing has gone completely bananas, on top of the manufacturer-mandated price rises. At the time of writing, the RTX 5070 Ti is sometimes available for around $800, but you\u2019re much more likely to find one at around $1,000. The RTX 5080 is going for as much as $2,000, but you can sometimes find them between $1,400 and $1,800. The on-paper differences between these two graphics cards are relatively minor, giving us our first glimpse of what is in actuality, quite close real-world performance. The RTX 5080 has 20% more CUDA cores, RT cores, and Tensor cores, but at roughly the same clock speeds. Memory quantities are the same, with only the slightly faster speed of the GDDR7 making a real difference to the overall bandwidth \u2014 and even then, it\u2019s minor. Wattage demands aren\u2019t insignificant, but 13% isn\u2019t anything crazy. If you have a PSU that\u2019s capable of handling the RTX 5070 Ti, it\u2019ll almost certainly be enough for the 5080, t00. We tested the RTX 5080 when it first debuted, and found it a very capable graphics card \u2014 albeit one that falls behind both the RTX 5090 and RTX 4090, by enough of a margin that 4090 owners must be very happy with their last-gen purchase. Although we haven\u2019t had a chance to test the RTX 5070 Ti, yet, it\u2019s an easy one to compare, because it\u2019s about as powerful as an RTX 4080 Super. In fact, the 4080 Super is slightly faster in some cases, though the added multi frame gen support with the RTX 50-series does give it an advantage in certain games. The 7900 XTX isn\u2019t a bad analogy for the 5070 Ti in non-RT games, but when ray tracing is turned on the AMD cards fall far behind, so it\u2019s not a universal analog. In Nvidia\u2019s own graphs, it claimed that the 5070 Ti was around 20% faster than the 4070 Ti (non-Super) which kind of works out in the wider third-party testing. Although the RTX 5080 is the stronger card, it only works out around 10-15% faster than the 5070 Ti and it does it while demanding more power, and with a price that\u2019s at least 50% higher. In a normal graphics card generation where there\u2019s some immediate competition from AMD at every price point and the last-generation is still in stock, we\u2019d almost certainly be suggesting you avoid the RTX 50-series \u2014 and indeed, until prices calm down, you should probably still do so. But it\u2019s not a normal GPU generation. It\u2019s one of the most catastrophic we\u2019ve seen in years. But! If you\u2019re going to buy one of these cards, where should you put your money? It\u2019s pretty obvious: The RTX 5070 Ti. It\u2019s not a great card when compared to the year-old, last-generation 4070 Ti Super, but it is faster. It\u2019s not as fast as the 5080, but it\u2019s pretty close (especially with overclocking) and you can often find it for close to two thirds of the price. That\u2019s huge. It just isn\u2019t worth spending $500+ more on a 5080 to maybe get 10% added performance. But better yet? Wait out either of these cards. Wait for stock to resume, prices to come down, and AMD to offer an alternative that might encourage Nvidia to correct course and make its cards more affordable and more capable for the money it\u2019s demanding. A boy can dream. The matchup between new-generation AMD and Nvidia graphics cards is heating up in early-2025, with Nvidia's RTX 50 storming out the gates, and AMD's RDNA4 GPUs waiting excitedly in the wings. With stock levels all over the place, prices skewing wildly too, questions abound about how these new cards will fair against one another in a straight head to head. Until we have hands-on time with these cards ourselves (and the embargos lift) we can't tell you for sure, but we can make some educated estimations of how the battle might turn out. Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti is mere days away. Set to launch on February 20, the GPU marks the beginning of Nvidia's mainstream RTX 50-series. With similar specs to the RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti has every chance to rank high among the best graphics cards -- but it's also going to face a number of obstacles that might impact its success. Thanks to some leaked benchmarks, we now have a better idea of how the card might perform, and that rough ballpark is really a bit of a mixed bag. Here's why I think the RTX 5070 Ti might have an uphill climb when it first hits the shelves, but also why it might completely displace the RTX 5080. Promising benchmarks -- well, kind of The RTX 5080 didn't blow us away in our testing, but there's no denying that it's the second fast graphics card in the world, behind Nvidia's ludicrously-priced RTX 5090 halo card. Still, if you are sitting on a last-generation RTX 4080 Super, or found one at a good price second hand and are weighing up the pros and cons, it's useful to know how these cards compare. So, let's take a look at the RTX 5080 and RTX 4080 Super, to see how the measure up.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Tesla shares tumbled sharply on Tuesday as data showed the electric vehicle maker's European car sales had fallen nearly half from a year ago. Tesla sold 9,945 vehicles in January, marking a 45% plummet from the same period one year ago, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Tesla's share of new car registrations in the region dropped from 1.8% to 1%. Tesla's sales performance was a dark spot in an otherwise bright EV market in Europe last month. Overall, new electric car sales jumped by 37.3% across the continent, capturing a 15% auto market share in European Union countries. The news sent shares in Tesla by over 9.22% by Tuesday afternoon, with the stock trading at around $300 as of 3:12 p.m. ET. The stock pared losses to end about 8% lower at $302.80. The move dragged Tesla's market cap to $974 billion, putting it below the $1 trillion milestone it had been cruising above since November. Signs had already emerged that Elon Musk's carmaker was struggling in Europe, as EU sales dropped 13% in 2024. Previous industry data showed that German sales plunged 41% last year. In January, only 1,277 new vehicles were registered last month in the country, Tesla's lowest monthly total since mid-2021, Bloomberg reported. The rise of competitors and shifting sentiment around Musk's politics are likely fueling the stagnation in sales. SAIC Motor, a Chinese auto manufacturer, led the surge of car registrations across the continent, notching a 37% increase in January. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Tesla bull-turned-skeptic Ross Gerber outlined that slowing sales could create longer-term pain for the stock. That's alongside other headwinds, such as a distracted CEO and the limits of the company's full-self driving technology. Speaking with BI last week, Gerber noted the issues with sales was one of the reasons he saw a potential 50% decline in the stock this year, highlighting stiff competition from China's BYD, which is the top threat to Tesla's business outside the US. \"Xi has made it very clear that he wants Chinese tech and EV companies to succeed, not Tesla,\" Gerber said. \"BYD is such a good company, everybody in the emerging markets are buying BYDs.\" Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks","label":1}

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Good morning! Fyre Festival is back, and it's officially got a date and location. The sequel to the infamous festival will occur from May 30 to June 2 in Isla Mujeres, Mexico. Additional details are scant, but I'm sure that's definitely not a red flag. In today's big story, the debate continues over how best to respond to DOGE's \"What did you do last week?\" email. (Got an opinion? We want to hear from you.) What's on deck Markets: Jamie Dimon's sorry about cursing, but he still wants you back in the office. Tech: AI could spell trouble for some software engineers, but it's far from a death knell for the entire profession. Business: For these companies, layoffs are never an option. But first, singing for my supper. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. From \"Should they stay or should they go?\" to \"Should they send or just no-show?\" A few weeks after considering buyout offers, federal workers faced another dilemma: Responding to Elon Musk's \"What did you do last week?\" email. The message, which asked federal workers to reply with five accomplishments from the previous week, left Washington in chaos. Agencies differed on their recommendations to employees before the deadline, which was yesterday at 11:59 p.m. The deadline may have passed \u2014 but conflicting guidance persists. The Social Security Administration initially told workers it was \"an opportunity to highlight the important work you do.\" Although it later clarified that responses were voluntary. The Department of Defense was less welcoming. The Pentagon publicly told its employees to \"pause any response\" to the email, adding that it \"is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel.\" Of course, it wouldn't be a DOGE mandate without getting the lawyers involved. All of that begs the question: What would YOU do? Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos, who wrote about how people might choose to respond to the email, wants to hear from you. She created a nifty form for you to share how you might respond. Interest in DOGE, for better or worse, doesn't seem to be waning. President Donald Trump's political operation is actually selling DOGE membership cards. For only a $47 donation, you can be the proud owner of a black metal card that says \"Trump DOGE member.\" There are also t-shirts for $40 or $28. Jamie Dimon is hopeful DOGE will be successful. \"More effective government \u2014 more efficient government \u2014 isn't bad. It's actually a good thing,\" the JPMorgan CEO said in a recent interview. Meanwhile, Rep. Rich McCormick said he's worried DOGE might be moving too quickly after getting an earful from his constituents at a recent town hall. The Georgia Republican said he's \"not against anything he's doing,\" but added that he's \"concerned that maybe we're moving a little bit too fast.\" And then sometimes things are just getting plain weird. Some Department of Housing and Urban Development employees had a brutal start to their day on Monday. TVs in the office were showing an AI-generated video of President Trump sucking Musk's toes underneath a text that read, \"LONG LIVE THE REAL KING.\" 1. YOLO traders can now literally bet the farm. The CME Group debuted a suite of agricultural \"micro\" contracts one-tenth the size of corn, wheat, and soybean futures. The move is part of CME's larger plan to pull retail investors into a market largely dominated by institutional players. On top of offering more opportunities to a wider part of the market, these bite-size options can also help smaller farmers. 2. The markets are about to feel the burn of Trump's policies, Steve Cohen says. The billionaire Point72 founder warned that slowing immigration, tariffs, and cuts to government spending could slow economic growth and create a \"significant correction.\" For investors, the best may be behind them. 3. Jamie Dimon is sorry \u2026 but not about criticizing WFH. The JPMorgan CEO apologized for cursing during a fiery rant he made against remote work at an internal town hall meeting that was leaked. But he didn't back down from his main point about the importance of in-office attendance: \"I'm not against work from home. I'm against where it doesn't work.\" 1. The AI coding apocalypse. Generative AI is beginning to shake up the engineering profession and entry-level coders could pay the price. The recent changes have software engineers worried they're coding themselves into obsolescence. But industry experts say that's unlikely to happen anytime soon. Plus, there's more to the job than just writing code \u2014 and AI has yet to catch up. 2. Donald Trump doesn't want anyone regulating Big Tech but himself. Last week, the president seemed to issue conflicting messages. On the one hand, he criticized European regulators for being too harsh on US tech companies. On the other hand, the Trump administration said it would regulate American tech companies because they have \"too much power.\" BI's Peter Kafka breaks down what it all means. 3. Elon Musk isn't the only one who hates OpenAI's for-profit plan. Sam Altman is trying to transform OpenAI from a non-profit into a more conventional business, but the process is complicated thanks to its complex corporate structure. Musk, an OpenAI cofounder who split from Altman, has vocally opposed OpenAI's plan. He's not alone, with a growing chorus of entrepreneurs, companies, and charities saying it could be a grave mistake for the AI leader. 1. POV: Your company has never conducted layoffs. Companies laying off their employees \u2014 even outside a recession \u2014 have become commonplace in the professional world. But some purposefully refrain from making cuts. Not only is the no-layoff approach good for employees, but the CEOs of these companies said they think it's good for business, too. 2. MrBeast's secrets to success. The YouTuber knows the negativity he receives \u2014 from viewers and former employees \u2014 is part of the job. But in a recent interview on \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast, MrBeast said it's helped him cultivate a stronger sense of self. He shared some key traits to his success, like his propensity for risk and what he looks for when hiring. 3. AT&T and Verizon's rivalry takes a modern twist. While AT&T navigates a rocky return to office, Verizon is seemingly looking to capitalize on its rivals' employees who aren't as keen on the mandate. In a recruiting email obtained by BI, Verizon's talent team encouraged AT&T workers to check out the company's hybrid and remote job opportunities. The outreach highlights how RTO mandates have become a sticking point for workers recently. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Due to over duplication of reporting news stories... Students using Chegg used to be the bane of my life as a CS prof circa 2018-2021. My assignments were immediately posted there and \"solved\" often with kooky solutions that many students would hand in as if they were the first people to discover the cheating site.

It's the same everywhere, many students don't do the least amount of work necessary and then complain when they get bad grades. Complain, whine, begrudge, shit-talk, write letters to profs about how they'll be cast out by their family if they don't succeed in CS, and if they get bad grades their grandmas will die of shame.You can't report an  Slashdot sued for excessive dupes. No more than usual Chegg\u2019s claims of \u201cdamages\u201d are at best disingenuous.  From an academic integrity standpoint, its business model was ethically dubious long before Google\u2019s AI came along, and now it\u2019s scrambling to compete with faster, free tools that students actually want to use. One possible result is that the suit never makes it out of the early stages, either because the court finds that Chegg hasn\u2019t adequately shown how Google\u2019s use of AI-generated snippets rises to a clear violation of antitrust law, or because the company can\u2019t establish the necessary link between this alleged misuse of its content and the erosion of its revenue. Another possibility is that Google and Chegg reach a settlement, maybe involving some kind of attribution requirement, licensing arrangement, or minimal monetary compensation, especially if Google wants to avoid protracted legal battles that draw further scrutiny to its business practices.  The current US administration has Google squarely in it's sights, and Google really doesn't need this extra attention. If the suit does move forward, Chegg still faces the challenge of proving damages\u2014particularly since it has publicly acknowledged losing new customers to free tools like ChatGPT rather than blaming Google alone.  This alone, IMHO, sinks this lawsuit.  Even if there is some infringement question over how AI Overviews are trained and presented, courts haven\u2019t yet pinned down a universal standard for what constitutes \u201cfair use\u201d or what qualifies as illegal monopoly power with regard to AI-based content. There\u2019s always a slim chance that the suit becomes a test case for how search engines handle AI-driven answers, but right now, it seems more likely that Chegg will have trouble clearing the fairly high bar of showing actual harm caused by Google\u2019s specific implementation of these summaries. As for Chegg itself, I\u2019ve never been able to see it as anything more than a glorified shortcut for lazy-ass students, a pay-to-pass service dressed up in the veneer of \u201cstudent support.\u201d It\u2019s hard to muster sympathy for a company whose bread and butter involves enabling academic cheaters, so I won\u2019t be shedding tears if their traffic and revenue slip even further. In the end, whether Google\u2019s AI Overviews hurt them or not, Chegg\u2019s business model has always skirted ethical lines, and I can\u2019t help but feel they\u2019re now crying foul only because someone else is offering free shortcuts that rival their paid ones.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Ukraine has become the world's largest producer of key military-use drones, the country's defense minister said. \"We've become the biggest drone manufacturer in the world, drones of tactical and strategic level,\" Rustem Umerov said during a Sunday press conference at Ukraine's \"Year 2025\" forum. Tactical drones support smaller-scale battlefield actions, often at close ranges, by gathering intelligence and supporting strikes, either as the munition or by providing targeting data. Strategic drones, meanwhile, are often higher-end, high-altitude systems with the endurance to advance operations against higher-priority targets. Speaking at the same press conference, Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine's commander in chief, said the country delivered over 1.3 million drones to front-line soldiers in 2024. The general added that its long-range drones can strike targets up to 1,700 kilometers inside Russia. At a separate press conference on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country produced 2.2 million drones in total in 2024 and planned to ramp up production further in 2025. Ukraine's defense ministry didn't respond to a Business Insider request for comment. Up-to-date and comprehensive data on various countries' respective drone production is scarce, making direct comparisons difficult. June 2024 data from Statista Market Insights, a data analysis service on market trends, said China was set to be the world's largest overall drone manufacturer in 2024 and was on track to produce 2.9 million drones. However, the data does not include drones for military purposes, though off-the-shelf drones for civilian use have been heavily repurposed for military use in Ukraine and further afield. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ramping up its own drone production to nearly 1.4 million in 2024, a tenfold increase from the previous year. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts around the world for intelligence and reconnaissance, bombing missions, precision strikes, and other military purposes by both state-level and non-state actors. This has led to an increased demand for counter-drone capabilities. In December, the Pentagon released a new counter-drone strategy aimed at coordinating how different branches of the US military are responding to the threat of drones and making \"countering unmanned systems a key element of our thinking.\" Drones have been a hallmark of the war in Ukraine, with both sides using the evolving technology to devastating effect. Even so, Ukrainian tactical drones face significant challenges, according to a February report by the UK's Royal United Services Institute, with a 60-80% failure rate in hitting targets \"depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\" Despite this, it said that they still account for 60 to 70% of damaged and destroyed Russian military systems. In an October speech to executives from dozens of foreign arms manufacturers, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was capable of producing 4 million drones a year, up from the one million he predicted in December 2023. Kyiv has tried to smooth the process of drone acquisitions for its troops. Last week, Umerov said Ukraine's defense ministry was launching a new drone supply model to facilitate a \"fast and uninterrupted supply of the best UAVs for our soldiers,\" and to provide its armed forces with an additional $60 million a month to purchase drones. Ukraine's growing defense industry has led some to believe that drones, among other military capabilities, could play an important role in Ukraine's postwar economic recovery. Jump to","label":0}

A report from the Conference Board Tuesday showed the sharpest one-month drop in confidence since August 2021. Consumers are particularly nervous about rising prices, with the outlook for inflation a year from now jumping to 6% \u2014 double the current rate.  \"This increase likely reflected a mix of factors, including sticky inflation but also the recent jump in prices of key household staples like eggs and the expected impact of tariffs,\" said Conference Board economist Stephanie Guichard. \"There was a sharp increase in the mentions of trade and tariffs, back to a level unseen since 2019.\" President Trump has added a 10% tariff on imports from China, and is threatening additional taxes, including a 25% levy on imports from Canada and Mexico that could take effect next week.  \"The tariffs are going forward, on time, on schedule,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Monday. A threatened tax on imported steel and aluminum could put more upward pressure on grocery prices, which have already been climbing.  Egg prices jumped more than 15% in January, as avian flu continues to weigh on the nation's flock of laying hens. Denny's restaurants followed Waffle House in adding a surcharge to menu items containing eggs.   Consumers are also feeling less confident about the job market, as the Trump administration moves to cut thousands of jobs in the federal government.  The Conference Board's expectations index, which measures the outlook for jobs, income and business conditions, fell more than 9 points in February to 72.9.  Readings below 80 are considered a warning sign for possible recession.  The Conference Board is a non-partisan think tank that conducts regular surveys on the economy. Its confidence index for February echoes a similar report on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan last week.   Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Sam Altman is attempting a thorny maneuver, transforming OpenAI from a subsidiary of a convoluted nonprofit into a more conventional business. Jungwon Byun knows what that's like. In 2023, the organization Byun cofounded, an AI lab named Ought, went through a similar transition. Launched in 2018, Ought built AI research tools and was structured as a nonprofit because its cofounders didn't expect AI to be commercially viable anytime soon, Byun said in an interview. Then ChatGPT launched, AI mania took hold, and the leadership team realized their structure might be a hindrance to raising capital and pursuing their mission. The decision was made to spin out Ought's core product, Elicit, as a for-profit company, along with most of its staff. Byun and several other executives set to lead the independent Elicit recused themselves from discussions, and a firm specializing in asset valuations was hired to independently appraise the value of Elicit so the remaining nonprofit, Ought, could be paid appropriately. (Byun declined to share the exact price, though she said Elicit chose to pay a premium on top of the recommended price.) OpenAI's planned transformation is on a far grander scale but faces similar questions and potentially more gnarly challenges. Altman wants to extricate OpenAI's revenue-generating business from its nonprofit parent, creating a more traditional company that can take in investments and give stock to shareholders who expect big returns. The process is complicated by OpenAI's complex corporate structure, the billions of dollars it has already raised from investors, and Elon Musk's attempts to block the deal. It's not just Musk though. A growing chorus of critics, including entrepreneurs, other companies and charities, investors, academics, and activists, say OpenAI may be about to make a grave mistake. Byun is one of them. \"Artificial general intelligence is the most transformative technology of our lifetime, and OpenAI is absolutely at the frontier and one of the most important players in that,\" she told Business Insider. \"So I think giving up governance rights to controlling the most important technology of our lifetime is an insanely huge decision and will affect all of humanity at a very great scale for a long time.\" Her advice to OpenAI's charitable parent organization: Do not sell to anyone. \"I don't know, obviously, the details of what pressures they're under and what the details are of the options they're considering and how it affects the mission,\" Byun said. \"But from what I can see, I absolutely would not sell those governance rights or give them up.\" OpenAI didn't respond to requests for comment over the past week. OpenAI was established as a nonprofit in 2015. Over time, its need for capital to pay for AI development prompted it to establish a for-profit subsidiary to raise venture funding and pursue business partnerships and revenue-generating products. This and various other subsidiaries are controlled by the nonprofit, which is controlled by a board of directors chaired by Bret Taylor, alongside Altman, Fidji Simo, Larry Summers, and other business luminaries. The board's main legal obligation is to further the nonprofit's charitable mission, which is to build \"safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity,\" rather than delivering returns to shareholders. OpenAI now seeks to transition to a more conventional corporate structure, turning the for-profit subsidiary into an independent public benefit company that controls \"OpenAI's operations and business.\" PBCs are relatively common. This approach takes into account the interests of shareholders, other stakeholders, and the public. OpenAI has said that with investors taken care of, this will help the startup raise \"necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space.\" OpenAI said the remaining nonprofit would receive shares in the public benefit company \"at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors.\" That may be the ultimate challenge\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and one made more complex by potential conflicts of interest. OpenAI investors and others focused on the startup's business-focused future may prefer to pay the nonprofit less for its assets and control, leaving the new for-profit entity with more financial firepower. However, some of these people could be in positions to influence the valuation and decision-making. Musk, an OpenAI cofounder who acrimoniously split from Altman, has sued the startup over its plans. Musk and a group of other investors also made a bid in February to acquire the nonprofit parent OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. That was more than half of the total value of the entire startup based on its most recent funding round. \"It is in the public's interest to ensure that OpenAI, Inc. is compensated at fair market value,\" the Musk consortium said in a statement. \"That value cannot be determined by insiders negotiating on both sides of the same table.\" Ellen Aprill, an expert on charities at the UCLA School of Law, said OpenAI's board has an obligation to make sure the nonprofit is getting a fair value for giving up its assets and control. \"One of the very big issues is what is fair market value?\" she told BI. \"In particular, how much should the nonprofit get for giving up control? \"Part of what Musk and his group were trying to do with this offer is to set at least some floor, some sense of what the fair market value would be,\" she added. \"Putting it out for auction \u2014\u00a0let's see what people would pay.\" Taylor, the OpenAI board chairman, officially rebuffed Musk. \"OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition,\" Taylor wrote in a statement. \"Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.\" Days earlier, Altman shot the bid down with a post on X that mocked the struggles of the Musk-owned social network: \"no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\" Altman's post prompted some discussion of whether he was, or should be, recused from this process. \"When it comes to looking at a conflicted transaction like this one, it's much easier to satisfy the court's review if you take people who are on both sides of their transaction out of the negotiations,\" said Peter Molk, a law professor at the University of Florida. However, he noted that under Delaware law, Altman isn't legally required to remove himself. Molk also cautioned against recusing too early. \"There's value in his being there. Along the way, he can provide useful insight and information that's actually useful for OpenAI, for the nonprofit, if they're going to go ahead with that process,\" Molk said. \"You want to try and strike a balance that allows them to do their job, that helps a transaction occur in a way that's actually beneficial to all parties, but then have them take themselves out of the picture once you're beyond that point.\" The existing for-profit parts of OpenAI have already raised billions of dollars in pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which the startup defines as systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. This has raised hackles among some consumer advocates. Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog, has repeatedly assailed the AI startup, accusing it of betraying its nonprofit mission. \"The nonprofit board has behaved as a subordinate to the for-profit, and has done nothing that evidences any commitment to the nonprofit mission,\" said Robert Weissman, the copresident of Public Citizen. He argued that the solution is to forcibly dissolve the nonprofit and auction off its assets for the benefit of a new independent charity not linked to the current OpenAI board. Meta, Facebook's parent company, raised similar concerns, writing to California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, in December to ask him to step in. \"Taking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission,\" the company wrote. \"Now, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.\" In late January, a group of 25 charities, including one started by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, piled on. The coalition urged Bonta \"to take prompt legal action to ensure that OpenAI's assets are not illegally diverted for private gain.\" Rose Chan Loui, a law professor at UCLA specializing in nonprofit and philanthropy law, is skeptical of the legal justifications for OpenAI's plan. She said the proposed changes would amount to a change in purpose for OpenAI's current nonprofit. To do that under Delaware law requires one of four criteria to be met: \"We don't think any of those apply here,\" Chan Loui said. \"We keep going back to \u2014 your purpose is not to be first in the race to AGI. Your purpose is to make sure that AGI is to protect, and ensure safe development of AGI.\" OpenAI's existing structure \u2014 a nonprofit that controls a for-profit subsidiary \u2014 is unusual, but by no means unheard of. The Mozilla Foundation, for example, owns a tech company, Mozilla Corporation, that produces the Firefox internet browser. \"Nonprofit organizations can not only coexist with commercial enterprises but also challenge them to do better,\" a Mozilla spokesperson said in a statement. \"Nonprofit commitments provide the kind of public interest compass we don't see enough of in tech.\" Another parallel comes from the healthcare sector. In the 1990s, in the face of mounting financial pressure, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association allowed its affiliated nonprofit plan organizations to transition to for-profit businesses. Many subsequently did so, to the chagrin of some. \"The mission of the nonprofit in most Blue Cross Blue Shield plans was to provide affordable, accessible healthcare to people,\" a Consumers Union attorney told NPR in 2010. \"And now the mission is to make money for stockholders.\" The most substantial threat to OpenAI's plans though, might not be Musk or other critics. The California and Delaware attorneys general are both making inquiries into the specifics of the transition. \"The current beneficiaries of OpenAI have an interest in ensuring that charitable assets are not transferred to private interests without due consideration,\" Delaware's attorney general, Kathleen Jennings, said. AGs have meaningful legal powers to get involved. In 2002, Pennsylvania's attorney general intervened in a planned deal by the nonprofit foundation that controls the for-profit Hershey chocolate brand to sell its assets to Wrigley for $12 billion, citing the potential harm to the town of Hershey. The sale was ultimately called off. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday, with inflation seemingly stuck and a trade war under President Donald Trump seen by a growing number of Americans as inevitable.  The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index sank this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That's far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.  The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August of 2021. Markets on Wall Street immediately dropped. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% in midday trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. The Nasdaq declined 1.1%. Respondents to the board's survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said. The Conference Board\u2019s report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans\u2019 short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future. The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said. Consumers\u2019 view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again. \u201cViews of current labor market conditions weakened,\u201d the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\u201d Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales and at retail stores.  Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains. Inflation has also remained sticky. So much so that the Federal Reserve has taken a more cautious approach to interest rates, leaving its benchmark borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. Fed officials have also expressed uncertainty over the new administration's policies. The most recent economic data and a pessimistic turn among American households does not bode well for the U.S. economy, experts say.  In a note to clients, Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote: \u201cBased on all the indicators showing declining consumer and business confidence and sentiment, we are expecting a slowing economy.\u201d The consumer confidence index measures both Americans\u2019 assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"As Nvidia (NVDA-7.37%) prepares to report its fiscal fourth quarter results in the wake of DeepSeek shock, analysts are optimistic that it will beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up its Blackwell chips. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.16%).  \u201cNvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,\u201d Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in comments shared with Quartz. The company dominates \u201cthe technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don\u2019t even know they need yet,\u201d Cook said. After the Chinese artificial intelligence startup spooked investors with its competitive reasoning models in January, Nvidia\u2019s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value \u2014 a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based company released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia\u2019s reduced-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek\u2019s AI models \u2014 which demonstrated performance on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META-1.98%) for seemingly thousands of chips and billions of dollars less \u2014 brought Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI into question ahead of a spate of results from Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN-2.20%), Meta, and Microsoft.  While investors waited to see if the tech giants \u201cwould lower their bold data center capex projections,\u201d spending instead grew to $325 billion, Cook said. \u201cThis is a long-term buildout for these goliaths,\u201d Cook said, adding that companies are not looking for immediate returns on investment, but are rather making \u201ca three to five-year bet when their infrastructure\u201d will be crucial to future AI development. Despite the declining costs of training and running generative AI models, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect overall spending on generative AI,\u201d John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. While \u201cDeepSeek didn\u2019t introduce anything fundamentally new\u201d about lower costs leading to higher AI adoption, Belton said, \u201cit did slightly accelerate the rate at which training costs are declining.\u201d However, DeepSeek\u2019s advancements could have a near-term impact on Nvidia and other chipmakers as U.S. officials weight stricter export controls on China, Belton said.  On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chinese AI firms including Tencent (TCEHY-0.91%), Alibaba (BABA-1.62%), and ByteDance are \u201csignificantly\u201d increasing orders of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips as demand rises for lower-cost AI models such as those from DeepSeek. The H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with existing export controls targeting China, and is less advanced than chips being sold to U.S. firms. Another area of concern, Cook said, is gross margins as Nvidia delivers its Blackwell chipset, which \u201chas been rumored to have overheating issues that may drive up costs.\u201d Investors could be spooked if gross margins fall below 73%, he added. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF-1.31%) said in a note that it still expects Nvidia to deliver a beat and a raise despite supply chain issues with Blackwell.  Meanwhile, FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. \u201cI think there was concern that DeepSeek would lead major companies to cut capital expenditures,\u201d Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Fund, said in comments shared with Quartz. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ve seen significant capex from these companies, and the market no longer seems worried about it. Nvidia\u2019s guidance should further confirm that.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning. ","label":1}

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"What do you do with a four-megapixel monochrome digital camera from the 90s that needed a dedicated PC with a frame grabber card to do anything useful? Easy \u2014 you turn it into a point-and-shoot by building your own frame grabber. At least that\u2019s what [Frost Sheridan] did with a vintage Kodak MegaPlus 4.2i, a camera that was aimed at the industrial and scientific market at a time when everyone was still using film for snapshots. Making this workhorse ride again meant diving into the manual, luckily still available after all these years, and figuring out what pins on the 68 pin connector would be useful. [Frost] worked out the pins for serial commands plus the 10-bit parallel interface, although he settled for the eight most significant bits to make things simpler. A Teensy with some extra RAM and a serial interface chip takes care of sending commands to the camera and pulling pixels off the parallel interface, and a 128\u00d7160 LCD provides a much-needed viewfinder. With a battery pack mounted the whole thing is reasonably portable, if a bit of a chore to use. It\u2019s worth the effort, though; the picture quality is fantastic, with a wide dynamic range and plenty of contrast. Hats off to [Frost] for bringing this beauty back to life without making any permanent modifications to it. Now it just needs a color wheel Indeed, it\u2019s got to be panchromatic, so color wheel for the win! Ah, heck, why have moving parts, or limit yourself to boring RGB: This camera is capable of so much more, so use a liquid crystal tunable filter instead, and do full multispectral imaging.  It\u2019s what all the cool imaging kids are doing. I had never seen braid-sleeved ribbon cables before. Neat! It\u2019s got that old CCD smoothness to it that modern CMOS cameras replaced with janky denoising artifacts. \u2026and lack of Bayer mask, and high IR sensitivity that makes blue sky look darker, and linear response (gamma=1) that changes the tone characteristics, and none of the HDR edge-enhance nonsense.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Nvidia disclosed its first financial results of the year Wednesday, delivering an eagerly awaited earnings report providing early indications of how it will emerge from the release of the less tech-intensive DeepSeek AI model from China, which led to the AI giant suffering the largest single-day market value loss in stock market history last month. Nvidia's centibillionaire CEO and cofounder Jensen Huang. In its fourth fiscal quarter ending last month, Nvidia reported $39.3 billion in revenue, $0.89 adjusted earnings per share and $22.1 billion of net income, equating to year-over-year revenue growth of 78% and profit growth of 71%. Consensus analyst estimates called for Nvidia to report $38.1 billion in revenue and $0.85 adjusted earnings per share ($19.6 billion net income), according to FactSet data. Nvidia\u2019s datacenter unit, which encompasses the company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) powering most generative AI models, brought in $35.6 billion in sales, smashing forecasts of $33.5 billion. The company said it expects revenue for its spring quarter to come in at $43 billion, give or take 2%, compared to Wall Street estimates of $42.7 billion. In the earnings release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called demand \u201camazing\u201d for his company\u2019s Blackwell GPU system which hit the market late last year. Despite the company\u2019s across-the-board beats, Nvidia stock traded slightly lower in after-hours, with the slightly negative investor reaction potentially stemming from the slight decline in the company\u2019s gross profit margins, which chief financial officer Colette Kress attributed to \u201ca transition to more complex and higher cost systems\u201d in the datacenter division. This was the weakest top and bottom line growth for Nvidia since the quarter that ended April 2023. It\u2019s still extremely robust expansion for a company of Nvidia\u2019s size despite the slowing pace, as Nvidia\u2019s growth dwarfs the 4% revenue and 10% profit expansion most recently reported by Apple, the only company with a higher market value than Nvidia. $72.9 billion. That\u2019s how much net profit Nvidia brought in during its fiscal year ending last month, a 145% year-over-year jump. It\u2019s an even starker 875% bottom line increase from the fiscal year ending in January 2023, as Nvidia took off amid the AI rush. Shares of Nvidia rose nearly 4% during normal trading Wednesday, closing at $131.28. But Nvidia, with a $3.2 trillion market cap, registered its cheapest intraday share price since Feb. 3 on Tuesday after a down start to the week, declining about 3% apiece Monday and Tuesday. This week\u2019s losses come as tech stocks broadly pulled back amid growing investor anxiety about uncertainty from President Donald Trump\u2019s economic agenda; the Nasdaq declined more than 1% each of Monday and Tuesday as the index closed at its lowest level since late November. Nvidia stock entered earnings while navigating an unusually down stretch, trading about 10% below where it stood ahead of its most recent earnings report in November even after Wednesday\u2019s bump. And the stock is down nearly 10% over the last month during the DeepSeek selloff, as the market expressed concerns high-performing generative AI models which can run on less of Nvidia\u2019s pricey semiconductor technology may lead to weaker sales for Nvidia. The earnings report was a \u201cmassive\u201d test for a wobbling stock market with perception \u201cheavily skewed negative right now,\u201d remarked Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives in a Tuesday note. Heading into earnings, analysts remained largely optimistic on Nvidia stock despite the recent holding pattern. The $175 average price target among the 68 analysts tracked by FactSet indicates 38% upside from Nvidia\u2019s Tuesday share price. Wednesday\u2019s earnings call \u201ccould mark the trough in investor sentiment,\u201d predicted Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya, who are among the most outspoken Nvidia bulls on Wall Street with a $190 price target. The California-based Nvidia became the poster child of this decade\u2019s AI revolution as the top designer of the technology training large-language models. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate Nvidia will capture about 95% of the $158 billion global GPU market in 2025. Nvidia\u2019s dominant market share led to its stock to take off, and it was the best-performing stock of 2023 and 2024 among stocks listed on the S&P for the entirety of those years. But Nvidia has not outperformed the broader market recently, gaining 3.7% over the last six months, worse than the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 6.7% return. Huang, the 13th-richest person in the world, downplayed the negative investor reaction to the DeepSeek release, saying last week the idea AI spending will slow down is \u201ccomplete opposite\u201d of the truth.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Before I visited Bali, I was convinced by posts on Reddit and TikTok that it was little more than a crowded playground for influencers trying to get the perfect photo for Instagram. Knowing that many of its popular areas, like Seminyak and Kuta, have struggled to deal with high levels of tourism (and the pollution and damage that can cause) in the past few years only added to the image I'd created in my mind.  I don't travel just to snap photos, and I enjoy getting to explore without crowds, so when I finally visited, I decided to head to a less popular and more rural region of Eastern Bali: Sidemen. I'd heard about Sidemen from a friend who had visited Bali a few months prior. After seeing images of the area's lush green landscape and reading about its incredible waterfalls and laid-back feel, I was sold. When I arrived in Sidemen, I was delighted to find the lush valley was filled with rice terraces, artisan silver workshops, and otherworldly landscapes. I stayed at Cepik Villa Sidemen, a resort where I paid $45 per night for an air-conditioned bungalow with a king-sized bed and complimentary breakfast each morning.  It had a pool, a rooftop spa, a yoga pavilion, and a restaurant where I had the best nasi goreng (an Indonesian fried rice dish) of my entire trip. The luxe-feeling hotel, which only has six rooms, was surrounded by rice terraces. It looked immaculately maintained, and I even saw staff walking the grounds multiple times a day to tend to the wide variety of tropical plants. My favorite activity at Cepik Villa Sidemen was a private scooter tour of the area with a staff member at the hotel who was born and raised in Sidemen. Early in the morning, I hopped on the back of his scooter, and we drove about five minutes to the local market, which was already bustling before 8 a.m. I bought and tried things I'd never heard of, like snakeskin fruit, a sweet-and-sour fruit with scaly skin. After exploring the market, we hopped back on the scooter and wove through the beautiful surrounding scenery until we reached Gembleng Waterfall. My guide dropped me at the base of it, where I walked up a steep series of steps to access a few small pools that the waterfall feeds into. I didn't see a single other person hiking up the steps or lounging in the pools during my visit. Looking out over the valley with the sound of the waterfall behind me, I was struck by how beautiful the area was and how lucky I was to have the view all to myself. After that, we stopped to taste locally brewed Arak (a strong Balinese liquor) and visited Pertenunan Pelangi, where I watched crafters go through the complex process of designing, dyeing, and weaving colorful fabrics. As it turns out, I'd underestimated Bali and how much it has to offer.  Much to my delight, Sidemen felt so much different from the crowded, influencer-filled Bali I'd expected \u2014 yet it still felt luxurious and beautiful. Unlike some of the other places I visited in Indonesia, Sidemen offered me a unique opportunity to connect with the landscape and the people. I don't think I could've had the same personalized, private experiences in a more crowded place. Although I don't necessarily dislike \"touristy\" destinations, I think there's something to be said for straying from the most popular recommendations online and seeking out something a little different. I'm sure there are many reasons Bali's trendiest destinations draw so many visitors \u2014 but I feel my choice to spend time in a lesser-known part of the province was a good one.

This development has prompted questions about the company\u2019s long-term requirements for AI computing capacity. Notably, Microsoft recently reiterated its commitment to an $80 billion capital expenditure plan for the current fiscal year, ending in June, with a signficant portion of that investment directed towards the construction of data centers designed to support AI workloads. MSFT stock declined 1% in a week, and at its current levels of around $400, it looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MSFT stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high.   We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MSFT stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Microsoft along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"NVIDIA's RTX 50 Series launch has been plagued with issues, and spending so much on one piece of hardware might be a risk.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The first of NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPUs launched on January 30, with the RTX 5070 Ti following up on February 20. As I await the delayed launch of the RTX 5070, I sat back to take a look at all of the issues plaguing NVIDIA's launch. I'm not here to convince you not to buy an RTX 5000 GPU. You can spend your money any way you want. I am, however, attempting to quell some of the demand by laying out some very good reasons why you shouldn't invest in NVIDIA's latest hardware, at least right now. For those who have their money ready and can't wait to land the latest RTX 5000 hardware, I've also included some positive points to help you convince yourself that your $1,000+ is better off going towards a new leather jacket for NVIDIA's CEO. Trying to convince yourself that you don't need one of NVIDIA's latest RTX 5000 GPUs? The reasons are, frankly, low-hanging fruit. NVIDIA hasn't done itself any favors with its early 2025 launch, and there are some big considerations to make before buying.  NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPUs \u2014 or at least everything except the RTX 5090 \u2014 were introduced with tempting MSRPs. Unfortunately, it has quickly become apparent that buying an RTX 5000 GPU at MSRP is but a dream achieved by a lucky few people. Poor stock availability \u2014 I've seen it blamed on a lack of notice from NVIDIA to its manufacturers, as well as poor timing due to the Chinese New Year\/Spring Festival \u2014 is the main culprit. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. While NVIDIA's Founders Edition cards stick to the company's suggested pricing, many third-party cards launched with a higher price. That in itself is not out of the ordinary; traditionally, third-party cards from NVIDIA's partners have offered a range of features and pricing. However, the effect seems to be a lot more pronounced this time around. If you do happen to find an RTX 5000 GPU in stock at a trusted retailer, chances are it's not going to sell for the MSRP. A quick look at Newegg's selection of RTX 5080 GPUs \u2014 with that $999 MSRP \u2014 has prices beyond $1,600. Looking at Best Buy for the $749 RTX 5070 Ti (which has no Founders Edition) shows prices at up to $980. Scalpers aren't making the situation any better, and you can be sure to overpay the most by finding a private sale. It didn't take long after the RTX 5090's launch for early adopters to report melted 12VHPWR cables. It's an issue NVIDIA has had in the past with its RTX 4090, so it's not like the company was taken off guard. Not only does the problem pose a risk to your PC hardware \u2014 cables, GPUs, and PSUs have all been spotted with melted plastic and worse \u2014 it's also a major fire risk and a threat to your well-being. Youtuber der8auer made a great analysis video that highlights the issue. In the video, he comes to the conclusion that only NVIDIA is to blame, stating, \"RTX 40 and RTX 50 cards have no way to tell how much current is flowing across which of the pins.\" This leads to too much power being sent across certain pins, which aren't rated high enough to handle the load. Things start to melt down. So far there's not really an answer as to what can be done to safeguard against melted hardware and a major fire risk. Even high-quality power cables have been spotted melting. If you want to avoid the problem entirely, skip the RTX 5090 until NVIDIA figures out a solution. NVIDIA dropping 32-bit PhysX support in its RTX 50-series GPUs isn't a big deal for most people. That doesn't mean it isn't a big deal for some people. The lack of anything by way of a PhysX translation layer (if that's possible at all) for the reworked Blackwell CUDA cores means you won't be able to properly enjoy all that certain well-aged games have to offer. Without a compatible GPU, the PhysX workload is shuttled to the CPU, which is unequipped to properly deal with the task. Performance suffers significantly, to the point where it's better to disable the effects. Yes, you can continue to play the games, albeit without the added PhysX features. Standout titles with PhysX effects include Borderlands 2, Batman: Arkham games, the original Metro games, and Mirror's Edge. This won't be a dealbreaker for everyone, but if your favorite game is impaired when using an RTX 5000 card, it only makes sense to go for an older NVIDIA GPU (40-series and back still handles 32-bit PhysX).  NVIDIA was quick to address reports of missing ROPs in a small number of its RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 Ti models \u2014 all Blackwell GPUs so far released \u2014 and it has stated that affected buyers must contact board manufacturers for a replacement. However, it remains to be seen how smooth the process will be as seemingly every board manufacturer is already struggling to put any GPUs at all on shelves. ROPs \u2014 aka Render Output Units or Raster Operations Pipeline \u2014 are a crucial part of the GPU, and it's a number that should not fluctuate at all between cards. I wonder how many people will never spot the defect. NVIDIA claims it has solved the chip manufacturing issue that led to the missing ROPs, but there are bound to still be some cards en route with a similar issue. What happened to quality control? NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPUs are more powerful than their direct predecessors. If that's all you need to know, go forth and attempt to buy. However, the new GPUs aren't suited for everyone. Windows Central Senior Editor Ben Wilson reviewed the RTX 5090, in which he notes: Still, I maintain that nobody needs it for gaming \u2014 again, that's where the RTX 5080 acts as the high-end pick. Nevertheless, it's a gorgeous redesign that slims down a previously gigantic monster into something much more sleek and convenient but comes at the cost of increased temperatures and a significantly higher power draw. DLSS 4 is great tech, but it's not enough to tempt away from an RTX 4090, especially if NVIDIA ports it back to the 40 Series. Wilson also reviewed the RTX 5080, stating: The RTX 5080 Founders Edition should be 60% cheaper than a previous-gen flagship MSRP, the RTX 4090 FE. However, the reality of finding the latter at anything under $2,500 would be considered extremely lucky, so it's more like a saving of around 150%. So, while it runs at a 14% deficit in gaming, you're saving around $1,500 for the trade-off to access DLSS 4 upscaling and frame generation benefits that combine with NVIDIA Reflex to eliminate noticeable input latency. The RTX 5080 ultimately performs at about the same rate as the RTX 4080 Super, which has the same $999 MSRP (if you can find it). The RTX 5070 Ti, which we didn't receive for review, performs at about the same rate as an RTX 4080. What I'm hinting at is that you don't necessarily need to buy an RTX 5000 GPU to get the same level of performance. RTX 4000 GPUs are getting hard to find, especially at a reasonable price, but you might get lucky with some savvy shopping. NVIDIA is hoping to draw enthusiasts in with DLSS 4's Multi Frame Generation (MFG), a feature (so far) exclusive to RTX 5000 GPUs. It's rumored that MFG will arrive on older cards at some point, further reducing the appeal of the newer hardware. Keep in mind that AMD is expected to reveal its Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs on February 28, 2025, with an \"early March\" launch in the works. If the cards can compete with NVIDIA's mid-range offerings, the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 won't look nearly as appealing as they do right now. My goal here isn't to convince you not to buy an RTX 5000 GPU. I'm simply pointing out reasons why you should save your hard-earned money until the market settles down and NVIDIA irons out some of the issues seen at launch. \ud83d\udc49 Where to buy NVIDIA's RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 \ud83d\udc49 Where to buy NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti I know some enthusiasts don't want to wait any longer, no matter the price or the struggle to find availability. If that sounds like you, I have three reasons why it makes sense to buy an RTX 5000 GPU to help convince you that you're making the right decision.  No matter how close RTX 5000 performance comes to older RTX 4000 GPUs, the reality is that the newest hardware is the most powerful stuff on the market right now. I'm currently working with an AMD Radeon RX 6800, and the gains from an RTX 5000 GPU are very tempting. The same goes, I'm sure, for anyone who has an RTX 30-series or older NVIDIA card in their gaming PC. Considering RTX 4000 prices don't seem to be getting any lower, especially as stock thins out, the RTX 5000 lineup no doubt makes sense for a lot of people. You'll have to come to terms with the high costs, but if you have the dough you should be setting yourself up nicely for years to come. NVIDIA's DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation (MFG) is kind of a big deal in the gaming world. It's a major breakthrough that allows the updated \"Blackwell\" CUDA cores to rely more heavily on AI-created frames than ever before. Where your GPU has to work to create one frame, MFG can then create multiple extra frames. This can significantly improve frame rates in games that support the feature. MFG is the main reason why NVIDIA was allowed to claim the RTX 5070 performs as well as the RTX 4090 at its CES 2025 presentation. It wasn't lying, either. It just wasn't upfront with what was going on behind the claim. As tested in our RTX 5080 review, the average FPS in Cyberpunk 2077 \u2014 without MFG enabled \u2014 hit about 64 FPS. With MFG enabled, performance climbed to 228 FPS. That's frankly incredible, and I applaud the NVIDIA engineers who cooked it up. There's been plenty of pushback on the subject, with lots of people calling these \"fake frames.\" But, as Ben Wilson discovered, \"Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't exhibit any noticeable input delay with NVIDIA Reflex enabled.\" If there's no major drawback, does it matter how the frames are created? DLSS 4's MFG feature is, so far, only available on RTX 5000 GPUs, but that could change in the future. For now, you'll need the latest hardware to see those triple-digit frame rates.  I'm eagerly awaiting the official announcement of AMD's Radeon RX 9000 GPUs. The RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 could come out of the gates matching (or outperforming) the mid-range NVIDIA cards, which would only benefit the GPU market as a whole. However, AMD's new Radeon RDNA 4 hardware isn't expected to compete with the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090. In the same vein, Intel is focused on the low end of the market with its impressive \"Battlemage\" cards designed for 1440p gaming. If you want to have the most powerful GPU on the market, you'll have to stick with NVIDIA's RTX 5090.

Big picture, it is fascinating that Trip.com had revenue of RMB 35.6 billion in 2019, revenue then fell to RMB 18.3 billion in 2020 but subsequently rebounded in 2024 to RMB 53.3 billion ($7.3 billion). So, the company is making more revenue today than before Covid. Impressive, in my opinion, though clearly, my views are not universally held. Asian equities were a sea of red as President Donald Trump \u201cappears\u201d to be pushing forward with tariffs on Canada and Mexico, while the Philippines was closed for Revolution Day. U.S. stocks\u2019 indifference to tariff talk is fascinating to me. U.S.-listed China stocks dramatically fell yesterday after Trump suggested replicating and\/or strengthening Biden\u2019s technology export controls. We do not yet know whether this is simply the \u201cArt of The Deal,\u201d which would allow the Hawks to establish the worst-case scenario or actual policy that will be implemented. I believe the former, as, despite all the headlines, the Hong Kong growth and technology stock rally was overdue for a correction and pullback. However, the question remains as to whether investors stay on the sidelines or step in. It is easier to say buy low than to actually do it, though I suspect professional investors, who, based on the below analysis, have no choice but to get involved due to their significant underweight to the space. One sign that this is simply a negotiation tactic is that Tesla has been allowed to push out its autonomous driving function in China today. Considering Trump\u2019s relationship with Tesla, harming and not helping Tesla would seem logical if we are headed to replicating \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d i.e. the economic policies that prolonged the Great Depression in the United States. After the close, Chinese media noted that DeepSeek was launching its R2 AI model, which only highlights the prior administration\u2019s effort to hobble Chinese technology growth, which failed. Hong Kong stocks were not off remotely as much, as Hong Kong\u2019s most heavily traded stocks by value included Alibaba, down -3.76% versus the U.S. ADR Monday down -10.23%, Tencent, down -2.49% versus its unsponsored ADR down -7.6%, Xiaomi, up +3.1% as electric vehicle (EV) stocks rallied, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), down -1.45%, Meituan, down -4.74%, and Li Auto, up +12.52% versus its ADR down -4.01%. Another example would be JD.com, which was down -3.79% in Hong Kong versus its ADR yesterday, which fell -7.33%. Large-cap stocks were off, with insurance, banks, software, telecommunication, and oil all lower on high volumes and poor breath. Hong Kong volumes have increased significantly since September One factor has been an increase in trading through Southbound Stock Connect, which allows Mainland investors to buy stocks in Hong Kong. Today, 49% of Hong Kong's volume was from Southbound Connect. Mainland investors bought a healthy $2.8 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks via Southbound Stock Connect, and Alibaba saw another major inflow. The only bigger macroeconomic news was the release of the \u201cLaw on the Promotion of the Private Economy\u201d in advance of the Dual Sessions. Mainland China was off as mega-capitalization stocks in banking, energy, beverage, and insurance weighed down on indices. Breadth was off, while volumes were very high at RMB 1.88 trillion. Several banks announced cutting their deposit rates. The Mainland market is clearly indicating more policy support is needed. We\u2019ve previously hosted Copley Fund Research\u2019s Steven Holden. He tracks the holdings of actively managed funds. He recently posted on LinkedIn a look at 334 actively managed global equity funds\u2019 China allocation. These funds are benchmarked to the MSCI All Country World Index, which had a 66.41% U.S. weight versus 2.68% weight to China as of January 31, 2025. Shockingly, 25% of the funds had ZERO exposure to China, while 89% had less than a 5% exposure. Since bottoming in January 2024, Chinese growth & technology stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 by 2X. The 4th largest country in ACWI starts with a C and ends in A but isn\u2019t the 2nd largest economy in the world but 10th largest: Canada. Meanwhile, China is only the 5th largest country by weight. It appears that approximately 77% of 344 funds have a weight of less than 3% to China. In my opinion, this means a great deal of dry powder to use to increase an allocation. Check out Steven\u2019s work on LinkedIn and his website, copleyfundresearch.com. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -1.32% and -1.57%, respectively, on volume that decreased -7.44% from yesterday, which is 221% of the 1-year average. 101 stocks advanced, while 393 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by 2.59% from yesterday, which is 222% of the 1-year average, as 15% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). Value and large capitalization stocks fell less than growth and small capitalization stocks. Technology gained +1.68% while consumer discretionary fell -3.28%, communication services fell -2.63%, and consumer staples fell -2.25%. The top sub-sectors were national defense, consumer services, and technology hardware, while consumer discretionary distribution, media, and consumer staples distribution were the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were very high\/well above the average as Mainland investors bought a healthy $2,833 million of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs, with Alibaba a large net sell, Tencent and Li Auto a large\/moderate net buy, SMIC a moderate net buy, Xiaomi small net buy, China Mobile a small net sell, Meituan and Hua Hong Semi moderate net sells. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board diverged to close -0.80%, -0.82%, and +0.26%, respectively, on volume down -8.9% from yesterday, which is 166% of the 1-year average. 1,464 stocks advanced, while 3,549 declined. Growth and small capitalization stocks fell less than value and large capitalization stocks. All sectors were negative, led lower by consumer staples down -1.89%, communication services down -1.81%, and materials down -1.37%. Top sub-sectors were led higher by construction machinery, power generation equipment, and industrial machinery, while agricultural, cultural media, and office supplies were worst.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"The Xiaomi 15 Ultra could snag the title of this year\u2019s hottest phone, and the company just gave us a sneak peek at its design.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Excitement is building as Xiaomi gears up to launch the 15 Ultra in its home market, following the footsteps of the 14 Ultra. Ahead of the big reveal, the company has dropped some teasers that give us a clear look at the phone\u2019s design. Xiaomi has officially shared 15 Ultra design images on Weibo, and they\u2019re pretty much in line with earlier leaks (via GSMArena). The design is a clear shoutout to Leica\u2019s camera style, with a back panel sporting a two-part design that rocks a pleather-like texture and a glossy finish. Topping it off is a huge circular camera module. The dual-tone look is a clear nod to classic camera aesthetics. This version rocks a black-and-white combo, blending a faux leather finish with a sleek glass back. The Leica-inspired design makes perfect sense, given that the 15 Ultra\u2019s powerful camera system comes straight from Xiaomi\u2019s partnership with the camera brand. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun also shared a set of photos on X, backing up the camera-inspired look we\u2019ve seen in earlier leaks. Love the classic camera-inspired design, hope you do too! #Xiaomi15Ultra pic.twitter.com\/gLTfeYK8n1February 24, 2025 Even though Xiaomi and Leica have been teaming up for years to fine-tune camera tech, the 15 Ultra is the first time Xiaomi has really leaned into Leica\u2019s design style. The phone's bottom two-thirds are wrapped in a textured black finish, while the top third shines like polished metal or silvered glass. Xiaomi also revealed the camera specs for the 15 Ultra on its website and Weibo. The flagship packs a quad-camera setup, including a 50MP one-inch main sensor, a 200MP periscope lens with 100mm focal length, a 50MP telephoto lens with 70mm focal length, and a 14mm ultrawide lens. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is expected to pack a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, a 6.73-inch QHD+ OLED display, and a 5,410mAh battery with 90W wired and 80W wireless charging speeds. It\u2019s set to launch in China on February 27, with a global release following on March 2.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Legendary investor Warren Buffett's magic helped a group of Japanese stocks weather a broad market decline on Tuesday. Shares of five Japanese trading houses were on a tear after Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it would increase its investment in the companies. Berkshire first started buying shares in five Japanese trading house giants \u2014 Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo \u2014 in July 2019. On Tuesday, the shares in the trading houses closed up 6.7%, 7.5%, 8.8%, 4.7%, and 6.6% respectively. They are all lower over the past year. The five Japanese trading houses \"very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself,\" Buffett wrote in the shareholder letter. \"As the years have passed, our admiration for these companies has consistently grown,\" wrote Buffett, praising the firms' use of capital, management, and attitude toward investors. He wrote that Berkshire is likely to increase its ownership of all five firms. \"Each of the five companies increase dividends when appropriate, they repurchase their shares when it is sensible to do so, and their top managers are far less aggressive in their compensation programs than their US counterparts,\" Buffett wrote, affirming Berkshire's \"very long term\" commitment for the trading houses that he expects to span decades. Despite the pop in Japanese trading houses' stock on Berkshire's optimism, the Japanese yen and other concerns could weigh on the stocks. Macroeconomic risks also stem from Trump's tariff threats and federal job cuts, wrote Travis Lundy, a Japan markets analyst. \"This does not bode particularly well for trading houses which make their money off increases in global consumption and investment demand, and higher not lower international trade,\" wrote analyst Travis Lundy of Quiddity Advisors, who publishes on Smartkarma, on Monday. In contrast to the stock rally in Japanese trading houses, China's tech stock investors were pulled back to earth on Tuesday by US President Donald Trump's comments reaffirming his commitment to tariffs on trading partners. Trump said on Monday that tariffs against Canada and Mexico next month were \"on time\" and \"moving along very rapidly.\" He said \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other trading partners were on schedule to kick off in April. Over the weekend, the American president also ordered new restrictions on Chinese inbound investment to the US. In Hong Kong, recent star tech stock Alibaba closed 3.8% lower after bumper gains recently. The stock is still about 60% higher this year. Most major Chinese tech stocks similarly posted losses: Tencent closed 2.5% down, Meituan ended 4.8% lower, and Baidu lost nearly 4%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index closed 1.6% lower. The losses in Chinese tech contrasted with the upbeat recent sentiment for their shares following the rise of\u00a0DeepSeek, which ignited enthusiasm about the potential of AI technology from the likes of Alibaba and Tencent. Beyond profit-taking, Tuesday's tech stock declines also highlighted how Chinese shares are still trading under the broad shadow of geopolitical risks. Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares, or H shares, are more vulnerable to market sensitivities than their mainland-listed counterparts, wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a Sunday note. \"Potential risks around US tariff policies and US-China relations could put more pressure on H shares due to their higher US ownership,\" the analysts wrote. Trump's comments pulled the market broadly lower in Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 1.4% lower, South Korea's Kospi ended down 0.6%, and Australia's ASX 200 lost 0.7%. China's CSI300 index closed 1.1% lower while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 1.3% lower. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks","label":1}

In contrast, its peer Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) is up 30% during the same period. Read What\u2019s Driving The Stock Rally For Expedia? to learn more. So, what is happening here? See more on Trefis.com Booking Holdings delivered better-than-expected results across every operational metric in Q4, including revenues and profitability. An extended booking window and growth in all geographic regions fueled the company\u2019s performance. The firm is leveraging AI and technology to improve efficiency and enhance customer experience. It is incorporating generative AI into its services\u2014such as AI-powered trip planning and Priceline\u2019s AI-powered travel assistant, Penny\u2014while also upgrading its mobile applications and payment systems to streamline operations and boost engagement. Additionally, if you prefer a less volatile investment than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered over 91% returns since inception. In Q4 2024, the online travel agency\u2019s revenues increased by 14% year-over-year to $5.5 billion, fueled by a 17% year-over-year rise in gross bookings to $37.2 billion. Room nights booked grew by 13% compared to the previous year\u2019s quarter, rental car days increased by 12% year-over-year, and airline tickets booked surged by 52% year-over-year in Q4. Moreover, BKNG\u2019s adjusted EBITDA rose by 26% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, driven by stronger revenue performance and lower-than-expected adjusted fixed operating expenses. Its earnings per share were $41.55, up 30% year-over-year. It is noteworthy that the Q4 increase in Booking\u2019s per-share earnings was supported by stock buybacks, which reduced the share count by about 5%. Additionally, Booking Holdings\u2019 alternative accommodations segment exhibited steady growth in Q4, with listings reaching 7.9 million\u2014marking an 8% year-over-year increase. We forecast Booking Holdings\u2019 revenues to reach $26.2 billion for fiscal year 2025, representing a 10% year-over-year increase. On the bottom line, our EPS forecast is now $209.17. In light of the revised revenue and earnings estimates, we have adjusted our Booking Holdings\u2019 Valuation to approximately $5227 per share, based on an expected EPS of $209.17 and a 25.0x P\/E multiple for fiscal year 2025\u2014which is nearly aligned with the current market price. Last month, Booking\u2019s board approved a new $20 billion stock buyback program, supplementing the remaining $7.7 billion from a $24 billion program authorized in Q1 2023. Moreover, a 10% quarterly dividend increase to $9.60 per share has been scheduled for March 31. The increase in BKNG stock over the past four years has been quite inconsistent, with annual returns being significantly more volatile than those of the S&P 500. The stock returned 8% in 2021, -16% in 2022, 76% in 2023, and 41% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent ride\u2014as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Booking has provided its growth outlook, forecasting a 2-4% year-over-year revenue increase for the first quarter of 2025, along with a 5-7% rise in gross bookings. For the full year, the company expects to maintain this momentum\u2014with both revenue and gross bookings projected to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Additionally, adjusted EPS is expected to increase in the low double-digit percentage range. It is also useful to compare how its peers perform.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Gino Marconi is struggling to secure full-time work, and it's messing with his retirement plans. Marconi, who's 64 and lives in Plantation, Florida, earned $60,000 annually as a sales representative for an outdoor supply company until two years ago, when he resigned due to the stress of working long days on the road. Marconi previously held engineering jobs that paid more. Since then, he said he's applied to over 600 remote and in-person roles across various industries and skill levels. He suspects many positions have rejected him because he's overqualified, and he's removed the years he's completed some degrees and certifications from some applications. Marconi said he hopes to retire in a few years and rely on Social Security income, but his plans could change if he's unable to find higher-paying work. \"My home is paid off, my cars are paid off,\" Marconi said. \"But I need to keep going until I get back to work.\" As many Americans reach retirement age, they don't find themselves coasting into their golden years as easily as they may have hoped. Instead, as hundreds of older Americans told Business Insider in responses to reader surveys about work and retirement, they find themselves once again on the job market. Maybe they got laid off or quit a career due to health issues. Either way, they need just a few more years to reach a comfortable financial position \u2014 and it's tough out there for job seekers. To be sure, the unemployment rate for Americans age 55 and older was just 3% as of January, compared to 4% for all workers. But for people of all ages who don't have jobs, the hiring landscape has become more challenging in recent years. Excluding a two-month pandemic-related dip in 2020, US businesses are hiring at nearly the lowest rate since 2013, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In response to his job search struggles, Marconi is working part-time with a transportation company for a hotel chain and said he's taken steps to become a full-time insurance agent. He said he's grown frustrated with the application process \u2014 he recalled getting stood up at an interview \u2014 but is remaining optimistic while cutting back on unnecessary spending. \"I don't know when I'll retire because Social Security is not going to be enough,\" Marconi said, adding he's pickier about the roles he applies for. \"My wife used to say I should do whatever increases my income, but I'm not going to work as an engineer making no money.\" Some older Americans told BI that even though they could technically retire, they're holding out because they fear their savings and retirement income won't be sufficient if unexpected costs arise. David F., 67, has been looking for work since last October \u2014 when he anticipated he would soon be laid off from his aerospace industry job. The layoff ultimately came in January. Of the nearly 1,700 submitted applications he's tracked since beginning his job search, only 4% have yielded interviews, and none have amounted to a job offer yet. He said he's frequently encountered ghost jobs or positions with similar job descriptions to previous roles but significantly less pay. \"They're either looking for a unicorn and never finding it, or there's not really a position there, but they want to look like they're hiring,\" said David, who lives in Washington and asked to withhold his last name due to ongoing late-stage job interviews. David doesn't have a firm retirement goal, but he hopes to retire within the next 5 to 10 years, assuming he finds a suitable position. After working in project management for nearly three decades, David briefly retired but returned to work to bolster his finances when the pandemic caused economic uncertainty. He said he's looking for work now because earning additional income would help him live more comfortably and stress less about retirement savings. \"My situation is not desperate, and although I've made mistakes in my retirement savings in the past, I'm not making those mistakes,\" David said. David said he also wants to keep working to stay busy. He's among the older Americans who desire to keep working for reasons other than finances. \"There are the people that love their job, working or even volunteering,\" said Deb Whitman, AARP's chief public policy officer, adding, \"There's sort of a social connection, a sense of purpose and meaning that people get.\" Some older Americans' jobs are more crucial. While they hope to retire in the next few years, it's far from guaranteed. In December 2022, David Schanen was laid off from his network engineer job. Over the last three years, he's struggled to find high-paying work in his industry. \"There's a lot of work for things that I'm qualified for, but people are paying like $25 an hour,\" said Schanen, who's 64 and based in Seattle. He said his network engineer job paid about $200,000 annually. Schanen said he hopes to sell the two side businesses he started over the past decade and retire sometime in the next couple of years. However, he said his real estate photography and virtual concert businesses have only generated roughly $100,000 in combined revenues to date \u2014 not nearly enough to make his significant financial investments in them feel worthwhile. Schanen's uncertain retirement outlook is why he's continued exploring other job opportunities. About six months ago, he began driving for Uber about 40 hours a week. He said he's frustrated with the gig's pay, but that it's given him the flexibility to control his own working hours and dedicate time to his businesses. \"Right now what I'm doing is just kind of keep helping me stay afloat,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Login  Vlad  25 February 2025   Samsung Xiaomi Motorola Infinix Tecno Honor Apple Android iOS  The Latin American smartphone market grew 15% in 2024 compared to 2023, according to new data released by Canalys. 2024 shipments were 137 million units, an absolute record in the region. Samsung reigned supreme with 42.9 million shipments for a 31% market share with 12% annual shipment growth. It was followed by Motorola with 22.8 million shipments, 17% market share, and a 4% decline compared to 2023. In third was Xiaomi, incredibly close to Motorola at 22.7 million units shipped and also 17% market share. Xiaomi's sales did grow 20% year-on-year. Transsion was next with 12.8 million shipments, a 9% share of the pie, and 40% growth. But no other brand grew more than fifth-place Honor, which recorded 8 million shipments for a 6% market share in 2024, up 79% compared to 2023. If we look at just the fourth quarter of 2024, the standings are a little bit different. Samsung still leads with 10.2 million shipments, 31% market share, and 17% annual growth, but it's Xiaomi in second place with 5.4 million shipments, 16% market share, and 11% growth. Motorola is in third with 5.2 million shipments, 15% of the pie, and a sales decline of 14% compared to Q4 2023. Transsion is next with 3.1 million units shipped, 9% market share, and 4% year-on-year growth, and Apple is in fifth with 2.8 million shipments, 8% market share, and a 12% year-on-year growth.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Semaglutide (GLP-1) weight-loss drug Wegovy, made by pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, which are ... [+] designed to treat type 2 diabetes, but are widely known for their effect on weight loss. Picture date: Wednesday October 16, 2024. (Photo by James Manning\/PA Images via Getty Images) Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS), a telehealth platform, reported Q4 sales of $481 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.23, surpassing consensus estimates of $470 million and $0.22, respectively. The company's weight-loss offerings continued to be a key driver of growth. Furthermore, the company's forward-looking guidance exceeded market expectations. However, declining profitability overshadowed these positive results, weighing on the stock price post the results announcement. Separately, look at our take on \u2013 Is Microsoft Stock Too Expensive To Buy At $400? See more on Trefis.com HIMS stock has seen remarkable growth since the beginning of 2024, with returns of 477%, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, up 28%. This surge can be attributed to the shortage of GLP-1 drugs used for obesity treatment, which allowed HIMS to capitalize on the demand for compounded versions of these medications. However, as the supply of GLP-1 drugs has now normalized, Hims & Hers is no longer permitted to sell compounded versions. The company can, however, continue to offer personalized weight-loss treatment plans designed to meet individual patient needs. While HIMS stock has had a phenomenal run, if you want an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Hims & Hers revenue of $481 million in Q4 was up a solid 95%, driven by a 45% rise in subscribers to 2.2 million. The monthly online revenue per average subscriber grew 38% y-o-y to $73. Among other key metrics, the net orders grew 22%, while the average order value surged 63% during the quarter. However, the company reported gross margin of 77% in Q4'24, lower than the 83% figure it reported in the prior-year quarter. This figure was also lower than the street estimates of over 78%. Its operating margin expanded from -0.2% to 3.9% over the same period. On a reported basis, the company's bottom line came in at $0.11 versus $0.01 in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, earnings of $0.23 per share compared with $0.08 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, Hims & Hers expects its Q1 sales to be $530 million and adjusted EBITDA of $60 million, at the mid-point of the provided range. For the full year, sales are expected to be $2.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $295 million. The top-line estimates are much better than $495 million for Q1 and $2.09 billion for the full-year, per the consensus estimates. Despite HIMS shares delivering impressive returns over the last year or so, the stock's journey has been marked by significant price swings. Returns for the stock were -55% in 2021, -2% in 2022, 39% in 2023, and 172% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. At levels of around $40 (as indicated in the pre-market), HIMS stock is trading at 6.4x trailing revenues, much higher than the stock\u2019s average P\/S ratio of 2.8x over the last three years. Given the wide disparity between historical and current valuations, we believe the potential upside from strong sales growth and the generic liraglutide launch is already reflected in the stock price. For investors prioritizing robust long-term gains, waiting for a pullback in HIMS stock may be a more prudent strategy, in our view. Wondering how IONQ stock will fare post-earnings?

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned. Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut. It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected. The conflict between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023. The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods. \"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\" The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID. The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice. The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance - on which the communal kitchens depend - will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes. The closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations. The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID. It is a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who has set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms. The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN. Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works. \"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets [humanitarian group] in Syria.\" For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out. There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege. Most of the kitchens had closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\". Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID. \"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was.\" \"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation. They are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\". The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful. \"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances. In 2024 the US was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan. Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries. \"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month. The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further. \"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director. He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It's extremely difficult.\" They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh. Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority. \"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said. Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people. They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing. Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape. Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods. They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight. With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders. Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained.  The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\". It does not help that the agency was already underfunded.  The UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive. The US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo.  \"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC. Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", he says. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Joy has turned to Sadness for Disney and Pixar alike now that \u201cFrozen 2,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d have each been surpassed at the global\u00a0box office, one after the other, by \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d a Chinese sequel that\u2019s just become the highest-grossing\u00a0animated\u00a0film of all time.\u00a0 The 2019 original grossed a respectable $726 million worldwide, making it the 31st most successful animation ever made. However, director Yang Yu (also known as Jiaozi) has easily doubled that with his follow-up, released in China over the Lunar New Year. That\u2019s not all though. After crossing the record-breaking $1 billion milestone in less than two weeks, \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d is already approaching $1.9 billion in China alone. With no sign of slowing down, that means \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d is on track to gross $2 billion in one single market, making it the first film to ever do so in box office history. Not bad for a \u201cdying\u201d industry, right?            Related Stories Anonymous Oscar Ballot 2025: Costume Designer Votes the \u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019 Ticket and Celebrates \u2018A Complete Unknown\u2019 Kim Basinger: \u2018I Don\u2019t See All of This Need\u2019 for Intimacy Coordinators  With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d is now the most successful film ever produced in China, not to mention the country\u2019s highest-grossing IMAX release, too. Beyond its native homeland, \u201cNe Zha 2\u2019s\u201d record-breaking run has now propelled it into the global top 10 films ever as well. As I write this, Jiaozi\u2019s sequel sits in eighth place above \u201cJurassic World,\u201d which means it\u2019s on the verge of swinging past \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d with $1.95 billion and probably \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d too, currently in sixth place with $2.05 billion. Try snapping back from that. Whether you\u2019re dumbfounded by the surprise success of \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d or you\u2019re just confused because you hadn\u2019t even heard of the film until now, there\u2019s no denying how impressive that all is. But who or what is Ne Zha? How did this cheeky demonic child come so close to toppling Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes? And what does the film\u2019s unprecedented success mean for global cinema moving forward? Loosely based on Chinese mythology as well as a 16th-century novel named \u201cThe Investiture of the Gods,\u201d Ne Zha is a not-so-cute hero who uses his magic gifts to defy heavenly authority and forge his own fate. The sequel begins with Ne Zha competing in mystic trials while forced to share his body with a Dragon Prince named Aobing, but that barely scratches the surface if you\u2019re not among the millions who have bought a ticket (or multiple tickets) already. And there\u2019s a strong chance you might not be, as more than 99% of the film\u2019s earnings to date have come from mainland China.\u00a0             The movie itself was made entirely in China over a five-year period by 138 animation companies with more than 4,000 crew members. Compared to the original, the total number of shots used in the sequel increased from 1,800 to 2,400, marking a huge technological leap forward. One battle scene near the end reportedly includes up to 200 million characters at once, yet, as the film\u2019s director told state broadcaster\u00a0CCTV\u00a0(translated via\u00a0CNN), everything was produced within China after international collaborations fell short of initial expectations. \u201cSure, they might be a top-tier studio, but they could be using third-rate staff on our project,\u201d said Jiaozi. \u201cSo, after outsourcing, many of the shots didn\u2019t turn out as we wanted, and we ended up bringing them back.\u201d It\u2019s important to note just what a huge 180-degree turn this is because it wasn\u2019t so long ago that Hollywood movies dominated Chinese multiplexes with franchise fare. But with the success of \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d and other recent hits like \u201cThe Wandering Earth\u201d series, homegrown productions are now rivaling and even surpassing American output at the local box office. As political tensions between the two nations shift and grow, there\u2019s more incentive than ever to produce and consume Chinese productions in China, especially now they\u2019re more sophisticated than ever before. The unprecedented success of \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d especially has been hailed by Chinese state media as a turning point for the country\u2019s growing \u201ccultural confidence,\u201d and even state officials are celebrating the sequel via\u00a0official channels.\u00a0             With the film\u2019s initial success, partly due to the holiday season and love for the original, national pride has continued to propel \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d with a near-divine reach. Fans have been calling on each other across Chinese social media to watch the film multiple times in cinemas via various hashtags. A wall mural painted in Shenzhen that features characters from the sequel quickly\u00a0went viral, as did an\u00a0ice sculpture\u00a0in Changchun. Various companies unrelated to cinema are even in on the act, rallying behind \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d in a participatory form of nationalism.\u00a0 As\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0reported, snacks maker Weilong Food recently paused operations to take 900 of its staff to see the film at a local cinema. Videos posted on the Chinese platform Douyin showed buses leaving the factory with a banner reading \u201cGlobal box office number one; Go go go!\u201d Other domestic brands making a visible effort to support \u201cNe Zha\u201d include Chinese electric vehicle maker Zeekr, who offered cinema vouchers to their employees, while Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi organized a group viewing for theirs. Rising nationalist sentiment is a key factor in the success of \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d just as it was for 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Battle at Lake Changjin,\u201d which previously held the record for China\u2019s highest-grossing movie before this demonic kid took on said battle and won the war. That particular epic was actually commissioned by the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department, focusing on a victory over U.S. forces in the Korean War.\u00a0             \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d isn\u2019t as outwardly nationalist, as it actually breaks from tradition in some respects, reimagining the titular character from Chinese mythology as someone more rebellious and cheeky rather than purely divine. But that\u2019s arguably another reason for the film\u2019s success as Ne Zha\u2019s defiance speaks to younger viewers who yearn more for self-expression. Still, \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d is undoubtedly rooted in Chinese philosophy, drawing ideas from Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Mohism, and more while also utilizing Chinese cultural aesthetics such as ink painting and bronze artifacts that feel uniquely Chinese in a modernized way. Tourists are even flocking to the\u00a0city of Tianjin\u00a0because of how authentic Tianjin dialect, music, and local influences have been woven into the story. Yet that\u2019s not to say the film isn\u2019t nationalist in bolder ways, too. If you know where to look, there are plenty of digs at imperialism, and the United States especially, found in symbols that look like the U.S. dollar sign or green card, for example. Whether that\u2019s true or not, there\u2019s certainly an anti-U.S. streak to the way many Chinese moviegoers have been boycotting \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d to further support \u201cNe Zha 2.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t care if \u2018Ne Zha 2\u2019 can survive overseas, but \u2018Captain America 4\u2019 must die in China,\u201d or words to that effect have been\u00a0all over Chinese social media\u00a0in recent weeks. Theaters are\u00a0reportedly\u00a0reducing China screenings of Marvel\u2019s latest in response, which means Cap\u2019s gonna need a bigger shield to deflect all the gloating, especially after \u201cBrave New World\u201d suffered a not-so-marvelous 86.8% drop in its second three-day weekend there.\u00a0             This resentment fueled by national pride also extends to critics of \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d as reported by the\u00a0BBC. Comments saying \u201cPeople like that are either clout-chasing, or are being paid\u201d aren\u2019t hard to find on Chinese social media, and if you haven\u2019t watched \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d at all, you risk being seen as unpatriotic. That\u2019s how much the film\u2019s success has become interwoven with China as a nation. To criticize one is to criticize the other, which reflects the political significance this cultural phenomenon has rapidly taken on in just a few short weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 Still, this is all good news for China and the Chinese film industry especially. During an event promoting movie-themed tourism at the China National Film Museum in Beijing, Wang Shiyong (founder and CEO of Wuhan-based 2:10 Animation)\u00a0proudly stated, \u201cThe film\u2019s outstanding box office performance will attract more investment and talent to the animation industry, injecting strong vitality into its development.\u201d He\u2019s not wrong, either. This financial and cultural success will embolden Chinese investors and creatives alike to capitalize on the potential unlocked by \u201cNe Zha 2.\u201d\u00a0 This couldn\u2019t have come at a better time after 2024 saw around a 25% drop for the industry compared to the year before, although that, combined with \u201cBrave New World\u2019s\u201d dire takings, doesn\u2019t bode so well for Hollywood\u2019s future in China. \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d has proven there\u2019s more desire than ever for local fare over American imports. At best, the return of bigger audiences to cinemas in China could spill over a bit and help international studio movies in the short term. Still, it\u2019s Hollywood who may have to change now, if anything, as producers will need to consider more collaborations with their Chinese counterparts if they hope for long-term success there in one of the world\u2019s largest, most lucrative markets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0             The success of \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d overseas isn\u2019t comparable to local takings, of course, but upon its U.S. release on February 14, the film earned $7.2 million, setting a record for the highest opening weekend any Chinese-language film has enjoyed in the past 20 years. Further proof that even a film as intrinsically Chinese as this can perform well abroad, further shifting the balance of power between these two filmmaking giants. In years to come, other nations may also look to the example set by \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d and consider investing more in local fare over Hollywood products. But even if this is a fluke, even if other non-English exports fail to match this success in the U.S. any time soon, it\u2019s not like anyone is going to forget \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d \u2014 the first non-Hollywood movie to join the billion-dollar club. Now that its run in China has been extended through March, not to mention the film\u2019s debut in various other territories over the coming weeks, \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d could theoretically go on to join the top five highest-grossing movies in box office history. That\u2019s assuming it eventually pushes its way past \u201cStar Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens\u201d after \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d followed by \u201cAvengers: Infinity War.\u201d And if it doesn\u2019t? Borrowing a trick from these films, \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d ends with a mid-credits scene that sets up a new adventure, one which could even outgross this one and bring more joy to the industry.

The leading cryptocurrency, which had been rallying since Trump\u2019s re-election in November, now appears to be losing momentum\u2014suggesting that the Trump-driven crypto surge may be over. On Tuesday morning, the flagship cryptocurrency was trading at $87,290, reflecting a decline of 8% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies experienced similar downturns: Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell by 10% during the same period. Additionally, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano all dropped by more than 10% in a single day. In recent weeks, Bitcoin has remained either stagnant or in the red, awaiting a catalyst for price movement. However, its latest decline may be linked to a crypto hack targeting a Dubai-based exchange named Bybit. On Feb. 21, 2025, attackers\u2014allegedly the North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group\u2014stole approximately $1.4 billion in crypto assets from the exchange\u2019s wallet. Adding to market jitters, the recent memecoin scandal involving Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei has reignited skepticism and negative sentiment among investors, further weighing on the crypto market. Once hailed as the most successful exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in history, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant withdrawals in recent weeks.

The kind that even might have daunted Han Solo. How could there ever have been another \u201cStar Wars,\u201d following George Lucas\u2019s hate-magnet prequels, that wouldn\u2019t incur insensate fan wrath? Being angry about \u201cStar Wars\u201d had almost become the default emotion for fans of \u201cStar Wars\u201d when Lucas hand-picked Kathleen Kennedy \u2014 now reported by Puck to be retiring at the end of this year, which Lucasfilm denied to Variety \u2014 to run the company upon his own retirement in May 2012. The immediate expectation was that, with her three decades of experience producing some of the most beloved blockbusters of all time (\u201cE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,\u201d Indiana Jones!) as Steven Spielberg\u2019s producing partner, she would develop new theatrical films for the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise.            Related Stories Anonymous Oscar Ballot 2025: Costume Designer Votes the \u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019 Ticket and Celebrates \u2018A Complete Unknown\u2019 Kim Basinger: \u2018I Don\u2019t See All of This Need\u2019 for Intimacy Coordinators  That came to fruition just five months later on October 30, 2012, when an announcement was made that rocked the galaxy: Lucas had negotiated the sale of his company to Disney for $4.3 billion and a sequel to \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d simply titled \u201cStar Wars: Episode VII\u201d at that point, was in the works to kick off a whole new trilogy, with Kennedy at the helm. How promising those days seemed. For this life-long \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan huddling in a New York City apartment that still didn\u2019t have power in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the news about these new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies was nothing but electrifying, a shot in the arm. Kennedy herself was just entering an awards season victory lap with \u201cLincoln\u201d as an eventual Best Picture nominee \u2014\u00a0in her career pre-Lucasfilm, she received eight Best Picture nominations, including for films directed by filmmakers other than Spielberg, such as \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d \u201cSeabiscuit,\u201d and \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button.\u201d She was giving all that up, and the leadership of shingle The Kennedy\/Marshall Company alongside husband Frank Marshall, to steer the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise.  Twelve and a half years later, that promise has all but evaporated. Make no mistake: She has been at the helm as \u201cStar Wars\u201d has given us some all-time highs (\u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d \u201cAndor,\u201d the Season 2 finale of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d), but also far more enervating lows that have left even the most bullish fan wondering where \u201cStar Wars\u201d goes from here.             Since the release of \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d and the mindless backlash it incurred, Kennedy has been almost an effigy to be pilloried by the most unforgiving and hate-filled fans. (It seems odd to even be calling them fans in this context.) She has presided over an era that saw authentic hate for the prequels, unfair as much of that hate might have been, curdle into the monetized hate of an entire YouTube grifter class that makes money off the most views they can incur from their rage-filled takes. Even the one possibly universally adored property created on her watch during her tenure, \u201cAndor,\u201d has resulted in videos titled \u201cHow \u2018Andor\u2019 Ruined \u2018Star Wars'\u201d on YouTube. Is Kennedy actually leaving now? Her Board of Governors Award from the ASC on February 22 sure had a valedictory feel to it. If she\u2019s not leaving, where does \u201cStar Wars\u201d go from here? (IndieWire\u2019s request for comment to Lucasfilm went unanswered as of publication time.) There is simply no pleasing a certain sect of YouTubers and social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d who otherwise would not make money unless they peddled hate. It is their business model. With that in mind, Kennedy\u2019s tenure faced impossible odds. You\u2019d have to invoke the infamous no-win scenario of another space franchise, the Kobayashi Maru of \u201cStar Trek,\u201d to emphasize this point. She deserves hazard pay for jumping into the fray and leading it amidst this.              With hindsight, you can see \u201cStar Wars\u201d and the reactions it incurred over the past decade as the ultimate Hollywood battleground for the culture wars, and an odd avatar for America\u2019s irreconcilable chasm between left and right. Simultaneously, the fraught production history of multiple titles at Lucasfilm on her watch made the studio a kind of stand-in for Hollywood\u2019s ongoing battle between filmmaker freedom and the storytelling by committee that drives much of the industry\u2019s IP franchise adaptations. The bottom line is: The way \u201cStar Wars\u201d has been discussed for almost a decade has not been about art or storytelling, but about these movies and its TV spinoffs as representative of other things. They\u2019re not films or TV shows, they\u2019re symbols. And Kennedy is a film producer. She faced a no-win scenario. Kennedy\u2019s own track record is not blameless. For as much as she tried to position herself as pro-filmmaker, \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d essentially remains the last \u201cStar Wars\u201d film on her watch that was scripted, shot, and edited per its director Rian Johnson\u2019s wishes. Creative sparring with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller on \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d resulted in their departure \u2014\u00a0and they immediately won an Oscar for producing \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d afterward. \u201cRogue One\u201d was all but taken out of its credited director Gareth Edwards\u2019 hands and handed to Tony Gilroy (who ended up showrunning both seasons of tie-in \u201cAndor\u201d). It\u2019s possible Edwards and Lord\/Miller just weren\u2019t ready for such big projects the way Gilroy obviously was, which is a hiring problem that is also on Kennedy.             There have been too many aborted film projects since to round up here. The result of all this was that a very pro-filmmaker producer was no longer seen in the industry as having filmmakers\u2019 backs. The brand was all that mattered. She never said as much, but much like Sam Mendes alleged of Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, it seemed she wanted \u201ccontrollable directors.\u201d But how could it have been otherwise? Even though Lucas hired her to run his company, the first film produced under her remit, \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d was crafted, in part, as a kind of rebuke of Lucas and his prequels: The very first line said in that movie is \u201cThis will begin to make things right.\u201d It was a message to the fans who still hated the prequels. All the messaging around \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was aligned with that: It would be built more around practical effects, unlike the prequels; it would tap into the emotions and family dynamic of the original trilogy (\u201cChewie, we\u2019re home\u201d); it wouldn\u2019t be about the taxation of trade routes. Like or dislike the prequels as you wish, but those were movies made by a filmmaker. The messaging around \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was unambiguously that Lucasfilm was now listening to the fans above all. And fan-influenced art at the studio level is nothing more than crowdsourced art. It\u2019s the same as Jeff Bezos taking to X last week asking who should be the next James Bond after acquiring creative control of that property.             Lucasfilm made a gamble with that messaging that they would never be able to win: You let the fans dictate your creative direction from the start like they did with \u201cForce Awakens,\u201d and you will be held hostage by them ever since. And so it has gone, with a succession of movies and TV shows over the past decade that have largely made no one happy, and have not even lodged in people\u2019s brains on the level that the prequels have. Just compare the number of prequel trilogy memes on social media to sequel trilogy memes. The true \u201cno going back\u201d moment was after a vocal segment of fans \u2014 to the apparent shock of Lucasfilm, which never seemed to expect any backlash \u2014 hated \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d The studio interfered with the next movie, \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker,\u201d to ostensibly undo and retcon much of \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d ending up with a Frankenstein-ed mess that was calculated to try to satisfy everyone (or at least not piss them off) and thrill no one. In the end, no one was satisfied and everyone was pissed off. At least lean into the fans who liked \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d! But those fans were lost too. \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d is one of the great creative surrenders in moviemaking history. Filmmakers should be making films. Not corporate suits or committees trying simply to channel what they think may or may not land with fans.             Was this uniquely Kennedy\u2019s fault? No. Even the beloved Marvel Studios that was riding high at the time of \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d has since withered into creative oblivion. \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d seems to follow a \u201cRise of Skywalker\u201d template, actually. \u201cRise of Skywalker\u201d infamously featured a blink-or-miss-it same-sex kiss at the end that the right hated and the left thought was tokenism and pandering. \u201cBrave New World\u201d still pisses off the right for touching lightly upon issues a Black Captain America might face and pisses off its Black audience by not substantively grappling with Cap being Black at all. These are movies that are ultimately made for no one. Would I or anyone else have made choices different from Kennedy? I can\u2019t say. This was an impossible situation to be in. The culture, and its neverending \u201cdiscourse\u201d that renders a \u201cStar Wars\u201d property as an avatar for something else, seems to have brought us to a point where it\u2019s impossible for any \u201cStar Wars\u201d film to be made at all. There could be nowhere to go other than just doing what \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d achieved and recycling the original trilogy over and over again. Kennedy\u2019s attention to detail is admirable. Full disclosure: This writer wrote several \u201cStar Wars\u201d books in the early days following Disney\u2019s acquisition, including one called \u201cStar Wars Made Easy\u201d that ostensibly was meant to be a primer to bring new fans onboard. Even then there was almost 40 years of lore to catch up on. If somebody wanted to become a fan, where would they even start? My remit was to help with that introduction, and it was my understanding that Kennedy herself kept close tabs on this project, seeing it as a critical tool to expand the fanbase. I joked once to a friend, \u201cIt\u2019s a Saturday night. Frank Marshall wants to go out, but Kathy insists on staying home to review proofs of Blauvelt\u2019s book!\u201d Who knows if that happened. The message imparted to me was that she really cared.              The idea that reputationally she\u2019s now seen as being unsupportive of filmmakers and emblematic of everything far-right culture warriors hate, means she\u2019s alienated from both left and right, filmmakers and fans, in an almost impossible-to-imagine way. How did this happen when she really did care? Maybe she cared too much. Saying that sounds Shakespearean, but it also sounds lot like what happened to Anakin Skywalker.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Hein Schumacher, CEO of Unilever, during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, UK, on November ... [+] 26, 2024. Photographer: Hollie Adams\/Bloomberg Unilever has ousted CEO Hein Schumacher after less than two years at the helm, replacing him with CFO Fernando Fernandez as the consumer goods giant seeks to speed up its turnaround plans. Unilever, owner of brands like Dove soap and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, surprised investors Tuesday when it announced that Schumacher would step down on March 1 and leave the company on May 31. Unilever's stock tumbled by as much as 3.4% on the news. The company\u2019s shares had been up more than 9% since Schumacher took over from Alan Jope in July 2023. Schumacher\u2019s departure comes at a time when Unilever has been undergoing a major restructuring which includes cutting thousands of jobs and spinning off its ice cream business, which includes the Ben & Jerry\u2019s brand. The group is under mounting pressure from investors to address years of underperformance. Unilever\u2019s recent strategy reset had been welcomed by billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz, who sits on its board. Trian Fund, the investment firm founded by Peltz, declined to comment on the change in leadership at Unilever. Peltz has a net worth of $1.6 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 World\u2019s Real-Time Billionaires rankings. Schumacher had been steering the company away from price-led growth to instead focus on selling greater volumes of products. Less than two weeks ago, Unilever had reported underlying sales growth of 4% in the fourth quarter, but also warned that it was anticipating a slower start to 2025 due to subdued market growth in the near term. Unilever\u2019s board reportedly ousted Schumacher just a day earlier after deciding that Fernandez was better suited to execute the company\u2019s turnaround plan, according to a report in the Financial Times that cited an anonymous source. \u201cWhile the board is pleased with Unilever\u2019s performance in 2024, there is much further to go to deliver best-in-class results,\" said Unilever\u2019s Chairman Ian Meakins. Barclays described Fernandez as the \u201cbest candidate\u201d for the next leg of Unilever\u2019s story. \u201cWhilst unexpected, we agree with the board that Fernandez is best placed to accelerate the value unlock,\u201d Barclays analysts said in a note on Tuesday. \u201cWe view it as a hard-nosed decision by the board about who is the best person going forward into the next stage of its evolution,\u201d they added. Fernandez is a longtime company veteran, having joined Unilever in 1988. Before he became the company\u2019s CFO, he ran its beauty and wellbeing unit, one of Unilever\u2019s fastest-growing businesses. He had also overseen several of the company\u2019s best-performing markets, including Brazil and the Philippines. Unilever\u2019s chairman praised Fernandez when announcing the leadership reshuffle, describing how the board had been impressed by his \u201cdecisive and results-oriented approach and his ability to drive change at speed.\u201d Meakins also laid out the board\u2019s expectations of Fernandez, when he said, \u201cThe growth action plan has put Unilever on a path to higher performance and the board is committed to accelerating its execution.\u201d Fernandez will be taking over with Unilever in the midst of spinning off its ice-cream business. The unit generated $8.6 billion in revenue last year. Unilever said earlier this month that it plans to list the unit primarily in Amsterdam, with London and New York getting secondary listings.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Following the debut of its sequel, AAWireless was removed from sale earlier this year, but has now returned amid stock issues for the new model. AAWireless first launched a few years ago as the original adapter for turning a wired Android Auto connection into a wireless one. The affordable dongle opened the door to this functionality for many, but the market has grown considerably in time since with many more options now available for purchase. In October 2024, AAWireless TWO launched as a replacement for this original device, bringing updated physical design with a new multi-function button, as well as new internal hardware. However, for the past several weeks, AAWireless TWO has been unavailable for purchase via Amazon, its normal sales channel, with buyers instead only able to purchase the device via the official AAWireless website. Now, in an unexpected turn of events, the original AAWireless has resurfaced on Amazon. The dongle is once again available for purchase for $59.99 \u2013 $5 less than AAWireless TWO \u2013 and is shipping in early March. While it lacks Prime, this does appear to be an official seller account for AAWireless, as it\u2019s registered to the same business address as the company. The cause for a return of the original AAWireless is unclear especially as it was fully removed from Amazon for a while, but it does come with a noteworthy benefit. AAWireless TWO lacks CarPlay support entirely, as a \u201cPlus\u201d version will be coming with that functionality sometime early this year, but the original adapter does support CarPlay in beta. Meanwhile, if you do want the updated hardware, AAWireless TWO is still available for purchase via the company\u2019s website.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Insights from Chris Dimitriadis, Chief Global Strategy Officer, ISACA.   The skills gap in the cybersecurity profession has long been a fraught challenge. Various estimates show large totals of unfilled cybersecurity positions, yet many aspiring entrants to the field report it can be challenging to break through, particularly for entry-level cybersecurity roles. Companies are often looking for backgrounds and qualifications that are in short supply. In other cases, they are unwilling to invest in their cybersecurity workforces at the level that the modern threat landscape demands. Recently, hiring conditions have become especially challenging. According to ISACA\u2019s State of Cybersecurity 2024 report, hiring across the industry is slowing, which could be especially problematic at a time in which the stressful nature of the industry and the longevity of longtime practitioners mean that many cybersecurity professionals will be exiting the field in the coming years. Here are a few meaningful steps that those looking to find their place in the cybersecurity field can take to stand out when roles are harder to come by: As the job market tightens, it becomes increasingly important for aspiring practitioners to find substantive ways to stand out in the marketplace. A great way to do this is to achieve respected industry certifications that are relevant to the roles being pursued. While many certifications have experience requirements, a positive development in recent years has been the creation of new credentials geared more toward newcomers and those in the early stages of their career journeys. The initial research phase can be even more challenging than the actual exam preparation. Although many practitioners recognize the value of becoming credentialed, one common obstacle is being overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of options that exist. Do your due diligence to understand which certifications best align with the type of roles you would like to pursue and the reputation of the organizations behind those certifications. Many credentials are fully knowledge-based, while others include a performance-based skills element, which can be especially resonant with prospective employers for certain roles. Factor all of this into your research. Cybersecurity professionals and cybercriminals alike are increasingly finding ways in which artificial intelligence can be a powerful ally. AI-powered cyberattacks are upping the degree of difficulty for cyber defenders, who in turn are turning to AI to assist in areas such as threat detection, endpoint security and automating various routine tasks. This reliance on AI projects will only increase in the coming years, meaning it is becoming necessary for cybersecurity professionals to have at least foundational AI knowledge for many roles. Other technologies\u2014such as blockchain, the Internet of Things and various cloud technologies\u2014also are impacting the attack surface, and quantum computing could be the most significant emerging technology of them all in the not-too-distant future. By showing a commitment to continuous learning on the emerging tech front\u2014for example, through taking training courses and attending webinars, workshops and conference sessions\u2014candidates can demonstrate their commitment to keeping up with the dynamic technology landscape while also equipping themselves to be more effective once they are on the job. Even aside from the fact that the cybersecurity job market is tightening, it is a difficult era to be a job candidate. AI technology is often used to scan r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for keywords, swiftly weeding out some potentially solid candidates. Also, attrition in the recruitment profession can leave HR professionals stretched thin, meaning candidates need to be purposeful about how they accentuate their strengths and qualifications. Don\u2019t assume the recruiting\/human resources specialists have the time or even experience to scrutinize your full r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to draw a carefully considered conclusion about whether you have the right background for the job. Be clear, specific and bold\u2014both in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and related application materials, such as a cover letter\u2014about how your skills and background are an ideal springboard to succeeding in the specific role you are pursuing. Candidates should have a strong sense of what is most important to prospective employers and make their case in a way that aligns with those priorities. One of those important skills is understanding the business landscape and having industry insights so you can directly relate with your potential employer. While the job market in cybersecurity\u2014as is the case in most industries\u2014can be cyclical, the underlying fundamentals of cybersecurity being an in-demand field remain intact. Companies need strong cybersecurity teams to be able to securely and sustainably innovate in a perilous digital environment. The current climate calls for interested cybersecurity newcomers to sharpen their approach to job-seeking. By adding a valued industry credential, becoming knowledgeable about the intersection of cybersecurity, the business\/industry and emerging tech and being intentional about how they are presenting themselves to employers, the outlook remains bright to break into this vibrant profession.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Hims & Hers (HIMS+0.19%) stock took a steep dive, dropping more than 27%\u00a0Tuesday morning \u2014 even after the millennial-focused telehealth company reported soaring sales for 2024 just the night before. Hims & Hers reported a striking 69% jump in sales for 2024, reaching $1.5 billion. But despite the strong growth, investors appear rattled by the looming loss of a key sales driver later this year. Last May, Hims & Hers began offering compounded semaglutide \u2014 the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO-0.42%) Ozempic and Wegovy \u2014 for just $199 a month, far cheaper than Ozempic\u2019s $1,000 list price or Wegovy\u2019s $1,349 tag. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. The company was able to sell this type of off-brand version due to shortages of the branded drugs. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. However, drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. But with those shortages now resolved, Hims & Hers will likely have to stop offering it. On Friday, the FDA updated its drug shortage list, marking branded versions of semaglutide as fully available. The FDA said it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that still offer patients \u201cessential copies\u201d of compounded semaglutide in the next 60 to 90 days. For its part, Hims & Hers said it will stop offering its current iteration compounded semaglutide after the first quarter.  \u201cWe will have to start notifying customers in the coming month or two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing,\u201d Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call on Monday evening. Instead, the company will focus on weight-loss pills and a generic version of liraglutide \u2014 an older GLP-1 drug taken daily instead of weekly like newer options. It may also potentially offer customized versions of semaglutide with personalized dosing or alternative administration methods, which would allow it to stay compliant with drug laws. Hims & Hers said that its full-year revenue, excluding its GLP-1 offerings , the class of drug to which semaglutide belongs, rose 43% year-over-year to over $1.2 billion. It also projected that its sales in 2025 will reach  $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion.  Hims & Hers was founded in 2017, known as just \u201cHims\u201d at the time, as a platform for men to get prescriptions online for erectile dysfunction and hair loss medications. Since then, it has expanded to offer treatments for men and women to address skin care, anxiety, and overall sexual health.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang (C) arrives for Nvidia's end of year party in Taipei on ... [+] January 17, 2025. (Photo by CHENG Yu-chen \/ AFP) (Photo by CHENG YU-CHEN\/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia stock has fallen 8.4% so far in 2025. The biggest damage to the AI chip designer\u2019s stock took place Monday, January 27 \u2014 a day after my Forbes post about DeepSeek\u2019s R1, a complex reasoning model built for $5.7 million in three months. (The actual cost was $50 million or more \u2013 way below the $149 million spent to build Google\u2019s Gemini, enterprise AI agent company Vectara\u2019s CEO Amr Awadallah told CNBC). Since DeepSeek said the company used a lower-powered version of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, I wondered whether more large language model developers would follow DeepSeek\u2019s lead and build models faster and more cheaply \u2013 possibly not buying as many of Nvidia\u2019s latest, most expensive chips. The $600 billion drop in Nvidia\u2019s stock market value that day did not deter retail investors. Instead, they have poured more than twice as much money \u2014 $5.7 billion \u2014 into Nvidia stock as of February 21 than last year, according to Vanda Research data featured by the Wall Street Journal. Will Nvidia bulls be rewarded after the company reports fiscal fourth quarter results? The answer depends on whether Nvidia beats and raises. More specifically, if Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue and earnings grow faster than the FactSet consensus of 72% and 59%, respectively, and the company forecasts faster than expected growth and higher margins for the current quarter, Nvidia stock could soar. Wall Street will be focusing on whether Nvidia\u2019s 2024 Blackwell production bottlenecks are loosening, whether cloud services providers will keep spending more on data centers \u2014 in light of DeepSeek\u2019s success with cheaper chips, and the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Nvidia\u2019s outlook. Nvidia remains bullish about its future. The drop in the company\u2019s stock price is an \u201covercorrection,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang said, according to Yahoo! Finance. Demand for the company\u2019s GPUs will remain strong because major processing capability is needed to enable the shift from training AI models to post-training, he added. Here are four things investors will be looking for. Nothing would be better for Nvidia bulls than a higher-than-expected growth forecast. Indeed, Nvidia\u2019s boffo forecast for the second quarter of 2023 spurred me to write my latest book, Brain Rush. Sadly, that growth has been slowing down since the company reported faster than 200% growth every quarter between the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Here are the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rates, according to Macrotrends: As the company\u2019s revenue growth has been declining in recent quarters, I would not be surprised if Nvidia forecasts 50% revenue growth for the current quarter. Last November, one analyst said Trump would be good for Nvidia. That prediction could be a bit off. The analyst expected higher margins and benefit from the Trump presidency. Nvidia \u201cis on track to see Blackwell revenue surge, surpassing Hopper revenue by Apr-Q (gross margins to also recover toward mid-70's by mid-CY [calendar year] 2025),\u201d according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino\u2019s report feature in Barron\u2019s. \u201cGeopolitical uncertainties remain a headwind, but we think Nvidia is better positioned under a Trump administration.\u201d Now reports are emerging of a policy curveball. The Trump administration has started discussions about increasing export chip curbs to China that could weigh on Nvidia\u2019s \u201crevenue by making it tougher to sell its products to tech companies like Alibaba Group,\u201d according to Barron\u2019s. Investors may be listening for what Nvidia has to say about this topic. The last time Nvidia reported quarterly earnings, Blackwell production costs were cutting into the company\u2019s adjusted gross profit margins \u2013 which the company attributed to clearing out production bottlenecks, according to my November 2024 Forbes post. \u201cThe challenge that we have is how fast can we get that supply, getting ready, into the market this quarter,\u201d Nvidia CFO Colette Kress told analysts in the post-earnings conference call last November. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back on track with more suppliers as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We\u2019re just going to be tight for this quarter.\u201d The Blackwell problems were reportedly tied to design flaws. When deployed in server racks, the chips overheated, \u201craising alarms about the ability to integrate them efficiently into existing data center models,\u201d noted Reuters. Now that we are into the new calendar year, investors will be listening for whether the company has realized Kress\u2019 hope for bottleneck relief. If not, Nvidia stock could drop. Huang said he may discuss \u201cthe ramifications of DeepSeek\u2019s advancement for AI investments\u201d during Wednesday\u2019s earnings call. Recent earnings calls from hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms suggested they would spend $320 billion on data centers and related hardware in 2025. Since then, Microsoft \u2014 which had said it intends to spend more than $80 billion \u2014 has reportedly canceled some leases with \u201cat least two private data center operators,\u201d noted CNBC. Microsoft did not confirm this report. \u201cOur plans to spend over $80B on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson emailed CNBC on February 24. Nevertheless, investors will be eager to learn whether Nvidia quantifies how much DeepSeek is likely to affect hyperscaler capital expenditures. Huang is an amazing entrepreneur and CEO and it will take all his ability to exceed investor expectations on Wednesday.","label":1}

The decrease in Tesla\u2019s stock price came after Bloomberg reported the company has been struggling with European sales over the last month as Musk has become more involved in politics both in the U.S. as a key adviser to President Donald Trump and in Europe, where he has been more openly backing far-right political parties.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms. Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day. \"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\" He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence. \"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou. In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024. And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023. The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities. And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it. Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence. But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that. One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told. The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died. Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\" Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\" Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home. Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University. One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps. Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine. \"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\" One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says. In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it. To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\" What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity. At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\" And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16. \"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug. Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson. Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable. Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs. The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\" Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use. In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\". There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue. \"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged. And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\". In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering. Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine. Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"About this rating    In February 2025, claims circulated that U.S. retail chain Target had lost $15.7 billion in market value since dropping its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. (Facebook user EM M Atkism) The claim circulated across (archived) X (archived), Facebook, Threads (archived), Reddit (archived) and Bluesky (archived). However, while it's true Target's stock prices dipped significantly at least twice since 2023, each time resulting in a drop in market value, the reasons for this were not all DEI-related. Boycotts followed when Target announced DEI policy changes in January 2025, but as of this writing it's too early to say if, or how much, stock prices will fall.\u00a0 There was no reported instance of Target's market value dropping specifically $15.7 billion in connection to the company's DEI policies. Jim Joice, Target's director of issues and crisis communications, told Snopes via email that the claim was \"inaccurate.\" For all of the above reasons, we rate this claim false. Elements of the claim appeared to have come from several widely reported stories about Target since 2023. The $15.7 billion figure may have come from a reported dip in stock prices following Target's 2023 Pride Campaign. The loss figure was also reported in November 2024, when Target's stock prices dipped following a poor third quarter financial report.\u00a0 On May 24, 2023, Target announced that it was removing items at the center of \"significant confrontational behavior\" in stores after public backlash against the company's Pride collection. The recall, spurred on by backlash against products including \"tuck-friendly\" women's swimsuits, was criticized by leading groups in the LGBTQ+ community. In the weeks following the announcement, outlets including the New York Post, Bloomberg and Fox Business reported on increased market value losses for Target, totaling up to $15.7 billion \u2014 the same figure touted in the February 2025 claim. The figure also featured in reporting about Target's earnings report for the third quarter (Q3) of the financial year 2024-2025 and the resulting dip in market value. Target shares dipped 21% in a single day following the Q3 earnings report on Nov. 20, 2024. Outlets including Reuters reported the lost market value to be $15.7 billion. However, this stock price dip did not appear to be connected to either Pride or DEI measures. According to Reuters, Target CEO Brian Cornell told a post-earnings call that the reasons for the weak Q3 results included low sales of high-margin items like technology, shipping issues and customers preferring to shop promotions (sales) rather than full-price items. CNBC also cited a call with reporters where Target executives pointed to the costs of rushing shipments in preparation for the U.S. port strike in October 2024 as part of the reason for the Q3 results. Unrelated to the two incidents above, Target did change its DEI policies in early 2025, though the financial effect of this is yet to be seen at the time of publication. On Jan. 24, 2025, the company issued a press release titled \"Target's Belonging at the Bullseye Strategy.\" The release said, among other points, that Target was \"concluding\" its diversity, equity and inclusion goals and its Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) program, both of which were due to expire in 2025.\u00a0 The changes raised questions for LBGTQ+ advocacy groups about Target's support and led to calls from Black community leaders and civil rights activists to boycott the company. According to the stock exchange Nasdaq, Target's stocks reached a 2025 high of $142.51 on Jan. 27, three days after the DEI announcement. Stock prices then fell into February.\u00a0 While there is no proof that Target lost $15.7 billion in market value after changing its DEI measures in January 2025, DEI-related events from recent years have caused both financial and now legal problems for the company. As of this writing, plaintiffs in Florida have filed two lawsuits against the company, both claiming they were defrauded by Target because the company failed to disclose the financial risks of its 2023 Pride campaign that sent stocks tumbling.\u00a0 The most recent of these suits, filed on Feb. 20, was brought as a class-action lawsuit by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. Both lawsuits are ongoing as of this writing. \"After Target Backs Away from Diversity Programs, Civil Rights Activists Call for a Boycott.\" PBS News, 31 Jan. 2025, https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/nation\/after-target-backs-away-from-diversity-programs-civil-rights-activists-call-for-a-boycott.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"The push by companies to get their employees to return to the office hasn't been enough to revive America's ailing office sector, with prices for office buildings ending lower in 2024 and expected to drop further throughout 2025.  Office prices continued to slide in 2024, with the average price dropping 11% to $174 per foot last year, according to a report from Yardi Matrix, a commercial real estate intelligence firm. Since 2019, the average sale price of an office building has plunged 37%, the report said, attesting to the lasting impact of the pandemic and work-from-home trends on the office sector. Office buildings will likely continue to be the worst-performing sector of the commercial real estate market for at least the next five years, Capital Economics said in a note at the end of 2024.  Researchers at the firm said they anticipated office values dropping another 10% from the third quarter of 2024 through 2029. \"Though we think the market has bottomed, we expect a very weak recovery this year, unlike in other cycles,\" the research firm said in a report at the start of 2025. \"In fact, we think valuation falls still have further to go, leaving our forecasts generally below consensus.\" Darrell Wheeler, the head of commercial mortgage-backed securities research at Moody's, also anticipates the US office market will continue to struggle, and will hit a bottom sometime in 2025.  Not all parts of the US office market are doing poorly, he said, but areas that have seen significant price drops include those where office vacancy rates have remained elevated, which has weighed on values.  And while return-to-office mandates have pressured some workers to get back to commuting to work, it'll take a while for companies to implement concrete policies regarding in-person attendance, Wheeler said. He expects debates over the return-to-office to stretch out until at least 2027 as companies decide the best policy for their employees. \"While it's sounding pretty clear \u2014 financial institutions are supposed to be into the office five days a week \u2014 that's certainly not the case for all the industries and different work models,\" Wheeler said. CommercialEdge data shows that the national office vacancy rate was nearly 20% in January, up 180 basis points from the same month last year. Meanwhile, more office buildings were also sold at a discount in 2024, according to Yardi Matrix. Over 600 office properties were sold for lower than what they were valued in the building's most recent transaction, the firm said, compared to 2023, when just 386 office buildings were discounted.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Red Lobster is charting a course for recovery under the leadership of its new millennial CEO. Damola Adamolekun, 36, was appointed CEO of Red Lobster in August, becoming the company's sixth and youngest chief executive after he was brought on to help revitalize the brand following years of declining sales and a bankruptcy filing. Before joining Red Lobster, Adamolekun served as CEO of P.F. Chang's and was a partner at Paulson & Co., where he played a key role in acquiring the Asian American restaurant chain in 2019. Under Adamolekun's leadership, Red Lobster emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy four months after filing in May. When the chain exited bankruptcy, Red Lobster was acquired by RL Investor Holdings, which included a plan to invest $60 million into the chain, the Associated Press reported at the time. \"Red Lobster is now a stronger, more resilient company, and today is the start of a new chapter in our history,\" Adamolekun said in a statement after the chain exited bankruptcy. Adamolekun discussed his goals for Red Lobster on a recent appearance on \"The Breakfast Club\" and shared the three main areas he was focusing on after exiting bankruptcy. After becoming CEO, Adamolekun revamped the menu, brought back popular items such as the chain's hush puppies, and introduced happy-hour specials at many restaurants nationwide. He told \"The Breakfast Club\" that part of his mission as CEO had been to offer new menu items at a more affordable price point as people tighten their spending. \"Value is an equation. Part of it is price. And you can get some things on the menu that are lower price,\" he said, mentioning the chain's new lobster rolls which cost about $20 at some locations. \"At the same time, value is what you get for the price,\" he said. \"So if you improve what you get, then you improve value.\" \"We have Shrimp Your Way for $16.99 for two types of shrimp,\" he added. \"There are things you can do that are approachable if you don't want to do the full lobster for a higher price.\" Adamolekun explained the chain's new \"RED Carpet Hospitality\" service model, which stands for recognize, engage, and delight. \"When people walk in, you need to recognize them as soon as they walk in. There should be somebody smiling at the post stand to greet them,\" he said. \"You see somebody \u2014 within 10 feet of them, you recognize them. Within 4 feet, you speak to them. We call it the 10-to-4 rule.\" \"If we're not going to be priced as Chipotle, then we need to offer something that Chipotle doesn't offer,\" he said. \"And what that is is called service and hospitality.\" In bankruptcy filings, Red Lobster said it operated about 570 restaurants, though it had plans to close about 120 underperforming locations. Many restaurants are locked in by long leases, and Adamolekun said that while a nationwide remodel of Red Lobster restaurants would be expensive and take a long time, the chain was considering it in the future. He also noted that there are smaller ways of improving the dining-in experience that don't require as much funding, such as making the restaurant's music better. \"We fix the things we can fix quickly,\" he said. \"If you go to a Red Lobster now, you'll notice the music is better. And you'll notice there are small things like we put the market prices on the lobster, we put the liners on the tables.\" \"There are small things you can do now,\" he said, \"but comprehensively, there needs to be a remodel. And that's something that we'll do in the future.\" Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Plenty of entry-level jobs are no longer entry-level. Mona Mourshed, the CEO of the employment nonprofit Generation, said many employers are now looking for two to three years of work experience for such roles. \"Job vacancies are down for entry-level roles, and that's true across the world,\" she told Business Insider. \"Then, on top of it, to get those job vacancies, hiring requirements have gone up.\" Labor market commentators previously told BI there's a surplus of available workers, and this is only getting more true as\u00a0highly skilled employees are being laid off\u00a0from the likes of Meta, Google\u00a0\u2014 and the federal government. The \"unbossing\" of the workplace\u00a0is also likely a factor, with millennial middle managers being squeezed out in the \"Great Flattening\" and wading into the hiring pool. Without these people in companies and mentoring junior employees, more experience is necessary for new hires to thrive. The group most likely to be affected is Gen Z \u2014 the youngest cohort of workers, which is also set to make up 30% of the workforce by 2030. Making it harder for young workers to find jobs could be short-sighted. \"They tend to be entrepreneurial in spirit, they collaborate with their peers, and they embrace diversity,\" said Stephanie Chung, JetSuit's former president and the author of \"Ally Leadership: How to Lead People Who Are Not Like You.\" \"The older generations need to come to grips that there are many ways to achieve the goal and that their way of working is one way,\" she told BI. \"It's not the only way. \" Mourshed said most entry-level roles are not what they used to be: \"When you went through a training, or you have a degree or a certificate, and you're seeking to get your first work experience \u2014 that's gone.\" There are many influences at play, including negative stereotypes about Gen Z's work ethic and the balance tipping in favor of employers, making room for experienced talent over \"underperformers.\" Jennifer Moss, a workplace culture strategist and author of \"WHY ARE WE HERE?: Creating a Work Culture Everyone Wants,\" told BI that \"young-ism\" is on the rise. Gen Zers are sometimes labeled difficult, demanding, and even weird in interviews. Many are fed up with work and don't want to climb the corporate ladder, thinking the juice isn't worth the squeeze. Some attribute this to the pandemic and being stuck at home in some of their most formative years. Moss thinks Gen Zers actually became more ambitious after lockdowns and now seek lives with purpose. \"This can be a great driver of engagement and lots of really positive business outcomes,\" she said. Chung said employees hiring for entry-level roles should consider Gen Z's positives, such as their ability to think outside the box, courage to take calculated risks, and that they are \"super collaborators.\" \"These folks collaborate on everything from school projects, to slaying dragons while immersed in a fictitious game,\" she said. \"Gen Z sees collaborating as a way of life \u2014 they don't know anything different.\" Leaders create a company's culture, so they need to address workplace disengagement, said Leena Rinne, a VP at online learning platform Skillsoft. \"Feeling that Gen Z doesn't have a work ethic, that they're entitled, that they lack motivation \u2014 those can be addressed through leadership,\" she told BI. \"If we believe those are learnable skills, then as an organization, as leaders, we should be investing in Gen Z to actually be able to do it.\" Gen Zers can fight back against negative stereotypes, by realizing that technology cannot replace experience, Chung said. Older generations have significant knowledge \"that doesn't always get captured by computers,\" she said. Going to the office more often is another good idea, in Chung's view, given the opportunities for forging connections and ad-hoc learning. \"Sometimes simply being present can lead to impromptu conversations that may enhance your thinking or change the trajectory of your career,\" she said. Chung thinks workers should ask what they can gain from interacting with those outside their cohort. \"Everyone can learn something from anyone if they're willing to try. All generations add value to a company \u2014\u00a0how do we both win?\" Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Mysterious and fascinating artifacts are surfacing on melting glaciers across the planet. From strange wooden tools and statues to ancient human remains, these objects are drawing archaeologists into the high, frozen mountains each year. Norway is at the forefront of this emerging field of research, called glacial archaeology. With about 4,500 artifacts discovered, the country claims more than half of the planet's glacial archaeology findings, according to Espen Finstad, who co-leads the Norwegian program, called Secrets of the Ice. Archaeologists there are piecing together clues about ancient industries and trade routes across the glaciers. They just had one of their best field seasons yet. Here's what they found. Ancient hunting, travel, and trade routes crossed the mountains between the Norwegian coast and inland areas from the Stone Age. \"We are lucky that some of these trade routes have gone over ice,\" Finstad told Business Insider. As humans have burned fossil fuels for energy, releasing heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, global temperatures have been rising for decades. Glaciers everywhere are melting, releasing the ancient artifacts preserved inside them. \"There are so many treasures in the ice there,\" Finstad said. Lendbreen was a common travel route during the Viking and medieval eras. The archaeologists go there almost every year. \"The melting really came rapidly at the end of the season,\" Finstad said. They stayed there about nine days, Finstad said. One of them was just lying on top of the ice, waiting to be found. Usually there's a little excavation involved, but the archaeologists simply picked this arrow up. \"It's very seldom to find them that well preserved on the ice. So it was kind of a gift. It was very beautiful,\" Finstad said. People hunted for their own food, of course, but also to sell in a market. For example, some arrowheads found on the glaciers have tips made from river mussels that must have come from far away, cluing researchers in to just how far people were traveling and trading over the ages. Fletching is delicate and doesn't usually last thousands of years. These were rare findings. Small bits of wood, leather, and textile are often impossible to identify. \"It's all kind of small things, daily life things from the Viking Age or older, which you don't find in other archaeology contexts, at least in Norway, because it's gone. It degrades,\" Finstad said. \"We are excited to go back,\" Finstad said. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management\u2014an investment firm co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy\u2014has urged GameStop to adopt bitcoin as a reserve asset. Cole sent a letter to Ryan Cohen, Chairman and CEO of GameStop (GME), on Feb. 24. According to Cole, GameStop has a unique opportunity to redefine itself as a market leader with its nearly $5 billion cash reserve. \"We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.\" According to the letter, Strive's clients hold shares of GameStop through the asset management's exchange-traded funds (ETFs), giving the firm \"a fiduciary responsibility and vested interest\" in GameStop's success. Cole said his firm holds GME stock in three different ETFs without disclosing the amount. The letter comes after reports surfaced earlier this month about GameStop considering investing in alternative investments, including bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  In the last two years, GameStop has reduced its operating losses and managed to offset these deficits through interest income from cash holdings generated from equity offerings, the letter said. These initiatives have stabilized GME's balance sheet and positioned the company for \"dynamic strategic moves,\" the letter adds.  Cole argues that bitcoin will be the new \"hurdle rate\" for capital deployment. The letter also argues that cash is a negative real return; bitcoin is deemed an inflation hedge in terms of outpacing monetary debasement. Strive's CEO suggests GameStop should focus on bitcoin and avoid other cryptocurrencies while leveraging capital markets to issue at-the-market (ATM) offerings and convertible debt securities.  The letter's suggestion mirrors what several other companies, including MicroStrategy, Semler Scientific and MARA Holdings, are already deploying. Most of the larger-cap stocks that have bought bitcoin in the open market have seen not only their stock price rally but also opened up new avenues for capital raises.  The letter ends with Cole applauding GameStop for closing unprofitable stores and publicly rejecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Cole says, \"We applaud the leadership your firm has already taken to close many unprofitable stores and publicly reject DEI.\" James Van Straten is a Senior Analyst at CoinDesk, specializing in Bitcoin and its interplay with the macroeconomic environment.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":" Audi has been on a transformation spree, shifting its model lineup, embracing electrification, and, much to the dismay of enthusiasts, phasing out its two-door sports cars. The Audi TT, once a staple of the brand\u2019s design philosophy, is gone, and the R8 has followed suit. Enter the world of digital automotive design, where talented artists breathe life into what mainstream manufacturers won\u2019t. One such designer, Mario Vilar, has envisioned an alternative future for Audi with the Quanta\u2014a virtual crossover coupe that imagines what the TT could have evolved into rather than disappearing altogether. The Quanta isn\u2019t just another high-riding crossover with a coupe-like roofline. It fully embraces the two-door format, a rarity in today\u2019s SUV-obsessed market. The design draws clear inspiration from Audi\u2019s past, particularly the TT, while incorporating futuristic cues from the RSQ, the concept car created for the 2004 film I, Robot. The result is a vehicle that looks both familiar and forward-thinking, capturing the essence of what made the TT so special while adapting it to the reality of modern automotive trends. Designer: Mario Vilar       From the front, the Quanta sports Audi\u2019s signature single-frame grille, but it\u2019s been reinterpreted with sharper angles and a more aggressive stance. The headlights are slim, with an almost robotic precision, echoing the aesthetics of concept cars that never made it to production. The sculpted hood and flared wheel arches give it an athletic look, reinforcing the idea that this isn\u2019t a crossover built purely for practicality\u2014it\u2019s meant to be engaging.        The side profile is where the design takes a radical turn. Unlike traditional coupe-SUVs, which often look like compromised sedans on stilts, the Quanta is a true two-door coupe, with a long, sweeping roofline that tapers into an integrated rear spoiler. There\u2019s a sense of motion even at a standstill, an element that many modern crossovers lack. The high ground clearance suggests capability beyond the pavement, but the overall proportions keep it from venturing too far into rugged off-roader territory.   At the rear, the influence of the RSQ concept is most apparent. A full-width light bar creates a futuristic signature, while the lower section features large aerodynamic vents, reinforcing the car\u2019s performance-oriented aesthetic. There\u2019s a minimalist approach to badging, with only a subtle Audi logo and the \u201cQuanta\u201d nameplate integrated into the rear fascia. The rear bumper, with its sculpted lines, looks more suited to a sports car than a traditional SUV, making it clear that this is a crossover designed for driving enthusiasts rather than suburban errand runs.  The interior is left to the imagination, but if the exterior is anything to go by, it would likely blend Audi\u2019s latest technology with a driver-focused cockpit. Given the brand\u2019s push toward minimalism, a virtual cockpit with augmented reality displays seems like a natural fit. Sustainable materials and a mix of leather, Alcantara, and carbon fiber would reinforce the balance between luxury and performance.   The question remains\u2014could something like the Quanta ever make it to production? Audi\u2019s current trajectory suggests otherwise, but there\u2019s always room for surprise. The success of vehicles like the Porsche Cayenne Coupe and the Lamborghini Urus proves that performance-oriented SUVs can carve out a niche, and a high-performance two-door crossover from Audi would certainly stand out in an increasingly homogenous market.   The Quanta concept also raises an interesting discussion about the evolution of performance cars. Traditional sports coupes are struggling to find a place in the market, but high-performance crossovers continue to thrive. If brands want to keep the spirit of cars like the TT alive, they may need to rethink how they package performance and design. The Quanta hints at a possible direction\u2014keeping the essence of a coupe while embracing the versatility that modern buyers demand.

{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"LONDON - NOVEMBER 22:  The logo of the London Stock Exchange is displayed in the foyer of the London ... [+] Stock Exchange on November 22, 2006 in London, England. The London Stock Exchange was founded in 1801 and iis one of the largest stock exchanges in the world.  (Photo by Scott Barbour\/Getty Images) I am often asked what picks I have for U.S. investors in the U.K. markets, as many look at the valuations and blink in disbelief at how low and out of sync they are with U.S. companies cut from the same cloth. U.K. stocks are cheap, but it seems that the slumbering FTSE 100 is slowly waking up. Here is a chart of the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 and the German DAX index: The U.K.'s FTSE 100 compared to Germany's DAX The recent bunny hop in the U.K. index mirrors sudden breakouts in other assets, and you can see that the German market has experienced a significant acceleration. The penny is dropping that Europe, including the U.K., must roll back bureaucracy and embrace more democracy \u2013 both politically and economically \u2013 to get back on track. If they don\u2019t, they face a very unpleasant near future, with the U.S. grappling with China and the mad chap in the east ogling their border. Of course, Europe could choose not to get its skates on, but the writing is so clearly on the wall that the trend toward getting off its fat, comfy derriere and stepping up its game is undeniable. This, I feel, is very bullish \u2013 as long as developments don\u2019t spook capital into fleeing for the hills and crashing the whole shooting match in a moment of epiphany. This is why gold is already so feisty. But wait. The gold chart seems to mirror Germany's DAX Well, that\u2019s kind of interesting. Of course, some will argue that correlation is not causation, but those who do generally aren\u2019t market operators. Betting against correlation is a road to the poorhouse. So, I would say to U.S. investors: the way to trade the U.K. is as follows: You can apply the same approach to Germany and France, though the gap between U.S. and German company valuations won\u2019t be so stark. This method allows you to build a nice selection of companies that are practically begging to be taken over. There is, however, an easier way. The quickest way to gain some exposure to the U.K. market is through the iShares MSCI UK ETF (EWU): The iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF chart runs alongside the FTSE 100 While it\u2019s not exactly the FTSE 100, the iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF runs closely alongside the FTSE 100 and offers similar exposure. Diversification is always wise, and with the seismic changes about to shake up Europe and the U.K., adding a bit of Euro seasoning to a spicy U.S. portfolio makes a lot of sense.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-25","content":"Adobe has launched a new Photoshop app for iPhones, bringing advanced tools such as masking, targeted adjustments, and layer control to the mobile platform. So far, the company has only offered a watered-down experience with the Photoshop Express app for mobile devices. The new Photoshop app also comes with its own subscription plan that offers access to all the editing tools and premium stock assets across the app and an expanded web-based version. Adobe claims the app has been built from scratch and that a majority of the pro-level tools have been optimised to offer the best mobile editing experience. Users will get access to workflows such as asset blending and compositing via layers and masks. The well-received Tap Select tool is here to stay, letting users select and edit specific elements in their photos. Adobe says the whole workflow will be integrated with other pro-grade editing software such as Adobe Fresco, Lightroom, and Express. \u201cThe introduction of Photoshop\u2019s new mobile app marks the first time image editing and design features and capabilities at this level of power, precision and control have been available for free in a single mobile,\u201d says the company. Another notable aspect of the Photoshop mobile app is the addition of AI-powered editing tools via the Adobe Firefly stack. This one opens the doors for fun edits such as removing objects, expanding the canvas, and adding new objects to the frame using AI. Google already offers similar AI-assisted editing features in the Photos app, and brands such as OnePlus and Samsung have also adopted a similar approach for their respective mobile gallery apps in 2025. All the niceties Adobe is promising for the Photoshop app and the updated web version come with a subscription package. The new Photoshop Mobile and Web plan is priced at $7.99 per month, and an annual tier priced at $69.99 is also on the table. This subscription offers access to cross-device sync facility, thousands of fonts, unlimited typography options, tools such as Magic Wand and Object Select, Content-aware Fill, and more. The new Photoshop app for iPhone is now available to download, while an Android version will arrive later this year. The web client, on the other hand, is compatible with mainstream browsers such as Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. What a shame the Apple iPhone 16e isn\u2019t more fun. I don't mean exciting, and I\u2019m not talking about the specification, or that a modem is the most technically interesting aspect (it\u2019s important, but modems are inherently a bit dull) of the phone. I mean fun, and I\u2019m specifically talking about it coming in only two colors, and the ones Apple chose are as vanilla and ordinary as you can get. Two colors The iPhone 16e is available in black or white. These are the most Apple colors it could have chosen, and fitting as the brand which arguably launched the white smartphone craze in 2008 with the iPhone 3G, when it joined the safe choice black iPhone 3G. What\u2019s old is new again, but things have moved on since the days of a white iPhone capturing attention. Apple has actually moved on too, as we'll soon show, which makes the whole situation feel out of place. There just can\u2019t be any fanfare around a new 2025 iPhone where the choice is either boring black, or overdone white. The iPhone 17 Air has been the subject of no small number of different rumors and leaks, and now the latest one suggests its screen might be up to 6.7 inches in size rather than the expected 6.6 inches. The information comes from tipster Jon Prosser on the Recycle Bin podcast. This is far from the first rumor we've heard about the screen size. Last year, Ross Young initially suggested a 6.55-inch display \u2014 that would be 6.6 rounded up \u2014 but estimates have ping-ponged since then. Few Apple devices have had as many conflicting rumors as the iPhone 17, so take this with more than a grain of salt. Apple\u2019s iPhone 16e is a strange duck. When one sits down and considers the specs, it\u2019s hard to figure out where it truly fits into Apple\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s apparent from the name that Apple wants you to see it as the new junior member of the iPhone 16 lineup. That\u2019s certainly fair, and it\u2019s arguably about time that the iPhone family got a third tier. After all, Apple\u2019s chief rivals like Google and Samsung have had their A-series and FE-series phones for years.
