{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Many of us assume that the US Food and Drug Administration approves all of our personal care products, vetting every serum, supplement, and LED mask. After all, on average, people slather on six to 12 cosmetics per day, according to the FDA, so we like to assume they\u2019re safe. Unfortunately, most cosmetics and wellness products are among the least regulated consumer products in the US, governed by laws that haven\u2019t seen significant updates since 1938. So, what do terms like \u201cFDA-approved,\u201d \u201cFDA-cleared,\u201d and \u201cFDA-regulated\u201d mean\u2014and why do these labels matter? Understanding the differences will help you cut through the buzzwords and make smarter decisions about the products you use every day. Here\u2019s a breakdown. A Note About FDA Registration If a product claims it\u2019s \u201cFDA-registered,\u201d it doesn\u2019t apply any form of approval, clearance, or endorsement. Registration simply means the manufacturer has filed their info with the FDA\u2014which is required by law. To verify a product\u2019s FDA status, check the database.

These are the products with the highest potential risk, such as pacemakers, injectable treatments like Botox, and breast implants. To earn FDA approval, manufacturers undergo a five-step process that includes: This process can stretch over a decade. While not flawless (hello, recalls), it\u2019s the highest level of scrutiny for consumer products. FDA clearance is for Class I and II devices, which are generally moderate-risk tools like microneedling pens and certain laser treatments. Unlike approval, clearance just requires manufacturers to prove their product is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to an already legally marketed device through the 510(k) clearance process. This pathway is less rigorous and faster than FDA approval, typically spanning months to a few years. Many consumer devices undergo the FDA clearance process, such as LED masks and fitness trackers that have features like irregular heart rhythm or sleep apnea alerts. They are usually labeled as such. This also means that if you\u2019ve ever seen an LED mask marketed as \u201cFDA-approved,\u201d that would be a mislabel. Most cosmetics\u2014except for color additives\u2014and dietary supplements fall into the FDA-regulated category, meaning that they don\u2019t require approval before hitting the market. Instead, manufacturers are expected to self-regulate under laws like the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labelling Act. These laws require the companies to ensure their products are safe and properly labeled, but in practice, there\u2019s little to stop misleading products from slipping through the cracks. Thanks to the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA), signed into law in 2022, the FDA can now recall cosmetics that pose a threat to public health. That said, the FDA intervenes after the fact, and only if a product is misbranded, adulterated, or causes adverse effects. MoCRA also doesn\u2019t grant the FDA the power to audit company records to verify their safety claim or conduct premarket reviews. Dietary supplements are similarly under-regulated. Manufacturers must notify the FDA 75 days before introducing new ingredients, but the products don\u2019t require preapproval. If a supplement is later to be found harmful or mislabeled, the FDA can take enforcement action\u2014but by then, the damage may already be done. The recent ban on Red No. 3\u2014a potentially carcinogenic dye approved in 1902\u2014highlights just how slow this process can be. For reference, the FDA first became aware of its risks in the 1980s. The bottom line is that the FDA\u2019s regulatory reach remains limited. Whether it\u2019s the sunscreen on your face or the supplements in your cabinet, much of the responsibility for safety rests on the manufacturers\u2014and you. Read labels and don\u2019t let the buzzwords fool you. Join the WIRED community to add comments.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  In January 2023, I had a decent-sized mortgage and was facing a divorce. On top of that, I was paying most of the mortgage and the bills that come with living in a 4-bedroom home, by myself.          As someone self-employed, this was a stressful time. I was constantly aware of what would happen if I had a slow freelance month, a client that took forever to pay, or I got sick.               I had minimal savings and decided that the best way forward would be to sell the property and, with it, pay off my mortgage in full, which I did.               This gave me some much-needed breathing room to decide what to do next \u2014 mentally, physically, and financially.               I stayed with family while I worked out what to do next. I'd always dreamt of not having a mortgage or rent to pay, and this felt even more important to me as I'd become self-employed and newly single.               Plus, as a single, self-employed person who only had a few years of accounts, getting a mortgage was always going to be tougher for me than when I had bought my previous home, when I was employed with a steady income and it was a joint application.               The amount I could get a mortgage for was laughable, and wouldn't even buy me a parking garage. I didn't want to rent as I have two dogs, and the idea of not having my own space or being at the mercy of a landlord's rent hikes was not where I wanted to be.               I kept an eye on the local market and in June 2023 found the exact type of property I was waiting for.               A small, but perfectly formed, barn conversion filled with character but with all the refurb work done for me. I was fortunate enough to have made a profit on selling the other house and this new place was within my cash budget, so I wouldn't need a mortgage. I bought it outright.               Nearly two years later, I can confidently say that living debt-free in my 30s has completely changed my life.               For starters, the financial freedom of not being tied to a monthly mortgage has allowed me to build up significant savings \u2014 more than I've ever had before \u2014 and pay off my lingering credit card debt.               I've started investing in the stock market, too, which I had never felt confident enough to do before for fear of \"wasting\" money.               I've also been able to pay for some home improvements, like a wood-burning stove, new heating and furniture, andbuying my car outright.               Knowing that everything I own is truly mine and comes with no extra payments feels like quite an old-fashioned way to live, but it's completely put my mind at ease and significantly improved my mental well-being.               The best part of choosing to live debt-free is that I can be more selective of the work I say yes to because I don't have the pressure of a mortgage or credit debt. That means no terrible projects, horrible clients, or work I don't enjoy.               I can also say yes to my friends and family more when they want to spend time with me since my work schedule is more flexible. Plus, I can use the money I save to travel \u2014 I've been to eight countries since paying off my mortgage, and I don't plan on slowing down.               While I compromised by moving to a lower-cost area so I could buy a property outright, that's been a compromise I've been more than happy to make to achieve my goal. I realize how fortunate I am to be in this position.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"February 13, 2025 18 min read The Beauty of \u2018Slow Flowers\u2019 versus the Pretty Poison of Plants Grown with Dangerous Chemicals New \u201cslow flower\u201d farms grow beautiful blooms\u2014without health-harming chemicals used by overseas operations that dominate the U.S. flower market By Maryn McKenna edited by Josh Fischman Dahlias bloom at the Maine Flower Collective, a group of local growers. Jesse Burke On a low hill near the coast of Maine, the fresh petals of double daffodils shake frills of gold and peach in a gusting breeze. It is the middle of May, a clear blue sky overhead, and the lacy burgundy foliage of peonies and new stalks of twiggy curly willow are poking through swaths of black landscape fabric. Against the walls of a greenhouse, seedlings of cosmos and celosia, lisianthus and snapdragons rise in plastic trays. Mud season is barely over, but the turf is vivid green. Those fragrant, frilly blooms will make up wedding arches and table settings and bouquets, the mainstays of the profitable farm and floral studio that farmer Bo Dennis, 35, has built since he bought this parcel several years ago. \u201cWhen people come to us, we say, this is what we\u2019re good at: local flowers that are sustainably grown,\u201d he says, tucking a curl of light hair back under his beanie with muddy hands. \u201cSometimes I do get clients that say, \u2018We want all hydrangeas and all roses, and we want them in May\u2019\u201d\u2014a date when those popular flowers won\u2019t yet have bloomed in Maine. \u201cI will say, \u2018Great! Have a good celebration. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the vendor for you.\u2019\u201d What Dennis grows won\u2019t be found among the blooms that cram the entrances of supermarkets, big-box stores, downtown florists\u2014most of the places where people buy flowers in the U.S. The bouquets that fill those spaces overwhelmingly come from equatorial countries, such as Ecuador and Ethiopia, where cheap labor and minimal environmental regulation make growing affordable. Those flowers are part of an enormously successful international market that sells blooms thousands of miles from their fields of origin and earns more than $25 billion every year.

But pesticides and other agrochemicals required to sustain that scale of production can injure workers and their families. One ongoing study of children in Ecuador whose parents work at flower farms has documented deficits in attention and eye-hand coordination, particularly after periods when these chemicals are heavily sprayed. Children born to women who work in floriculture regions have higher-than-normal rates of birth defects, another study found. And the risks extend to people around the world. In Belgium, florists with imported flowers had unhealthy levels of pesticide chemicals on their gloves, levels high enough to burn the skin if it wasn\u2019t protected. And in the Netherlands, prolific use of antifungals on the country\u2019s signature tulips has fostered the emergence of deadly drug-resistant fungi. The remedy for at least some of these problems is rising in small U.S. operations such as Dennis\u2019s Dandy Ram Farm and others in North Carolina and Utah and throughout the country. Dennis came to floriculture out of a desire for economic self-sufficiency and career-long concern for the environment. He and other growers are building a new, surprisingly lucrative agricultural model\u2014a \u201cslow flower movement,\u201d akin to the Slow Food movement, that offers a cleaner, greener alternative to modern floral production. They aim to protect ecosystems and build new economic pathways while bringing a bit of beauty\u2014ungroomed, imperfect, unpredictable\u2014back into the world. Flowers are so present in our lives that we almost do not see them: sheathed in paper in every market, plunked in a vase on a table in any cafe. But while they are quotidian, they are also monumental; in many cultures, they memorialize the most important days of our lives, from graduations and promotions to weddings and funerals. They are vital to Catholic rituals, Hindu festivals, Buddhist temple offerings and Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead\u2014and also, via chrysanthemums, to the quasi-religion of U.S. college football homecoming games. (Mums are funeral flowers in parts of Europe and Asia, which might be a comfort to the losing team.) We invest them with so much meaning that we demand they always be perfect\u2014although like any crop, they are fungible and fragile, subject to weather, diseases and decay. And like any product, they are subject to the lure of cheaper production offshore. The movement of American manufacturing to countries with fewer regulations over land and labor is an old story, reenacted in products from furniture to cars to food. But the relocation of flower growing was not an accident of global economics. It was deliberately fostered by the U.S. government, part of the 20th-century war on drugs. A bag at Maine\u2019s Dandy Ram Farm protects a delicate dahlia from pests, avoiding the use of chemicals. Jesse Burke In the 1990s, when cocaine flowing from South America was the main focus of drug interdiction, President George H. W. Bush proposed measures to boost legal businesses in the drug\u2019s most important production areas. A 1991 law lifted or reduced tariffs on thousands of products produced in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Cut flowers were on the list, and it gave them an enormous boost. U.S. flower production shrank, and the market for imported flowers skyrocketed. Take roses, the U.S. national flower. In 2002, according to Department of Agriculture data, 157.2 million homegrown roses were sold in the U.S. By 2019 that shrank to 17.2 million. Revenue from homegrown roses plunged as well, from $58.9 million in 2002 to $13.3 million in 2019. \u201cAbout 25 years ago approximately 85 percent of what was sold in the U.S. was grown here; today it\u2019s about 22 percent,\u201d says Camron King, CEO of the trade group Certified American Grown. That decline represents an economic burden\u2014and, given the resonance of flowers, an emotional one, too. King feels that weight when he watches patriotically colored wreaths of red, white, and blue carnations being laid at sacred military sites such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. \u201cThere aren\u2019t commercial-level carnation producers here in the United States any longer,\u201d he points out. \u201cThose are imported flowers honoring our American fallen heroes.\u201d Multiple global trends have benefited offshore flower growers: larger planes, easier refrigeration, low-cost labor and land. But so has freedom from the rules that protect U.S. workers and consumers. \u201cIn California, but also in many other states, there are very strict regulations in terms of pesticides,\u201d says Gerardo Spinelli, a production adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension San Diego County. \u201cBeing in compliance is expensive.\u201d But overseas, \u201cthese regulations are not there or are a lot less strict.\u201d Jose Ricardo Su\u00e1rez, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego, saw the changes the tariff exemptions brought. His parents, both academics, are from Ecuador. The family moved around, but when they were in his parents\u2019 home country, they often visited Pedro Moncayo cant\u00f3n, a county perched in Ecuador\u2019s Andean foothills. Su\u00e1rez remembers the high green landscape and how abruptly it changed in the 1990s: \u201cAll of a sudden, these greenhouses started popping up in many different parts of the county.\u201d The explosion of construction was the first bloom of the floriculture encouraged by that 1991 law, which would make Ecuador the third-largest exporter of flowers in the world, a billion-dollar trade that fields a workforce of more than 100,000 people. Ecuador specializes in roses; the cool mountain climate and consistent sunlight of its equatorial days are uniquely suited to producing straight-stemmed, big-blossomed flowers, highly sought after for celebratory bouquets. But those perfect plants don\u2019t grow that way without assistance; they are sprayed routinely with fungicides and insecticides, especially organophosphates, which kill insects by interfering with their nervous systems. As Su\u00e1rez earned his medical degree in Quito and then his Ph.D. back in the U.S., he became curious about how those compounds might affect the people living nearby. Kate Del Vecchio collects deliveries at the Maine Flower Collective. Jesse Burke In 2008 he founded the Study of Secondary Exposures to Pesticides among Children and Adolescents, known as ESPINA for its acronym in Spanish, to explore whether children in Pedro Moncayo were affected by living in the center of greenhouse production and having parents and family members employed there. \u201cWe found what we call take-home pesticide pathways, in which the workers are exposed, and then those pesticides adhere to their clothing or their hair and skin, or maybe they bring home tools, or they bring some pesticides to use in their own backyards,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cWe\u2019ve also looked at the proximity of homes to different spray sites. We tend to think of greenhouses as totally closed, but the fact is that they\u2019re not: They have windows because you need some circulation of air, so the pesticide is not contained just within the crop.\u201d The study launched with a cohort of 313 children between four and nine years old and then expanded. Approximately half of the kids lived in the same household as workers from flower plantations. The children contributed blood and urine samples, underwent medical exams, and participated in neurological and behavioral assessments. The team began publishing results in 2012. From the beginning, they found problems in the children of flower-farm households that those with no farm connection did not share: first, changes in enzyme levels that affect neurotransmitters and indicate pesticide exposure\u2014and later, effects on learning ability, depression, thyroid function and blood pressure. In one especially poignant result, they found that children linked to flower farms experienced months-long damage to attention, self-control, and eye-hand coordination after one of the biggest spraying episodes of the year: the lead-up to the harvest to make Mother\u2019s Day bouquets. During reassessments, the investigators recruited additional participants to the cohort, topping out at 554 children and teens and collecting fresh samples of blood and urine from both new participants and long-standing ones. They repeatedly found evidence of exposures to pesticides, demonstrating an ongoing problem. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any changes in regulations when it comes to pesticide use,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. National political interest in the issue has waxed and waned, he adds, but local governments have consistently supported their agricultural workers as well as his research. Su\u00e1rez and his fellow investigators have tried to do so also. His parents, physician-epidemiologist Jose Su\u00e1rez-Torres and anthropologist Dolores Lopez Paredes, created a local organization, Fundaci\u00f3n Cimas del Ecuador, that gathers international funding for educational exchanges and local initiatives. Perceiving that flower production doesn\u2019t produce anything nutritious and also sends its products out of the country, the foundation sought to demonstrate another vision of agriculture, creating an organic produce farm where more than 3,000 teens and young adults have received training in agroecology. \u201cYou have to give workers an alternative,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Well, don\u2019t work in flowers.\u2019\u201d Other researchers have focused on risks run by the workers themselves. Two decades ago epidemiologist Jinky Leilanie Lu, now a research professor at the University of the Philippines Manila, documented physical and neurological symptoms\u2014chills and fever, dizziness and headache, for example\u2014in about one third of workers whose jobs were mixing and spraying pesticides on flower farms. In 2009 researchers at the University of New Mexico and the University of Michigan reported on high miscarriage rates among the large number of women who worked in the Ecuadorian flower industry. They had a 2.6 times greater risk of miscarriage than other women. In 2015 a paper about flower greenhouse workers in Ethiopia uncovered a series of health troubles. The country had experienced an explosion of rose cultivation over 10 years thanks to its mild climate and high elevation, going from a tiny industry to the fourth-largest exporter in the world. The research found that a large number of workers had rashes and other skin problems, and some had chronic coughs and shortness of breath. In 2017 a research team at the Autonomous University of Mexico State showed that birth defects in children born in a floriculture region, to women who worked in or near flower farms, occurred in 20 percent of births. That contrasted with 6 percent among women in the same state who worked outside of the flower industry. That same year a separate team of researchers showed that greenhouse workers in two Mexican states who mixed and applied pesticides had higher levels of pesticide biomarkers in their urine than did workers who had less contact with the chemicals. Then last year another paper reported that men who work in the Mexican flower industry and were often exposed to pesticides and fungicides have high blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines\u2014small messenger proteins that normally alert the immune system to fight infection but can trigger chronic diseases when they are too abundant. The colorful flowers are grown in season on local farms. Jesse Burke The perils posed by extensive pesticide use on flower farms outside the U.S. do not stay confined to those properties and their workers. In 2016 researchers in Belgium, who were alarmed by reports of flower workers\u2019 illnesses, published a study on the hazards of flowers after they were cut and shipped. The blooms were not subject to strict rules imposed on food, because they are not a crop intended for eating. In two studies, the scientists tested flower bouquets sold at florists and in supermarkets and found levels of fungicides and pesticides\u2014especially on roses\u2014that could be harmful to the human nervous system if they were absorbed through the skin. To ascertain whether any real risk existed, in follow-up research the scientists asked a group of florists to wear cotton gloves for several hours on two consecutive days while trimming flowers and assembling bouquets and then analyzed what the gloves had picked up. They found 111 different agricultural chemicals, mostly pesticides and fungicides, present in concentrations up to 1,000 times higher than are allowed on produce. Several were present in such high concentrations that they represented both immediate and chronic risks to the florists\u2019 health, capable of causing skin burns and eye irritation, risking damage to a fetus or exposing a breastfed child. The researchers noted that wearing gloves while working and not eating or smoking with flowers nearby would reduce the danger. In the most troubling example, chemical use on flower farms has reached far beyond the farm environment, and farm workers and flower handlers, to affect people not involved with agriculture at all. In the early 2000s a group of physicians in the Netherlands began to notice a worrisome pattern in the sickest patients in their intensive care units. People whose immune systems have been undermined by illness and repeated rounds of drugs are vulnerable to what are called opportunistic infections, triggered by organisms that don\u2019t cause disease in healthy people. One of the most feared is a fungus called Aspergillus fumigatus, which lives in compost heaps and decaying vegetation and puffs out spores that drift through the air. A healthy immune system will sweep inhaled spores from the lung and dispose of them, but in someone with diminished defenses, they lodge in the lung lining and reproduce. The overwhelming infection that results, invasive aspergillosis, occurs in more than two million cases worldwide every year. It was almost always a death sentence until a class of antifungal drugs called azoles debuted in the 1990s and began saving patients from it. A new greenhouse at Dandy Ram Farm holds snapdragons, zinnias, and many other flowers grown using organic farming principles. Jesse Burke But within 10 years of the drug class debuting, that trend reversed. ICU patients began dying again from invasive aspergillosis; when experts investigated, they discovered the fungus had developed resistance to azoles and was no longer vulnerable to the drugs\u2019 attack. In critical care medicine, it is not unusual for infections to become resistant after rounds of drugs. But these azole-resistant infections were occurring in people who had never received those antifungals\u2014and their organisms displayed an identical genetic pattern even in patients hospitalized many miles from one another. An informal strike force of physicians and microbiologists assembled to investigate the problem. If patients were suffering from azole-resistant infections yet had never received azoles in health care, the fungi that had taken hold in their bodies must have been exposed to antifungal compounds somewhere else first\u2014and that exposure must have been common enough, across the Netherlands, to exert the same selective pressure everywhere at the same time. The answer, it turned out, was flowers: the tulips that the Netherlands is famous for and the other bulb-making blooms, lilies and hyacinths and alliums, in which it leads the world. At the same time that medicine was benefiting from the new class of azole drugs, agriculture had been using a class of fungicides based on the same chemical structure. Bulbs planted in the Netherlands, grown to flowering and then harvested for sale around the world, were dipped into azoles or sprayed with the fungicides to protect the investment they represented. That blanket distribution had found its way to Aspergillus in discarded plants and compost heaps of trimmed foliage, and the spores of the newly resistant fungi had been breathed in by patients and made them untreatably ill. By processes that no one has fully defined\u2014simultaneous evolution, or international sales of plants and bulbs, or fungal spores carried on the wind\u2014lethal azole-resistant Aspergillus spread worldwide. It is a persistent danger, says Paul Verweij, chief of medical microbiology at Radboud University Medical Center in the southern Netherlands, one of the first researchers to identify the problem. \u201cThe rate of occurrence is quite stable; it is not going down.\u201d To this point, there has been no indication that international flowers pose a danger to everyday consumers buying a bouquet at a supermarket. Patients who were sickened or killed by exposure to resistant Aspergillus were often already ill, and workers harmed by the procedures of flower growing were exposed by the nature of their jobs. But absent major changes in mass floriculture, those risks will remain. Bo Dennis (left) and Catalina Rodriguez (right). Jesse Burke In the U.S., it is much less likely that small flower farmers will create risks for their workers or their communities. These small growers don\u2019t have the land or equipment to field thousands of acres of identical flowers that may be overwhelmed by a single disease or pest. Nor are small growers compelled by contract to produce thousands of perfect stems to catch the market for graduation or Valentine\u2019s Day. Both of those circumstances can drive up agrochemical use. \u201cThe market has pretty much bifurcated into two streams,\u201d says John Dole, a professor of horticultural science at North Carolina State University and an adviser to the Association of Specialty Cut Flower Growers. (\u201cSpecialty\u201d designates less common flowers, outside the market domination of roses, chrysanthemums and carnations.) \u201cWe have the very large international growers, who ship primarily through Miami. They focus on low-cost production. They are primarily supporting the bib-box stores, which would be grocery stores and mass-market wholesalers. Most U.S. growers are not facing competition from Colombia and Ecuador, simply because they\u2019re growing different products.\u201d Out of preference and for differentiation in the marketplace, many small-scale flower farmers follow organic principles, such as no synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, although they may not pursue the years-long process to get USDA organic certification. \u201cGetting that designation is expensive, so a lot of people say that they grow responsibly, sustainably,\u201d says Val Schirmer, president of the specialty growers association and a founder of Three Toads Farm in central Kentucky. \u201cMost of our growers don\u2019t want to use pesticides. They are much more likely to use beneficial insects and to improve their habitat, like for birds.\u201d (Instead of the USDA route, some farmers opt instead for Certified Naturally Grown, a peer-reviewed process developed for small farms that allows growing flowers for which no organic seed is available.) Without the pesticides and fungicides in use on large farms, workers and owners are safer, and research conducted on flower farms that grow organically or sustainably backs up the assumption that they are healthier for the environment, preserving the diversity of the soil microbiome. \u201cPart of the reason these farms work fairly well is they mimic nature more closely,\u201d Dole says. \u201cBecause of our diversified operations, we have a lot of insect pests. But we also have a lot of insect enemies.\u201d Dennis harvests a field of dahlias, each flower covered in a bag to shield it from the tarnished plant bug, a crop-destroying insect. Jesse Burke None of that would matter, of course, if small farms could not sell their product. \u201cWhen I first started in this business, I would load my flowers into the back of my pickup truck and drive around to florists, and they would refuse categorically to buy local flowers,\u201d says Kate Swift, a flower grower who has operated Cedar Farm Wholesale in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley since 1997. \u201cThey felt that the quality was inferior. That\u2019s how strong a hold overseas production had on the psyche of the buyer.\u201d By 2014, though, a USDA analysis pegged floriculture as the most lucrative product for most small farms (under 10 acres) in the U.S. that specialize in a class of crop, outpacing livestock, poultry and produce in earnings per acre. In 2024 two thirds of people responding to an annual survey by the National Gardening Association said they would preferentially buy local flowers to support family farms and keep agricultural jobs in their regions. Small flower farmers found customers first at farmers markets and among members of community-supported agriculture programs, then at local florists, and finally by linking up with restaurants and event designers where they could charge a premium\u2014in some cases, as at Dandy Ram, by becoming farmer-florists themselves. To accomplish that, the farmers had to persuade their clients to embrace a new aesthetic: less polished and more primal, twining and frondy, founded on blossoms that might be too lush and soft to endure weeks of refrigerated storage but could be guaranteed to look and smell like nothing else. \u201cI\u2019m trying to convince other floral designers that what they really want are locally grown, beautiful, interesting, unique flowers,\u201d says Stacy Brenner, a Maine state senator and one of the proprietors of Broadturn Farm in Scarborough, Me. \u201cTrying to push them to think about shape and color and less about specific blooms, that you can make things look certain ways with color and texture, and you can use local flowers to do it.\u201d If this sounds like the journey of food production in the late 20th century\u2014away from conventional agriculture and toward sustainable and regenerative farms growing heirloom vegetables and heritage breeds\u2014the parallels are close. Debra Prinzing was a journalist writing about architecture and interiors for glossy magazines when she started to think about the provenance of flowers. The international Slow Food movement had launched 20 years earlier, and in the U.S., food activists had begun to talk about consuming only food raised within strict geographic limits. In 2007 novelist Barbara Kingsolver published the best-selling Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, about relocating her family to Appalachia so they could eat from their own property, and the New Oxford American Dictionary decreed \u201clocavore\u201d the word of the year. In the floral design barn, Dennis arranges cut flowers. Jesse Burke Prinzing lives in Seattle, infamous for its short, dark, winter days\u2014yet in the wet worst of that season, she would walk into local supermarkets and encounter bright cellophane-wrapped bouquets that looked plucked from a summer field. The contrast jarred her. She wrote a book in 2012, The 50 Mile Bouquet, to support local flower production, and then a second the next year, Slow Flowers, borrowing the \u201cslow food\u201d nomenclature to provide a manifesto for local production. In 2014 she founded the Slow Flowers Society and directory to help consumers find designers and producers. It has 750 members now. \u201cIf someone was tied into understanding where their food came from, it wasn\u2019t much of a leap for them to say flowers are a legitimate form of agriculture,\u201d she says, calling slow flowers an attempt to \u201credefine what is beautiful and redefine that if you live in the seasons\u2014which is the slow food ethos as well\u2014you are not going to have everything all the time, 24\/7, 365 days a year.\u201d The benefit of the emergence of U.S. slow flowers extends beyond supporting the farms themselves. By offering an alternative to foreign flowers, they are creating economies where their products and their vision can find a home. On a sunny spring afternoon, vans pull up to a low white clapboard building on Crystal Spring Farm in Brunswick, Me., a historic property marked at the roadside by a long horizontal sign of a big wood carrot with a bite taken out. The vans unload bucket after bucket of paper-wrapped sheaves of flowers: delicate lily of the valley and glowing pink bleeding hearts, refined pale-blue nigella, smooth and frilly tulips in purple and apricot, branches of lilac and beech and peach and apple blossoms, and dozens more colors and types. The sheaves come from farms; inside the shed, workers assess their contents and sort them into new buckets to match 24 pages of orders tacked to the wood walls. Each order comes from a florist who placed it in the previous few days on the software platform of the Maine Flower Collective, a member-owned cooperative launched in 2023 that aggregates the products of local growers to make them easier for local designers to buy. Cosmos and other cut flowers are made into bouquets at Dandy Ram Farm. Jesse Burke Before the collective began, the closest wholesale flower market was two states and 130 miles to the south in Chelsea, Mass., in Boston\u2019s infamous traffic. \u201cThere was one in Bangor years ago, and it closed down,\u201d says Sofia Oliver, the collective\u2019s operations manager, tugging down a knit cap to protect against the chilly fragrant air. \u201cWhich I think was part of the reason a lot of growers and buyers started working together to get this collective started.\u201d Every week local flower growers\u201441, on this May afternoon\u2014post whatever looks ready on the collective\u2019s private site, and designers peruse the offerings and place orders. On a morning after orders close, the collective\u2019s vans take off on long loops around the state, scooping up harvested flowers and delivering them to the shed for sorting. Once they are matched to their orders and rebucketed, the flowers go into the shed\u2019s coolers and get delivered the next day. It makes up a web of selling and buying and connection, an economic network that, thanks to local flowers, stitches together the state. The new economic opportunities that small farm flowers represent stretch across the country. Take Utah, where flower farms have proliferated from 18 in 2018 to 199 in 2023. Floriculture may fit well with local norms because it allows women to develop home-based businesses. \u201cWe have a lot of women who are household managers and primary caregivers,\u201d says Melanie Stock, an associate professor and extension specialist at Utah State University\u2019s College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences who surveys the industry. \u201cIt is such a premium, high-value crop, and they are entrepreneurs, so they are finding these small parcels of land and making it into a profitable business. It helps families out of underemployment without imposing associated childcare costs.\u201d And at its best, flower production allows farmers to extend to others the opportunities they have developed for themselves. For Dennis, owning Dandy Ram offers the possibility of bringing more LGBTQ people into agriculture. He and his partner have set aside some of their acreage to lease to brand-new queer farmers, creating an incubator for those who cannot yet afford their own. \u201cA big reason why I keep farming is to build community,\u201d he says, \u201cso we share land with a few people who are learning how to grow.\u201d The collective action, the support for others, the community building\u2014as much as the flowers themselves, they are acts that bring beauty into the world. For flower farmers, it is especially poignant that these investments in the future arise from something so ephemeral. \u201cIt may look very glamorous from all of the things that people see and post online, but it\u2019s definitely still difficult,\u201d Oliver notes. But the blooms are worth it, she says: \u201cFlowers are like food for the soul. They fill a different kind of need. Some people might think of them as frivolous, but they bring people joy.\u201d Blooms Away: The Real Price of Flowers.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"A company called Signulous has helped more than 120,000 Americans install TikTok on their iPhones despite the app being unavailable on the Apple App Store. The company simplifies the process for iPhone users to create iOS developer accounts, which allow them to load apps onto the device without going through the App Store. Apple\u2019s own TestFlight service allows iPhone users to install apps that have not been added to the App Store, with limits. Signulous told the BBC that at certain times, more than 2,000 people have used its service to download TikTok within a one-hour period. It just goes to show that the younger generations do not care much about US policymakers\u2019 focus on national security concerns in relation to China, something recent studies support. Gen Z is nihilistic\u00e2\u0080\u0094they know the likes of Meta and Google collect their information to use for hyper-targeted recommendations and advertisements, and they do not care much about fears that the Chinese Communist Party could use TikTok to manipulate discourse in America. They get a lot of value from the app, and a lot of the national security concerns remain speculative, with legislative hearings regarding the app being kept confidential. Legislators do not want to advocate for TikTok to remain available only to later on learn that it was indeed censoring or manipulating speech, however, so the order to divest from Chinese ownership has largely been bipartisan. Trump and Biden \u201cflipped\u201d insofar as they decided TikTok should have more time to divest, but they still both have sought divestment. Even though President Trump gave TikTok a 90-day reprieve to negotiate a deal in which it would sell to U.S. owners, during which time it can remain active, Apple and Google still have not allowed the app back into their respective stores. Technically speaking, the law banning TikTok went into effect in January, but some service providers like Oracle have chosen to trust Trump\u2019s promise that he will not penalize them for supporting the social network. Apple and Google have, of course, been more cautious. Funnily enough, TikTok itself has begun instructing Android users on how they can sideload the app themselves, which just shows how confident they are President Trump will stick to his word. The president found himself in an enviable position as he took office, able to (temporarily) walk back President Biden\u2019s ban on the app favored by Gen Z, making Trump look like a savior. President Biden, for his part, had said in the final days of his presidency that he would direct his Justice Department to give TikTok more time to spin off from its Chinese owner ByteDance, but alas, he left office looking like the enemy of America\u2019s youth. Following the removal of TikTok from the App Store, eBay and Facebook Marketplace were flooded with sellers asking tens of thousands of dollars for iPhones with the TikTok app installed. Pause lmao 35k??? pic.twitter.com\/XOm8fFL5r1 \u2014 Megan Nyvold (@MeganNyvold) January 27, 2025  There was talk that Trump\u2019s right-hand man, Elon Musk, would potentially acquire TikTok and further grow his empire. He said last week that he has no plans on buying the company, however. Other suits like Perplexity have stepped up, but it remains unclear whether ByteDance is willing to sell at all, or whether the Chinese government would allow a deal. TikTok remains very popular around the world, so it may well be willing to retreat from the American market and maintain the app across the rest of the world.

Whether you opt for the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra or the Galaxy Tab S10+, you\u2019re getting one of the best tablets on the market, and one of the newest. The Galaxy Tab S10 line of tablets was released by Samsung just this past October. The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has a 14.6-inch reduced-glare screen with Dynamic AMOLED 2x resolution and 120Hz refresh speed, while the Galaxy Tab S10+ has virtually the same screen in a slightly smaller 12.4-inch size. The Ultra\u2019s front camera has 12MP ultrawide mode in addition to a 12MP primary mode, while the S10+ has just the 12MP primary mode. The rear cameras are the same: 13MP primary and 8MP ultrawide. The Ultra\u2019s Wi-Fi 7 is a slight step above the 6E connectivity of the S10+ Other than that, the only real difference is that the Galaxy Tab S10+ is available in 256GB and 512GB storage sizes, while the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra has a 1TB version in addition to the 256GB and 512GB. Both tablets share the same ultra-fast MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ processor chip, both come with an included S Pen, and both have all of the same Galaxy AI-powered perks and features. Samsung has loaded these Presidents\u2019 Day offers with opportunities to bundle up and save on more great tech from the Galaxy family, with 30% off Galaxy Watches and Buds with the purchase of one of these great tablets, and 50% off the Book Cover Keyboard Slim that gives the Galaxy Tab S10 a true laptop-like user experience. Any tablet trade-in gets you halfway to your max credit on either the S10 Ultra and S10+.

With market uncertainty looming, many are shifting their focus to undervalued stocks with more potential. One key metric for evaluating a stock\u2019s profitability is the price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio. This is calculated by dividing the stock\u2019s price by its earnings per share (EPS).

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  Nissan and Honda called off a $50 billion merger that would have formed one of the world's largest car companies.          The Japanese automakers said on Thursday they scrapped the deal, announced in December, \"to prioritize speed of decision-making and execution of management measures\" in an \"increasingly volatile\" market.               The companies said they would continue to work within a \"strategic partnership.\"               Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said Honda's desire to make his company a subsidiary rather than a partner played a key role in the deal's collapse.               \"While both companies have a long history, we were not sure whether this would reflect our autonomy or allow us to demonstrate our potential or strength,\" he told a press conference.               Both companies released earnings on Thursday shortly after the deal's collapse.               Honda reported a 25% rise in pre-tax profit in the latest quarter, buoyed by strong US sales and its high-performing motorcycle business.               It still faces a major headache in China, where sales collapsed almost 40% in the nine months to December, but its financial position looks decidedly rosier than its rival's.               Nissan's profits crashed to 5.1 billion yen ($33 million) for the nine months to December, down from 325 billion yen ($2.1 billion) in the same period for 2023. It projected an annual loss of 80 billion yen ($519 million).               A scarcity of electric models has seen Nissan lose market share in China to local rivals, while its US sales have also suffered due to a lack of hybrid options and its EV's failure to qualify for $7,500 government tax credits.               Nissan stock has fallen about 25% over the past year. After being about the same size as Honda a decade ago, its market capitalization is now about a fifth of its rival. Honda stock is down about 15% in the same period.               Uchida is now racing to execute a turnaround plan that will involve cutting 9,000 jobs globally. He warned that all options were on the table to ensure the storied automaker's survival.               \"Given the latest performance of the company and the changing environment, it is essential to explore all the options without taboo and carry out a deeper structural reform,\" Uchida said.               Nissan gave more details about its restructuring plans on Thursday, unveiling plans to cut 6,500 jobs at the company's factories in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Thailand.               It also plans to cut global vehicle production by 1 million to 4 million in the 2026 financial year.               Both Nissan and Honda also face a looming headache in the form of potential US tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico and Canada, where the two companies have factories.               Uchida said Nissan would consider moving production from Mexico to other regions if the tariffs go ahead after the temporary suspension expires in March.               Honda vice president Shinji Aoyama said the automaker was racing to export vehicles made in Canada and Mexico into the US before the waiver expired.               The breakdown of the Honda deal leaves Nissan looking for investment elsewhere. The chairman of Apple supplier Foxconn said the Taiwanese firm was considering buying the 36% stake in Nissan owned held by France's Renault.               Private equity firm KKR is also considering an investment in Nissan, Bloomberg reported.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  It looks like Apple has finally found a partner to bring its full vision of generative AI to China: Jack Ma's Alibaba.          Apple will be hoping the partnership, confirmed Thursday by Alibaba's chairman Joe Tsai, drives more iPhone sales in China. But its success is far from guaranteed at a time when the company is facing tough competition from domestic rivals like Huawei.               \"Apple has been very selective. They talked to a number of companies in China, and in the end, they choose to do business with us,\" Tsai said in an interview at the World Government Summit in Dubai. \"They want to use our AI to power their phones.\"               Apple has been searching for a local partner to bring the full version of its Apple Intelligence suite of features to Chinese consumers. Beijing's rules prevent it from bringing its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to the country.               As a result, Apple Intelligence has not yet been introduced to Apple's most important international market. While the Alibaba partnership brings that one step closer, it still has some regulatory hurdles to pass.               Some analysts predict that Apple Intelligence will boost the company's fortunes in China at a time when its smartphone sales are continuously sliding in the face of fierce competition from local smartphone makers such as Huawei, Xiaomi, and Vivo.               Last month, Apple reported an 11% year-on-year revenue drop to $18.5 billion in Greater China, adding further woes to the health of its sales in the region after a 7.7% drop there to $72.5 billion in its previous fiscal year.               In that time, market share has shifted toward domestic firms as their devices have begun to incorporate 5G capabilities that can rival those of top-end iPhones. These devices have also provided a made-in-China alternative that appeals to growing national sentiment in the country.               In the last quarter of 2024, for instance, Huawei saw its smartphone sales jump 15.5% year-on-year, per figures from research firm Counterpoint, following the release of its high-end Mate 70 series of smartphones in November. Apple's smartphone sales fell 18.2%.               The other uncertainty for Apple is whether any of its generative AI features will move the needle among consumers spending more carefully.               Counterpoint's associate director Ethan Qi noted last month that China's smartphone market saw a slowdown in the final quarter of 2024 \u2014 overall smartphone sales fell 3.2% year-on-year in the quarter \u2014 as \"consumers adopted cautious spending behavior.\"               Though Apple is betting on generative AI to help trigger a fresh upgrade cycle, analysts have been left underwhelmed by what Apple Intelligence offers, raising concerns about the value consumers might see in the technology.               Following rumors of an Apple-Alibaba deal earlier this week, analysts at investment bank Jefferies wrote that they thought it \"would be unlikely to boost sales\" of the iPhone 17 in China.               While the analysts recognized that Alibaba's Qwen AI model has left a strong impression on the industry, having demonstrated \"strong performance in global AI leaderboards,\" there are concerns that Apple will find it hard to use the model to leverage data from its own apps and deliver the \"highly intelligent, personalized services\" it seeks to offer.                Chinese iPhone users \"rarely use any Apple apps\" and choose to opt for local ones like WeChat and Baidu instead, the analysts added.               Markets have reacted positively to The Information's initial report that Alibaba and Apple had agreed to a partnership. On Wednesday, Alibaba shares in Hong Kong climbed over 8%.               Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.               A partnership between Apple and Alibaba would not mark the first time the two companies have floated the possibility of working together.               In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly addressed the prospect of a \"marriage\" between Apple Pay and Alibaba's payment platform, Alipay, by sharing his respect for the company's founder, Jack Ma. He said he likes to work with \"those that \"push us, and we like to push them.\"               \"Those partners we work the best with, and I think Jack has a company that's exactly like that,\" Cook said. Some 11 years on, he'll hope that Alibaba can still be that company to Apple.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Citing OPPO's lead in the foldable segment with the Find N5.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  OnePlus is leaving the foldables scene, at least for this year. In a community blog post on their foldable strategy, Vale G, a OnePlus product manager, said the company is 'recalibrating their foldable strategy' and confirmed that it will be holding off on launching a OnePlus Open 2. The company's first foldable, the OnePlus Open, debuted in 2023 and continues to be one of the best foldables on the market today. This explains the enthusiasm around the next edition of this foldable. But it looks like fans will have to wait. \"At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we\u2019ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year,\" the community post explained. OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies, and the two share combined hardware and research teams, as well as a common software codebase. It looks like the focus is now fully on launching the world's thinnest foldable, the OPPO Find N5, in the next couple of weeks. That said, OpenPlus doesn't fully rule out the possibility of launching Open 2 in the future. \"While this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time. That said, our decision to pause on foldable for this generation does not signify a departure from the category,\" the community post added. The company also adds that nothing changes for the current OnePlus Open users as they will continue to receive all \"the software updates security patches, and the exceptional after-sales service you\u2019ve come to expect from us.\" While we don't know for sure what made the company take this stance, it looks like the software advancements that were supposed to debut in the Open 2 will now be seen in OPPO\u2019s Find N5. Not only will it be the thinnest foldable yet, but the device is said to demonstrate advancements in foldable technology, \"including the use of cutting-edge new materials and more sophisticated engineering.\" Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android It remains to be seen if the move was right for OnePlus as it takes a step back this year.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 08: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] morning trading on October 08, 2024 in New York City. Stocks opened up on the rise after the Dow Jones saw a loss of 400 points amid a rise in oil prices.  (Photo by Michael M. Santiago\/Getty Images) A market leadership tug-of-war has been taking place over the past several quarters between mega cap growth and the rest of the U.S. equity universe. Leadership has proven fickle with many twists and turns, such as the recent news about DeepSeek\u2019s AI model, which has cast doubt on the magnitude of the AI investment cycle and the cost to train AI models. Whether or not DeepSeek\u2019s models represent a true breakthrough that will shift the demand for semiconductors, data center capacity, and power generation will not be known for some time. What is clear, however, is that equity investors are once again faced with the prospect of an inflection in market leadership. Often the catalysts for a sustained shift are unknowable until after the fact, as new information surfaces that substantially alters the investment landscape. Unfavorable news can create headwinds to even the most bulletproof companies, where lofty embedded expectations can prove vulnerable to investors reassessing the path of future earnings. As seen with the recent DeepSeek-led shakeup, high-flying leaders can suffer sharp declines when investors decide to book profits. With the biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index trading at a substantial premium to the rest of the index and market concentration near record levels, there is little room for disappointment at present. While some catalysts for a rotation can appear seemingly out of nowhere, others are well understood but ignored by investors until price action encourages broad repositioning against the underlying trend. Often a \u201cshow me\u201d moment can create the sense of urgency to embrace new leadership. Over the past several years, a narrow group of stocks has driven the majority of the benchmarks earnings growth, but sell-side consensus expectations suggest that 2025 will see broader earnings delivery, which should help support the typical stock. While investors will typically pay a premium for earnings growth when it is scarce, the opposite also tends to occur when earnings growth is more abundant. Put differently, we anticipate that investors will embrace cheaper areas of the market like value, small and mid caps, i.e., the average stock, in the coming year as earnings delivery broadens. Although this dynamic is highly anticipated and reflected in consensus estimates, we believe it is not fully priced into share prices after being deferred repeatedly in recent quarters. As a result, fulfillment could help investors move toward the \u201cshow me\u201d moment for relative outperformance. For 2025, the outlook for the U.S. economy remains healthy as many of the foundational elements of U.S. economic exceptionalism remain intact. The economy could also be helped along by a rebound in one of its laggard areas over the last two years \u2014 manufacturing. ISM New Orders surged in January to 55.1, the highest reading since mid-2022. However, this indicator could prove fickle in the coming months as some of the pickup in orders likely represents a pulling-forward of activity in anticipation of rising tariffs. Tariffs represent another potential catalyst for market leadership, and they may be undergoing their own \u201cshow me\u201d moment. The prospect of rising tariffs is not unknown to investors; instead, what is unknown is when, where and on what products they will be levied. As we have seen in recent days, these risks have not been fully discounted by equity investors. Importantly, the implementation of tariffs could prove to be another potential catalyst for a U.S. equity leadership rotation given the outsize share of sales the largest companies in the benchmark derive from overseas. Specifically, the Magnificent Seven stocks generate 55% of their revenues from outside the U.S., a substantially larger share than the rest of the benchmark at 35% or small and mid cap benchmarks, which are below 25%. With a healthy economic backdrop, corporate profits are likely to hold up and provide broad support for equities. Current conditions suggest that leadership over the next several years is likely to look different than the past several as elevated concentration is unwound. While the specific catalyst(s) will only be known in hindsight \u2014 for instance, will a hot January inflation reading end the Fed\u2019s easing cycle, a major support for small caps \u2014 this dynamic leads us, in the intermediate term, to continue to favor the equal-weighted S&P 500 relative to the cap-weighted, value relative to growth, and small and mid caps relative to large. Portfolio diversification from both a cap and style perspective should benefit as a result.

Shotsy has raised $2.25 million in seed funding to ramp up marketing and grow its team, the startup tells Business Insider exclusively. April Underwood of Adverb Ventures led the round, while Coalition Operators, Springbank Collective, and angel investor Esther Dyson participated.               The excitement around weight-loss drugs has both Big Pharma and Silicon Valley chasing the Wegovy wave. The telehealth unicorn startup Virta Health recently began prescribing Ozempic for weight loss in a push toward profitability. Omada Health, which works with employers and health plans to deliver better care to people with type 2 diabetes, said employer interest in its weight-loss program is behind its latest growth spurt. And on Super Bowl Sunday, ads for junk food and beer shared airtime with a controversial Hims & Hers spot promoting its version of the popular weight-loss drug.               But even as startups rush to capitalize on this supersized market, there hasn't been a basic app for tracking medication use. Beckett knows this firsthand.               Beckett, 43, said she's struggled with her weight for years and cycled through diets like keto and Weight Watchers. She became curious about Ozempic after reading about these drugs in the news. Thirteen months ago, she began using Zepbound, an injectable branded to treat obesity.               Beckett kicked her Dr. Pepper habit almost overnight. As she lost weight, a bum ankle that had bothered her for years was no longer sensitive. She also noticed that she could think more clearly without the \"food noise.\"               She started tracking her weekly injections in the Notes app on her phone. Beckett noted that side effects like nausea peaked at different lengths of time after her shot, and by logging her doses, she could estimate when she would feel ill and plan accordingly. She also tracked her injection sites to make sure she rotated body areas and how much weight she lost per shot.               But the Notes app left her wanting. So she built an app, saying that her fading obsession with food gave her more energy on nights and weekends to code.               Beckett also became active on a Reddit group for Zepbound users. She invited other members to take the app for a test drive. The excitement was palpable, and the feedback poured in.               \"Nobody else was providing any tools for specifically GLP-1 users,\" Beckett said. \"So it was really exciting for all of us in the community to feel seen.\"               Shotsy saw 3,000 downloads in the first 24 hours after its App Store debut.               Still working full-time, Beckett used some of the subscription proceeds to hire a part-time designer to improve the app's look. The app continued to rack up downloads. She felt comfortable quitting her job when the app generated enough revenue to replace her software engineering salary.               \"It started to feel like I was missing out on an opportunity to do everything I wanted to do with Shotsy,\" Beckett said.               By chance, she ran into an engineer friend and gave him a demo while traveling through an airport on her return from a developer conference. He asked to connect her to some investors, including Underwood, the former Slack head of product.               Shotsy clicked with the investor for a few reasons. It tapped into an emerging market that Swiss bank UBS says could eclipse 40 million people by 2029. Shotsy was the first to market with an app consumers were craving, as evidenced by the Reddit love. And it had a founder solving a problem she understood from experience.               \"She needed it, she built it. It's gotten incredible traction as a side hustle,\" Underwood said. \"She now has cash in the bank that allows her to build a team around her that is going to be able to extend the capabilities of the app to make it more useful and stickier, reach more audiences, and address more needs.\"               Beckett said Shotsy has only scratched the surface of its product road map, but she didn't comment on what that may include. Ashley Mayer, a general partner at Coalition Operators who led its Shotsy investment, said that the most important thing Shotsy can do now is create a product that users love.               \"If you earn people's trust and you accompany them on a journey that is life-changing and emotional,\" said Mayer, Glossier's former communications boss, \"you earn the right to build other experiences for them or help them in other ways.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"By\u00a0         Scott Neuman                        A Joann retail store seen here in Arlington Heights, Ill., on Jan. 15 is among the outlets slated for closure.                                                           Nam Y. Huh\/AP                                       hide caption  Joann, the fabric and craft chain, plans to close about 500 stores across the country \u2014 more than 60% of its retail outlets \u2014 as slumping sales and declining market share have forced the company into its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in less than a year. The company, known for fabric by the yard and its variety of yarns, said in a statement that it is seeking court authority to shutter stores in nearly every state, with California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio among the states with the most closures.  \"This was a very difficult decision to make, given the major impact we know it will have on our Team Members, our customers and all of the communities we serve,\" it said. \"Right-sizing our store footprint is a critical part of our efforts to ensure the best path forward for JOANN.\" In March last year, the Hudson, Ohio-based company filed for bankruptcy protection, reporting about $1 billion in long-term debt. At the time, however, it said its 800 stores would remain open. Last month, the company announced yet another bankruptcy filing, saying the move was in preparation to sell the company. Retail analyst Neil Saunders said that going into the first bankruptcy, Joann's debt levels were already unsustainable. \"Into the second bankruptcy, the debt levels had been reduced and the debt had been restructured, but it was still quite punishing,\" he said. Saunders, who is managing director of GlobalData, said Joann also struggled to maintain inventory, as suppliers became increasingly reluctant to do business with a company that looked in trouble. \"A lot of stores were very shabby,\" Saunders said. \"There were a lot of out of stocks and of course, that just trains customers to go elsewhere.\" As a result, Joann has lost market share to online retailers and bricks-and-mortar competitors such as Hobby Lobby and Michaels, he added. Hobby Lobby says it has about 1,000 stores in 48 states and employs around 46,000 workers. It reportedly took in $8 billion in revenue last year. Michaels says it has more than 1,200 stores in the U.S. and Canada. Neither company is publicly traded. In a statement announcing Joann's second bankruptcy filing on Jan. 15, interim CEO Michael Prendergast, acknowledged that \"the last several years have presented significant and lasting challenges in the retail environment, which, coupled with our current financial position and constrained inventory levels, forced us to take this step.\" \"After carefully reviewing all available strategic paths, we have determined that initiating a court-supervised sale process is the best course of action to maximize the value of the business. We hope that this process enables us to find a path that would allow JOANN to continue operating as a going concern,\" Prendergast said. Saunders, the retail analyst, said it was difficult to see how Joann could recover from its current troubles short of a buyout. \"It's a very unfortunate conclusion to a very long process of decline,\" he said. \"You can shut unprofitable locations, you can try to put the business back on a surer financial footing, but the end result is that you are then a much smaller business.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? It\u2019s no secret that Apple\u2019s AI efforts, especially on the iPhone, haven\u2019t quite managed to create a stir, neither in terms of capabilities, nor the pace of innovation. The company, however, has finally managed a breakthrough in one of its biggest markets, which is also the central part of its product manufacturing operations. Earlier today, Reuters reported that Apple has picked Chinese giant Alibaba to lead its AI efforts in the country. So far, iPhone and Mac users in China haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of the Apple Intelligence tech stack. That\u2019s due to the regulatory norms in China, which mandate a local partner to offer such services. So far, Apple hasn\u2019t been able to pick a partner for offering generative capabilities aboard its phones and computing devices. For the rest of the world, Apple Intelligence arrived months ago, featuring the company\u2019s own work with generative AI tools and some extra help from OpenAI\u2019s GPT stack. The deal with Alibaba is a crucial development for multiple reasons, as the company races to recover its slumping market share and stay competitive in the face of local rivals, including a resurgent Huawei. Apple was previously rumored to be in talks with other names such as Tencent and Baidu for serving AI features in China. \u201cApple has been very selective. They talked to a number of companies in China, and in the end they choose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones,\u201d Joseph Tasi, chairperson of Alibaba Group, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. There is no word whether Alibaba will remain Apple\u2019s sole AI development partner for the Chinese market. Elsewhere, despite its deal with OpenAI, Apple is reportedly open to the idea of bringing Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude to the Apple Intelligence ecosystem. Alibaba is no small fish in the AI pond. Merely a couple of weeks ago, the company released its Qwen 2.5 AI model. The company said it not only outpaces the buzzy new AI agent that is DeepSeek, but also the recent models from Silicon Valley AI titans like OpenAI and Meta. \u201cQwen 2.5-Max outperforms almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B,\u201d the company claimed in an official statement, as per Reuters. According to Hugging Face, Qwen powers the world\u2019s top ten open-source large language models (LLMs). AI is a huge deal in China, especially in the context of smartphone innovation. \u201cMainland China\u2019s AI-capable smartphone market experienced a remarkable 591% year-on-year growth in devices shipped in Q3 2024,\u201d says a Canalys report. Every major smartphone player in China \u2014 including Xiaomi, Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo \u2014 now offers on-device as well as cloud-based implementation of AI features. The idea is not too different from how you experience on-device Gemini Nano on Google Pixel phones and the Galaxy AI stack on Samsung devices such as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Speedy progress with optimizing these on-device AI models, reduction in costs, and improved performance have played a key role in democratizing AI smartphone features in China. In fact, the players are adopting closed as well as open-source ecosystems, which further picks up the pace for innovation. The best example of China\u2019s rapid progress in the AI field is DeepSeek, which sent the US-based AI companies into a frenzy and wiped billions of dollars from the stock market in one go. Of course, it was also quickly adopted by smartphone makers such as Honor. At the same time, a robust policy framework and focus on privacy have only encouraged local smartphone brands to embrace AI in China. Apple is following a similar approach to Apple Intelligence. But its deal with Alibaba could be beneficial for Apple customers across the world. Thanks to their quick adoption of AI, Chinese smartphone labels have been able to build AI-driven experiences at a rapid pace. From fun media editing to productivity tools for calls and connected computing, the progress has been quite impressive to witness. Apple\u2019s deal with Alibaba could very well offer a template for quicker AI feature development. Once that wheel starts spinning, the company would simply have to load those tricks atop the AI models it is already using with Apple Intelligence for the rest of the world. If you\u2019re looking for the best AI experience on a phone, chances are two different AI makers come to mind. For the iPhone 16, Apple Intelligence is the answer, while for Pixel 9 series \u2014 and the best Android phones \u2014 it\u2019s Google\u2019s Gemini. Of course, you can also download Gemini as a standalone app on the iPhone, but Apple Intelligence is the default AI option. Both companies offer a range of nearly identical features, at least in what they promise to offer, but there are also nuanced differences. Google Gemini is mostly focused on using AI to help you create, edit, and generate content. In contrast, Apple Intelligence focuses more on personal use cases and integration across a range of apps. Apple\u2019s ambitions of serving a reliable AI experience on iPhones are off to a rough start. The BBC recently highlighted how one of the new Apple Intelligence features that summarizes notification alerts has been making up news and serving misleading information. The company is now making a course correction with the latest iOS beta update, which disables AI notification summaries for news apps, and makes a host of other preventive changes. The update in question is 18.3 Beta 3, and it is now widely available for testers. Here's what to expect. Changing the tone New research into smartphone shipments shows Apple remains the top brand for market share worldwide, but it has slipped in China, a crucial market, and the blame likely lies in its inability to launch Apple Intelligence there. Apple will take solace in its 23% market share worldwide at the end of 2024, according to the numbers from analysts IDC, which although down from the end of 2023, is still far ahead of rival Samsung in second position with 15% market share.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  The benefits of marriage aren't just limited to tax advantages. It's easier for married people to buy a house, too. According to Redfin, nearly 70% of single people struggle to afford rent or mortgage payments. For married couples, that number is significantly lower, at 52%.          Just because you're single doesn't mean you're alone in experiencing this struggle. A growing number of Americans are in the same boat. Rising housing costs have resulted in rent or mortgage payments eating away at Americans' budgets. For married people, having two incomes gives them a leg up in the housing market, but single people have to shoulder the burden of rising living costs by themselves.               However, there's no need for single people to panic \u2014 some states are easier than others for solo buyers to get their foot in the door.               Online loan marketplace LendingTree analyzed US Census Bureau data and found the states with the highest levels of homeownership for single men and women. Single women, in particular, might have an advantage in the housing market, as LendingTree found that they owned 11.1 million homes nationwide, compared to 8.4 million for single men. That means in the US, single women and men own 13% and 9.8% of owner-occupied homes, respectively.               Regardless of gender, the top housing markets for single men and women are typically in states with low population density and economies driven by a combination of energy, manufacturing, and various natural resources. New Mexico is the top state for single women homeownership. For men, it's North Dakota.               Tanner Schock, a real-estate agent from Minot, North Dakota, believes that a combination of cheap housing costs and job opportunities make the state particularly attractive to homebuyers.               North Dakota's cost of living is almost 9% lower than the national average, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center.               \"Out west, we have oil fields, and a lot of people actually come from out of state to North Dakota to work in the oil and gas industry,\" Schock told BI. \"In the Minot area, we have an Air Force base as well.\"               These industries tend to have a higher proportion of men relative to women, which could explain why male homeownership is high in the state, Schock said.               Nationwide, one explanation for the higher number of single women homeowners could be due to women's earnings catching up to men's, according to LendingTree. Another factor could be that since women typically live longer than men, there could be a higher proportion of women who became single homeowners after their spouse died, LendingTree said.               Listed below are the top three housing markets for single women and men homeownership and the median home price for each, according to Redfin. For context, the median home price across the US is $427,670.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  A startup developing efficient AI chips has secured $100 million in a funding round led by investment firm Tiger Global.          California-based EnCharge AI, founded in 2022, has created an in-memory computing AI chip that it claims provides a twenty-fold improvement in energy efficiency.               This allows inference computation \u2014 when AI makes predictions based on new data \u2014 to take place outside the cloud and on local devices. As a result, advanced AI applications wouldn't always have to be powered by data centers and could instead be performed on smaller computers and edge devices.               The startup's product is a commercial expansion of research from its CEO, Naveen Verma, which explored non-volatile memory devices \u2014 a type of memory that holds stored information even when its source of power is removed. This, in theory, makes devices more energy-efficient as they don't need to consume power in order to retain information.               Other computing architectures don't use in-memory techniques, which can make devices unsuitable for running AI calculations because it takes too much time and energy to move data back and forth between memory and processing units. EnCharge's in-memory chips use static random-access memory, or SRAM, to improve compute efficiency.               The hardware can be deployed for everything from automotive sensing to smart retail and industrial robotics.               The Series B was led by Tiger Global, with participation from Maverick Silicon, Capital TEN, SIP Global Partners, Zero Infinity Partners, CTBC VC, Vanderbilt University, Morgan Creek Digital, and others.                Previous investors backing the round include RTX Ventures and Anzu Partners, among others. It brings the startup's total funding to around $144 million.               EnCharge is also working with semiconductor giant TSMC to refine its first-generation commercial chips.               With the fresh funding, the startup said it would bring its AI accelerator solutions to market.       Check out the pitch deck it used to secure the fresh funding.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Last year was an awkward time in gaming. There was a significant shortage of big-name games dropping into players\u2019 laps, but Sony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PlayStation brand rode high on several unexpected hits, namely Astro Bot and Helldivers 2. Most surprisingly, Sony said that PlayStation consoles sold well through 2024. We have to hope the company learns the right lessons. Based on the exec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent statements, it seems like it\u2019s learning at least half of what it should have gleaned from 2024. On Thursday, Sony released its third quarterly financial report on sales through Dec. 31, 2025. In that quarter, the Japanese tech giant sold 9.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles, bringing its total sales to 74.5 million. Sony launched the PS5 in 2020, its best quarter ever, at least in sales. The report doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t note the percentage of the new PlayStation 5 Pro. Still, industry analysts have said that the $700 Pro-level console\u00c2\u00a0was doing well\u00c2\u00a0despite its high price. As noted by EuroGamer, the PS5 sales were just shy of what the PlayStation 4 sold in the same number of months. The gravy train keeps on rolling. Sony reported that games and console sales were up by 16% year-over-year. The company further claimed that over 40% of those who bought a console last quarter were new to the PS5. The number of users and overall playtime were up as well. Part of this can be attributed to the games. Sony specifically cited Astro Bot and Helldivers 2 and said they wanted to expand into more \u00e2\u0080\u009ctitles for families and live service games.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Astro Bot wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just a family game; it was a really good game that even had Reggie Fils-Aim\u00c3\u00a9, the former president of Nintendo of America, telling the audience at the New York Game Awards how it \u00e2\u0080\u009calmost outdid Nintendo at its own game.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helldivers 2 was another unexpected treat. It was a live service game that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obsess over nickel and dining consumers. More than that, it had a solid gameplay loop with a unique and refreshing satirical tone. Game executives largely have money on their minds, and they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look beyond the line going up to understand why games or consoles do well. There is nothing wrong with more family games on PS5, but Astro Bot proved that good games still sell. If Sony is thinking about more \u00e2\u0080\u009clive service\u00e2\u0080\u009d games, it should also take a lesson from the travesty of the hero shooter Concord. Players don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just want another multiplayer co-op shooter; they want a good game. There is a continuing lack of first-party, middle-market games that cost less, making them normally cheaper for consumers. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require all the graphical finesse of a big-budget title, but players enjoy them all the same. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good thing Sony is continuing to back Astro Bot. PlayStation announced Thursday it was adding even more levels to the platformer. A sequel is almost guaranteed at this point. We want to see more good games. Sony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first State of Play for 2025, shown late Wednesday, was a dry affair. We\u00c2\u00a0hoped to see a new trailer for\u00c2\u00a0Ghost of Y\u00c5\u008dtei,\u00c2\u00a0Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, or anything\u00e2\u0080\u0094regarding that upcoming Wolverine game from Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man developer Insomniac. So there weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t many surprises, though at least players received an already-leaked trailer for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, set to release Aug. 28. We also have a date for Borderlands 4 (Sept. 23). The indie slate is looking interesting, at the very least. The State of Play featured some intriguing trailers for Hell is Us and Saros, the latter of which was made by Returnal devs at Housemarque. We may not see those games in 2025, and the anticipated Onimusha: Way of the Sword won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive until next year. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if a new Sonic Racer CrossWorlds will be able to compete against Nintendo for its upcoming Switch 2 Mario Kart sequel. There are some good games coming to PlayStation 5 this year, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait a while to see if any of them are more unexpected gems. Then again, maybe none of this matters. If Grand Theft Auto VI rolls around this year as promised, it will outsell any and all of these games by a wide margin.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Hertz (HTZ-9.39%) is paying the price for unloading its Teslas. Shares sank Friday by more than 10% after Hertz announced it had completed selling off its glut of 30,000 electric vehicles.  In 2021, the company had been all-in on EVs, declaring them a safe, fuel-free bet on the future and committing to stocking 100,000 of them. But the company quickly ran into the buzzsaw of tepid customer demand, depreciation, and higher-than-expected maintenance costs. Hertz endured a brutal fourth quarter, with revenue cratering by 7% from the previous year. On Thursday, the company pinned the decline on ongoing adjustments in its fleet strategy, including a completed reduction of 30,000 electric vehicles, mainly Telsas, along with a few Polestars.  Hertz stock fell more than 10% on Thursday, to about $3.80 per share. The company isn\u2019t completely unplugging from EVs, according to CEO Gil West. \u201cMoving forward, we recognize the strategic value of EVs in the markets with established product market fit and infrastructure, particularly in our Rideshare business where drivers receive advantageous partner incentives for choosing EVs over traditional ICE vehicles,\u201d West said. West joined the company in July 2024 and has set about implementing a new strategy. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve taken the necessary actions to turn the page on the past and set Hertz up for ongoing success. While there is still a lot of work to do, we are already seeing encouraging signs of progress as we\u2019ve implemented fundamental changes which have laid the foundation to transform our company,\u201d West said of his first months as CEO. A company spokesperson told Quartz that the company would continue to sell EVs through its normal retail channels. Todd Cassidy, managing director and lead of the automotive and aftermarket investment banking group at Brown Gibbons Lang & Company, said that on the long road to electrification, Hertz\u2019s misstep is just a blip, but in the short-term it is a setback. \u201cIn the near term, it is a negative headwind for EVs,\u201d Cassidy said, adding that flooding the market with lower-priced EVs creates price pressure everywhere. Cassidy said the Hertz experience highlights the lack of infrastructure for EVs and the public\u2019s underwhelming appetite for them.

I've loved racing games for years, dating back to the days of Gran Turismo on PlayStation 2. \u2022 The good\u2022 The bad\u2022 Final thoughts I remember racing my dad on rally tracks for hours and having the time of my life. He was never much of a gamer, but in those moments, he was. Because of those heartfelt moments, racing has always held a special place in my heart. That brings us to the modern technology of today. Racing simulation wheels and peripherals are at an all-time peak. With new competitors rarely entering the field, it's an exciting time to see a company like Turtle Beach take the dive. Their launch of the VelocityOne racing wheel went well for the company's first time, and now they've launched a shifter to expand their racing collection. Introducing the VelocityOne Multi-Shift. A premium racing shifter that can be used as a 7-speed H-pattern or sequential shifter. With multiple knobs, a high\/low switch for upwards of 14-gears, hall effect actuation, and more, this Xbox and Windows PC shifter is hitting the ground running. I've been gaming and playing on PCs and consoles for 30 years. I've been racing since the PlayStation 2 era and was once a top 100 driver in games like Test Drive Unlimited 2 and Forza Motorsport. Racing has, and always will be part of me. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Turtle Beach. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.  \u2022 Price: $129.99 at Amazon\u2022 Dimensions: 206 x 133 x 148mm \/ 8.11 x 5.24 x 5.83in\u2022 Weight: 1.76kg \/ 3.88lbs\u2022 Features: Seven-speed gearbox, on-the-fly sequential mode switch, handbrake mode, high and low range gear button, hall-effect magnetic technology, versatile mounting options, swappable shift knobs, PC and Xbox connectivity. There's a lot to like about the VelocityOne Multi-Shift. That didn't come as a surprise to me, given Turtle Beach has always had a reputation where they build upon their previous release, no matter what product line they're working on. That resounding push for excellence has penetrated their racing wheel peripheral department. Let's start with the knob and shaft options; there are multiple styles to choose from that all come included in the box. Inside you'll find three different lengths and two different knob styles; an everyday car look and a grip that fits the class of a genuine race car. Each of them fits those definitions well. I much prefer the longer stick to the shorter one, but I've always preferred things like longer thumb sticks or a more oversized mouse pad. The general idea is that the greater the range of motion, the better the precision. While shifts should be quick, fast, and repetitive, meaning precision is less necessary, I found that sticking with the same style best suits my preferences for racing, 18-wheeling, and drifting. The option to switch from sequential to H-pattern shifting on the fly was fantastic. There was no need to fiddle with extra options in the menu or reset key binds. A flick of the switch was literally all I needed to do to switch over. There's also another switch that doubles the number of gears. A high\/low switch is present on the top face of the VelocityOne Multi-Shift to allow the H-pattern shifter to hit up to 14 gears. Hitting the button will swap from the first seven gears over to the remaining seven. An excellent option for 18-wheeling enthusiasts like myself.  The added hall-effect magnetic technology lifts the entire experience. Knowing that specific mechanical components won't break down over time because they are being replaced by magnetic tech is soothing. While it's been most beneficial to gamers in controllers, Hall-effect technology is the real deal and provides unparalleled, lasting components. I mentioned that the VelocityOne Multi-Shift had a sequential mode, but I didn't discuss the sequential brake option! A simple button press turns the sequential mode into an analog hand brake, which provides phenomenally precise braking control. I loved using it to drift in ways I have never been able to do with standard hand brakes or pedal brakes. There's something far more manageable and controllable when using a proper hand brake to glide. You'll feel the power of a real drifter in the palm of your hand. Heck, get two, and you'll have both the analog brake and a shifter! The mounting features are also rock solid. It more than dealt with my desk via the clamp and racing rig with screws. No matter the setup, the Multi-Shift was stable throughout the entire experience, as if it were mounted right in my car.  Not everything is perfect, and neither is the VelocityOne Multi-Shift. While my complaints are narrow and few, they're still worth discussing. Let's break down what might hold potential buyers back. First, I have a small issue with sequential mode. While it's terrific in its own right, and I appreciate the fact I can switch between the two modes, it does come with a small hitch. Said hitch is literal, depending on use. If you're an aggressive player who pulls inside or pushes out during a shift, you might notice the shaft dragging across the opening of the closed H-pattern. Essentially, the sequential mode makes use of the third and fourth gear slots, the two gear options in the standard middle of the H-pattern. When sliding from the third slot down to the fourth, it's possible you'll notice the neutral slide opening on either side towards the left or right. It's small but noticeable if you're overly aggressive in your shifting style. For my own purposes, I didn't have an issue with it since my playstyle is more direct and on point. I just know there might be some folks who want to know about it, so I'm putting it out there. My last complaint is the leather encasement. I wish there was an option to remove the leather sleeve and reveal the underside of the H-pattern. While I'm sure it's nothing extraordinary, I'd like the option to unveil a more gearhead look on a device that otherwise seems to be all about possibilities.  \u2705 You want an affordable, next-gear feeling shifterI can't get over how good this device feels. Coming from the days of old Logitech shifters, it really ups the ante for what gamers should expect in a package for around $100. \u2705 If you can't decide between an H-pattern shifter, sequential, or analog brake.This thing does everything you'll want from a shifter unit. Even things you didn't know you wanted, like analog braking. If you're looking for features and want to get multiple experiences from one device, this is it. \u274c You're looking for the most premium experience. There's higher-end gear available, but that's not what Turtle Beach is aiming for. They're looking to tackle the entry and mid-level markets without breaking the bank. Landing affordable features in the hands of gamers. \u274c You want the best-performing H-pattern shifter or sequential The VelocityOne is tackling both worlds for the price of one and does a fantastic job of doing so. However, if you're just after a sequential shifter, you can pick up some cheaper modules that will match the performance of the Multi-Shift for less. Honestly, the VelocityOne Multi-Shift surprised me. The device is a near-perfect fit for any serious racing rig, both small and big. The fact that it can be used with any system on a Windows PC makes it all the more worthy for someone who may change up their wheel experience on the fly. I have a few friends with more than one wheel they use depending on what they're playing, making the multi-use Multi-Shift all the more remarkable. For its price range, the VelocityOne Multi-Shift can't be beat. I'm extremely happy to see Turtle Beach continue crafting their VeloctyOne racing lineup. After some initial launch hurdles with the racing wheel, the triumph of the Multi-Shift is welcoming for the future of the series. Keep it up, Turtle Beach; you're doing great.   A great shifter that will bring Xbox and Windows PC gamers up a gear. If you're in the market for a premium shifter and can't decide between an H-pattern or sequential, get the best of both worlds with the VelocityOne Multi-Shift. It'll come in clutch.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell last week as employers continue to retain workers despite resurgent inflation and elevated interest rates U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell last week as employers continue to retain workers despite resurgent inflation and elevated interest rates. The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits fell by 7,000 to 213,000 for the week ending February 8, the Labor Department said Thursday. Analysts projected that 215,000 new applications would be filed. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered representative of layoffs. The four-week average, which smooths out some of the week-to-week volatility, inched down by 1,000 to 216,000. Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. Last week, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 143,000 jobs in January, significantly fewer than December\u2019s 256,000 job gains. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to an even 4%, signaling a still very healthy labor market. Late in January, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate alone after issuing three cuts late in 2024. Fed officials are closely monitoring inflation and the labor market for signs of a potentially weakening economy. They expect only two rate cuts this year, down from previous projections of four. However, after Wednesday\u2019s consumer prices report that showed inflation accelerated last month, many experts believe the Fed may not be moved to cut rates at all this year.  The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, up from a 3 1\/2 year low of 2.4% in September. The new data shows that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s 2% target for roughly the past six months after it fell steadily for about a year and a half. Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, a host of companies have announced job cuts already this year. Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025. Late in 2024, GM, Boeing, Cargill and Stellantis announced layoffs. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of February 1 fell to 1.85 million, a decrease of 36,000 from the previous week. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Intel has struggled to find its footing in a silicon landscape dominated by NVIDIA, but the Trump administration's \"America first\" approach might have thrown the chip maker a big lifeline.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Intel has not had a good few years, but things might be looking up for the beleaguered chip maker. Over the past year, Intel has laid off thousands upon thousands of staff, following its disastrous attempts to build a home-grown chip fabrication business, typically known as Intel Foundry. The firm saw its valuation practically wiped out over the past few years as a result, with its market cap shrinking to lows not seen since the mid 90s. Investors have largely been placing their bets on NVIDIA in the artificial intelligence wars, given that the server technology built by the firm has become the de facto default for building generative AI platforms. Microsoft, Meta, xAI, and others have placed orders in the multi-billions for chips from NVIDIA for their data centers, leaving Intel and AMD in the dust. However, the political landscape might just be turning in Intel's favor. At the recent Paris AI summit led by France, U.S. Vice President JD Vance shared some interesting comments during his speech (via Barron), which seem to have excited investors. \u201cThe Trump administration believes AI will have countless revolutionary applications in economic innovation, job creation, national security, healthcare, free expression and beyond. [...] To safeguard America\u2019s advantage the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American designed and manufactured chips.\"  Indeed, the United States has been trying to limit dependence on countries like Taiwan and China for building out its AI aspirations. Both the Democrats, and Republicans have lobbied to build home-grown semiconductor solutions, to reduce the dependence on TSMC. The firm produces some 90%+ of the world's most sought-after chips, and the Trump administration has targeted Taiwan with tariffs in an attempt to force businesses to consider home-grown solutions instead.  JD Vance's comments were seen by many investors as a positive sign of more support for Intel, which remains a significant player in the space. Intel might have missed out on opportunities to be a bigger player with smartphones, server tech, and graphics processing, but it is enjoying a lot of home-grown support via the CHIPS act, which allocated billions in funding to United States-based companies. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. For the United States and other western countries, artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as a national security issue. Indeed, lots of western tech firms saw their stock prices battered when a Chinese start up, with its DeepSeek model, seemed to reproduce OpenAI's ChatGPT results for far cheaper. The first countries to really achieve true \"AGI\" in sci-fi terms could see rapid advancement in technological breakthroughs, with computers able to understand context and experiment far more rapidly than humans. To that end, the Paris AI Action Summit aimed to draw nations into an agreement to regulate AI development, to focus on making it \"open, ethical, safe, and secure,\" given the potential the technology has to actually do serious harm to humanity as well. The United States and United Kingdom buddied up to refuse signing the act. JD Vance criticized the regulations, saying that it would \"kill an industry that is just starting to take off,\" while a UK government spokesperson said \"it didn't provide enough practical clarity.\" Jez Corden is the Executive Editor at Windows Central, focusing primarily on all things Xbox and gaming.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Meta is bleeding talent and money at an unprecedented rate to achieve its goals.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The next round of Meta layoffs began this week, with an estimated 5% staff reduction count topping out around 4,000 people. Many employees received notification earlier this week, giving them an hour to assemble any last-minute correspondence before access was cut off. Hot on the heels of the layoff is news that Meta is rapidly rehiring many of these positions, per Business Insider, pivoting them to AI development. Meta's latest earnings show it's still mainly an ad-driven company, with over 3.3 billion people being served ads in some capacity across the company's many platforms. AI, it's said, will be the next major way to deliver ads in a more profound, personalized way. But the amount of money Meta plans to spend on AI development in 2025 is staggering. Zuckerberg told investors the company plans to spend upwards of $65 billion on AI this year, citing it as a key component of the company's future revenue strategy. To put that in perspective, Meta has spent roughly $60 billion on its Reality Labs division since 2019. Now, Meta wants to spend another $5 billion more than that on AI in one-fifth of the time. It's a huge shift in a company that has been spending billions on products and R&D over years, not months.  Meta is looking to spend $5 billion more on AI in a single year than it has on Reality Labs in five years, and that screams of desperation. While Reality Labs has cost Meta lots of money over the years, the group has been turning healthy revenue numbers since 2020, which could outpace spending if Meta cuts down on R&D costs. Thus far, Reality Labs has offset its 5-year costs by pulling in nearly $10 billion in revenue. The revenue guidance for Reality Labs is straightforwar,d as the company mainly profits from the sales of devices, services, and apps sold on the Meta Horizon digital marketplace. But the way Meta makes money on Meta AI isn't nearly as clear or straightforward. Meta has been injecting AI into every product and service it has, from products like Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and the Meta Quest 3 to apps like Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg told investors last April that Meta AI will primarily make the company money through ad revenue. As Stratechery notes, this is done through enhanced machine learning techniques \u2014 using AI to better understand Meta's customer base and serve even more personalized ads to it \u2014 as well as generative visuals targeted toward specific customers. In other words, Meta AI is being used as an ad delivery vehicle, not a product in the traditional sense. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android  Meta AI is being used as a way to deliver more personalized ads to customers, helping to ensure the company's leadership in the ad space. But Meta's strategy for getting AI into its products feels disconnected. Thousands of Meta employees are now jobless after receiving positive performance reviews, made even worse by the company publicly calling them \"low performers.\" Everyone from Instagram product designers to fledgling data engineers and even longer-term product counselors are part of the layoffs, and many cite having received no warning ahead of yesterday's notice. It's true that Zuckerberg did give some advanced notice of upcoming layoffs, but the CEO said that the company would be laying off \"low performers\" during January 29th's earnings call \u2014 not employees that just received positive performance reviews. The surprise is deepened further by the company's earning reports, which showed a record $48 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the previous year. Per internal memos obtained by Business Insider, managers were to identify between 12% and 15% of their employees to be labeled as \"low performers.\" This comes after the previous round of layoffs in October 2024, cutting each of the company's departments by another 7-10% to meet the goals outlined by Zuckerberg. Employees who spoke with Business Insider noted that a culture of anxiety and fear had swept through the company.  Meta's strategy going forward is to blitz-hire AI engineers in place of employees who were just laid off. To make matters worse, Zuckerberg said that the company would be \"backfilling these roles this year,\" meaning folks laid off this week will likely have their roles replaced by the year's end. It screams short-term thinking without considering long-term repercussions, something the tech industry has been guilty of as it began mass layoffs across the sector a few years ago. It's said that Meta's strategy now is to blitz-hire AI engineers to ensure the company is a leader in the AI space. Our current understanding of the company's strategy is that the backfilled roles will pivot to AI development instead of their previous scope, ensuring that Meta's upcoming hires are laser-focused on the company's latest goal. Meta's CFO, Susan Li, directly addressed the hiring process in the recent earnings call. \"In 2025, we expect headcount growth will continue to be primarily driven by technical roles across our priority initiatives within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative AI, as well as regulation and compliance. We anticipate headcount growth in our business functions will remain relatively limited.\" This leaves even more uncertainty in the wake of several rounds of layoffs during 2023 and 2024 despite Meta labeling only 2023 as the \"year of efficiency.\" Now, even good employees with a track record of excellence are being replaced to further a single, specific goal.  While Meta's strategy seems dubious from many angles, the company deserves credit for its generous severance packages. Impacted folks were given \"16 weeks of pay and an additional two weeks for every year of service,\" according to two folks who spoke with Business Insider. A similar amount of severance pay was offered to laid-off workers during several other rounds of lay-offs, according to people I had previously spoken with. If profits only continue to go up, isn't it madness to get rid of the people who made that possible? IT certainly seems so to me. And Meta's moves are certainly helping stock owners profit from a heightened valuation. Meta stock is up 200 points (roughly 40%) since October when the latest string of layoffs began. If anything, the company's strategy is resonating well with investors who believe the company to be on the right track. But how much of this will come back to bite Meta in the proverbial butt? Ousting employees with positive performance reviews feels underhanded unless decisions are being made for financial reasons. Given how well Meta has been doing and how much money the company continues to rake in, this is certainly not the case. Bleeding talent is a huge problem across the tech sector and certainly not siloed to Meta, but one wonders why the company can't simply hire more AI engineers and keep the rest of the employees onboard during the process. After all, if profits only continue to go up, isn't it madness to get rid of the people who made that possible? It certainly seems so to me.

Hong Kong held up better than Mainland China as markets experienced another day of likely profit taking as up sectors from Wednesday\u2019s session were mostly lower. Meanwhile, both markets experienced a rotation into value stocks and sectors. Hong Kong\u2019s volumes, however, remained elevated as turnover increased +30% from yesterday and Mainland investors were net sellers via Southbound Stock Connect. The animated film \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d broke record at the box office in China, leading its maker the A-share (Mainland) listed Beijing Enlight Media to gain +20% overnight. The movie\u2019s success is leading to speculation that AI-powered animation techniques were used to make the movie and these techniques could have a profound impact on the animated film industry. Baidu, up +5%, released some upgrades to its ERNIE bot large language model, including a tool called Deep Search, which will add multimedia inputs and outputs.

China\u2019s State Railway Group has announced plans to create trains that are specifically designed for the elderly. The idea is to make it easier and more comfortable for the elderly to travel by train, unlocking more of their spending power. These trains would come with predefined touristic routes and comprehensive onboard services, including medical care facilities. So far this year, Southbound Stock Connect flows into Hong Kong from Mainland investors have been heavily geared towards growth and technology stocks. Specifically, stocks in the Information Technology sector have accounted for 17% and those in the Communication Services sector have accounted for 38% of the flow, for a total of 55% of flows. We saw this trend coming with the addition of Alibaba\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares to the program in September of last year. As such, the rally in technology and growth stocks, driven primarily by AI optimism, has been largely driven by local (Mainland) investors, as Southbound flows have accounted for nearly one-third of Hong Kong turnover in many trading days. Foreign investors\u2019 flows have been light and there is evidence that they, overall, still prefer U.S. equities. The unwinding of this trade could be a catalyst moving forward. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed lower by -0.20% and -0.87%, respectively, on volume that increased +32% from Wednesday. Mainland investors sold a net -$131 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs overnight via Southbound Stock Connect. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Discretionary, which gained +0.80%, Consumer Staples, which gained +0.64%, and Utilities, which gained +0.16. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Information Technology, which fell -4.99%, Real Estate, which fell -2.43%, and Health Care, which fell -1.66%. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board all closed lower by -0.42%, -0.77%, and -2.31%, respectively. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Staples, which gained +2.42%, Utilities, which gained +0.48%, and Industrials, which gained +0.33%.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Police said the driver was detained at the scene. LONDON -- Munich police said at least 30 people, including several children, were injured after a \"vehicle drove into a group of people\" in the center of the city on Thursday morning. \"The driver was able to be secured on site and currently poses no further danger,\" police said in a post in German on social media. The incident is being treated as a \"suspected attack,\" Bavarian state Premier Markus S\u00f6der told journalists. A 2-year-old child was critically wounded in the attack, according to a spokesperson for the Dr. von Hauner Children\u2019s Hospital. \"Doctors are currently fighting for the toddler's life,\" the spokesperson said. The suspect is a 24-year-old Afghan asylum-seeker residing in Munich on a valid residence permit, police said. The suspect was already known to police because he \u201cwas listed as a witness due to his previous work as a store detective,\u201d not because he was a known criminal, police said. Authorities have not yet suggested a motive or named the suspect. Florian Volm, a spokesperson for the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office, told ABC News that the Bavarian Central Office for Extremism and Terrorism of the Attorney General's Office is \"investigating today's incident to find possible motives.\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he did not want to \"prejudge the results\" amid the ongoing investigation into the \"terrible attack.\" \"But our thoughts are with the victims and their families,\" he said. \"Some of the victims were very, very seriously injured.\" Police said the incident occurred in the area of Dachauer Street and Seidle Street in the heart of Munich, close to the city's central train station. The incident occurred at Stilgmaierplatz, where a rally organized by the Verdi trade union was taking place from 10:30 a.m. local time, police said. The event was accompanied by police and therefore officers were already on site. A Munich police spokesperson told ABC News that the suspect overtook a police vehicle with his car before accelerating and plowing into the back of the demonstration. Police believe he acted alone. Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter told reporters that \"many people have been injured, including children. I am deeply shocked. My thoughts are with the injured.\" \"The police have arrested the driver of the vehicle, but the exact circumstances are still unclear,\" Reiter added. Police said a \"major operation\" was underway, urging residents to avoid the area in order to assist emergency responders. Images from the scene showed police and medical responders working near a damaged vehicle surrounded by belongings and debris. Police cordoned off the area of the incident as helicopters circled above. Police have not identified the suspect or the vehicle involved. Thursday's vehicle crash came less than two months after a car plowed through a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing two people and injuring nearly 70 others, local officials said at the time.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Home tax deduction Have you refinanced your house recently? Me neither. Somehow, for our house it\u2019s already four years ago, though I can remember the transaction like it was yesterday. Full credit for the smart financial move to my wife, who asked about refi timing over (and over) and fortunately got it through my thick head before interest rates really started to rise. Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell was running the printing presses like crazy and long rates (mortgage included) would eventually lift from basement levels. When refi activity slows, it is bullish for elite 8.5%-yielding Rithm Capital (RITM). RITM, our old Contrarian Income Report friend, smartly purchased a stockpile of mortgage service rights (MSRs), which gain in value as rates grind sideways or up. We bought RITM for CIR in July 2021, shortly after my refi. At the time the stock was paying 7.6% and the company was sitting on a pile of MSRs smartly purchased for cheap by company founder Michael Nierenberger. Mortgage service rights (MSRs) are contracts that give the holder the right to collect payments from a borrower. These aren\u2019t the loans themselves; they are the rights to service these loans. A subtle but important difference. When we originally bought our house back in 2012, our bank flipped the servicing of our loan to Caliber Home Loans. Caliber collected our monthly payment and settled up with the lender. We made our payments on time (thank you autopay!) Caliber collected 0.25% of our monthly payment for, well, simply processing our payments. Our MSR was easy money. Our 2021 refi disrupted Caliber\u2019s gravy train. But with rates rising again in 2021, Caliber was due to see fewer loans \u201ccalled away\u201d via refinancing. Nierenberger saw this ahead of Wall Street. He announced plans to buy Caliber for cheap in April 2021, making RITM the largest owner of MSRs in the world. We bought the stock for CIR just in time for a 25% dividend raise, boosting our yield-on-cost from 7.6% to 9.5%. The current yield trended lower over the 3.5 years we owned it because buyers swarmed in, boosting the price and dropping the dividend on new money. We contrarians enjoyed 48% total returns, mostly as cash dividends\u2014a whopping $3.25 on a modest $10.46 purchase price! RITM Dividend I said \u201csell RITM\u201d in October as mortgage rates came down from 8% to nearly 6%. Lower rates were a potential problem for RITM if they led to increased refis. Fortunately for RITM, the dip did not last and the mortgage market remains moribund. Today, mortgage rates remain stubbornly high above 6% by post-financial-crisis standards. This means a comatose housing market and mortgage activity: Mortgage Rates Mortgage rates \u201cstuck\u201d high is great for RITM\u2019s stock. The company earned $0.60 in its most recent quarter, plenty to fund its generous $0.25 payout. Wall Street analysts expected only $0.44 in profits\u2014they are behind the curve. Those same blinders-on analysts don\u2019t get RITM\u2019s recent acquisition of Sculptor Asset Management, either. Sculptor brought in $34 billion in assets under management, providing another river of fees to complement the MSR stream. Hedge funds are starting to catch on to the dividend deal that is RITM. They added 2 million shares in the most recent quarter. These institutional players are \u201cstronger hands\u201d than vanilla individual investors and are likely to set a floor under the stock price.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"We've all heard tell that Samsung's foldables sales are suffering. So, is this the right time to launch the new multi-fold device?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Word on the streets is that Samsung's planning to launch a 'G Fold' multi-fold phone, also known as the \"double-folding\" foldable. This would expand the brand's current Galaxy Z family, going from a duo to a trio of diverse foldable form factors. Hurray for innovation, right? Well, based on rumors and alleged leaks from the weeks past, this seems counterproductive. In case you haven't heard already, purported reports about Samsung's foldable sales and production numbers started surfacing around late December 2024. The Galaxy S24 Ultra might be breaking records, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 are headed in the opposite direction. Apparently, Samsung's Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 series sales did not live up to the Korean smartphone maker's expectations. Based on this decline, Samsung is supposedly cutting down on production for the Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 series. An alleged reduction of roughly three million foldable units produced is no small feat. This doesn't bode well for Samsung's slice of the foldable market at all, especially when taking their original target of a 10% increase into account. And yet, the brand all but confirmed the multi-folding G Fold device at Galaxy Unpacked 2025.  This isn't the first time that Samsung has shown off its conceptual multi-fold phone. In fact, prototypes of the book-like Android device were shown off at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. What I am highly skeptical of at the moment isn't the existence of the device but rather the alleged release timeline. If the rumors are true and Samsung launches the G Fold in the second quarter of 2025, there will be three Galaxy foldables launching this year and around the same time. Furthermore, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 likely will not be very different from their predecessors, as other leaks have pointed out. In that case, it is highly likely that the downward trend in their sales will continue. Even with scaled-back Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 production, Samsung will then have the G Fold to consider. If people are losing interest in these expensive Android devices, who's to say the multi-fold will sell well? Sure, it'll garner interest from hobbyists and enthusiasts, but the exorbitant price tag will likely prevent many of them from actually buying one.  It's not like the larger, more innovative, and experimental G Fold multi-fold phone can be expected to launch with a cheaper price tag either. After all, new technology is expensive. The first few years of sales alone are sometimes not enough to recuperate research and development costs. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The Samsung Galaxy G Fold will reportedly use Samsung Display's \"newly developed display and film,\" which will be debuted at Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona next month. Some tipsters have suggested that the G Fold launch could be delayed past Q2 2025 into Samsung's fall Unpacked event. According to more hearsay, Samsung is only gunning for about 200,000 units of the multi-fold phone, playing it safe rather than taking a bold risk. Samsung is starting to realize that its current portfolio of foldables has become very stale. This is very clearly reflected in the numbers. Regardless of Samsung's hopes for the multi-fold, I don't think it will be enough to revive foldable sales. At the end of the day, it'll all boil down to the price of the G Fold. Because, let's be honest \u2014 if the G Fold is priced anything like the Huawei Mate XT tri-foldable, no one's going to buy it.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"CHONGQING, CHINA - FEBRUARY 9: In this photo illustration, the Trade Desk logo is displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen in front of a stock chart showcasing The Trade Desk's financial performance, advertising technology trends, programmatic advertising growth, and global digital marketing developments on February 9, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin\/Getty Images) Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD)\u2014a digital ad technology company that assists businesses in purchasing digital ads across various publishers\u2014recently reported its Q4 earnings. The company posted earnings of $0.59 per share on revenue of $741 million, falling short of analyst expectations of $0.57 per share and $760 million in revenue. Additionally, its forward guidance was weaker than anticipated, causing its stock to decline following the earnings announcement. Separately, can this stock move on earnings, too? See How Might Moderna Stock React To Upcoming Earnings? TTD stock has gained 70% since the start of 2024, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which has risen by 27% over the same period. The company has benefited from continued growth in connected TV advertising. However, if you're looking for exposure with reduced volatility, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 with over 100% cumulative returns since inception. Trade Desk's revenue for Q4 was $741 million, marking a 22% year-over-year increase. The company maintained a strong customer retention rate of 95% and processed a record $12 billion in ad spend, underscoring its expanding influence in the digital ad market. Additionally, it sustained an adjusted EBITDA margin of 47%, with net earnings per share rising 44% year-over-year to $0.59. Looking ahead, Trade Desk expects Q1 2025 revenue of $575 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $145 million, which is lower than the market's consensus of $582 million in revenue and $193 million in EBITDA. Regarding TTD stock, recent price fluctuations are not unusual. The stock has exhibited substantial volatility in previous years, with annual returns of 14% in 2021, -51% in 2022, 61% in 2023, and 63% in 2024. By contrast, the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio, consisting of 30 carefully selected stocks, has been significantly more stable. Over the past four years, it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500. Why? Because the HQ Portfolio stocks have historically provided better returns with lower risk than the benchmark index, offering a less turbulent investment journey, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. With ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, including interest rate decisions and trade tensions, could TTD stock face a downturn similar to 2021 and 2022, underperforming the S&P in the next 12 months? Or will it see a rebound? At its current price below $90 per share, TTD stock is trading at 18x trailing revenue, notably lower than its five-year average price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 28x. While the weak Q4 performance and cautious outlook have contributed to a contraction in valuation multiples, we believe the stock is currently undervalued, with potential challenges already factored into its price. Although TTD stock appears to have room for growth, it\u2019s worth comparing how Trade Desk\u2019s peers perform on key metrics.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  Many older Americans are facing a difficult choice: leave behind a career they've built for decades to care for their parents, or stay at their job and cover the high cost of care.          In the late 1990s, Maylia Tsen's parents moved from New York to live with her in Southern California. Tsen said her mother was facing several health issues and that her area offered better access to healthcare. Tsen continued to work full-time as a VP of sales and marketing, but eventually, it became too difficult to balance the role with her caregiving responsibilities. Around 2005, she left the job she'd spent years working toward, which she said paid more than $150,000 annually.               \"I couldn't take full-time hours,\" said Tsen, 63. \"I couldn't make that commitment because I never knew what was going to happen with them.\"               About two dozen older Americans told Business Insider in responses to reader surveys about work and retirement that they moved, quit their jobs, or switched to a part-time work schedule to care for their parents. Many made the decision because taking on caregiving themselves was the most economical option, as they couldn't afford the high costs of nursing homes or other long-term care for their parents.               They're now earning less since they\u00a0reentered the labor market\u00a0or are struggling to get hired in the industries they worked in before stepping away.       Are you an older American who has struggled to secure work due to caring for parents? Have you struggled in general to find a job recently? To share your story, please fill out this form.           The most recent data on unpaid caregiving from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that over the combined years of 2021 and 2022, about 9 million or 21% of 55- to 64-year-olds provided eldercare, referring to unpaid care provided by family or friends to those 65 or older. This demographic didabout four hours on average of eldercare each day.               A 2021 AARP report found, based on a survey of 2,380 caregivers, that they spent on average $7,242 annually of their own money. Among the 1,415 working caregivers in the survey, 29% had to take paid time off from work in the past year because of caregiving.               \"It's been a real financial challenge and burden,\" said Tsen. \"Caregiving has taken a toll on me, financially, physically, and mentally.\"               Tsen's mother died 11 years ago, but she still cares for her 97-year-old father. To facilitate her caregiving, she's turned down higher-paying work in favor of lower-paying jobs that offered her the flexibility she needed. To pay the bills, she's had to draw upon her savings and retirement funds.               Some people have continued to face career obstacles after scaling back their caregiving responsibilities. D. Peterson, 65, applied for jobs unsuccessfully for a year and a half after taking three years off to care for her mother.               Peterson, who lives in Georgia and asked to obscure her first name to protect her family's privacy, often switched jobs and worked as a leasing consultant, administrative assistant, and real-estate agent throughout her career.She made enough to live comfortably but called herself a \"poor money manager\" and said she didn't prepare well for retirement. Because of her financial situation and her mother's health, she moved in with her in 2010.               At the start of the pandemic, she quit her job where she was earning $40,000 annually to care full time for her mom, who was in her mid-80s. Once her siblings became more involved with caretaking in 2023, Peterson looked for work \u2014 only to realize that landing a role with a three-year gap and being close to retirement age would be challenging.               She wasn't familiar with the new hiring technology like online interviews, and there weren't many administrative assistant roles remotely or in her area. The available ones had hundreds of applicants. And because she switched industries during her career, she said she couldn't prove her authority in one field as easily.               Peterson landed a job at a library a month ago, which pays $11 an hour, but she injured her ankle two weeks in and said she's applying elsewhere. She doesn't foresee herself being able to retire as she relies on her $1,600 monthly Social Security checks.               \"I'm trying to save as much as I can and finally put myself on a budget, but my main concern now is my mom, who's losing her memory and eyesight but doesn't want to go into assisted living,\" Peterson said. \"It's hard to stay motivated when you feel like you don't have the skills or face age discrimination.\"               The labor market has been difficult for job seekers in general, including for older Americans, some of whom have taken huge pay cuts after a layoff or voluntary departure. Additionally, even though the unemployment rate is historically low, hiring rates have slipped from more than 4% a few years ago to 3.3% and 3.4% in recent months.               Rita Choula, senior director of caregiving for AARP Public Policy Institute, told BI that more companies should aim to support caregivers. This can look like offering leave for caregivers or changes to company culture to normalize caring for an older adult.               \"It's great that you have vacation leave, but we really want caregivers who are under enough stress to be able to take that time for them to rest and reset,\" Choula said.               Older Americans told BI that caregiving meant sacrificing career opportunities that didn't work with their schedules, often adversely affecting their finances.               \"Many employed caregivers face strain in managing both caregiving and work responsibilities simultaneously,\" the AARP report said. \"These consequences can lead to reduced job security, fewer employment opportunities, and ultimately, lower retirement savings.\"               In 2017, Robin, who asked to use her first name for fear of professional repercussions, sold her condo in the DC area and moved into a nearby one-bedroom apartment with her legally blind mother. She had just been laid off from her government relations job.               Robin, 62, said caring for her mother has had lasting effects on her career and earnings. To help pay the bills, Robin said she worked various retail jobs, including as a cashier at Walgreens. She said this income wasn't sufficient, and she had to deplete much of her savings and 401(k).               \"During that time, I was unable to hold anything more than a part-time job,\" she said.               In 2022, Robin's mother died, which allowed her to pursue full-time government relations roles. But, despite her roughly 20 years of industry experience, she said she struggled to land a job.               \"Employers just see the gap on your rsum, and they don't realize that your time was spent productively, but in a very different way,\" she said.               In September 2022, Robin enrolled in the Senior Community Service Enrollment program, which helps unemployed older people find work. She said the program helped her land a part-time data analytics role with the National Council on Aging \u2014 which she started in October 2023 \u2014 and that she's interviewing for a full-time position with the organization.               \"I'm really hoping the job comes through,\" she said, adding, \"I definitely have to recover my finances.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Recently passed legislation gives an 18-month grace period but after that, all products in all sectors will need lesser, and more sustainable packaging  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Ah, EU regulations. Some love them, some, namely non-EU countries and businesses, tend to loathe them. Nevertheless, they exist, and the latest one will affect, among other products, those wonderful display boxes CPUs have shipped in over the years. The Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) came into effect on February 11 (via TechPowerUp) with the aim to reduce unnecessary and non-sustainable packaging. For CPUs specifically, that probably means even the current boxes will continue to shrink. After all, a CPU isn't very big, is it? Curiously, some are leaning towards the in-box stock cooler becoming a relic of the past, too. now CPU makers will ditch the included fan thanks to EU pic.twitter.com\/Rv5vVXrhkCFebruary 11, 2025 It's a fair assumption to make. If the wording stresses that packaging weight and volume needs to come down, would including a stock cooler fall foul of this? After all, you're not buying the cooler, you're buying the CPU inside. If the stock cooler were to completely go away, I don't think it would be a particularly big deal. The higher-end CPUs from Intel and AMD have already been shipping this way for a little while now. Truthfully, even if you're building a budget PC, if you're building one you're still better off getting a third-party cooler, anyway. What it will mean is the death of any special edition packaging. It'll likely get to a point where the box is little bigger than the CPU tray. Hell, the box my RTX 4090 Founders Edition review unit came in would probably fall foul, too.  Packaging will also, not surprisingly, need to be composed of a percentage of recycled materials by 2030 and 2040, as well as being restricted on single-use plastics. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The PC industry has actually been pretty forward-thinking in the last few years, so it's unlikely this will cause any furore. The likes of Acer and Razer, in particular, have really been pushing environmentally friendly packaging, and there are multiple examples of how the boxes your hardware comes in can be reused as an accessory. It's a good step that I'm not totally convinced the tech industry necessarily needed regulations on compared to, well, a lot of others, but nevertheless, it now exists.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Turbulent market  Last Friday some traders noticed the negative reversals in both the Spyder Trust (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). For example, SPY closed at $606.32 on February 6 but opened higher last Friday at $606.89 before closing at $600.77, which was below the prior day\u2019s low. From a technical standpoint that is not normally a positive sign as a more negative key reversal was formed at the start of the three-month correction in July 2023. A reversal was also formed Friday on the QQQ. Last week\u2019s lows for both ETFs are now short-term support. Market Summary In my weekend technical review, I noticed that three of the daily advance-decline lines that I follow closed below their daily MAs as noted by the red arrows in the table above. Only the Russell 2000 weekly A\/D line is currently negative. Only IWM closed below its 20-day EMA. Both the SPY and QQQ closed near the midpoint of their weekly starc bands indicating they are neither overbought nor oversold. Some may remember the stock market trading during the last Trump administration and especially the periodic trade comments that pushed stocks either sharply higher or lower. This article from Reuters outlines some of the key dates from the period. The choppy trading that we often saw during these four years was frustrating for investors who often sold or bought at just the wrong time. This is probably how some investors are feeling right now as those who bought stocks in reaction to Trump\u2019s victory may be having second thoughts. Their hopes for greater growth are being somewhat replaced by impatience, uncertainty, or even fear. Spyder Trust Monthly When my market outlook reflects choppy action as it does currently I have found that looking at the longer-term charts can often keep me in sync with the major market trend. The monthly chart of the Spyder Trust (SPY) continues to look strong after completing a bottom in October 2022. A year later the rising 20-month EMA was again tested after a three-month correction. The monthly analysis of the S&P 500 Advance\/Decline line was positive in November 2016 which was a positive sign for the stock market. This was also the case before last year\u2019s election. It held above its rising WMA in October 2023 before moving above the resistance at line a (see arrow). SPY Weekly With A\/D Lines The weekly A\/D lines are followed more closely as they will generally warn of more serious declines like the one that occurred in the last quarter of 2018 when the S&P 500 declined 13.5%. They will also help identify important buying opportunities. The weekly S&P 500 A\/D line moved to new highs and above resistance, line a, in mid-November of 2023. This was after the AAII bullish sentiment dropped to a low of 24.32% on November 2. By late January 2024 (line c) the NYSE All A\/D line had also overcome its major resistance at line b, after moving further above its strongly rising EMA. The slope of both the WMAs and EMAs that I use on the A\/D lines can provide further trend confirmation. The S&P 500 A\/D line peaked in November 2024 and as the SPY and S&P 500 made a new high on January 24, the S&P A\/D line failed to make a new high. This potentially bearish divergence, line d, will become more significant if the A\/D line drops below the September low as it will confirm a new downtrend. The NYSE All A\/D and NYSE Stocks Only (not shown) also have formed lower highs since peaking in late November. Since the NYSE Composite did not make new highs with the S&P, no divergences were formed. These A\/D will form new negative downtrends if they drop below support going back to the September lows. Invesco QQQ Trust Weekly For most of 2023 and 2024, the Nasdaq 100 has been leading the other market averages. In early 2025 QQQ has been testing the rising 20-week EMA at $508.29. It has not had a weekly close below the yearly pivot since March 2023, point 1. This year the pivot that is derived from the price action in 2024, is at $483.29. which is a level that needs to hold on a weekly closing basis. The yearly R1 resistance level and the upper trading channel, line a, are in the $573 area. The weekly Nasdaq 100 Advance\/Decline has made a new high and is leading prices higher as the December 16 high at $538.28 has not yet been exceeded. It bounced off the rising 21-period EMA at the start of 2025 and this is the first support level to watch. The relative performance (RS) measures the performance of the QQQ relative to the S&P 500. When the RS (in red) is declining as it was for much of 2022 it means that QQQ was declining more than the S&P. In 2022, QQQ was down over 32% while the SPY declined by 18%. In February 2023 the RS broke its downtrend, point 2, signaling the QQQ was again leading the SPY contrary to the prevailing Wall Street opinion. The CPI report on Wednesday came in higher than expected so it was another ugly open for the stock market Wednesday as the SPY had an early low of $598.51 but then closed at $603.35. The selling was heavy in early trading with a 10-1 negative A\/D ratio. The stock market spent the rest of the day rebounding as both the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 closed positive. On the NYSE there were 818 issues advancing and 1972 declining. Now four of the six A\/D are negative as they closed below their MAs. A further rally and higher weekly close is needed to suggest that the rebound from Wednesday\u2019s lows was significant. The revisions in the monthly jobs data and the CPI report appear to put the new administration and the Fed on a collision course. I think patience is the right approach until the weekly and daily A\/D lines both signal a new uptrend. Additionally, I would spend more time looking at weekly and monthly charts certainly not the daily or intra-day data. Some of the best longer-term market analysis is done by an old friend and world-recognized technical analyst Martin Pring. Technology\/Financial Martin recently posted a very interesting chart of the ratio between Technology and Financials (XLK\/XLF), together with its long-term KST. He commented that \u2018the ratio has clearly completed a 2-year top and decisively violated its secular up trendline. I regard that line to be of great significance not only because of its nearly 20-year length, but because it has turned back numerous declines including the late 2022 whipsaw. It therefore represents an important level of dynamic support, whose violation favors financials over technology going forwards.\u201d Relative Performance XLK\/XLF The relative performance chart from Stockcharts.com reveals that since the market low in 2009, the Technology Sector Select (XLK) is up well over 1,700% while the Financial Sector Select (XLF) is just up over 500%. Therefore a change in this relationship could have an important impact on the markets going forward.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Intel\u2019s desktop processors might not be setting the world on fire in early-2025, but its mobile chips are still some of the best in the game, and that\u2019s only going to continue later this year. Panther Lake is Intel\u2019s next-generation Core Ultra CPU design, and though originally expected to be a desktop and laptop line of processors, it\u2019ll most likely be a mobile-only design. That\u2019s still worth getting excited over though, with early rumors suggesting some impressive onboard GPU performance and improved AI capabilities. We don\u2019t have all the details just yet, but here\u2019s what we know about Intel Panther Lake so far. Intel has slated Panther Lake for release in the second half of 2025, likely towards the end of the year. There\u2019s some suggestion that production of the new chips won\u2019t enter full swing until 2026, also, which might mean availability of Panther Lake laptops is initially quite limited, increasing as the new year rolls around. Panther Lake CPUs will likely take on the moniker of Core Ultra 300 processors. Intel hasn\u2019t released any firm specifications for the next-generation just yet, but we do have some details and some leaks which point to a focus on efficiency over raw power \u2014 not a terrible thing considering some of Intel\u2019s recent generations. However, new architectures, enhanced graphics, and a new NPU, all on a new process node, should shake things up a bit. The above are some alleged leaked core counts for some Panther Lake performance and efficient CPUs, via VideoCardz. The lack of any kind of eight performance core variant suggests Intel isn\u2019t going to drive high performance for gaming or other demanding tasks on these processors, but should be able to run them incredibly efficiently for a big boost to battery life. Casual and esports gaming should be more than doable, though, with the new Xe3 graphics likely to be a solid alternative to entry-level mobile GPUs. Each Panther Lake CPU, regardless of configuration, will also include a new NPU that can output 50 TOPS by itself. That\u2019s a little more than we\u2019ve seen from current-generation processors like Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Elite X, but only by 5 additional TOPS, so it wouldn\u2019t be any kind of game changer. One aspect of these CPUs we can confirm, is that they\u2019ll be built on the Intel 18A process. That means it\u2019s keeping production in-house, which is likely part of Intel\u2019s drive towards greater profitability, with improved margins on future generations of CPUs. That doesn\u2019t mean much for consumers, outside of the fact that it may mean there is more limited stock to start with \u2014 that would run in line with release date rumors. This is a complete wildcard, as we just don\u2019t know what these chips can do without more details of their specifications, and ideally some hands-on testing time. Graphically, they\u2019re likely to take big leaps over anything we\u2019ve seen before from Intel. Both AMD and Intel have been gunning hard for the entry-level GPU market for the past few years, and it seems likely that within this next-generation they could all but invalidate low-level mobile GPUs, like the Nvidia RTX XX50 series, and lower-power options, like the MX550. We\u2019d like to see an eight-performance core option for these CPUs, as otherwise they\u2019re going to fall well behind AMD\u2019s alternatives in raw power for high-end tasks. Efficiency cores are great, but in limited quantities, they can\u2019t keep up. It\u2019s a long way off before we even get a glimpse of these CPUs, but we\u2019ll be keeping our eyes peeled. As more details emerge, we\u2019ll keep this updated. Interested in what comes after even Panther Lake? We have a guide to Nova Lake too. Intel Arrow Lake has struggled to compete against some of the best processors from both AMD and Intel itself, but improvements are on the way. In fact, a completely unexpected update just gave the CPUs a major boost. Unfortunately, there's a caveat: That boost only applies to one game. The update in question was just announced by CDProjektRed, which has dropped a surprise patch for Cyberpunk 2077. The game studio now promises to improve in-game performance on Arrow Lake CPUs by up to 33%, which is a tune-up that gamers badly need, considering that the CPUs generally failed to impress in gaming scenarios. Intel has announced that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired. The executive, who first joined Intel in 1979 at 18 years old, is being replaced by David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. Holthaus and Zinsner will serve as interim co-CEOs while the board of directors works \"diligently and expeditiously\" to find a successor. Gelsinger became CEO in early 2021. At the time, Intel was struggling to regain ground it had lost to AMD in the desktop market, as well as push a more ambitious manufacturing timeline to catch up with foreign chipmakers like TSMC. Under Gelsinger's leadership, the company made some big strides. Intel's 12th generation of processors marked a significant turning point in the company's desktop processors, and an aggressive foundry roadmap has pushed smaller nodes out of U.S.-based plants. Those headline above includes strong words from the maker of the best graphics cards you can buy, and they have extra significance considering where Nvidia sits today in relation to Intel. But in 1997, things were a bit different. The quote comes from the upcoming book The Nvidia Way,\u00a0written by columnist Tae Kim, and was shared as part of an excerpt ahead of the book's release next month. The words from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came as part of an all-hands meeting at the company in 1997 following the launch of the RIVA 128. This was prior to the release of the GeForce 256, when Nvidia finally coined the term \"GPU,\" and it was a precarious time for the new company. Shortly following the release of the RIVA 128, Intel launched its own i740, which came with an 8MB frame buffer. The RIVA 128 came with only a 4MB frame buffer.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"AppLovin Corp (NASDAQ: APP) \u2014 a company providing a full suite of solutions for mobile app developers, including marketing, monetization, and analytics \u2014 recently posted strong quarterly results. The company reported earnings of $1.73 per share on revenue of $1.37 billion for Q4, surpassing analyst expectations of $1.24 per share on $1.26 billion in revenue. Additionally, its optimistic outlook drove the stock up nearly 30% in after-hours trading. Separately, can this stock move on earnings, too? See How Might Twilio Stock React To Upcoming Earnings? CHONGQING, CHINA - FEBRUARY 9: In this photo illustration, the AppLovin logo is displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen in front of a stock chart showcasing AppLovin's financial performance, mobile app development trends, digital advertising growth, and global technology sector developments on February 9, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin\/Getty Images) With an astonishing 854% return since the start of 2024, APP stock has far outperformed the S&P 500, which gained 28% over the same period. AppLovin has consistently exceeded expectations in recent quarters, largely due to the success of its AI-driven ad search engine, which has fueled its stock rally. For investors looking for strong returns with lower volatility than individual stocks, consider the High-Quality Portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P with returns of over 91% since inception. AppLovin's Q4 revenue of $1.37 billion represented a substantial 44% year-over-year increase. Breaking this down further, advertising revenue surged 73% to $999 million, while revenue from apps declined by 1% to $373 million. The company's advertising revenue growth has been fueled by its AI-powered search engine, AXON, which enhances and automates advertisers' operations, spanning from marketing to user engagement and revenue optimization. The company also experienced a significant improvement in its adjusted EBITDA margin, which rose to 62% in Q4'24, up from 50% in the prior year. This combination of higher revenue and margin expansion led to earnings per share of $1.73, marking a 3.5x year-over-year increase. Looking ahead, AppLovin anticipates Q1'25 revenue to reach approximately $1.37 billion, with an EBITDA margin expanding to 63.5% at the midpoint of its projected range, surpassing the market consensus of $1.32 billion. APP stock has experienced an impressive surge, but this also brings increased volatility. Its performance in past years has been highly variable, with annual returns of 45% in 2021, a steep decline of -89% in 2022, followed by a rebound of 278% in 2023, and an extraordinary 713% gain in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated far less volatility while delivering consistent returns. What makes it different? These stocks tend to offer superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, creating a more stable investment journey, as highlighted in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties such as interest rate fluctuations and trade tensions, will APP follow a pattern similar to 2022 and lag behind the S&P in the next 12 months? Or will it continue its strong performance? After its recent rally, APP stock now trades at premium valuations. At its current price of $490, it has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 36x, significantly above its four-year average of 10x. While its valuation may seem steep, AppLovin\u2019s exceptional growth in both revenue and profitability justifies a higher multiple. The company has demonstrated strong revenue expansion, and with a projected CAGR exceeding 20% in the coming years, it remains a compelling growth story. Even if its P\/S ratio eventually normalizes, the stock\u2019s increasing earnings potential\u2014outpacing even its impressive sales growth\u2014suggests further upside driven by strong business fundamentals rather than mere multiple expansion.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  Every few months, we take a look at what top investors \u2014 known in market-speak as \"whales\"\u00a0\u2014 are placing big bets on. Specifically, which stocks they have at least 20% of their portfolios in.          High concentration in just one or a few companies is what drives many top investors' outperformance, so having a gander at their top positions can be an insightful exercise. But the strategy can also be risky in the sense that much of a portfolio's performance depends on a small number of holdings.               Many of the bets are the same as in September 2024, the last time we checked in. Portfolio weightings change, however, either as particular stocks see outsize gains or losses or as fund managers add to or reduce their positions.               One notable update is that Warren Buffett has continued to reduce his position in Apple, a move that some view as a protective measure amid an expensive market. Another is that David Einhorn has upped his position in his own homebuilding firm, Green Brick Partners, as the stock has fallen 29% since September.               Using data from GuruFocus.com's list of 145 top investors and funds, we've compiled below the stocks that make up at least one-fifth of their respective funds.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Members of key congressional oversight committees have called on the United States' new top intelligence director to pressure the United Kingdom to withdraw its controversial demand for Apple to create a backdoor into encrypted user data stored in iCloud, according to The Washington Post. Last week The Post revealed that a secret UK order, issued under the Investigatory Powers Act last month, demanded Apple to provide access to data protected by its Advanced Data Protection feature, which offers end-to-end encryption for iCloud storage. The mandate would apply globally, potentially affecting users worldwide, including Americans. But in a letter sent Thursday to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard, senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and representative Andy Biggs (R-AZ) warned that the British order poses significant risks to Americans' privacy and security. The bipartisan pair suggested that if the UK doesn't back down, the US should consider limiting intelligence sharing and cybersecurity cooperation between the two countries. \"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers,\" the lawmakers wrote, going on to express concerns about the security of sensitive data stored by government agencies on Apple devices. The legislators also pointed to recent Chinese hacking campaigns as evidence that backdoors intended for law enforcement could be exploited by malicious actors. They referenced the \"Salt Typhoon\" attacks, which targeted phone networks by exploiting systems designed for law enforcement surveillance. \"The US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"If the UK does not immediately reverse this dangerous effort, we urge you to reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing with the UK.\" Apple has long opposed the UK's plans to demand access to iCloud encrypted content, or indeed any form of backdoor in its encrypted services. By contrast, US law enforcement has historically resisted end-to-end encryption, but recent major cyber attacks have led to increased support for stronger security measures.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Elon Musk was one of the founding members of OpenAI, but made a sour exit before ChatGPT became a thing. The billionaire claims he wasn\u2019t happy with the non-profit\u2019s pivot to a profit-chasing business model. A few days ago, Musk submitted a bid to buy OpenAI\u2019s non-profit arm for $97.4 billion, but now says he will pull the offer if the AI giant abandons its for-profit ambitions. \u201cIf (the) OpenAI board is prepared to preserve the charity\u2019s mission and stipulate to take the \u201cfor sale\u201d sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid,\u201d says a court filing submitted by the billionaire\u2019s lawyer, as per Reuters. Musk\u2019s bid was surprising, though not entirely unexpected. Musk is currently entangled in a legal tussle with OpenAI, challenging the company\u2019s shift to a for-profit structure. OpenAI is aiming to spin its AI stack into a business entity, while the non-profit arm will retain a small stake in the business division. Swindler &mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 10, 2025 When news of the acquisition offer broke, OpenAI chief, Sam Altman, responded that they would instead like to buy X at one-tenth the value of Musk\u2019s bid. In subsequent press interactions, Altman made it clear that the company was not up for sale, adding that it was just another tactic to mess with the company. Interestingly, Reuters reported a few days ago that OpenAI hasn\u2019t formally received Musk\u2019s $97.4 billion bid to acquire its non-profit arm. Altman labeled the attempt as \u201cridiculous\u201d and reportedly told OpenAI employees that the company would reject the offer. But it seems this wasn\u2019t Musk\u2019s first attempt at a takeover. In a couple of lengthy official statements published recently, OpenAI claimed Musk wanted to eventually merge the AI upstart with Tesla and foresaw a for-profit model, too. Altman also told Axios two days ago that Musk has been vying to take control of OpenAI for a long time. YUCK &mdash; Sam Altman (@sama) February 11, 2025 \u201cOpenAI is not for sale. OpenAI\u2019s mission is not for sale \u2013 to say nothing of the fact that, like, a competitor who is not able to beat us in the market and you know, instead is just trying to say, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna buy this\u201d with total disregard for the mission is a likely path there,\u201d Altman told the outlet. Musk owns his own AI company called xAI and already has a ChatGPT rival called Grok out in the market. Speaking virtually at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Musk revealed that the latest version of xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok-3, is in the late stages of development with improved reasoning capabilities. OpenAI has already teased its next-gen GPT-5 plans and says it will simplify the AI model strategy in the near future. The company is also working on in-house AI chips and the ambitious \u201cStargate\u201d project worth $500 billion to boost AI development and help maintain US supremacy in the AI race. Mere hours after the OpenAI announced the ambitious Stargate Project, which would see up to $500 billion in private AI infrastructure construction over the next four years, Tesla CEO and newly-minted presidential advisor Elon Musk alleged on social media that the project's backers, \"don\u2019t actually have the money.\" https:\/\/x.com\/OpenAI\/status\/1881830103858172059 OpenAI appears to be just throwing spaghetti at this point, hoping it sticks to a profitable idea. The company announced on Tuesday that it is rolling out a new feature called ChatGPT Tasks to subscribers of its paid tier that will allow users to set individual and recurring reminders through the ChatGPT interface. Tasks does exactly what it sounds like it does: It allows you to ask ChatGPT to do a specific action at some point in the future. That could be assembling a weekly news brief every Friday afternoon, telling you what the weather will be like in New York City tomorrow morning at 9 a.m., or reminding you to renew your passport before January 20. ChatGPT will also send a push notification with relevant details. To use it, you'll need to select \"4o with scheduled tasks\" from the model picker menu, then tell the AI what you want it to do and when. We've officially passed the second anniversary of the start of the AI boom, and things haven't slowed down. Just the opposite. Generative AI is ramping up at a pace that feels nearly overwhelming, expanding into new platforms, mediums, and even devices at a relentless pace.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Vanina Marcote is Executive Director, Demand Generation for IBM Americas.   What would you do if you had the opportunity to completely reshape the way your brand competes in the marketplace today? In the marketing and comms space, this is one of the most important, ongoing conversations taking place. The question isn\u2019t whether AI can replace human creativity or resources\u2014it cannot\u2014but rather, how to integrate it, develop the right skills and culture and pick the right projects to be part of the game. GenAI is not only leading but forcing brands to extend their borders\u2014and not only conventional vertical or horizontal expansion but journey expansion, with the user at the center. This type of expansion necessitates reaching your audience with the right message, at the right time, with the right offer and experience\u2014and opens the door to developing new business opportunities and new sources of revenue growth. Beyond the hype, possibilities are real. But challenging the status quo requires aligning GenAI to your business strategy and needs, as well as making the right cultural shifts in your organization; these steps are necessary to truly unlock GenAI\u2019s value. Perhaps the most impactful capability of AI is hyper-personalization, a topic we\u2019ve been talking about in the marketing sector for years. Hyper-personalization applies to everything, from marketing and communication to the shopping experience, pricing and all the elements that define a brand. AI enables brands to personalize these aspects at scale and at speed. But until now, we haven\u2019t had the capability to execute with such extensive reach, across every touchpoint, in an omnichannel experience and at the speed required for today\u2019s consumers. In the past, personalization efforts were time-consuming and often ineffective. What once took weeks can today be accomplished the same day\u2014including legal validation. McKinsey research suggests that 65 percent of customers see targeted promotions as a top reason to make a purchase, and that marketers deploying GenAI to personalize content development can move far faster than those applying a manual approach. AI allows us to scale personalization across multiple personas, industries and use cases\u2014which is a game changer. Customer experience is another area where GenAI has notably leveled up the game. AI facilitates multilingual translation and social sentiment analysis and helps route customers to the right representative based on their needs. This use case may seem more obvious than hyper-personalization\u2014and, frankly, less flashy\u2014but it\u2019s also one of the most widely implemented. By this year, projections suggest that AI-powered bots will handle 85% of customer interactions. While this isn\u2019t the most groundbreaking application of AI, it\u2019s still crucial. Hyper-personalization may be more innovative, but AI-driven customer experience improvements are essential\u2014especially for brands with high customer interaction volumes. They\u2019re also significantly cost-saving: IBM reports that implementing AI tools can reduce customer service costs by 30%. So if a company hasn\u2019t already adopted AI in this area, it probably should. It\u2019s well-known that AI tools can play a role in streamlining operations. Many companies approach this from an operational efficiency perspective\u2014use cases include fraud detection, stock management and inventory control. In its optimal implementation, AI can free up employees from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on more valuable, strategic work. This enhances productivity, enabling them to contribute more meaningfully. Even creative roles, like writers and designers, can use AI as a starting point to enhance their work (rather than having AI replace it\u2014a valid concern of creatives these days). I was in a meeting recently where we discussed how AI can provide initial ideas that creatives then refine and build upon. The key to leveraging these capabilities is to upskill and reskill teams as AI is integrated into workflows. As always, deploying GenAI tools should be a mindful, deliberate process\u2014not just a free-for-all of buying and rolling out new platforms. It\u2019s best to start small. While there are many benefits, there are also dependencies and risks: data considerations, technology partnerships and organizational readiness must all be considered. With that in mind, here are some industry-agnostic best practices: 1. Identify the problem. Determine where your customers\u2014or your organization\u2014currently stand. Then choose a use case where AI can add value, whether by simplifying a long process or solving a specific problem. Ideally, this problem is discrete and contained\u2014something meaningful that will address a business or process challenge in a concrete, manageable way. 2. Test before making massive overhauls. We always begin with small-scale testing, learn from it and plan for scaling. We outline in advance some key questions teams should consider, and once those are agreed upon, we test, assess the results and\u2014if we\u2019ve found a good use case\u2014plan how to roll it out more broadly. 3. Assess readiness and capabilities. It\u2019s important to look at technical readiness and skills within your team or organization. Crucially, when we\u2019re talking about skills, this doesn\u2019t just mean technical expertise but also the capabilities of whichever teams (such as marketing, communications, design) will be involved in the selected processes. AI implementation is never limited to one department; it requires cross-team, cross-functional collaboration. 4. Keep the focus on \u201cbusiness first.\u201d AI should be applied to your business operations with that mindset of figuring out what your needs are\u2014and then determining if and how AI can support those needs. At the same time, you shouldn\u2019t just take an existing process and simply apply AI to it exactly as it is. Instead, think about how AI can help you rethink and optimize the entire process. Successful AI deployment isn\u2019t just about replacing manual steps with AI. Rather, it requires reimagining the process altogether, rethinking workflows in a way that improves efficiency and efficacy. Fundamentally, implementing GenAI in marketing requires adopting a new mindset, one that rethinks business strategies to stay competitive, and in doing so, leverages the capabilities AI is bringing to the table. Amid the hype and buzz around AI, the real challenge is cutting through the noise to identify what\u2019s just a trend versus what\u2019s a real opportunity. It must be acknowledged that there are significant risks and dependencies, particularly when it comes to data and governance. But at the same time, businesses need to figure out how to be part of this transformation, lest they fall behind their competitors. The key is not just using AI to replicate existing processes, but instead, rethinking entire business models. It\u2019s not enough to look at your omnichannel journey and ask, \"This is how it is\u2014how can GenAI optimize it for me?\" True transformation lies in looking at these processes and asking, \"What\u2019s an entirely new, better way to do this that I haven\u2019t even considered before?\" Don\u2019t just apply AI to the same old processes; challenge the way everything has been done to date. That\u2019s where the real opportunity lies.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Kennedy will set up a 'MAHA' commission to address chronic disease. Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been sworn in as the nation's next health secretary Thursday, his first order of business will be to investigate America's problem with chronic illnesses. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News earlier that President Donald Trump would sign an executive order creating a \"Make America Health Again\" commission and direct Kennedy \"to investigate this chronic crisis plaguing our country and the minds and the bodies of the American people.\" What that will mean exactly remains to be seen. But here are three things to watch for as Kennedy takes the helm, based on what he and Trump have said in the past: MAHA has easily emerged as a deeply popular slogan by Kennedy as much of America struggles with obesity and chronic diseases. The question though is how to do that in a way that won't weigh down the federal budget or trigger an avalanche of legal challenges from the food and drug industry. One possible avenue for Kennedy could be to call for additional safety studies of certain ingredients used by manufacturers, including food dyes. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its authorization of one type of red food dye. \"Red Dye No. 3\" is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals but was allowed to be used by manufacturers for years because scientists didn't believe it raised cancer risk in humans at the level typically consumed. The FDA, under President Joe Biden, acted after longtime pressure by consumer advocates. But a different type, Red Dye No. 40, remains on the market and hasn't been studied by the FDA in more than 20 years. FDA and health officials say there is no evidence though that it's harmful, and food manufacturers say they need to be able to rely on ingredients generally recognized as safe. Still, health advocates argue more can be done to look at the health impacts and or do the kind of post-market monitoring of food more common in Europe. All of those efforts though will take significant federal resources and rely on a workforce that Trump has promised to cut. Kennedy hasn't personally focused much on the question of transgender rights. But eliminating federal rules at Health and Human Services that President Barack Obama and Joe Biden pushed to protect transgender Americans is a major priority for Trump and the conservative party. Federal law prohibits sexual discrimination, but it's up to the executive branch to spell out specific rules that schools, insurers and hospitals must follow if they want to retain access to federal aid. Obama triggered a fierce legal fight in his second term when he issued federal regulations aimed at protecting transgender people from discrimination in schools and medical settings. Under rules written by Obama's Health aand Human Services Department, doctors and hospitals were told couldn't decline care for a person because of their gender identity. Insurance companies also were specifically prohibited from offering different benefits to certain groups, including transgender individuals and people with HIV. Trump quickly dropped Obama's rules in his first term, writing new rules that granted exceptions for medical providers on discrimination rules if they cited religious objections. President Joe Biden tried to resurrect Obama's initial rules but was swiftly challenged in court by Republican states, tossing the issue back to Trump. It'll now be up to HHS under Kennedy, if he's confirmed, to decide what those federal rules should say. School vaccine requirements are up to the states, and currently all 50 states have laws requiring certain vaccines for students to attend public schools. But HHS sets the recommendations for childhood vaccines followed by schools, while the Education Department provides vital grant money to schools used to teach low-income or children with disabilities. On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to revoke spending for schools that mandate vaccines currently recommended by public health experts and HHS. \"I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,\" Trump declared last year. Such a move could have big implications for public health. According to the nonpartisan KFF, routine vaccination rates for kindergarten children is on the decline while exemptions are on the rise, including non-religious exemptions. While running for president before aligning with Trump, Kennedy rejected the numerous studies finding that childhood vaccines are safe, including several studies that debunked a myth that vaccines cause autism. During his Senate confirmation, Kennedy insisted he doesn't oppose vaccines but wants more study. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican doctor from Louisiana, said he was concerned by Kennedy's past in \"undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments.\" Facing a Republican primary next year, Cassidy decided to back Trump's pick after getting Kennedy to agree the two would work together closely. \"Ultimately, restoring trust in our public health institution is too important, and I think Mr. Kennedy can help get that done,\" Cassidy said.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Miriam Groom, (M.A. Psyc.) Organizational Therapist, CEO of Mindful Career, and Leader, Human Capital at KPMG.   The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with automation reshaping industries, remote work creating a global talent pool and employers seeking candidates with both technical and soft skills. As a professional career strategist, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how the right approach can make the difference between blending in and standing out. Here\u2019s how you can carve your path in a crowded market. In an oversaturated market, being generic is a big mistake. Employers are inundated with applications from candidates with similar qualifications, so you need to answer a critical question: What sets you apart? Start by conducting a self-assessment. What are your core strengths, values and skills? Consider using psychometric tools such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or the Career Aptitude Test to uncover your behavioral tendencies, decision-making styles and workplace preferences, which can help you articulate your unique value. For example, if you\u2019re naturally innovative and thrive in dynamic settings, you can position yourself as a creative problem-solver who excels under pressure\u2014an asset in industries like tech or marketing. Your value lies not just in what you do but in how you approach challenges. One-size-fits-all applications rarely make it past the initial screening. Instead, tailor your resume and cover letter to each role. Highlight relevant experience and accomplishments, use keywords from the job description and demonstrate your knowledge of the company and its goals. For instance, if you're applying for a data analyst position, you could emphasize your experience with statistical software and how you\u2019ve used data to drive business outcomes. When preparing for interviews or networking events, craft compelling narratives about your professional journey. Tailor your stories to the role or industry you're targeting. One technique I recommend is the STAR method: describe a situation, task, action and result to structure your stories. Highlight some of the challenges you've overcome, sharing examples of how you navigated those setbacks to achieve success. A well-told story can create an emotional connection and make you a standout candidate. Technical expertise is important, but in my experience, soft skills are what make you truly stand out. I have observed that employers today particularly value adaptability, emotional intelligence and collaboration. They want to know their team members can thrive in change, understand and manage their own emotions, empathize with others and work effectively in diverse, often remote teams. Showcase these skills through examples during interviews. For instance, consider sharing a story about how you navigated a challenging team project, demonstrating adaptability and collaboration. Industries are evolving at lightning speed, and skills that were essential yesterday might not be relevant tomorrow. Here are a few ways you can stay ahead of the curve: \u2022 Research industry forecasts. Read reports from sources like Forbes, McKinsey and Deloitte to identify emerging trends. \u2022 Upskill strategically. For example, if you\u2019re in marketing, becoming proficient in AI tools for content creation or analytics can make you indispensable. Platforms like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning and Google\u2019s Career Certificates offer courses in in-demand fields like AI, data analysis and sustainability. \u2022 Attend industry events. Virtual and in-person conferences, webinars and networking meetups can provide valuable insights and connections. \u2022 Embrace continuous learning. Seek to maintain a growth mindset, viewing challenges as opportunities to learn. Read books, listen to podcasts and follow industry leaders on social media. Consider participating in professional development programs, and see if your current workplace offers workshops or certifications. Your online presence is often the first impression potential employers or clients will have of you. A compelling personal brand can differentiate you from the competition and position you as an expert in your field. Start by optimizing your LinkedIn profile. Use keywords relevant to your industry, showcase your accomplishments, and include a professional headshot. Create thought leadership content\u2014write articles, share insights or start a blog to demonstrate your expertise. Also, engage with your network to increase your brand's visibility. Remember, consistency is key. Your personal brand should reflect your unique strengths and align with your career goals. The phrase \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know but who you know\u201d holds true. A well-connected network can provide access to opportunities that might not be publicly advertised. Here are a few ways you can go about strengthening your network: \u2022 Seek mentorship. A mentor can offer guidance, open doors and help you navigate career transitions. \u2022 Join professional organizations. Many industries have associations that offer networking events and job boards. \u2022 Leverage alum networks. Reach out to alums from your educational institutions who work in your target field. Feedback is a powerful tool for growth. Regularly seek input from colleagues, mentors and even potential employers to identify areas for improvement. \u2022 Conduct mock interviews. Practice with a career coach or trusted advisor. \u2022 Ask for constructive criticism. Be open to learning from rejection. \u2022 Reflect and adjust. Use feedback to refine your strategy and improve future applications. Standing out in an oversaturated market requires a combination of self-awareness, adaptability and strategic action. By understanding your unique strengths, staying ahead of industry trends and investing in personal growth, you can position yourself as an indispensable candidate or professional.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"CHONGQING, CHINA - FEBRUARY 9: In this photo illustration, the Reddit logo is displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen in front of a stock chart showcasing Reddit's financial performance, social media industry trends, online community growth, and global digital engagement on February 9, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin\/Getty Images) Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) recently announced its Q4 earnings, reporting a profit of $0.36 per share on revenue of $428 million. This exceeded market expectations of $0.25 per share and $405 million in revenue. However, its daily active user (DAU) count fell short of estimates, leading to a sharp drop in RDDT stock during after-hours trading. The company attributed this slower-than-expected DAU growth to fluctuations resulting from changes in Google\u2019s algorithm. Separately, could this stock move on their earnings? See How GoDaddy Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings. Since its IPO at $34 per share in March last year, RDDT stock has surged past $215 earlier this week, significantly outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 16% gain over the same period. Reddit\u2019s strong user engagement has contributed to its stock\u2019s impressive performance. However, if you prefer a less volatile investment alternative, consider the High-Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outpaced the S&P 500 and has delivered over 100% returns since inception. Reddit\u2019s Q4 revenue of $428 million reflected an impressive 71% year-over-year increase, driven by user growth and higher ARPU. DAUs increased by 39% year-over-year to 101.7 million, though this was slightly below the 103.1 million consensus estimate. The company also saw its ARPU climb by 23% to $4.21 in Q4. Additionally, Reddit\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin increased fourfold to 36.1%, up from 9.3% in the previous year\u2019s quarter. Higher revenue and expanding margins resulted in earnings of $0.36 per share, compared to breaking even in the same period last year. Looking ahead, Reddit expects Q1\u201925 revenue of $365 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $85 million at the mid-point of its guidance, surpassing the street\u2019s $358 million estimate. RDDT stock has shown notable volatility since its debut. In contrast, the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, is significantly more stable. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? This portfolio comprises stocks that have historically provided stronger returns with lower risk compared to the broader index, offering a more predictable performance, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current economic uncertainty surrounding interest rate cuts and ongoing trade disputes, could RDDT sustain its upward trajectory? Since the stock was only listed last year, there is no historical data to assess its valuation multiple. At its current price of approximately $200, RDDT trades at 22 times trailing revenue. With sales increasing by 62% in 2024 and expected to grow at a CAGR of over 30% in the next three years, the company\u2019s high valuation multiple appears justified. Additionally, Reddit\u2019s improving profitability suggests that its bottom-line growth could accelerate further. The decline in RDDT stock following the earnings release could represent an opportunity for long-term investors looking for strong returns. Although RDDT shares are currently trending lower, it\u2019s useful to compare how some of its competitors perform on key metrics.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Although the Samsung Galaxy S25 has only been on the market for a short time, rumors have already begun to swirl about the Galaxy S26. Contradicting rumors, at that. Early leaks suggested the flagship might opt for an under-display camera, but a tipster has shared that it isn\u2019t likely \u2014 and that Samsung might not implement that style of camera anytime soon. The under-display cameras have had \u201cpoor results,\u201d according to tipster Panda Flash on X. They claim that under-display cameras don\u2019t perform as well as a standard camera, and that Samsung\u2019s focus on high-end cameras for its flagships means you shouldn\u2019t look for one to come anytime soon. Panda Flash says users shouldn\u2019t expect to see Galaxy Ultras with under-display cameras for the next two to three years at least. Samsung does use an under-display camera in the Galaxy Z Fold lineup, but the company\u2019s focus has been AI features. Galaxy AI could remain the primary feature for the next few generations, with cameras taking a backseat aside from standard upgrades. The launch of the phone is still too far away to confirm any concrete details, but we\u2019ve heard a few enticing leaks that make the Galaxy S26 sound incredibly promising. According to one leak, the handset could arrive with a battery as large as 7,000mAh. Considering that even the Galaxy S25 Ultra only has a 5,000mAh battery, that\u2019s a massive upgrade. Other tips suggest that Samsung could return to an all-Exynos lineup for its next series of phones with the new Exynos 2600 chip. Although Samsung has a history of taking a more consumer-friendly approach to repairing devices, it hasn't always been an easy task. And in some cases, Samsung doesn't take the friendliest view of third-party components. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has taken a step forward, as iFixit has dubbed it the \"most repairable Galaxy phone in years\" in a recent press release. Here's why. The Galaxy S25 Ultra uses four small tabs to hold the battery in place. If you need to remove it, you just pull those tabs up and the battery releases with ease. It's a much simpler method than iPhone's electrochemical release, but there's still a long journey ahead before Galaxy phones are as repairable as they should be. With the Samsung Galaxy S25 series now available, the company's attention is turning to its next handset, the Galaxy S25 Edge. The phone is expected to be a game-changer and will likely be marketed against Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone 17 Air. Now we know better when the Samsung phone could be released. According to tipster Max Jambor (via Android Headlines), the new phone should be available for purchase during the year's second quarter. Previous rumors suggested the phone would be available sometime around April, so the tip seems to confirm this. The new Samsung Galaxy S25 series is now available worldwide. This lineup includes the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra, all featuring an array of advanced AI capabilities. Many of these features were highlighted during Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy Unpacked event, where the company announced the new phones. Many were not, however. Android Authority discovered that one of those new features is\u00a0\u201csuggested replies.\u201d The feature, available for the Samsung Keyboard, uses on-device AI models to offer potential responses to messages you receive.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"For the last months mobile fans have been watching the Oppo Find N5 foldable phone news with interest, as it was widely expected to be very similar to the OnePlus Open 2, which unlike the Oppo phone would almost certainly be released in the U.S. during 2025. Unfortunately, OnePlus has crushed our hopes for such a phone, and clearly stated in a blog post that it has, \u201cmade the decision not to release a foldable this year.\u201d That\u2019s right, no OnePlus Open 2. Here\u2019s what it means, and why it\u2019s bad news. For those who don\u2019t know, Oppo entered into a partnership with OnePlus in 2021, when the two brands (both were also once separate parts of the defunct BBK Electronics empire) began working closely together on software and hardware. The OnePlus blog post shared on its Community Forum starts out by saying the company has been observing the tech world\u2019s interest in the Oppo Find N5, and the anticipation for a OnePlus version of the phone. \u201cAt OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWith that in mind, we\u2019ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year.\u201d There\u2019s no ambiguity here. It\u2019s very clear that not only will the OnePlus Open 2 not be coming this year, but there won\u2019t be a compact foldable to challenge phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Motorola Razr Plus either. The post goes on to say, \u201cwhile this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time,\u201d and adds how it\u2019s going to let Oppo \u201ctake the lead\u201d in foldables. If the Find N5 isn\u2019t going to morph into the OnePlus Open 2 in 2025, there would be no point in it doing so in 2026 either, as it would be too far, technically, behind the curve. Few would be excited about a rebranded 2024 foldable in 2026. It seems OnePlus has given itself an entire year to assess how it next approaches foldable phones \u2014 it calls this a \u201cpause\u201d and a \u201crecalibration,\u201d indicating it\u2019s not leaving the space completely \u2014 but in reality it may have even longer to ponder. The Oppo Find N3 arrived at the end of 2023, around the same time as the OnePlus Open. Oppo was happy to let the Find N3 continue on throughout 2024 (skipping the Find N4), while OnePlus vaguely refreshed the Open with the OnePlus Open Apex Edition mid-way through the year. The Find N5 looks all set to be a considerable step forward over the Find N3, not least because it will take the crown of \u201cworld\u2019s thinnest foldable phone\u201d from the Honor Magic V3. For this reason, Oppo may decide the Find N5 will carry its big-screen foldable hopes well into 2026. OnePlus and Oppo worked together on the Find N3\/Open, meaning it\u2019s unlikely OnePlus will go it alone on the development of an Open 2 and will wait to jointly develop a sequel to the Find N5 with Oppo. When OnePlus decides it\u2019s ready to make another foldable phone, it\u2019s possible such a device won\u2019t arrive until well into 2026. By that point, it may as well follow Oppo\u2019s odd naming decision and call it the OnePlus Open 3. There are two big reasons why this is bad news. The first is a continued lack of variety in big-screen foldables in the U.S., where it\u2019s the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or nothing. Both these phones are great \u2014 the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was one of my personal favorites last year \u2014 but without competition, prices won\u2019t drop and brands won\u2019t feel the need to quickly innovate. OnePlus will tell you the OnePlus Open Apex Edition is its 2025 foldable, but we all know this is marketing spin. It\u2019s a facelift Open, which was released at the end of 2023. It\u2019s also bad news for adoption, crucial to the growth of foldables in general, and this may be the unsaid reason OnePlus has decided against a foldable this year: they just aren\u2019t selling enough to make it worthwhile. Data collected by Counterpoint Research at the end of 2024 showed global foldable phone shipments decreased slightly between July and September, and that Samsung ruled the market with a 56% share. Tellingly, this number was substantially down on its 70% share for the prior period. This wasn\u2019t an unforeseen event. In its Worldwide Foldable Phone Forecast released in early 2024, research firm IDC wrote, \u201cFoldables were a hard sell in 2023, as many vendors struggled to move significant inventory. The market has not fully embraced the form factor. High prices and longevity remain a challenge to both consumers and vendors.\u201d However, it\u2019s not like other brands aren\u2019t finding success with foldables. Vivo and Xiaomi gained ground in 2024 with the X Fold 3 Pro\u00a0and Mix Flip respectively. Honor continues to build interesting and innovative folding phones, as does Tecno with its Phantom series. OnePlus\u2019s decision (or Oppo\u2019s decision, depending on how you view the partnership) may see it fall behind the competition over the next year. But because the overall Oppo\/OnePlus business won\u2019t suffer due to the Find N5\u2019s existence, it\u2019s only BUYERS that suffer, particularly in the U.S. where the other foldables mentioned aren\u2019t officially sold. The death of the OnePlus Open 2 in 2025 is bad news for us, but does it leave OnePlus in a terrible position for the year? No, absolutely not. It has kicked off 2025 with what I\u2019m beginning to think is the best phone it has ever made, the OnePlus 13. There are very few downsides to it, and the aggressive price means it really should be at the top of anyone\u2019s list when considering other phones like the Google Pixel 9 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. I think it should be seriously considered over the Galaxy S25 Ultra too. The OnePlus 13R is also well worth your attention. Even without the Open 2, OnePlus is well on its way to a stellar 2025, but the OnePlus 13\u2019s resounding success is somewhat bittersweet, as if it brought the same magic to the Open 2, along with a modest strategic price drop, it could have stolen the market from the aging (and a bit dull) Galaxy Z Fold 6, and pricey Pixel 9 Pro Fold. But now, sadly, all discussion of the OnePlus Open 2 has become a case of \u201cwhat could have been.\u201d The OnePlus Open 2 promises to be an incredibly slender device, perhaps even the thinnest phone ever made. Leaks earlier in the year suggested a thickness of just 9.2mm, and now an image shared by Oppo executive Billy Zhang gives us a look at just how slim the phone actually is. The Oppo Find N5 \u2014 believed to have a virtually identical design to the OnePlus Open 2 \u2014 is smaller than the iPad Pro, a device that is 5.3mm thick. While folded, the OnePlus Open 2 is said to be less than 9.2mm, and somewhere under five when unfolded with a weight of less than 219 grams. Foldable phones are great, but one crucial aspect where they leave buyers second-guessing whether they should spend so much on a new device is their weak resilience against the elements. Take the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which is stuck at IP48, good enough for basic immersion in water only. Moreover, it is not dust-tight, either. Oppo\u2019s imminent foldable phone \u2014 and OnePlus\u2019 too, by that extension \u2014 will be sturdy enough to take it in the bath, the shower, or the occasional underwater video capture session, as well. The next from Oppo, dubbed the Find N5, has officially been confirmed to offer IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 full-grade waterproofing. Oppo\u2019s Chief Product Officer, Pete Lau, recently teased the upcoming Oppo Find N5, describing it as the \u201cworld\u2019s thinnest folding flagship\" while also offering a photo of the device hidden behind a pencil, just to demonstrate its lack of girth. Just a few days later, Finnish leaker Teme shared photos that may show the new device in more detail, and emphasize just how thin it will be. As shown in the three images below, the Oppo Find N5 appears to have what it takes to become the thinnest folding flagship phone on the market. One of the photos also shows the phone\u2019s camera layout. As the leaker explains: \u201cOppo Find N5 thinness and camera layout. OnePlus has not confirmed anything yet whether this will also be the [OnePlus] Open 2.\u201d Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Business Insider Edition  After her job contract for the City of New York ended amid the pandemic, Tanya was left scrambling. The 55-year-old was juggling roles as an adjunct media professor, community activist, and writer in New York City, but still needed some extra cash. A friend introduced her to Taskrabbit, where she spent a few years earning money by running errands, working the odd event, and pet-sitting. Then in January 2024, she came across a side hustle she'd never seen before: someone was offering their services to stand in line. It was something, she thought, she could also easily do.          In major cities, standing in line has become all the rage, a \"scene\" unto itself; hourslong lines are now the price of entry to secure restaurant reservations, concert tickets, brand merch, bagels, and more. Retail brands are leaning into the luxury of the real-life experience, offering more exclusive events and you-had-to-be-there sample sales that bring out hundreds of fans. When the Hailey Bieber-backed beauty brand Rhode did pop-ups in New York and London in the fall, for instance, people waited in the cold for seven hours just to snag a single tube of lip balm.               In order to beat the queues, professional line-standers have become a growing part of the gig economy. While the cash-rich, time-poor have been sending their assistants ahead to get early access for years, more people are joining them in outsourcing their time. Bookings for professional standing line services on Taskrabbit experienced an 18% increase in the US in November and December compared to the previous year, the company found, earning those willing to wait an average of $27 an hour. For people with more money than time, it's an easy way to save a few precious hours. For those who wait, it's not a bad deal.               The process to become a line sitter is simple: Tanya, who asked that we just use her first name to protect her privacy, will get a notification saying someone is interested in hiring her to stand in line. After reviewing the details and making sure it is something she can do, she will contact the client and ask for specifics.               Certain restaurants like the pizzeria Lucali in Brooklyn \u2014 which saw a 30% increase in bookings the month after Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce made an appearance \u2014 only take in-person reservations, leading to long wait times.               \"You need to know how many people they have in their party and what time they would like to go,\" Tanya says. The first people in line for a popular spot typically show up a couple of hours before a host comes out to take reservations. When it's Tanya's turn at the front she will tell the host the client's preferred timings for later that evening. \"I also always ask for alternative times because you never know where you're going to get until you're up there,\" she adds. The client then comes back at the reserved time to claim their table.               Tanya quickly learned that different lines have different protocols. Waiting for Broadway tickets or an art gallery is not the same as waiting in line at a popular restaurant. For \"the really sought-after places like Lucali and Don Angie\" she says, she's started charging a two-hour minimum for clients to have a shot at a reservation. If clients don't want to fork out for the extra hours to guarantee a front-of-line spot, Tanya can't make any promises.               One time a client insisted that Tanya start waiting for a reservation at Lucali at 3 p.m., an hour before reservations are taken. She didn't end up getting the reservation. \"They were disappointed,\" Tanya said, adding that they \"hesitated to pay.\" But she has never been stiffed for failing to get a spot.               \"Some places the process is very predictable,\" she tells me. \"In other places, you have no idea whether you're going to get a spot or not.\"               Tanya charges $20 an hour. Clients will generally book a day or two in advance, but sometimes she will activate same-day tasks and take on last-minute requests. She normally makes herself available on Friday nights and weekends, averaging about three-line-standing bookings a week and earning between $60 and $200. \"It's definitely one of my most consistent task categories,\" Tanya says. \"It's relatively easy, but then it's not. You do have to have patience and you do have to come prepared.\"               Her longest line to date was for tickets to Gutenberg! The Musical! on Broadway. \"It was a limited engagement and it was closing,\" she tells me. \"People were really going crazy trying to get these tickets.\" It was January 2024 and one of the coldest days of the year. The client had paid for her to stand in line from 6 a.m. until the box office opened at noon. Other people didn't start showing up until 9:30. \"I was freezing, it was brutal. It tested everything I had,\" she says. Despite wearing two coats, two hats, a scarf, and two pairs of gloves, \"I couldn't even feel my hands or my face,\" she says.               To make the wait slightly less gruelling Tanya brought a stool to sit on to and a hot drink to sip on. She also listened to a high-energy playlist she had compiled specifically for these types of gigs, featuring hits from The Greatest Showman, Michael Jackson, and Beyonc. \"The last thing I would listen to is something really slow that makes me sleepy,\" she says. The client, a local New Yorker, met her in the line shortly before noon so that they could both purchase the two-ticket-limit each. On top of $120 for standing in line, they gave Tanya a $50 tip.               Professional line-standing is not limited to New York. Jennifer Goff, 38, first tried her hand at making some money from waiting in line at a Game of Thrones pop-up bar in Washington, DC, in 2017. After three hours of trying to convince those already in the queue to hire her to stand in for them while they went for a drink or grabbed some food, someone bit. From there, standing in line snowballed into a full-time business. She launched Skip The Line, which now employs five people part-time and charges $30 to $40 an hour for their services. Goff has stood in line for concerts, book signings, new iPhones, and releases of limited-edition liquors. However, her most lucrative jobs are standing in line for Supreme Court hearings.               \"They generally only allow the first 50 people in line to attend the oral arguments,\" she tells me. \"So people do have to line up, sometimes for days.\" In November, she was booked to stand in line 24 hours in advance for the US v. Skrmetti Supreme Court hearings, which dealt with whether minors could receive gender-affirming care. In 2023, she was booked 36 hours in advance to secure a spot at the United States v. Donald J. Trump hearings, which addressed presidential immunity. For bookings of this length, Goff's team will work in shifts that range from about four to eight hours at a time. If they need to quickly grab a snack or use the bathroom, other members of Goff's team will keep an eye on their spot. For both cases, she got her clients seats in the courtroom.               Goff has found that others in the line are interested in hearing about her services. \"It's a popular topic of conversation,\" she says. \"When you're standing in line for a very long time, it's natural to start chatting with others around you. There will also be some folks who keep to themselves or have headphones, but for the most part, no matter the line, people like to converse with each other.\"               Tanya, for the most part, works alone. \"I used to work as a reporter,\" she tells me, working 12 to 14 hours straight covering breaking crime stories. \"I would go for hours and hours when I was on assignment and not even eat or go to the restroom.\" Standing in line, in comparison, is light work. \"I can hold it,\" she says.               At some of the most coveted spots, Tanya will be one of many hired line standers. \"They know my face, I know their face.\" Sometimes, it can get competitive. In the Lucali line recently, five people tried to slip in ahead of her as she approached the front, but she stood her ground. \"It was cold, I'd been waiting for two hours,\" she recalls. \"It was not gonna happen.\"               As lines get more time-consuming and competitive, more services have sprung up to help people save time. Startups like LineLeap allow people to pay to skip the line at bars, clubs, and concerts it has partnered with, while credit card companies like American Express have snatched up restaurant booking apps to offer their cardholders more exclusive opportunities. Online marketplace Appointment Trader lets people buy and sell reservations, and subscription-based apps like Access charge up to $300 a month to reserve tables at top restaurants.               Of course, the economics of line-skipping don't work out in favor of everyone who has to camp out in the cold \u2014 something anyone who has watched people bypass them in the fast pass lane at an amusement park can attest to. For that reason, some venues don't allow line skipping. A new law in New York is also cracking down on the restaurant reservation black market, requiring third-party reservation apps to obtain consent from restaurants before they can market and sell their reservations. Popular spots like \"Saturday Night Live\" have outright banned paying to bypass the line and many restaurants disapprove of it, so Tanya has to convince the hosts that the reservation is for her. \"I've gotten smarter,\" she says. \"I memorize the person's name and act like they're with me.\"               Still, some people get mad when they realize she is being paid to stand in line. \"One person asked me, 'How early do you get here?',\" Tanya says. She explained her process and that she had to start arriving earlier and earlier to beat out other line standers. \"'That's not really fair,'\" the person responded. \"'If everyone in line is getting paid to do this, it leaves the rest of us with less chance to get a reservation.'\"               Tanya and Goff were quick to defend line skippers. Goff's clients range from attorneys and activist groups to journalists without press passes and individuals physically unable to endure long waits. It's not just for the wealthy; the services allow people to choose what they value more \u2014 time or money. \"Life is busy. You don't owe an explanation,\" Tanya says. \"If you can find one way in this world to make your life a little easier, why wouldn't you take it?\"               Although Tanya waited in line at Lucali over 20 times last year, she's never waited for herself. Her personal line standing mainly involves getting tickets to Broadway shows. \"I wouldn't say never,\" she says about waiting for Lucali, \"but I think I'd do it on a nice day.\"       Eve Upton-Clark is a features writer covering culture and society.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"BARCELONA, SPAIN - FEBRUARY 4: A logo sits illuminated outside the Intel booth at ISE 2025 on ... [+] February 4, 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. Integrated Systems Europe (ISE), the second largest professional congress to be held in Barcelona this year, expects to attract more than 80,000 attendants. ISE occupies the entire Fira Barcelona space and has more than 1,600 exhibiting companies. One of the major novelties this year is the installation of an area dedicated to eSports. (Photo by Cesc Maymo\/Getty Images) Intel stock performed well over the last two days, climbing approximately 12% across Monday and Tuesday. Several factors have contributed to Intel\u2019s recent surge. Intel has made significant investments in its U.S.-based foundry operations over recent years. Although this unit has struggled\u2014posting a loss of nearly $13 billion last year\u2014there are signs of improvement. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance recently mentioned at a conference that the Trump Administration aims to have AI chip design and production take place domestically to protect American AI technology and intellectual property. This could lead to regulatory measures promoting domestic semiconductor manufacturing. For instance, tariffs could be introduced to raise costs for foreign chipmakers exporting to the U.S. A shift toward domestic production through tariffs or other policies could benefit Intel\u2019s foundry business as companies seek U.S.-based suppliers to avoid extra costs. See how Trump and New Manufacturing Processes Help Intel Stock.  Major customers like Microsoft and Amazon have already contracted Intel to manufacture some of their custom AI chips, and this trend may accelerate. Unlike Intel, its key rivals, AMD and Nvidia, do not operate their own fabrication facilities and rely on overseas foundries such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. As Intel advances its fabrication technology, including its 18A process, competitors may also consider shifting some of their production to Intel. If you\u2019re looking for growth with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. Additionally, Intel\u2019s latest processor, the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, has received favorable reviews. Benchmark results from PassMark indicate that the new Arrow Lake-based chip outperforms AMD\u2019s Ryzen 9 processor by approximately 7% in CPU tests. It is also 34% faster than the prior-generation i9-14900HX, with single-thread performance improving by 9%. Unlike Intel\u2019s AI-centric Lunar Lake processors, these chips focus on delivering high performance for demanding creative and productivity workloads.  This launch comes at an opportune moment. Over the last two years, companies have primarily focused on acquiring GPUs to support AI-driven initiatives, potentially neglecting investment in traditional CPUs. As CPU demand rebounds, Intel may stand to gain after experiencing market share declines in both consumer and server segments. Over the past four years, INTC stock has been highly volatile compared to the S&P 500. Annual returns have varied significantly: 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, 95% in 2023, and -60% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has been far less volatile and has outperformed the S&P 500 over this period.  Why is this the case? HQ Portfolio stocks, as a group, have provided better returns with lower risk, avoiding the dramatic fluctuations seen in individual stocks. This is evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. With an uncertain economic outlook, including potential interest rate cuts and global conflicts, will INTC continue underperforming as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2024, or could a recovery be on the horizon? Intel stock currently trades at around $21 per share, or just over 20 times the projected 2025 earnings\u2014an arguably reasonable valuation. Trefis estimates Intel\u2019s fair value at approximately $27 per share, significantly above its current market price. Despite challenges over the last few years, Intel\u2019s strategic investments in foundry operations, improved CPUs, and a potential slowdown in AI-driven GPU spending could all work in its favor.

DeepSeek is challenging ChatGPT with speed and cost, but security flaws and censorship concerns raise red flags. Since launching to the public on Jan. 20, 2025, Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s open-source AI-powered chatbot has taken the tech world by storm. As the top free app by downloads in the U.S. Apple app store since Jan. 26 \u2013 with 16 million app downloads in its first 18 days (ChatGPT had 9 million in the same timeframe) \u2013 DeepSeek\u2019s performance and accompanying search feature is at least on par with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost. Its launch led U.S.-based AI technology company, Nvidia, to the greatest drop in market value for a U.S. company in U.S. stock market history. That\u2019s quite an entrance! U.S. tech analysts and investors seem to all fear that the U.S. is falling behind in the generative AI global race. This may be warranted considering how quickly and cost-effectively DeepSeek was able to get R1 developed and out the door. DeepSeek utilizes reinforcement learning, meaning the model learns complex reasoning behaviors through reinforcement without supervised fine-tuning, which allows it to save significant computational resources. But, is DeepSeek really going to emerge as the leader in AI? And what are the implications for this development for the future of search? Let\u2019s dive in. While U.S. tech companies were humbled by the speed and claimed cost efficiency of this launch, DeepSeek\u2019s arrival has not been without controversy. A lot of questions lurk, ranging from suspected intellectual property violations to security, data privacy, Chinese censorship, and the true cost of its technology. OpenAI and Microsoft are investigating whether DeepSeek used OpenAI\u2019s API to integrate their AI models into DeepSeek\u2019s own models. OpenAI claims it has evidence of DeepSeek distilling the outputs of OpenAI to build a rival model, which is against OpenAI\u2019s terms of service, but likely not against the law. Distillation allows for the transfer of knowledge of a large pre-trained model into a smaller model, which enables the smaller model to achieve comparable performance to the large one while reducing costs. This is more than a little ironic given the lawsuits against OpenAI for ignoring other site\u2019s terms of service and using their copyrighted internet data to train its systems. There are also questions about where user data is stored and how it is processed, given that DeepSeek is a Chinese-based startup. For anyone handling customer information and payment details, integrating a tool like DeepSeek that stores data in a foreign jurisdiction could violate data protection laws and expose sensitive information to unauthorized access. Given that DeepSeek has yet to provide its privacy policies, industry experts and security researchers advise using extreme caution with sensitive information in DeepSeek. Wiz Research, a company specializing in cloud security, announced it was able to hack DeepSeek and expose security risks with relative ease on Jan. 29. It found a publicly accessible database belonging to DeepSeek, which allowed it full control over database operations and access to user data and API keys. Wiz alerted the DeepSeek team, and they took immediate action to secure the data. However, it is unclear who else accessed or downloaded the data before it was secured. While it\u2019s not uncommon for startups to move fast and make mistakes, this is a particularly large mistake and shows DeepSeek\u2019s lack of focus on cybersecurity so far. There are national security concerns about DeepSeek\u2019s data collection policies reminiscent of fears about TikTok, which saw a similar rise in global prominence out of Chinese-based company ByteDance. The U.S. government briefly banned TikTok in January 2025, which came out of concerns about how the company was collecting data about users. There were also fears that the Chinese government could use the platform to influence the public in the U.S. A few incidents in the last several years that initiated that fear include TikTok employees utilizing location data from the app to track reporters to find a source of leaked information, and TikTok employees being reported to have plans to track specific U.S. citizens. While TikTok is active in the U.S. right now, its future is unconfirmed. For similar reasons to the TikTok concerns, a number of governments around the world, including Australia and Italy, are already working to ban DeepSeek from government systems and devices. The U.S. is also considering a ban on DeepSeek. Regardless of whether you run DeepSeek locally or in its app, DeepSeek\u2019s censorship is present for queries deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, according to a Wired investigation. However, because it is open source, there are ways of getting around the censorship, but it\u2019s difficult. Doing so would require running on your own servers using modified versions of the publicly available DeepSeek code, which means you\u2019d need access to several highly advanced GPUs to run the most powerful version of R1. Much has been written about the cost of building DeepSeek. Initial claims by DeepSeek were that it took under $6 million to build based on the rental price of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. However, a report from SemiAnalysis, a semiconductor research and consulting firm, has since argued that DeepSeek\u2019s hardware spend was higher than $500 million, along with additional R&D costs. For context, OpenAI lost about $5 billion in 2024 and anticipates it will lose more than $11 billion in 2025. Even if DeepSeek did cost $500 million or more, it still cut costs compared to what leading competitors are spending. So, how did they cut costs? Before DeepSeek came along, the leading AI technologies were built on neural networks, which are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of computing power. Specialized computer chips called graphics processing units (GPUs) are an effective way to do this kind of data analysis. This is how chipmaker Nvidia grew to prominence (and also had a huge fall in market value on the day DeepSeek launched). GPUs cost around $40,000 and require considerable electricity, which is why leading AI technologies like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT were so expensive to build. Sending data between chips can also require more energy than running the chips themselves. DeepSeek was able to reduce costs, most notably by using a method called \u201cmixture of experts.\u201d Instead of creating one neural network that learned data patterns on the internet, they split the system into many neural networks and launched smaller \u201cexpert\u201d systems paired with a \u201cgeneralist\u201d system, reducing the amount of data needed to travel between GPU chips. DeepSeek-R1 is as \u201copen-source\u201d as any LLM has been thus far, which means anyone can download, use, or modify its code. Similar to Meta\u2019s Llama, the code and technical explanations are shared, enabling developers and organizations to utilize the model for their own business needs, but the training data is not fully disclosed. Many believe DeepSeek is a big step toward democratizing AI, allowing smaller companies and developers to build on DeepSeek-R1 and achieve greater AI feats faster. This could lead to more innovation in places with more limited access to the tech needed to build AI solutions. But, critics fear that open-source models can expose security vulnerabilities that could be exploited, which we\u2019ve already seen in DeepSeek\u2019s first weeks in the public. So, what does this all really mean for search professionals? The way I see it, DeepSeek is just the next splashy AI chatbot with search capabilities in the rapidly changing world of SEO. It\u2019s important to understand that while tools like DeepSeek and ChatGPT use advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, they still simply provide answers to real questions that real people ask. Their responses heavily focus on semantic understanding, intent matching, and contextual analysis, but they ultimately serve the same core user need. While we have years of experience testing optimization tactics on more established search engines like Google, we\u2019re still at the beginning stages of understanding optimization for generative AI chatbots. Whether DeepSeek will stick and grow in prominence remains to be seen. Obviously, if other governments follow Australia, Italy, and potentially the U.S. to ban DeepSeek, that would limit its potential for growth. And much as DeepSeek rose to prominence rapidly by providing a blueprint for others and significantly lowering costs, a new market-moving AI could always be just around the corner. Regardless of what happens with DeepSeek, we are at the beginning of a very rapid period of innovation in AI technology. As SEO professionals, we need to be prepared to test a surge of new platforms and reverse engineer how they arrive at their responses to user queries.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Alienware's m18 R2 is one of the best gaming laptops on the market, especially when you add high-end hardware that can easily tackle any title on the market with ease. It's a laptop we've tested and reviewed here at Windows Central, so rest assured I'm not attempting to peddle a subpar gaming PC that's only attractive because of its discounted price. This is the real deal. Dell's monster flagship gaming laptop usually costs about $2,800 for this specific configuration, which includes an Intel Core i9 CPU and NVIDIA RTX 4080 Laptop GPU. However, it's currently $500 off at Amazon, bringing the price down to $2,299.99. That's a better price than you'll find anywhere, including Dell's official site. Alienware m18 R2Was: $2,799.99Now: $2,299.99 at Amazon \"The Alienware m18 R2 is a beast of a gaming laptop in both size and performance. With up to a 14th Gen Intel Core i9 and up to an NVIDIA RTX-40 Series GPU, it can handle even the most demanding games at high frames per second. A good refresh rate, response time, and color range also provide excellent picture quality and motion clarity.\" Windows Central review:\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd \u2705Perfect for: Gamers who don't want to compromise performance for mobility. CherryMX mechanical keyboard is awesome. \u274cAvoid if: You'd like a smaller laptop that's easier to carry around, or you prefer something with an OLED display. Display: 18 inches, 2560x1600, 165Hz, 3ms, G-SYNC, 100% DCI-P3. CPU: Intel Core i9-14900HX. GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4080L. RAM: 32GB DDR5-5600. SSD: 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe. Battery: 97Wh. AI PC: \u2716\ufe0f Copilot+ PC: \u2716\ufe0f Launch date: 2024. \ud83d\udc49 See at: Amazon.com \ud83d\udc40 Price check: $2,379.99 at Dell  With NVIDIA's poorly received RTX 5000 launch that saw the new GPUs sell out in seconds, I know that many gamers are wondering how to navigate the current hardware landscape with several generations of GPUs available. Do you wait and hope to get your hands on a desktop RTX 50-series GPU? Do you spend large on an RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 laptop? Or do you save some money and buy an RTX 40-series system that's enjoying a discount? If you're keen on the last option I listed and want to grab a great laptop at a discount, this Alienware m18 R2 deal is probably looking too good to pass up. A $500 discount isn't minor, matching many of the best sales I usually see during major events like Prime Day and Black Friday. I poked around to try and find a better deal on the Alienware m18 R2 elsewhere, but it looks like Amazon has this one sewn up. It's important to note that the NVIDIA RTX 5080 Laptop GPU is expected to offer a more significant improvement over its predecessor than the desktop counterparts. I urge you to check out Senior Editor Ben Wilson's RTX 5080 review, which includes important metrics for the desktop GPU. However, just because the mobile RTX 5080 is faster than the mobile RTX 4080 doesn't mean the older card isn't worth buying. The RTX 4080 Laptop GPU is still a monster piece of hardware with the ability to run just about any modern game to the built-in display's limit. Intel's Core i9-14900HX CPU is also impressive, boasting 24 total cores, 32 threads, and a 5.8GHz max Turbo frequency. The best part, at least for enthusiasts who enjoy tweaking their system, is that HX-series chips can be overclocked with something like Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility.  As one of Dell's flagship gaming laptops, the Alienware m18 R2 comes packed with premium features that you don't often find in cheaper laptops. I'm talking primarily about the CherryMX mechanical RGB keyboard, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, IR sensor for Windows Hello, and a generous mix of ports (including dual Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, and many more). Don't just take my word for it: Windows Central Editor Rebecca Spear tested and reviewed the Alienware m18 R2, giving it a Best Award and 4.5 stars in the process. Here's what she has to say about the keyboard: \"I could honestly drone on and on for hours when it comes to how amazing the mechanical Cherry MX ultra-low profile keyboard feels. From the moment that I first pressed down on one of the Alienware m18 R2's keys, I fell in love. These linear switches react very quickly with little coaxing from me, which means they relay in-game demands very fast. There's also the option to go with a less expensive RGB backlit M Series keyboard if you want to save some money.\"  The laptop's display does not have an OLED panel, but it's hard to knock the specs beyond that omission. It's an 18-inch screen with a 2560x1600 resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, 3ms response time, NVIDIA G-SYNC, and 100% DCI-P3 color. It tops out at about 310 nits of brightness, but as long as you aren't playing outdoors it shouldn't pose a problem. Here's what Spear has to say about the Alienware m18 R2's screen: \"From the moment I first laid eyes on the display, I knew that the m18 R2's IPS screen provided excellent picture quality and motion clarity. Colors come through vibrantly, everything looks crisp, and game visuals are extremely smooth. The 18-inch IPS QHD+ (2560 x 1600) display offers a 3ms response time with the option of going between a 60Hz or a 165Hz refresh rate. On top of that, G-Sync reduces lag and stutter.\" Finally, performance should be nothing less than stellar. The Core i9-14900HX CPU, RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, and 32GB of DDR5 RAM come together to crush any game on the market. Spear tested Cyberpunk 2077 \u2014 one of the most demanding games out there \u2014 on the laptop, noting: \"After getting a personal feel for m18 R2 performance, I switched gears and ran some benchmark testing. One of the first tests I ran was the Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark, where I put settings at the default Ray Tracing low. The laptop managed to average a whopping 116 fps. Encouraged by these excellent results, I upped the graphics settings to Overdrive then proceeded to turn on DLSS, Path Tracing, and Ray Reconstruction. Even with these far more demanding settings in place, the Alienware m18 R2 didn't flinch. It provided an extremely impressive average of 87 fps, which is beautifully smooth to watch. That's incredible and shows just how powerful this laptop really is.\" All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":" Robinhood (HOOD) shares surged in pre-market activity Thursday after the popular trading app reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates driven by a massive jump in crypto revenue. The company reported $358 million in crypto transaction revenue in the quarter, the highest contribution from digital-asset trading to date, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. JPMorgan raised its price target for the stock to $45 from $39, while maintaining its neutral rating. Citi (C) raised its target to $60 from $45 and kept its neutral rating on the stock. Broker Bernstein more than doubled it price objective to $105 from $51 and kept an outperform rating on the shares. The stock jumped 13% to $63.20 in early trading Thursday following results, released after the market closed on Wednesdy. Robinhood said fourth-quarter revenue rose 115% from the previous year to $1.01 billion, beating Wall Street analysts' estimate of $945.8 million, according to FactSet data. Transaction-based earnings increased 200% year-on-year, mainly due to a 700% rise in cryptocurrency revenue. Crypto revenue normally contributes 10%-20% of total revenue, JPMorgan noted. The 46% jump in total cryptocurrency market cap in the period and the increase in Robinhood notional volumes, which were 393% higher quarter-on-quarter, fueled the revenue beat. The company has big plans for its crypto business. \"Management seeks to add more tokens, strengthen its wallet offering, add an order book with exchange routing functionality, integrate Bitstamp and explore tokenization longer-term,\" the report said. Robinhood has benefitted from favorable trends since the start of the year, with \"crypto market tailwinds and retail activity remaining strong,\" Citi said. If this positive backdrop is maintained, the shares are likely to see support, but investors should expect volatility. While the bank has become more positive on the company's fundamental outlook, it said it preferred to wait for a \"more reasonable entry point.\" Bernstein reiterated that Robinhood was the best idea in the broker's global digital assets coverage. It said it expected continued momentum in the first quarter \"driven by crypto volatility and a sustained price cycle.\" Read more: Robinhood's Big Earnings Beat Could Bode Well for Coinbase  Will Canny is an experienced market reporter with a demonstrated history of working in the financial services industry.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"OpenAI CEO says his ChatGPT usage has increased over the past few months as it evolves into the \"everything app.\"  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Despite the increasingly alarming reports of AI tools like ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot hallucinating, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently indicated that his ChatGPT usage has significantly increased over the past few years (via Tsarnick on X). According to Altman: \"I realized, over the last couple of months, that I don't use a lot of the services that I used to use. Like I don't do Google searches anymore, unless it's a very specific thing.\" The executive admits that Google continues to hold a firm grasp on the search market share but presents an argument that ChatGPT presents an oracular system that allows users to do anything that they would have ordinarily turned to other services. Sam Altman says over the past year, ChatGPT has become an \"oracular system\" so that he doesn't need to use other services like Google any more pic.twitter.com\/WcRbFDsPzaFebruary 11, 2025 As you may know, OpenAI recently shipped an AI-powered search engine called ChatGPT search. Market analysts and experts predict that the service could give Google and Bing a run for their money. They further indicated that Google may have bigger fish to fry with the AI-powered search engine than the antitrust ruling, which deems it an illegal monopoly pending regulation. This is especially true after OpenAI made the service available for everyone for free and lifted the account requirement to access the service. For context, the AI-powered search engine was previously buried behind OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus or Team $20 subscription plan.  While reports suggest scaling laws have begun stunting the progression of AI, predominantly due to a lack of high-quality content for model training, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated, \"There is no wall.\" Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt echoed similar sentiments, indicating that there's no evidence scaling laws have actually begun. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Recently expounding further on these claims, Sam Altman claimed: \"Better algorithms, bigger computers, harder data sets to train on, building better products that help us learn more from feedback with users about what's not working.\" Sam Altman: \"I cannot overstate how much progress we're going to make in the next 2 years. We know how to improve these models so, so much... the progress I would expect from February of '25 to February of '27 will feel more impressive than February of '23 to February of '25\" pic.twitter.com\/B5SWgTqqUxFebruary 7, 2025 Perhaps more interestingly, the executive claimed OpenAI is on the verge of a major breakthrough that would allow the company to scale greater heights at a neck-breaking speed within the next two years. I cannot overstate how much progress we're going to make in the next 2 years. We know how to improve these models so, so much... the progress I would expect from February of '25 to February of '27 will feel more impressive than February of '23 to February of '25. These claims build on Altman's predictions from last year, citing that superintelligence will trigger a 10x surge in scientific AI breakthroughs, making each year as revolutionary as a decade.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. eBay is running some killer deals right now with unbeatable prices on refurbished laptops, like this Chromebook for just over a hundred bucks. But if you prefer Windows, you can get an equally amazing deal from Acer, whose official eBay account is selling an AMD-powered touchscreen laptop with 16GB of RAM for just $271.99. The Acer Aspire 3 offers a 15.6-inch 1080p touchscreen, a mid-range AMD Ryzen 5 7520U\u00a0quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM (which is as low as I would go for Windows 11 these days), and a roomy 1TB SSD. Those specs are hard to find on any Windows laptop under $500 right now, but Acer is selling a refurbished one for $339.99 \u2014 and with a 20 percent discount with code PREZ20, you can get it for even less. PCWorld reviewed a similar model of this laptop back in 2023. That model\u2019s specs were different, but appears to be the same chassis. It was already a good pick at that $330 price, and that was with less RAM and storage and lacking a touchscreen. You can read the full review here. While this one on sale is a refurbished model, Acer did the refurbishing and even bundles the laptop with a two-year Allstate warranty. That\u2019s about as good as it gets for consumer electronics in less-than-new condition, and it\u2019s kibble for the penny-pincher. I\u2019ll also point out that this model can be upgraded with even more RAM and storage if you\u2019re so inclined (which isn\u2019t a given with laptops these days). Acer has already sold over a thousand of these refurbished laptops during this sale, and the PREZ20 coupon code is only good \u2019til Monday. There\u2019s no telling how long the stock will hold out. If you\u2019re in the market for a fantastic deal on a budget laptop, I\u2019d snag one of these ASAP.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Nasdaq-listed Zoom Communications (ZM), a stock market high-flyer during the pandemic boom that's faced tougher times since, should embrace a bitcoin (BTC) strategy to shake up sluggish stock performace and provide value to shareholders, said Eric Semler, chairman of medical technology firm Semler Scientific (SMLR).  \"Once a pandemic darling, Zoom is now stuck in a highly competitive, slow-growth market,\" Semler said in an X post Thursday. \"By leveraging its $7.7 billion cash pile, $2 billion in annualized free cash flow, and ready access to low-cost debt, Zoom could rapidly become one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin,\"   Zoom shares are down about 85% from their 2020 peak even as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have continued to push to new record highs.  Semler's comments came from experience as his company adopted a BTC treasury strategy last year after studying the example of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, on how to provide value for the company's shareholders. Semler since has converted most of its cash holdings to bitcoin and tapped capital markets for more funds with which to acquire tokens. As of the most recent update, it's accumulated 3,192 BTC worth $305 million at current prices. Even as SMLR shares have struggled in recent weeks alongside bitcoin's poor price performance, the stock has still more than doubled since the company disclosed its first token purchases in mid-2024.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":" But AMD's server march has started to slow down.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  AMD continued to gain unit and revenue x86 CPU market share in 2024 across both consumer and server segments, according to recently released data by Mercury Research that was provided by AMD. But while the company gained an additional 4% unit share on the consumer PC market, its server winning spree slowed down and the firm only gained 2% on the server market. Nevertheless, the company's revenue share gains were more impressive across both markets.  In the consumer PC processor market, Intel maintained its lead while commanding a 75.4% unit market share in Q4 2024. However, AMD experienced strong growth, significantly increasing both revenue and unit share at the expense of Intel.  The company's consumer CPU revenue share rose to 24.6% at the exit of 2024, reflecting a 4.5% increase year-over-year (YoY) and 0.7% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). Similarly, AMD's revenue share grew to 23.8%, marking an impressive 8.4% YoY gain and a 2.1% QoQ rise. Such numbers reflect the fact that AMD gradually gains share in the premium segments and its average selling prices (ASPs) are growing. Keep in mind though that revenue share figures in this report were calculated by AMD.  The desktop PC processor market segment was a particular success story for AMD in 2024 as the company saw a massive YoY increase in both unit and revenue share, but quarterly performance was mixed. By contrast, Intel's share declined following a scandal with Raptor Lake CPU stability issues in certain cases, as well as an inventory correction at a partner in the third quarter. As of Q4 2024, AMD's unit share reached 27.1%, gaining 7.4% YoY but declining 1.6% from the previous quarter. By contrast, Intel gained 1.6% following the launch of its Arrow Lake-S processors for desktops. Meanwhile, AMD's revenue share increased to 27.3%, up 12.1% YoY and 0.9% QoQ in the fourth quarter, an indication that the company's enthusiast-oriented Ryzen 9000-series CPUs are quite popular among the target audience. Apparently, the launch of Arrow Lake-S processors did not help Intel regain revenue share last quarter  In the mobile CPU space, Intel continued to dominate outselling AMD by three times in terms of units. However, AMD demonstrated steady and consistent growth. Unit share climbed to 23.7% in Q4 2024, increasing by 3.4% compared to the same quarter a year before and 1.4% QoQ, while revenue share rose to 21.6%, up 6.5% YoY and 2.4% QoQ. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Although Intel now has highly competitive Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake processors for notebooks, Mercury's numbers suggest increasing adoption of AMD-powered laptops, driven by improved performance, power efficiency, and overall brand recognition. The mobile segment remains a critical area for AMD's expansion as notebooks outsell desktops 3:1, so winning a 3.4% from Intel in a year is a good result.  In the server CPU market, AMD continued its momentum, achieving a record-high market share in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company's unit share reached 25.1%, reflecting a 2% increase year-over-year and a modest 0.9% gain quarter-over-quarter. While Intel's Xeons still power three servers out of four, it is getting harder for Intel to maintain this lead, which leads to discounts and lower ASPs. On the revenue side, AMD's server revenue share surged to 35.5%, marking an impressive 3.7-point YoY increase and a 1.6-point QoQ gain. This significant jump in revenue share suggests that not only is AMD selling more server processors, but it is also capturing more of the high-margin, high-performance market. In fact, AMD's datacenter group outsold Intel's datacenter and AI business unit in the fourth quarter, whereas Intel's datacenter CPU sales hit their lowest point in 13 years.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"HDDs used for mining the Chia cryptocurrency have been resold as new  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Seagate hard drives that were previously used in Chinese Chia cryptocurrency mining farms have been resold as new by unsuspecting retailers. An investigation by Heise indicates large quantities of high-mileage drives have surfaced in the market, particularly in Europe, Australia, Thailand, and Japan. These drives, often datacenter-grade Seagate Exos models, have been found with thousands of operational hours despite being marketed as brand new. At the peak of the cryptocurrency boom, mining operations required vast storage capacity, leading to a surge in demand for high-end HDDs. However, as the profitability of Chia mining declined, many farms shut down and sold their hardware. These hard drives were then repackaged and reintroduced into the market, deceiving customers. Concerned buyers can verify the true usage history of their Seagate HDDs using special diagnostic tools. While SMART parameters can be reset to hide prior use, the FARM (field-accessible reliability metrics) values provide a more accurate record. Users can check these values by running the command smartctl -l farm \/dev\/sda in Smartmontools version 7.4 or higher or by using Seagate\u2019s own Seatools software to inspect the drive\u2019s operational history. Seagate has stated it only distributes genuine hard drives through official channel, and it suspects these used HDDs entered the secondary market before reaching consumers. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Nevertheless, It has also launched a full-scale investigation and has urged affected buyers to report any suspicious purchases to fraud@seagate.com. Affected retailers are firefighting the issue, with Galaxus creating online help pages for affected customers, while Proshop is offering free returns and replacements. Alternate, a German retailer, denies prior knowledge of the issue but has encouraged customers to report used drives. Wortmann, on the other hand, insists on verifying HDDs before offering compensation.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Obsidian's Avowed supports DLSS 4 at launch, and MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle gets support soon.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Obsidian Entertainment's latest role-playing game Avowed supports DLSS 4 features at launch, NVIDIA confirmed on Thursday. The fantastical adventure will allow players to use Multi Frame Generation and other DLSS features right from the start when it begins early access. Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws also supports DLSS 4 now, thanks to a new update enabling the feature set for Ubisoft and Massive's Star Wars adventure. Another Xbox first-party game will be joining in the fun soon. Bethesda Softworks and NVIDIA confirmed that MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting DLSS 4 support in a patch next week. This patch will be part of the third big update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and will also include a number of bug fixes for the game based on issues that players have reported since its launch back in December 2024. While DLSS 4 is available across NVIDIA's entire lineup of ray-tracing capable graphics cards, Multi-Frame Generation is only available for anyone that picks up one of the new 50-series cards. Stock for the 5080 and 5090 hasn't been great so far, meaning not many players will be able to use this bleeding-edge technology right away. Fortunately, this feature is only necessary for players who want to push truly wild framerates like 240 FPS with every setting in a game dialed to max, including high-end ray tracing like Indiana Jones' path tracing option. If you're content with merely enjoying Avowed and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at 120 FPS, regular frame generation will be sufficient for your needs. If you still haven't played MachineGames' latest yet, read my review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, where I praised it as a fun adventure with immersive sim elements, as well as being a game that \"can sit next to the original trilogy with pride.\" Meanwhile, Avowed is almost here, with early access for the Premium Edition and Premium Upgrade owns kicking off later today. My colleague Zachary Boddy writes in their review that \"A varied combat system, gorgeous visuals, and an interesting story all help make Avowed one of the most fun RPGs I've played in a long while.\" The standard edition of Avowed is slated to launch on Feb. 18, 2025 across Xbox Series X|S and Windows PC. Like all Xbox first-party games, it's included day one in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Claire Lim, Director of NY Growth, Golin.   During my time leading growth strategy at Emerging Markets Entrepreneurs (EME) in Myanmar from 2018 to 2021, I witnessed a remarkable phenomenon that challenged everything I thought I knew about business development and growth strategies. Instead of following the traditional steppingstones to modernization, I watched as Myanmar took a bold leap directly into the digital age, offering lessons that would reshape my understanding of growth strategy not only in emerging markets but also in prominent nations and heritage companies. The following are four key lessons I learned throughout my time in Myanmar that I believe business leaders in any industry or sector can bring back to their organizations. Through our portfolio companies, I witnessed firsthand how this leapfrogging approach creates unprecedented opportunities. I worked with one company that transformed daily life for countless rural shop owners (mostly women) who previously had to close their shops for a day just to trek to the nearest town for supplies. While other markets were still grappling with gradually digitizing supply chains, this company built a mobile-first platform that connected these rural retailers directly with wholesalers, saving them both time and money. Working alongside visionary founders at this company, I learned that the biggest opportunities often come from embracing these technological jumps rather than following conventional step-by-step evolution. Today, I can\u2019t help but draw comparisons to how some of the most successful companies we know have fully embraced AI, both internally and externally. When identifying growth opportunities, you should always look for ways the world is shifting around you to home in on. By embracing those technological jumps, you may be able to find new ways to evolve alongside the world. The excitement of this transformation became even clearer through my experience with the country\u2019s first and only online vehicle marketplace. In developed markets, I would have faced the familiar challenge of transitioning traditional dealerships online. Instead, we had the unique opportunity to shape how an entire industry would operate in the digital age from the ground up. I quickly learned that even in a leapfrog market, the human element remains crucial. We found success by blending digital innovation with physical touchpoints, running vibrant auto shows in Yangon and Mandalay alongside our online platform. When developing your own offerings, make sure human interaction remains a key touchpoint in your strategy. Adding personable elements to your strategies can help encourage customers to keep coming back. What fascinated me most was watching innovation unfold in real time. Quite literally, a new app or digital solution would emerge almost daily. Whether I was helping a creative agency pioneer Myanmar\u2019s first animated live series or supporting an app that connected cleaners and clients, success consistently came from finding that sweet spot between innovation and local market realities. How does the famous saying go? Necessity is the mother of invention, and that could not have been clearer than in a country that has only opened its doors to the rest of the world a few years ago. When developing your own solutions, look at what the people around you need right now. Focusing on those needs may help you grow faster. This experience has fundamentally transformed my approach to growth strategy. In my current work with global brands and multinational companies, I find myself constantly drawing on these lessons from Myanmar. I\u2019ve learned to look for those unexpected developmental leaps that can create entirely new opportunities while keeping one foot firmly grounded in local market understanding. Of course, we also need to talk about how Myanmar\u2019s story took a devastating turn in 2021. During my time there, I witnessed extraordinary growth and digital transformation; businesses were flourishing, international investment was flowing and optimism permeated the market. The current situation in the country has disrupted much of this progress, affecting countless talented entrepreneurs and professionals I had the privilege of working with. Yet, the principles we discovered during that period of rapid growth remain invaluable. For business leaders and investors looking at emerging markets today, I truly believe that success isn\u2019t just about following traditional development paths. It\u2019s about being bold enough to embrace technological leaps while staying deeply connected to local market realities. When preparing your own growth strategies, make sure you keep local markets top-of-mind at every step. Looking ahead, I believe we\u2019ll see more companies taking these nonlinear paths to development. The lessons I learned in Myanmar\u2014about adaptability, innovation and local market understanding\u2014will become increasingly relevant as more companies seek to accelerate their growth through technological advancement. In today\u2019s interconnected world, the ability to recognize and capitalize on these leapfrog opportunities while remaining sensitive to local conditions may well be the key to success.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"FILE - Attendees listen as Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks ... [+] during a campaign event at Alro Steel, Aug. 29, 2024, in Potterville, Mich. (AP Photo\/Alex Brandon, File) Ahead of his second term, President Donald Trump revived the \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d slogan, reaffirming his commitment to boosting domestic oil production and reducing energy costs. This policy aims to enhance energy independence, drive economic growth, and lower fuel prices for consumers. However, despite the administration\u2019s push for increased drilling, oil producers remain cautious, emphasizing that their decisions are primarily driven by market conditions rather than political rhetoric. Working against Trump\u2019s pro-drilling stance is an oil market that remains relatively stable. According to Deloitte\u2019s 2025 Oil and Gas Industry Outlook, in 2024 oil prices traded within a range of $74 to $90 per barrel, leading energy companies to prioritize capital discipline and strategic investments over aggressive expansion. Liam Mallon, President of ExxonMobil\u2019s Upstream division, recently reinforced this sentiment, stating: \u201cA radical change in production is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is primarily focused on the economics of what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Mallon\u2019s perspective reflects a broader industry trend\u2014oil producers remain focused on financial sustainability rather than short-term production boosts. The decision to drill new wells is fundamentally tied to breakeven prices\u2014the price at which oil companies can cover their production costs and remain profitable. According to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey, the breakeven price for new drilling projects ranged between $59 and $70 per barrel in 2024. With West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude currently priced around $71 per barrel, new drilling remains modestly profitable but not lucrative enough to justify large-scale investment without clear demand signals. Many producers remain wary of overproduction, which could lead to another price downturn similar to those experienced in 2014 and 2020. Another major factor influencing U.S. oil production is the role of OPEC+ in global supply management. The cartel\u2019s coordinated production cuts have played a key role in maintaining stable oil prices, allowing U.S. producers to generate steady returns while discouraging excessive expansion. If OPEC+ were to increase output significantly\u2014which they have done in the past\u2014oil prices could dip below breakeven levels, making drilling far less attractive for U.S. companies. Additionally, global demand for oil is evolving, with energy transition policies promoting renewables and reducing long-term oil consumption projections. Some producers are hesitant to overinvest in drilling amid an uncertain demand outlook, preferring instead to focus on maintaining cash flow, shareholder returns, and measured production growth. Trump\u2019s policies seek to remove regulatory barriers to oil production, including streamlining federal permitting and reducing environmental restrictions. While these measures could lower costs for producers, they do not necessarily translate into immediate increases in drilling activity. Regulatory relief can make operations more efficient, but as Scott Sheffield, former CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, noted in a 2024 interview: \u201cNo company wants to risk another price collapse. We are disciplined now because we\u2019ve learned from past cycles.\u201d This sentiment highlights the industry\u2019s cautious approach\u2014prioritizing stability over speculative expansion. For investors, the current environment presents both opportunities and risks. Many oil companies are prioritizing dividends and share buybacks over aggressive capital expenditures, making them particularly attractive for income-focused investors. Technological advancements, such as automated drilling and AI-driven well optimization, have significantly reduced operational costs, allowing producers to maintain profitability even at lower price points. Additionally, unlike in past cycles, U.S. producers have embraced capital discipline, reducing debt and improving financial stability, which could help mitigate risks associated with volatile oil prices. However, there are also key risks to consider. The ongoing global shift toward electric vehicles and renewable energy presents long-term demand uncertainties that could impact the industry's future growth. Geopolitical risks also remain a factor, as conflicts in the Middle East, Russia, and other oil-producing regions could lead to price spikes or supply disruptions. Furthermore, future U.S. administrations could introduce stricter environmental regulations, affecting domestic production growth and potentially increasing operational costs for producers. As a result, investors must weigh these factors carefully when considering U.S. oil companies as part of their portfolio strategy. While President Trump\u2019s \u201cDrill, Baby, Drill\u201d slogan embodies an aggressive approach to increasing U.S. oil production, market forces remain the primary driver of industry decisions. Oil companies are responding not to political pressure but to price signals, profitability concerns, and shareholder priorities. As the global energy landscape evolves, the focus for U.S. producers will likely remain on capital discipline, operational efficiency, and strategic growth rather than an all-out drilling surge. For investors, this means looking beyond short-term political narratives and focusing on companies with strong balance sheets, efficient operations, and consistent shareholder returns.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump appear during an executive order signing ... [+] in the Oval Office at the White House on February 11. Trump signed an executive order implementing the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) \"workforce optimization initiative,\" which, according to Trump, will encourage agencies to limit hiring and reduce the size of the federal government. (Photo by Andrew Harnik\/Getty Images) Efforts by Elon Musk and President Donald Trump to downsize the three million member federal workforce can benefit companies and organizations, while posing new challenges for the former government employees who want to re-enter the job market. \u201cCorporate and private-sector employers have an opportunity to tap into highly skilled talent with deep regulatory, compliance, and administrative expertise. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between federal experience and private-sector expectations\u2014identifying transferrable skills, capitulating to corporate priorities and messaging, modernizing technical skills (that are often behind the curve), and adapting to a vastly different work culture,\u201d Lauren Milligan, a career coach, observed via email. Some of the newly unemployed federal workers may decide to enter the growing and vibrant freelance workforce which includes an estimated 64 millions workers. \u201cMany displaced federal employees are now navigating a job market that is quite different from government hiring. They\u2019ve had to revise their resumes on the fly, dust off their networking and interviewing skills, and overhaul their short- and long-term career goals. While these candidates bring valuable transferable skills, they are entering what was already a highly competitive employment market,\u201d Milligan pointed out. The current job market will pose additional hurdles for former government workers. \u201cGiven December\u2019s lackluster jobs report, the roughly 77,000 federal workers who took the buyout may have a hard time finding new jobs. For those already in the private sector, the addition of these workers, who are typically highly educated, adds extra competition. Justin Schnitzer, a federal employment attorney, commented via email. The voluntary or forced departures of tens of thousands of federal workers will likely have an impact on government agencies. \u201cEarly indications are that a lot of people who took the buyouts were people later in their career taking early retirements, which means they may not be headed back into the job market. But they are also the most experienced, so these abrupt departures will mean a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise across agencies that would otherwise have been passed on,\u201d Michelle Devitt, a labor law attorney and partner at the Willig, Williams, and Davidson law firm, predicted in an email interview. \u201cThis brain drain from the federal workforce is likely to impact the quality and speed of federal services Americans are used to enjoying. America\u2019s workers rely on federal agencies to assure workplace safety (OSHA and DOL), protect their rights to organize (NLRB and FLRA), enforce anti-discrimination protections (EEOC), and support collective bargaining and labor arbitration (FMCS). These agencies are already limiting services and extending wait times for resolution of workplace disputes and remedies. Further downsizing the federal workforce only worsen those impacts,\u201d Devitt cautioned. The three million member federal workforce, while significant, has been roughly flat since the 1970s, and has been a smaller part of the nation\u2019s workforce over time, Laurence Ales, the senior associate dean for education and a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, explained via email. Government spending has a small put positive multiplier effect on the economy, according to Ales. But the cutback in the workforce and corresponding reduction in government spending \u201cwill have introduced contractionary headwinds to the economy. These forces will become stronger as the labor market is by itself already losing steam,\u201d Ales noted. Since most federal workers live outside of Washington, their departure from the workforce will affect the communities where they reside. \u201c[R]oughly 85% of federal employees live outside of the D.C. metropolitan area. These employees live all across the country. These steady and generally well-paid jobs provide a boon to local economies. Significantly cutting back on these positions will have a negative effect on local economies across the U.S.,\u201d J. Thomas Spiggle, a labor and employment lawyer with The Spiggle Law Firm, warned via email. The impact of a downsized federal workforce could lead to broader problems for the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cBeyond the short term impact due to changes in spending, longer effects are hard to predict. Here we need to acknowledge the critical work that many federal employees provide. Broad reductions in the federal workforce could lead to significant, albeit uncertain, economic drawbacks,\u201d Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Ales concluded. The unexpected efforts to downsize the federal government and the tens of thousands of jobs it represents can be a dark cloud for the people who suddenly find themselves out of work\u2014but a potential gold mine for companies looking to take advantage of the expertise and skills of the former federal workers.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"Macroeconomics is top of mind from the impact of Crypto, to AI to Interest Rates (Photo by Johannes ... [+] Simon\/Getty Images) As 2025 approaches, major macroeconomic trends\u2014including interest rates, AI-driven labor market shifts, and the rise of decentralized finance or crypto\u2014are set to shape global business, investment, and policymaking From central banks navigating inflation and interest rates to AI redefining labor markets and the rise of decentralized finance, several macroeconomic forces will shape the global financial landscape. Understanding these shifts is crucial for businesses, investors, and policymakers alike. Of course, if I could predict, I'd be on an island\u2014but that said, here are my thoughts. After the rapid rate hikes of 2022-2024 aimed at curbing inflation, central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are expected to pivot toward rate cuts in 2025. Inflation has shown signs of stabilizing, and growth slowdowns in key economies may push policymakers to ease financial conditions. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global GDP growth slowed to 2.9% in 2024, down from 3.4% in 2022. The IMF projects that rate cuts in 2025 could restore growth closer to 3.3%. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging business investments, consumer spending, and asset price appreciation. However, the timing of these cuts is uncertain. If rates are lowered too soon, inflation could resurge; if delayed, economic stagnation could deepen. Central banks will also need to balance the risks of over-stimulating economies with the potential for reigniting inflation. The U.S. and European economies, in particular, will be under scrutiny as they decide when and how aggressively to cut rates. For the tech sector, lower interest rates could be a significant catalyst for growth. Reduced borrowing costs enable startups and established tech firms to access capital more affordably, fueling expansion, innovation, and hiring. Venture capital activity, which has slowed due to higher interest rates, could see a resurgence as investors regain confidence in funding high-growth, high-risk ventures. Moreover, large tech companies that rely on debt financing for acquisitions and R&D investments may find it easier to fund ambitious projects, particularly in AI, quantum computing, and cloud infrastructure. The launch of new ETFs focused on AI, blockchain, crypto and other emerging technologies could further channel capital into the sector. With lower rates making equities and growth-focused investments more attractive, institutional and retail investors may increasingly turn to these ETFs as a way to gain exposure to high-growth opportunities. These funds can help drive liquidity into AI startups and established players, reinforcing the sector\u2019s upward momentum. The renewed appetite for riskier assets could also boost valuations for tech firms, encouraging further innovation and expansion. Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are not just emerging trends\u2014they are fundamental forces redefining economies. AI-driven efficiencies will boost productivity, yet concerns remain over labor displacement and income inequality. AI-powered automation could increase economic output, with the PwC Global AI Study estimating up to a $15.7 trillion contribution to global GDP by 2030. While AI is expected to eliminate up to 85 million jobs per the World Economic Forum Jobs Report, it will also create approximately 97 million new roles in tech-driven fields. Companies across industries\u2014from healthcare to finance\u2014are aggressively adopting AI-driven decision-making, leading to higher efficiency but potentially fewer traditional job opportunities. AI is projected to take roles and create new roles (Photo by Spencer Platt\/Getty Images) A recent shift in the AI landscape has challenged the notion that only tech giants like the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) players would dominate AI innovation. Deep Seek, a pioneering AI company, has demonstrated that smaller, highly specialized firms can disrupt the space with breakthrough innovations. Their work in AI-driven search and knowledge discovery has inspired a new wave of investment in emerging AI firms, proving that the market remains open for agile startups and non-traditional players. This development has reinvigorated competition and broadened the opportunities for businesses of all sizes to integrate AI-driven solutions. Expectations for productivity growth will be crucial for long-term economic prospects. Some forecasts suggest labor productivity growth between 1.5% to 3% in 2025, driven by technological advancements, particularly in AI and automation. This productivity growth will be essential in offsetting demographic challenges in developed economies and sustaining economic expansion. The broader macroeconomic impact of AI will depend on how swiftly businesses and governments adapt to workforce reskilling and whether AI\u2019s efficiency gains outweigh its displacement effects. Geopolitical shifts will continue to disrupt global supply chains in 2025. The U.S.-China rivalry, Europe\u2019s regulatory interventions, and the increasing drive toward de-risking supply chains will shape international trade flows. The World Trade Organization (WTO) estimates that global trade growth will slow to 1.5% in 2024, down from 3.2% in 2022, largely due to supply chain shifts and protectionist policies. Countries are prioritizing domestic production of strategic resources like semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and AI chips. Regional trade alliances such as the EU and ASEAN will expand economic partnerships as alternative trade networks form. Even crypto is feeling the impact with the US proposing no crypto tax on gains for US Born cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, governments are investing in alternative energy sources, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-heavy supply chains. The semiconductor industry is a prime example. The U.S. CHIPS Act has incentivized domestic chip production, and similar efforts are seen in the EU and China to secure critical technologies. While interest rates and AI dominate economic discussions, wildcards like cryptocurrencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) are poised to reshape global finance. Financial institutions are increasingly embracing blockchain technologies for cross-border payments, smart contracts, and transparent financial transactions. The question remains whether crypto will become a mainstream asset class or continue as a speculative alternative. Key trends in crypto and digital finance are shaping the future of monetary transactions and decentralized assets. Governments and financial institutions are increasingly integrating regulated stable coins into traditional banking, offering a more stable alternative to volatile crypto assets. Digital assets and crypto are wild cards in the macroeconomics equation (Photo Illustration by ... [+] Chesnot\/Getty Images) China, the EU, and the U.S. are making strides in central bank digital currency (CBDC) rollouts, which could significantly alter the way transactions are conducted at a national and global level. The increased regulatory focus on crypto markets could also impact the sector, influencing how digital assets are traded and stored. The macroeconomic landscape of 2025 will be defined by central bank policies, AI-driven productivity shifts, Digital Assets like Crypto, global trade realignments, and financial innovation. Interest rate decisions will set the tone for economic stability, while AI\u2019s impact on labor markets will require careful adaptation. Meanwhile, emerging digital financial systems\u2014whether through crypto or CBDCs\u2014could revolutionize the way money moves globally. For investors, businesses, and policymakers, understanding these trends will be essential for navigating the opportunities and risks ahead. 2025 is shaping up to be a year of transformation, and those who adapt early will be best positioned for success.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"BNB Chain's BNB token and PancakeSwap's CAKE bucked low-volatility market conditions to rally 9.3% and 35% respectively even as bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, remained rangebound at $96,200. CAKE has more than doubled over the past seven days, a move coinciding with a spike in trading volume, with $1.1 billion being notched in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. BNB, meanwhile, flipped Solana's SOL token in terms of market cap following a series of tweets from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who hinted at \"interacting with memecoins\" on the BNB Chain. The move in BNB and CAKE is correlated because CAKE is the native token of decentralized exchange PancakeSwap, the largest protocol on BNB Chain. The increase in activity comes as bitcoin experiences a lull. BTC has traded between $95,000 and $98,000 since Feb. 8.  Rangebound price action for BTC typically leads to a rise in activity in alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, because traders tend to look for more speculative bets. In the past 24 hours LIDO, INJ, JTO and HYPE have all gained between 7% and 9%.  Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.

{"date":"2025-02-13","content":"We answer your bird flu questions. With news coming in about the ongoing bird flu, the Hotline has gotten a ton of questions about egg and poultry safety, budgeting, and alternatives\u2014so we want to cut through the noise to provide some answers. We are in the midst of a major outbreak of H5N1 bird flu, and it has hit poultry farms hard. So far, it's killed millions of birds across the country, and farmers have culled entire flocks, resulting in an egg shortage in many areas. This, combined with the price of eggs already being on a precipitous climb since the start of 2024, means some stores are charging $12 or more for a carton of eggs, while others are restricting customers to buying only 1 or 2 cartons. The short answer is yes. The USDA has reported that the likelihood of eggs or poultry infected with the bird flu entering the market is extremely low. Additionally if you cook them to 165\u00ba, you\u2019ll be killing off any bacteria, anyway. Unfortunately, this means no soft-boiled or over-easy eggs (apologies to my runny yolk lovers). For baking, you can use the liquid from chickpeas, aka aquafaba, to mimic egg whites (one can contains the equivalent of three to four egg whites). And, Annie just made a helpful video about the power of chia eggs. In place of an egg wash on baked goods, go for heavy cream or milk instead. For savory dishes, add mashed potatoes, silken tofu, or other starches as a binder. When frying, swap in mayo as a replacement for the egg step of dredging. We just put out a list of our 20+ favorite weeknight dinners without chicken or eggs. This is unfortunately not super clear because the bird flu outbreak is continuing to grow, and grocery prices generally don\u2019t seem to be leveling off any time soon. We\u2019ll keep you posted through the Hotline for any developing eggs news as well as answers to all cooking, hosting, cleaning, and eating questions. Have more food safety questions?
