{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Paul Singer, the founder of the $72 billion hedge fund Elliott Management, has made a fortune out of being stressed. The billionaire, who launched his firm in 1977 and has famously lost money in only two years of a nearly half-century of investing, is famous for being worried about situations that seem far-fetched. His letters to investors often include doomsday scenarios he's monitoring, involving things such as hackers or solar flares. From the outside, it can seem like an unpleasant reality, but titans of finance often thrive under the pressure of delivering day in and day out, extracting their own version of fun from these daily tensions. Not Singer. In a rare public appearance, speaking on the podcast of Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Singer was blunt about the difficulty in running his manager. When Tangen asked him if he was having fun, he said no. Skiing, snowmobiling, sailing, hiking, biking, and playing music (he said he played the keyboard for \"a couple of bands\") are what he enjoys. Investing, managing risk, never losing his investors' capital \u2014 these are challenges he's enthusiastic about, he said, but not what he does for fun. \"If I want to be risk averse, I have to be risk averse all the time,\" because markets never sit still, he said, adding, \"You can't get bored by not losing serious money.\" In the 40-minute conversation, which Tangen posted on Wednesday, the pair talked about Singer's activism, risks in the market, and advice for young people. Singer, whose firm took a $5 billion position in the oil giant BP this year, said most companies welcomed Elliott with open arms when the firm initiated a campaign. \"We're not crusaders; we're not just speaking to hear ourselves speak,\" he said. \"We have a goal; we have a thesis,\" Singer added, estimating that 70% of the firm's campaigns were successful and the business and stock price improved. Before he was the feared activist, Singer was losing his parents' and friends' money in the early 1970s, investing in stocks and options. The early struggles shaped his focus on risk, and he sees plenty of it today in the markets. Stock markets are \"just about as risky as I've ever seen,\" he told the CEO of the fund that owns more equities than any other manager in the world. Government responses to market events like the pandemic, he said, have \"lulled people into thinking they'll always be bailed out.\" \"Leverage is building and building, risk-taking is building,\" Singer said. He pointed to valuations in the artificial intelligence industry, which he argued was \"way over its skis.\" \"There are uses, and there will be additional uses, but it's way exaggerated,\" he said.  He added that the US government's support of cryptocurrency \u2014 which could affect the US dollar's standing as the world's reserve currency \u2014 \"makes my head spin.\" Understanding geopolitical and market ripple effects is critical for Singer and his legions of investors, and it's a big reason he recommends that young people study history, political science, and philosophy in college instead of business. \"If you specialize too soon, you get this narrow, deep skill set, and you're not equipped for the things that are actually happening in the world,\" he said. And things are happening faster than ever. He said he no longer had time to read fiction \u2014 he's a sci-fi fan \u2014 because of how complex markets have become. But that doesn't mean he plans to give up the keys anytime soon \u2014 his advice on rocking it is to do it \"till you can't do it anymore.\" Jump to","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Last month, veteran investment chief Keith Lerner said stock-market dips were worth buying. Six weeks later, Truist's chief market strategist is singing a different tune. He just downgraded US equities for the first time in years and thinks investors should have more cash on hand. \"After being more on the positive side of the ledger, the risk-reward backdrop has shifted,\" Lerner said in a recent interview. \"I don't think it's catastrophic. I just think that we're acknowledging that the risk-reward is more mixed now, relative to where it was before.\" Lerner's decision to knock his rating on US stocks from attractive to neutral comes as an optimism-driven rally sputters. The S&P 500 reached record highs in mid-February but has since lost ground in four straight sessions as markets grapple with weak economic data, policy confusion, and uncomfortably high valuations. Walmart's ghastly guidance didn't help either. Even still, economic fundamentals look solid, and Lerner said a recession is likely off the table. The main issue, in his view, is that investors' expectations are out of whack. \"It's not that things are falling apart,\" Lerner said. \"The concerning thing is that the expectations are high, and now we're seeing some softness.\" Stocks may be a victim of their own success. Earnings growth has defied analysts' cautious estimates for years, so investors have come to expect beats. The market is now pricing in low-double-digit profit growth this year, and while Lerner's 8% to 10% call is slightly more conservative, it still might be a palatable outcome. Steadily rising profits in a healthy economy are, on paper, a blueprint for higher stock values. Add in excitement about Trump's agenda, namely lower corporate taxes and deregulation, and it's clear why investors spent much of the last few months scrambling to add equity exposure. \"There was some complacency,\" Lerner said. \"There wasn't a lot of fear built into the market.\" However, this bullish case will only play out if earnings live up to the considerable hype \u2014 and Lerner believes that's increasingly in question. Forward earnings estimates, which had inspired optimism, have stalled in the last month or so, Lerner noted. And while analysts are known for setting the bar low, profit expectations haven't hit a snag like this in half a year, which suggests that they're less confident than usual. An earnings hiccup might not be a major obstacle if stocks weren't priced to perfection. But at 22x forward earnings, the S&P 500 has little room for error before it gets a valuation haircut. \"If you get a negative surprise, you're more vulnerable again on a short-term basis,\" Lerner said. Besides flattening profit estimates, Lerner pointed out that US companies must also contend with policy uncertainty regarding interest rates and tariffs. Trump's unconventional governing style has everyone from trade partners to Wall Street on edge. No one knows for certain whether he's bluffing or serious about import taxes \u2014 much less how high they'd be, when they'd go into effect, and for how long. At the same time, the president is pushing for rate cuts, though Lerner said the Federal Reserve won't comply unless there's clarity on tariffs, and their impact on inflation and economic growth. \"The Fed is basically boxed in,\" Lerner said. \"They're in a holding pattern because they're waiting to see how this tariff stuff happens. They're not going to cut rates unless the economy weakens, most likely. They're going to be slower to react, so that's less supportive, near term.\" Consumers seem to be growing restless in this higher-rate, higher-tariff backdrop. Case in point: Long-term inflation expectations just hit their highest level since 1995, Goldman Sachs economists recently noted, citing the University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment data. \"The longer that we are in a world where tariffs are a real possibility \u2014 from the perspective of consumers, from investors, from companies \u2014 the more risk that you do see a more sustained drift up in inflation expectations,\" said Joseph Briggs, the co-lead of Goldman Sachs' global economics team, in a recent interview. Investors may want to take that survey data with a grain of salt, as Lerner said it may be \"polluted\" by political polarization. Even still, he's also closely eyeing price growth. \"Consumers are at the high point of what they're willing to pay for a lot of items,\" Lerner said, adding that record profit margins may suffer as a result. Although US stocks have gotten less appealing, Lerner still thinks they're a relatively strong bet. His favorite investment ideas are still domestic large caps, namely companies in the technology, communication services, and financials sectors. Truist also has an attractive rating on mid caps. Conversely, Lerner thinks investors should now steer clear of small caps due to their shakier earnings, and elevated interest rates. He's also skeptical of international stocks, even though they've been among the best performers across global markets so far this year. Jump to","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Taboola cornered the market for bottom-of-webpage \"content you may like\" advertising widgets \u2014 less affectionately referred to as the \"chum box.\" Now, it's moving beyond its native advertising roots by launching a new ad platform called Realize that expands its offering to more prominent ad placements on publisher websites and apps, the adtech company exclusively told Business Insider. The move puts Taboola in more direct competition in the display ad market with traditional demand-side platforms \u2014 companies like The Trade Desk and AppLovin that help advertisers plan and buy their ad campaigns across various media \u2014 and supply-side platforms, such as Magnite and PubMatic, that help publishers connect with advertisers and monetize their webpages and apps. Taboola CEO Adam Singolda told BI that the company has estimated that its new strategy can target an additional $55 billion in performance advertising budgets. The company reported Wednesday that it generated $1.8 billion in annual revenue in 2024. Performance advertising refers to ads designed to drive a near-immediate outcome, such as a purchase, app download, or email subscription. Most advertisers' performance advertising budgets lean heavily on Meta and Google, but these are highly competitive platforms, and acquiring new customers has become more difficult and expensive over time, Singolda said. \"Search and social are maxed out,\" he added. A similar thesis has propelled rival AppLovin's market value in recent months after it expanded its performance advertising offering to e-commerce advertisers. It had traditionally focused on the mobile gaming market. \"Outside of search and social, two companies have done a good job: The Trade Desk, for the top of the funnel, for branding, and AppLovin for apps,\" Singolda said. \"No one is the third leg.\" While plenty of established demand-side platforms already offer access to similar web inventory outside Google and Meta, Singolda said many of these companies have shifted focus to areas like video and connected TV or require a minimum level of monthly spending, which can shut out many smaller advertisers. \"Adtech is fragmented, complicated, and not scaleable,\" Singolda said. Taboola aims to make it easy for advertisers to set up campaigns by conversing with an AI assistant,\u00a0Abby, which lets them upload their existing creative assets and select the outcome they hope to achieve, like driving website visits or encouraging customers to try a new product. Singolda said Taboola's heritage in running code on publisher websites that operate its recommendation widgets gives it an edge over competitors because it has unique data about the type of content users read, what they click on, and what they buy. It counts Yahoo, Microsoft, NBC News, Apple News, and Business Insider among its 9,000-plus publisher partners. Singolda said Taboola would continue to offer its content recommendation widgets. Ana Milicevic, cofounder of the adtech consultancy Sparrow Advisors, said that Taboola's large publisher-direct footprint and access to data would appeal to performance advertisers, especially if it emphasizes that its platform is easy to use. However, those publishers may be highly alert to potential brand safety risks as performance advertising moves higher up their article pages. \"Let's say I'm on CNN's website and am seeing performance ads for a new diet fad or crypto course that readers or users may perceive as low-value \u2014 does that, in turn, turn off other advertisers who may be buying CNN directly,\" Milicevic said. Earlier this year, Taboola's close rival, Oubtrain, also expanded its offering beyond traditional content recommendation widgets. It closed its acquisition of fellow adtech firm Teads, a specialist in video advertising. The combined company is now operating under the name Teads. Jump to","label":1}

Peter Rawlinson helped found the company and served as its first CTO. But he\u2019s not leaving Lucid quite yet. by  Andrew J. Hawkins Lucid Motors founder and CEO Peter Rawlinson will step down, as the luxury EV company sets its sights on doubling production over the next year. Rawlinson won\u2019t be leaving the company. Instead, he\u2019ll be assuming the role of \u201cStrategic Technical Advisor to the Chairman of the Board,\u201d the company said. Chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff will serve as interim CEO while the board initiates a search for a new chief executive. \u201cNow that we have successfully launched the Lucid Gravity, I have decided it is finally the right time for me to step aside from my roles at Lucid,\u201d Rawlinson said in a statement. \u201cI am incredibly proud of the accomplishments the Lucid team have achieved together through my tenure of these past twelve years. We grew from a tiny company with a big ambition, to a widely recognized technological world leader in sustainable mobility. It has been my honor to have led and grown this remarkable, truly world-class organization, because Lucid has always been first and foremost about a team effort.\u201d \u201cI have decided it is finally the right time for me to step aside from my roles at Lucid.\u201d The leadership shuffle comes as Lucid eyes major growth for the next year. The company says it expects to sell 20,000 vehicles in 2025, nearly double the 10,241 EVs it delivered in 2024. The updated guidance was announced as part of the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings. Lucid reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $636.9 million for the three month period ending December 31st. Lucid said it earned $234.4 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, on top of $807.8 million for the entire year. The company lost $3.06 billion attributable to common stockholders in 2024, and ended the year with $6.13 billion in total liquidity. Doubling production will be a tough feat for Lucid, with most analysts predicting that EV share of the retail market to remain flat this year. Its especially tough for a luxury EV company like Lucid, with most of the growth taking place in the mass-market segment. But Lucid has high hopes for its Gravity SUV, which just started its first customer deliveries late last year. The company says it plans on gradually ramping up production during the year. Lucid said the SUV would get up to 440 miles of range, offer 800 horsepower, and accelerate 0\u201360 mph in under 3.5 seconds. The Gravity will also be the first vehicle from Lucid to come with a native NACS charging port that\u2019s compatible with Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network. Lucid is backed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which invested $2.5 billion in the company in 2024. The money has helped the cash-losing EV maker from heading down a similar path as some of its less financially stable peers.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"This video can not be played Match of the Day: Why 'vulnerable' Arsenal are failing to score Arsenal's Premier League title challenge looks all but over this season, even if manager Mikel Arteta will not publicly admit it. The second-placed Gunners are 13 points adrift of leaders Liverpool after a goalless draw at Nottingham Forest again saw the conversation centred around their lack of striking options. In their past two Premier League matches, Arsenal have had 33 shots, but just three on target and no goals. It is the first time since May 2023 they have failed to score in back-to-back league games, with midfielder Mikel Merino forced to play up front due to having no available strikers. Arteta said: \"We dominated the game. We tried in many different ways. We insisted but lacked that spark, that final pass to unlock a well-organised team. We have to generate more shots on target.\" While Arsenal undoubtedly have not been helped by injuries to forwards Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz, there seems little doubt they will be stepping up their search for a goalscorer in the summer. Former Gunners goalkeeper David Seaman, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live admitted: \"We have always needed a striker. We tried in the transfer window and now hopefully there is one lined up in the summer, but that will be a bit too late. \"It will be the final piece of the jigsaw. That will hopefully be what makes it (winning the title) happen next season.\" But with Premier League rivals Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham and Aston Villa also likely to be in the market for a striker this summer, finding that missing piece is not going to be easy for Arsenal. Here are some options of forwards likely to dominate the transfer market this summer... Jonathan David's goals in the Champions League include strikes against Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid (two), Juventus and Liverpool 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 36. Goals: 20. Assists: 9. Minutes per goal: 146. Lille striker Jonathan David is currently the third-top scorer in France's Ligue 1 with 12 goals from 21 matches as well as eight goals in the Champions League qualifying rounds and league phase. The 25-year-old Canada international is expected to be one of the most in-demand players in the summer with his current deal expiring at the end of this season. Liam Delap came through the ranks at Manchester City but left having never started a Premier League game for them 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 28. Goals: 10. Assists: 2. Minutes per goal: 206. England Under-21 striker Liam Delap has been a big hit for Ipswich Town since his move for an initial fee of \u00c2\u00a315m from Manchester City in the summer, scoring 10 goals in the Premier League, despite his club struggling at the wrong end of the table. If they are relegated, Ipswich will not be short of offers in the summer to sign their main forward.  As well as being in fine scoring form for Sporting, Viktor Gyokeres has been prolific for Sweden, scoring four times in a 6-0 win over Azerbaijan in November 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 37. Goals: 35. Assists: 8. Minutes per goal: 84. One of two Swedish strikers on this list, former Coventry City striker Viktor Gyokeres has been in fine form for Portuguese side Sporting this season. The 26-year-old has been linked with a move to Manchester United, which would see him reunited with former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, but his goalscoring record is attracting clubs from across Europe.  His contract reportedly has a release clause of 100m euros (\u00c2\u00a383.1m). Only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has scored more Premier League goals than Alexander Isak this season 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 30. Goals: 21. Assists: 5. Minutes per goal: 113. Sweden international Alexander Isak has been one of the stars of the Premier League season and played a vital role in getting Newcastle to the final of the Carabao Cup. Newcastle are adamant they do not want to sell the 25-year-old, who has become the seventh-fastest player to reach 50 Premier League goals.  But will he be looking to leave if his side miss out on European football, as they did for this campaign? Jean-Philippe Mateta helped France win a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics, with the side managed by Arsenal legend Thierry Henry 2024-25 stats (league only). Appearances: 32. Goals: 15. Assists: 3. Minutes per goal: 169. Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta is enjoying a fine season and is a man in form with eight goals in nine games in 2025. Earlier this month on Match of the Day, former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott said he hoped the 27-year-old would move to the Gunners and said: \"Mateta is playing with so much confidence. He's always a threat and constantly on the move.  \"He likes to start the press and the connection he has with the players behind him is so key.\" Victor Osimhen scored 26 goals in 32 games to help Napoli win the Serie A title two seasons ago 2024-25 stats (league only). Appearances: 26. Goals: 20. Assists: 5. Minutes per goal: 100. In 2022-23, Nigeria striker Victor Osimhen helped Napoli win their first Italian title since 1990.  He looked set to leave the club last summer on a permanent transfer but went on loan to Turkish side Galatasaray, where the 26-year-old has been in prolific form.  Among his goals this season was a double in his side's 3-2 Europa League win over Tottenham in November. Mateo Retegui scored four times for Atalanta in their 5-0 win at Verona earlier this month 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 37. Goals: 24. Assists: 5. Minutes per goal: 93. Italy international striker Mateo Retegui is the top scorer in Serie A with 21 goals for Atalanta in 2024-25. The 25-year-old has played in the Champions League for his side this season and has been linked with a Premier League move this summer, with Arsenal and Manchester United among those reportedly interested. Benjamin Sesko has been linked with a number of English clubs over the past two seasons 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 33. Goals: 17. Assists: 5. Minutes per goal: 141. Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko has long been linked with a move to the Premier League as he continues to rapidly build his reputation at RB Leipzig. The 21-year-old is 6ft 5in and will not come cheap as he signed a new long-term deal with the German side in the summer. Dusan Vlahovic joined Juventus from Fiorentina in 2022 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 32. Goals: 14. Assists: 2. Minutes per goal: 160. Serbia striker Dusan Vlahovic, whose contract runs until June 2026, is another big target man who has been linked with a move to the Premier League for a long time. The 25-year-old is 6ft 3in and enjoying another fine season in Italy with Juventus, who had signed him in January 2022, when Arsenal missed out on the forward.  Vlahovic also scored when Juventus beat Manchester City 2-0 in their Champions League tie in December. Ollie Watkins has played 18 times for England, scoring five goals, including the last-minute winner in the Three Lions' 2-1 victory over Netherlands in the semi-finals of Euro 2024 2024-25 stats (all competitions). Appearances: 37. Goals: 13. Assists: 10. Minutes per goal: 200. Arsenal made a late bid for England striker Ollie Watkins in the final few days of the winter transfer window with Aston Villa refusing the reported \u00c2\u00a340m offer. Villa are in the last 16 of the Champions League, but only 10th in the Premier League table and if Unai Emery's side fail to qualify for Europe then the Gunners may consider another move for the 29-year-old.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Unemployment is low, but workers aren\u2019t quitting and businesses aren\u2019t hiring. What\u2019s going on? Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is Work in Progress, a newsletter about work, technology, and how to solve some of America\u2019s biggest problems. Sign up here. Six months. Five-hundred-seventy-six applications. Twenty-nine responses. Four interviews. And still, no job. When my younger brother rattled off these numbers to me in the fall of 2023, I was dismissive. He had recently graduated with honors from one of the top private universities in the country into a historically strong labor market. I assured him that his struggle must be some kind of fluke. If he just kept at it, things would turn around. Only they didn\u2019t. More weeks and months went by, and the responses from employers became even sparser. I began to wonder whether my brother had written his resume in Comic Sans or was wearing a fedora to interviews. And then I started to hear similar stories from friends, neighbors, and former colleagues. I discovered entire Subreddits and TikTok hashtags and news articles full of job-market tales almost identical to my brother\u2019s. \u201cIt feels like I am screaming into the void with each application I am filling out,\u201d one recent graduate told the New York Times columnist Peter Coy last May. As someone who writes about the economy for a living, I was baffled. The unemployment rate was hovering near a 50-year low, which is historically a very good thing for people seeking work. How could finding a job be so hard? The answer is that two seemingly incompatible things are happening in the job market at the same time. Even as the unemployment rate has hovered around 4 percent for more than three years, the pace of hiring has slowed to levels last seen shortly after the Great Recession, when the unemployment rate was nearly twice as high. The percentage of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs to find new ones, a signal of worker power and confidence, has fallen by a third from its peak in 2021 and 2022 to nearly its lowest level in a decade. The labor market is seemingly locked in place: Employees are staying put, and employers aren\u2019t searching for new ones. And the dynamic appears to be affecting white-collar professions the most. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say this kind of thing has never happened,\u201d Guy Berger, the director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute, told me. \u201cBut I\u2019ve certainly never seen anything like it in my career as an economist.\u201d Call it the Big Freeze. Jonathan Chait: The real goal of the Trump economy The most obvious victims of a frozen labor market are frustrated job seekers like my brother. But the indirect consequences of the Big Freeze could be even more serious. Lurking beneath the positive big-picture employment numbers is a troubling dynamic that threatens not only the job prospects of young college graduates but the long-term health of the U.S. economy itself. The period from the spring of 2021 through early 2023, when employees were switching jobs like never before, was a great time to be an American worker. (Remember all those stories about the Great Resignation?) It was also a stressful time to be an employer. Businesses struggled to fill open positions, and when they finally did, their newly trained employees might quit within weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the impact this period had on the psyche of American companies,\u201d Matt Plummer, a senior vice president at ZipRecruiter who advises dozens of companies on their hiring strategies, told me. \u201cNo one wanted to go through anything like it again.\u201d Scarred by the chaos of the Great Resignation, Plummer and others told me, many employers grew far less willing to either let go of their existing workers or try to hire new ones. Even as they were still shaken by the recent past, employers were also growing warier about America\u2019s economic future. In March 2022, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to tame inflation, and the business world adopted the nearly unanimous consensus that a recession was around the corner. Many companies therefore decided to pause plans to open new locations, build new factories, or launch new products\u2014all of which meant less of a need to hire new employees. Once it became clear that a recession had been avoided, a new source of uncertainty emerged: politics. Recognizing that the outcome of the 2024 presidential election could result in two radically different policy environments, many companies decided to keep hiring plans on hold until after November. \u201cThe most common thing I hear from employers is \u2018We can\u2019t move forward if we don\u2019t know where the world is going to be in six months,\u2019\u201d Kyle M. K., a talent-strategy adviser at Indeed, told me. \u201cSurvive Until \u201925\u201d became an unofficial rallying cry for businesses across the country. By the end of 2024, the pace of new hiring had fallen to where it had been in the early 2010s, when unemployment was more than 7 percent, as Berger observed in January. For most of last year, the overall hiring rate was closer to what it was at the bottom of the Great Recession than it was at the peak of the Great Resignation. But because the economy remained strong and consumers kept spending money, layoffs remained near historic lows, too, which explains why the unemployment rate hardly budged. Look beyond the aggregate figures, and the hiring picture becomes even more disconcerting. As the Washington Post columnist Heather Long recently pointed out, more than half of the total job gains last year came from just two sectors: health care and state and local government, which surged as the pandemic-era exodus to the suburbs and the Sunbelt generated demand for teachers, firefighters, nurses, and the like. According to an analysis from Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, hiring in basically every other sector, including construction, retail, and leisure and hospitality, is down significantly relative to pre-pandemic levels. Among the hardest-hit professions have been the white-collar jobs that have been historically insulated from downturns. The \u201cprofessional and business services\u201d sector, which includes architects, accountants, lawyers, and consultants, among other professions, actually lost jobs over the past two years, something that last happened during the recession years of 2008, 2009, and 2020. The tech and finance sectors have fared only slightly better. (The rise of generative AI might be one reason the hiring slowdown has been even worse in these fields, but the data so far are equivocal.) David Frum: How Trump lost his trade war A job market with few hiring opportunities is especially punishing for young people entering the workforce or trying to advance up the career ladder, including those with a college degree. According to a recent analysis by ADP Research, the hiring rate for young college graduates has declined the most of any education level in recent years. Since 2022, this group has experienced a higher unemployment rate than the overall workforce for the first sustained period since at least 1990. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that college graduates have significantly better employment prospects and higher earnings over their lifetime. It does, however, mean that young college graduates are struggling much more than the headline economic indicators would suggest. For job seekers, a frozen labor market is still preferable to a recessionary one. My brother, for example, eventually found a job. But the Big Freeze is not a problem only for the currently unemployed. Switching from one job to another is the main way in which American workers increase their earnings, advance in their careers, and find jobs that make them happy. And indeed, over the past few years, wage growth has slowed, job satisfaction has declined, and workers\u2019 confidence in finding a new job has plummeted. According to a recent poll from Glassdoor, two-thirds of workers report feeling \u201cstuck\u201d in their current roles. That fact, along with a similar dynamic in the housing market\u2014the percentage of people who move in a given year has fallen to its lowest point since data were first collected in the 1940s\u2014might help explain why so many Americans remain so unhappy about an economy that is strong along so many other dimensions. This is a warning sign. The historical record shows that when people are hesitant to move or change jobs, productivity falls, innovation declines, living standards stagnate, inequality rises, and social mobility craters. \u201cThis is what worries me more than anything else about this moment,\u201d Pollak told me. \u201cA stagnant economy, where everyone is cautious and conservative, has all kinds of negative downstream effects.\u201d According to economists and executives, the labor market won\u2019t thaw until employers feel confident enough about the future to begin hiring at a more normal pace. Six months ago, businesses hoped that such a moment would arrive in early 2025, with inflation defeated and the election decided. Instead, the early weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency have featured the looming threat of tariffs and trade wars, higher-than-expected inflation, rising bond yields, and a chaotic assault on federal programs. Corporate America is less sure about the future than ever, and the economy is still frozen in place. Support for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"After a rush of momentum to close out last year, the industry is pondering its next steps across AI, gaming, and more. by  Vox Creative Crypto is, once again, exploding. Momentum born of a potentially friendlier regulatory atmosphere has met rising coin values, with Bitcoin more than doubling in value last year. Meanwhile, powered by advances to the underlying infrastructure, crypto is evolving beyond speculation and into real utility. That\u2019s driving new use cases for AI and enabling seamless experiences across gaming and more. Saga has emerged as a key enabler of these shifts, providing scalable, on-demand blockspace for AI, gaming, and decentralized finance (DeFi). The company\u2019s efforts are facilitating industry acceleration \u2014 \u201cmore, faster,\u201d as Saga puts it \u2014 expected to continue throughout 2025. With that in mind, here are a few predictions for what\u2019s to come. Artificial intelligence continues to work its way into more and more of our daily lives. It\u2019s getting better at automating tasks and enhancing our work, and continued investments will only keep growing AI\u2019s influence. But when it comes to certain real-world datasets, AI runs into some limitations. It would never be trusted with the keys to its own bank account, for instance. But its own crypto wallet? That\u2019s feasible. AI-driven DeFi strategies could reshape trading, lending, and asset management. AI is quickly becoming more capable than human beings at things like algorithmic trading, assessing borrower reliability, dynamically adjusting interest rates, and even portfolio management. But, to take on its growing workload with trustless execution and true autonomy, AI needs blockchain.  Although this activity represents just a small fraction of transactions today, futurists believe there will be a shift over time so that humans become a participant alongside AI agents. Saga\u2019s AI agent chain infrastructure will prove critical to this shift, accounting for the added strain to blockchains by providing unlimited horizontal scaling to meet demand. It used to be that there was just one blockchain. Then there were five. And then, suddenly, there were hundreds, built to house and accommodate the exploding number of cryptocurrencies. That has complicated industry growth for perhaps obvious reasons: When a user sees their currency go up in value, or when they win at a casino-like game and want to quickly cash in, there\u2019s no obvious way to do so. It could take that user some three weeks for the currency to cross an infrastructure bridge and reach an account for a withdrawal. But the bigger issue, still, is how fragmentation holds crypto back from preventing seamless cross-chain economies. Saga\u2019s Liquidity Integration Layer solves this long-standing problem by creating a seamless flow of liquidity across chains. It makes liquidity composable and gasless, which renders unnecessary the consolidation in the token market that so many industry players have been calling for. The result for gamers, developers, and others is an ecosystem in which liquidity flows easily from one game to the next, from one use case to the next \u2014 realizing its utility as a safer and more transparent form of currency. Traditional gaming has been in flux. Cost of user acquisition is skyrocketing. The boom-time growth gaming companies experienced during the pandemic has largely fallen back to earth, precipitating layoffs at a few major shops. Meanwhile, games have become more expensive to build. So it\u2019s no wonder that more traditional gaming companies have started steering into blockchain, seeing it as a path not only to better revenue but as a way to build a fervorous fan base. Blockchain enables real asset ownership for players, which drives higher engagement and monetization for developers. It moves gaming firms beyond predatory microtransactions and into a world of sustainable revenue models. It also enables interoperable economies that reduce friction between games. As an infrastructure component built to enable that new reality both for web 3 developers \u2014 where it\u2019s the layer 1 of choice for gaming \u2014 and traditional gaming platforms, Saga has seen momentum on both sides of the coin. Adoption from AAA titles is moving quickly \u2014 Saga\u2019s in-house game publishing studio, Saga Origins, works with established leaders like Lussa and Angelic. To keep up with the demand, the company recently bolstered its internal talent, adding Samsung alum Fernando Vasconez to the fold last month. Alongside that growing, two-sided interest in crypto, maturity in DeFi infrastructure will enable the gaming industry to move fully into a new era, overcoming the pitfalls of walled-garden blockchain games. The foundational infrastructure provided by Saga is tailored to gaming ecosystems. That means it\u2019s easier than ever to develop economies that span multiple games. DeFi gaming experiments fell flat during the last cycle as poor tokenomics, inflationary rewards, and a lack of liquidity cut down any chance at a functional system. With Saga\u2019s infrastructure enabling cross-platform liquidity flows, utilizing tokens and developing a bank that flows quickly across games and platforms has been made simple. Players can now enjoy sustainable, interoperable economies that span multiple games, platforms, and chains. The market\u2019s swirl of new developments points to one thing: A surge in the demand for blockchain space. As one illuminating example, when the president launched his memecoin in January, the related surge on Solana reportedly caused network difficulties on the chain. That incident illuminates a larger failure of scalability present across chains. Even beyond high-profile launches, there\u2019s reason to believe capacity will need to scale quickly this year. The rise of AI agents alone will add significant strain to the system, and traditional L1s will struggle to keep up. Saga\u2019s infrastructure, built to support infinite block space, is prepared to take on all that demand \u2014 and provide builders experimenting with AI the runway they need. One thing is certain: Blockchain is becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives, and the underlying infrastructure will have to keep up. Saga\u2019s technical breakthroughs are enabling rapid growth across blockchain gaming, AI, and DeFi. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Tesla (TSLA) stock surged after President Donald Trump won last November\u2019s election, based on his relationship with CEO Elon Musk. But that relationship is likely a driving factor behind the erasure of much of those gains.  The stock closed at $302.80 per share on Tuesday, marking a 37% dive from a peak of $479.86 in mid-December. That\u2019s also the lowest Tesla has closed since Nov. 7, just two days after the election, and it has pushed the company\u2019s market capitalization to less than $1 trillion. In early trading on Wednesday, shares rose by more than 1%, as some investors bought the dip. While Tesla has been slowly shedding some of its post-election gains over the past few months, the latest decline was partially a reaction to a major decline in sales abroad. The European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association on Tuesday reported that Tesla\u2019s sales in the region fell 45% in January, even as the electric vehicle market surged.  In California, traditionally Tesla\u2019s biggest domestic market, new vehicle registrations fell 11.6% last year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.  \u201cCalifornians\u2019 love affair with electric vehicle giant Tesla may have peaked,\u201d the group noted in April. Musk has spent much of his time since the election working alongside Trump in Washington, often sleeping in his government office and posting on his social media site X, formerly Twitter. His Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which he acts as the face of in an \u201cunofficial\u201d capacity, but is actually led by someone else, according to the White House \u2014 has been pushing cost-cutting at multiple government agencies, even those that regulate Musk\u2019s companies. Musk also took time out of his schedule to endorse Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party and participated in an online campaign to convince British officials to release far-right agitator Tommy Robinson.  His political activities, which included his massive financial support of Trump during the presidential campaign, have cost Tesla about $15 billion in brand value, Brand Finance told CNBC last month. Antagonism toward the CEO was a big factor in Tesla\u2019s declining reputation and sales, although the company\u2019s aging products also had a part to play.  \u201cI believe the recent pullback is largely related to investors recalibrating their delivery expectations for 2025,\u201d Deepwater Asset Management\u2019s Gene Munster noted. \u201cThe catalyst to the adjusted expectations has been Musk\u2019s increased political visibility, alienating buyers.\u201d Tesla\u2019s new push to deliver autonomous driving features in China has left some consumers disappointed, Reuters reported Tuesday. Competition in the world\u2019s biggest auto market has been heating up, with chief rival BYD (BYDDY) beginning to offer assisted driving software to mass market buyers. Xiaomi\u2019s (XIACF) SU7, which has been a major hit in the market, offers similar features for free. And behind all of that, Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings fell below analysts\u2019 estimates. Deliveries also narrowly missed the automaker\u2019s own targets for the year, even as Musk forecasted a \u201creturn to growth\u201d in 2025. The company is betting on a revamped Model Y SUV, the company\u2019s best-selling vehicle, and interest in autonomous technology to keep investors happy. Tesla plans to launch a ride-share service later this year using Model Y and 3 vehicles equipped with self-driving software and ramp up production of its Optimus humanoid robots.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production. The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals. BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn). The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels. Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\". He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year. He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders. Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart. Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after. BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic. The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027. Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas. In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year. However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production. Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.  The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\". Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\". Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision. Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work. \"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.  Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects. She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company. According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels, \"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs. \"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\" The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar. BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business. Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables. But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.  In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%. In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively. BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.

The lawsuit stems from the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline eight years ago.

It\u2019s up for preorder along with many laptops from other manufacturers, all sporting new mobile GPUs from Nvidia. by  Antonio G. Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Razer is adding a fresh gaming laptop to the pile of new models up for preorder today: the Blade 18. Like its smaller (but far from small) Blade 16 cousin, the new Razer Blade 18 will come with Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series GPUs and Intel Arrow Lake CPUs. But one major way it differs is its large 18-inch display, which has dual modes allowing it to run at either 3840 x 2400 at 240Hz or 1920 x 1200 at 440Hz. The Blade 18 will start at $3,199.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti and climb to $4,499.99 with an RTX 5090. But if either the Blade 18 or the already announced $2,799.99 Blade 16 are the right pricey option for you, you\u2019ll have to wait until late-April for them to actually ship. Razer isn\u2019t the only PC manufacturer offering new gaming laptops for preorder today. As Nvidia already teased, a variety of new notebooks sporting RTX 50-series GPUs now have finalized pricing, and there are fresh offerings from the likes of Asus ROG, MSI, and HP. Back when many of these laptops were first announced at CES in January, they mostly had estimated prices or no pricing at all. The first wave of these new gaming laptops sits at the high end with high prices, and some are more expensive than their last-gen versions with 40-series GPUs. Like previous generations, we may have to wait until cheaper mobile GPUs are announced and brought to market to get something not priced into the stratosphere. Hopefully, the mobile versions of Nvidia\u2019s new cards won\u2019t be saddled by some of the problems that have hit its latest desktop class, with mediocre improvements over their last-gen counterparts, power issues, or manufacturing missteps. As for some examples of these soon-to-land laptops and the kinds of prices we\u2019re talking: Asus\u2019s flagship ROG Strix Scar 16, with its new wraparound RGB lighting, starts at $3,299.99 with an RTX 5080 GPU and $4,299.99 with a top-of-the-line RTX 5090. The sleeker Zephyrus G14, which is a Verge favorite for balancing gaming performance with everyday usability, starts at $2,499.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti. And the larger Zephyrus G16 starts with the same GPU at $2,699.99. The G14 can go up to the RTX 5080, but the G16 will go all the way to an RTX 5090 once those higher-end configurations come a little later. MSI has its RTX 5090-equipped Titan 18 HX AI is up for preorder for an astounding $5,999.99. (That\u2019s not even MSI\u2019s ridiculous Dragon Edition Norse Myth, which is still listed as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d) The company has some of its slightly more down-to-Earth gaming laptops up for preorder as well, like the Stealth 18 HX AI with an RTX 5070 Ti starting at $2,999.99.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":" The portability of laptops come at the cost of flexibility. Moving away from the open designs of their stationary desktop counterparts, these powerful mobile workstations used to leave little in the way of changing specs after they are purchased. It\u2019s only recently that manufacturers have finally started to heed consumer demand for more repairable and, therefore, more modular laptops, but there are still limits to these designs. We\u2019re also seeing some of those limitations in the growing mini PC market, which is basically a mix of desktop and laptop characteristics. They\u2019re smaller than towering desktops but more powerful than most laptops, but they also offer a few modular parts. Framework has long been championing modular designs and the right to self-repair, and it\u2019s bringing that culture to new segments not only with its smallest laptop yet but also its very first desktop. Designer: Framework        A desktop is already open and modular by nature, right? So what need would you have for a modular Framework Desktop? That\u2019s definitely the first question that would come to anyone\u2019s mind when hearing about the Framework Desktop. Technically, the design is based on a mini-ITX, so it\u2019s closer to a mini PC, a very tall mini PC, than a regular desktop box.        What Framework brings to the table, quite literally, is a plethora of options when trying to build your own desktop, none of which are set in stone save for one. You have an AMD Ryzen AI Max processor at the center of it all, and your choice of storage, power supply, and cooling. Of course, you can also swap these out later on, bringing Framework\u2019s repairable spirit to the mini-ITX space. The one you can\u2019t change, however, is the RAM, which is unfortunately soldered due to its massive 256GB\/s bandwidth.    There\u2019s also a bit of customization freedom right off the bat, such as the choice between black or translucent side panels. The front panel has this tile-based design that you can personalize to your liking, and Framework even open sourced the tile designs so you can 3D print your own. The front ports feature the same Expansion Card system as its modular Laptops, so you can mix and match the ports your needs require. The Framework Desktop starts at $1,099.  Framework started with modular laptops but there was one segment it hasn\u2019t touched until now. Convertible 2-in-1 laptops with touchscreens have become a popular design in the market, but it wasn\u2019t in the company\u2019s crosshairs before. Usually, that\u2019s due to the complexity of the design and the price of components, so it\u2019s almost ironic that the Framework Laptop 12 could be its most affordable one yet.   Moving slightly away from the \u201cprofessional\u201d aesthetics of its other laptops, the Framework Laptop 12 sports slightly more colorful designs complete with shock-absorbing TPU bumpers. It\u2019s a design that screams it\u2019s intended for student use, which was initially the goal years ago. Now it will be marketed for grownups as well, because who doesn\u2019t want a powerful yet affordable laptop anyway?  The Laptop 12 will be running on 13th-gen Intel Core i3 and i5 processors, supporting up to 48GB of RAM. The \u201c12\u201d in its name signifies the 12-inch 1920\u00d71200 display, the smallest so far from its roster. Its most notable feat, however, is the 360-degree hinge that would let you use it as a tablet and even write on the screen with a color-matching stylus. Unfortunately, no price has been announced yet.   It\u2019s strange how shaving is associated with masculinity, but not through product design\u2026 through marketing.

Harvard Business School professor Gary Pisano says this type of rapid growth is a default goal of a lot of companies. And as a result, he says, they often end up\u2014like your friend with the plants\u2014under-resourced and over-invested. In this episode you\u2019ll learn why slow growth is often more sustainable AND profitable, and how to consider the three elements of growth: rate, direction, and method. This episode originally aired on HBR IdeaCast in February, 2024. Here it is. ALISON BEARD: Welcome to the HBR\u00a0IdeaCast\u00a0from Harvard Business Review. I\u2019m Alison Beard. How do you measure success at your company? I bet that a lot of you, if not all of you, will say \u201cgrowth.\u201d Whether you\u2019re an entrepreneur, store manager, team leader, business unit head, or CEO, the goal is to increase revenues by as much and as quickly as the market will allow. But is that realistic? Is it sustainable? Our guest today has studied the performance of nearly 11,000 public US companies over two and a half decades, and found that for most businesses the answer is no. Three-quarters of firms showed little to no growth after adjusting for inflation, and even those in the top quartile of growth in a certain year weren\u2019t able to keep that performance up for more than a few. So, what is the key to steady sustained growth? Gary Pisano is a professor at Harvard Business School who\u2019s done deep dives into the strategies of organizations that both succeed and fail at this. He says that leaders need to be much more thoughtful about the way they set growth targets, focusing on not just market demand, but also their capacity to meet it, and how they map out plans for achieving them. Gary wrote the HBR article, How Fast Should Your Company Really Grow? Hi, Gary. GARY PISANO: Hi, Alison. Thank you. Great to be here. ALISON BEARD: Let\u2019s start with the problem. Has this obsession with rapid growth always been a feature of investor-led capitalism, or has it become more pronounced in recent years or decades? GARY PISANO: I think it\u2019s always been an obsession of companies, at least as long as \u2013 throughout my professional life, which is now close to somewhere between 36 and 40 years, depending on how you measure it. I mean companies I\u2019ve been coming across throughout my career, a steady stream of them, report wanting to grow, and growth as a goal, and almost as a natural thing to be trying to grow as fast as they can. And whenever I speak to CEOs, what\u2019s always top of their mind, it\u2019s growth. Particularly publicly held companies are thinking a lot about growth. That\u2019s what their investors are demanding. And I think that is just kind of part of what these companies and managers have come to learn as normal. Grow as fast as you can. ALISON BEARD: And if the data show that most companies grow modestly or stay flat, but they\u2019re still operating, they\u2019re still employing people, they\u2019re still serving customers, they\u2019re still contributing tax revenues, should we be fundamentally rethinking growth as a goal? GARY PISANO: Look, there\u2019s nothing wrong with growth as a goal. I\u2019m very interested in profitable growth. If you can grow profitably, you\u2019re going to make your shareholders happy, you\u2019re going to create more opportunities for employees, you\u2019re going to be able to pay better wages, you\u2019re going to have a bigger tax base. What I want folks to take away from the article is, growth is a strategic goal. You have to think about how fast to grow, how fast you can grow, and you want to maximize what you can do within the constraints. And if you try to get past that, you will actually make things worse. It\u2019s learning how to do it appropriately, so you can sustain the profitability of it over time, and not just be a flash in the pan. You don\u2019t want growth to kill the company. I\u2019ve seen too many organizations where growth, in and of itself, is what damages the very things that made the company special, and actually contributed to its initial growth. I guess, it\u2019s the classic story of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. ALISON BEARD: You talk about that segment, that quartile of companies, that did grow nicely for a time. I think it was something like between 11% and 12% on average, but they aren\u2019t able to sustain it. Obviously, each company is different, but is that a function of shifting market dynamics? Or do you see some clear common mistakes that they\u2019re all making? GARY PISANO: I do think there\u2019s common challenges, and there\u2019s common traps, that organizations fall into. I do think as you go back to that data, I\u2019ve done the analysis with the most up-to-date data, and I\u2019ve done previous studies with other authors that are a little bit older data, but very long timeframes, 40-, 50-year periods, and many other scholars have done work just trying to characterize the patterns of growth. And the data is pretty consistent across all these studies. And some of these have been done, by the way, not just in the U.S., European firms, Asian firms, even some studies in Africa. It\u2019s a pretty robust set of findings that very few companies grow at all. Everyone\u2019s excited about growth. And it turns out that\u2019s really, really hard, that if you look at the data, most companies don\u2019t grow, or don\u2019t grow very fast. If you look at the top quartile, they have reasonable growth rates, pretty good. It\u2019s double-digit. Once you go to the next three quartiles down, it\u2019s basically close to zero, and the bottom quartiles in a slight negative. So, organizations, as they set growth goals, have to face some of the reality that very few companies grow very fast. And then, of those that do grow fast, very few sustain it for very long. And I think there are mistakes organizations make. One is to think that you can outgrow your resources in the short term and catch up. A lot of times when organizations have opportunities, today, to capture a market, or they have opportunities to hire people, they may outstrip certain resources that they have, certain capabilities. And there\u2019s often a view inside companies, \u201cWell, that\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll catch up. It\u2019s okay if we\u2019re short of people today. Customers are arriving. We\u2019ll figure out how to make it work.\u201d Or, \u201cYeah, I know our supplier base isn\u2019t strong enough, and it\u2019s really straining our supply chain, but you know what, we\u2019re just going to work at it, and we\u2019ll catch up. So yeah, we\u2019ll delay deliveries for now, but next year it\u2019ll be better.\u201d And that is often not the case. So you know, you can borrow money. If you\u2019re short on cash, if you\u2019ve got reasonable financial prospects and a good balance sheet, you can borrow cash \u2013 a lot of other resources you can\u2019t really borrow. If you\u2019re short on them, there\u2019s no way to make them up. And when you\u2019re short on them, they can cause damage. If you\u2019re short-staffed, you could damage your reputation for, say, service. Or sometimes, what we see happen is, they throw tons of money and resources at trying to grow, spend a ton of money, build out factories. It\u2019s almost brute force. And that can leave them with really badly designed supply chains, badly designed processes or no process. They\u2019re holding everything together with duct tape. Really bad cost structure. And then they can\u2019t compete at that level. And their finances don\u2019t work right. That\u2019s a mistake. They get very excited about the prospect of growth, but they don\u2019t think about, or maybe they underestimate, the difficulty of building up the organization to do it. And that\u2019s why I talk about in the article, growth is about both the demand side, which is the market, and the supply side, what are we capable of doing? And if you break that supply side, you may not be able to recover very quickly. ALISON BEARD: It sounds like you\u2019re describing, one side of the problem is being under-resourced for skyrocketing demand, and another problem is expecting sky-high demand, and acquiring too many resources, and not being able to deploy them effectively. GARY PISANO: Yeah. It\u2019s this idea that, if demand is growing today, it\u2019s going to keep growing. We saw that during the pandemic. There were certain markets where demand was skyrocketing, and yet that\u2019s a pretty special set of circumstances. Part of the thinking can be, \u201cWell, let\u2019s make hay while the sun shines.\u201d It\u2019s an opportunity. It\u2019s maybe a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build an installed base. So, strategically it kind of makes sense, but at another level, and it was well-publicized that Peloton had a lot of difficulties, because their supply chain just wasn\u2019t capable of meeting that demand. And then, they threw a lot of resources at it to do it. They built up a lot of capacity. And of course, that stuff all takes time. By the time you get there, then the market is cooling back off. And it\u2019s not that the market goes away, but suddenly you\u2019ve built a cost structure for a much, much bigger company. ALISON BEARD: Besides existing and potential market demand, what are the other specific factors regarding capacity that leaders need to consider when they\u2019re setting their growth rate targets at a more realistic way? GARY PISANO: Literally, it\u2019s almost working backward to think about the organization, think about the resources, and think about the bottlenecks to growth. Identify what are the bottleneck resources. A competent CFO will make sure that cash is not a bottleneck, that you don\u2019t run out of cash. They\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t overspend and wind up bankrupt. But you have to apply that same logic to every other resource in the company. So if you think about \u2013 is it people, is it frontline workforce, is it managers, is it mid-level managers, is it senior managers, is it a certain kind of supplier, really almost systematically go through and ask yourself, \u201cWhat are the resources here that are constraining our growth? And what is the growth rate that we can have, based what that resource is capable of providing?\u201d And then set your growth based on that. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t, over the long-term, grow faster, but then it\u2019s a strategically, that\u2019s the resource you attack to increase its productivity or find more of it. There\u2019s a company I talk about in the article, Pal\u2019s, it\u2019s a fast food chain, and they had a really interesting approach to growth. They have a very special operating system. They\u2019re a small fast food chain that does very well. And that\u2019s a business, by the way, where it\u2019s hard to do well when you\u2019re small, because it\u2019s a very scale-intensive business. At some level, they have no right to be doing well, and yet they do very, very well financially. They\u2019ve built the model around speed, but more importantly, they\u2019ve built a very unusual model around quality, so that they can serve customers really fast, mistake-free. And that actually contributes to a better cost structure. But the core of it is, they have fostered a very, very unusual culture that allows them to really get something fairly close to zero defects. That culture really depends on the store managers. They have these owner-operators. And their belief is, it takes a few years to become an owner-operator, and an owner-operator is a really special person. And they invest a lot of time in hiring them, recruiting, and developing them. It\u2019s like three to five years of development before you get your own store. But the way they decide when to add a new store is when they have a graduate of their internal development program and say, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s somebody. They\u2019re ready for a store. Let\u2019s go open a store.\u201d Most companies do it the other way around. They say, \u201cHow many stores do we want to create? We want to create five stores next year,\u201d or 10 stores, whatever the number is. And then they say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go find people to run them.\u201d And Pal\u2019s just turns the logic on its head. And that\u2019s a good example of driving growth off your bottleneck. It can seem slower, but it can be much more sustainable and profitable, and you can, over time, if you expand your capability to develop that resource, in this case, the store managers, then you could grow faster if you wanted to. ALISON BEARD: It\u2019s interesting, because culture is sort of what enables them to grow, but it\u2019s also this constraint, so they have to think very carefully about that trade-off. GARY PISANO: Culture is a huge part of what breaks when companies grow quickly. That is probably one of the single most fragile parts of organizations as they grow. Because every time you add people, you\u2019re bringing in new cultural DNA, and organizations will talk about, \u201cWell, we have to keep the culture,\u201d but they often don\u2019t recognize what\u2019s needed to do it, and what parts of the culture have to change, and not change, to sustain the growth. ALISON BEARD: Yeah. And interestingly, Pal\u2019s was your positive example, and then your cautionary tale came from the same industry, another fast casual restaurant chain called B.GOOD, that I\u2019m very familiar with because it\u2019s founded in Boston actually by a friend of mine before it was taken over by private equity, and became a cautionary tale. So, talk a little bit about the contrast between those two. Where did B.GOOD go wrong in contrast to how Pal\u2019s did it right? GARY PISANO: And I will say I love B.GOOD, but the cautionary tale was, early on, I think their model was really nicely aligned. They were trying to do something different in the quick serve business, the idea of healthier food, local ingredients, cooked in a more normal or non-industrial way \u2013 ALISON BEARD: And this was pre-Chipotle, pre-Sweetgreen. Yeah. GARY PISANO: They were an early mover in it. Their founders had a terrific vision. And they also said, \u201d We think this requires different culture. We\u2019re going to be a more family-oriented culture. We\u2019re going to hire locally, like you\u2019ve walked into a local place, not a fast food chain, but a place where, hey, they know your name.\u201d And I think their founders recognized early on that, that was a real constraint on how they could grow. Typically, the way chains like that grow quickly is by franchising, but I think they recognized there were few constraints. One is franchising does make it harder to control the culture. The second thing was, just supply chain. You had to keep this pretty localized around leveraging local supply chains. That was part of the promise to customers that it was going to be local, so it would constrain your geographic growth. But early on, they had all their stores in the Boston area. Then they decided, and the case on them has a quote from one of the founders about, \u201cSomeday we want to be as big as McDonald\u2019s.\u201d And they start this fairly rapid growth. They start opening new stores. They start franchising more. And you just get this lack of congruence between the elements of what they needed to sustain themselves. It\u2019s just harder to maintain the culture. It\u2019s harder to deal with the supply chain issues. They could have grown more quickly, but they would have then changed their model. It\u2019s okay to grow faster, but then recognize you may need to change your model to make it more scalable. ALISON BEARD: So in the article, you give labels to these things that we\u2019re talking about \u2013 you talk about the rate of growth but then also the direction of growth and the method of growth. Talk a little bit more about what you mean in terms of how companies need to think about these three elements of growth in concert? GARY PISANO: My argument is that, really, companies need growth strategies. And a growth strategy is composed of three interrelated sets of choices. One is, how fast should we grow? The second is direction, which is, in which direction? And by that I mean, what markets do we go after? Are we going to get broader? Are we going to expand geographically? Are we going to diversify to new markets? Are we going to try to penetrate a particular market? The third element is method of growth, which is, how do we obtain the resources to grow? If again, you\u2019re a fast food chain, do we franchise? Are these company stores? If you\u2019re a different kind of business where you don\u2019t have franchising, do you use vertical integration? Are you partnering? Do you do acquisition? A classic method choice is organic growth versus growth by acquisition. What I try to point out is, like any strategy, there\u2019s no one right answer. There\u2019s no one magical growth formula of rate, direction, and method that everyone should use, but there are trade-offs between them. And you have to understand those trade-offs. You may make some choices on rate that are going to have implications for direction and method. Really, what I hope folks take away from the article is, if you\u2019re running a company, hey, we need a growth strategy, and that growth strategy is three things, rate, direction, and method. We need to evaluate our growth strategy based on that. And then, we need to think about those choices, and the implications of the choices we\u2019re making there. Do they fit together and are they consistent with our goals? ALISON BEARD: So what are some practical ways that team, division and company leaders can better recognize their limitations without being too conservative? How do you begin to be more realistic about what\u2019s attainable? GARY PISANO: So again, I think the rigor that is often imposed by a CFO, in terms of finances, which is, if you try to serve on the board of a few companies. If we have growth plans, if those growth plans are going to cause us to run out of cash, the most basically competent CFO, will be able to identify that. We need to apply that same rigor to thinking about the other resources. People. Do we have enough people? Are we planning ahead? Are we planning to develop and hire? Do we have the right even middle managers, if they\u2019re store managers or service technicians. I find that companies that are really good with sustaining growth really take seriously their human resources. They don\u2019t pay it lip service. They really think about developing talent. They want to make sure they\u2019ve got the right talent in the right positions. And an excellent growth strategist is not thinking about slower growth. They\u2019re thinking about how to build the capabilities of the organization to enable faster growth. ALISON BEARD: On the human resources front, it does seem like so many organizations either say, OK, everyone here just needs to work a little bit harder. Or the opposite approach is, let\u2019s just put more bodies in the building, more bodies, more bodies. And you can see how neither of those would be successful strategies GARY PISANO: Does not work. In fact, it\u2019s a vicious circle. Because you start hiring people and their productivity is initially lower, and then you\u2019re sometimes creating more confusion, and your quality standards might go down. Bodies in the building is just not the right way to think about it. So we look at companies that grow. The airline industry is really interesting. Because Southwest Airlines. Until recently, they had some issues last year, but they\u2019ve been really quite a remarkable story of sustained profitable growth over a very long period of time. But they never grew particularly fast at any given year. They grew faster than the market for a long, long time. In fact, they helped expand the market. But more importantly, if you look at their long-term data on growth, they never have explosive years of growth. Their variance is pretty low. It\u2019s a bit of the slower and steady. If you\u2019re growing 6% to 8% a year, but you do that consistently, well through compounding, you grow a lot over 20, 30, 40 years. I do think there\u2019s a pattern there in the companies that grow sustainably. They\u2019re never in a hurry. They never have rush years to grow. They\u2019re never trying to make up a growth shortfall. It\u2019s pretty consistent. I think they take their time. There\u2019s a bit of patience in their growth of, do it right, make sure you have the capabilities, make sure you\u2019re going after the right markets, but keep doing it, keep doing it, keep improving. And it\u2019s not glamorous. It often doesn\u2019t get you on the cover of Fortune or the latest website reporting on company businesses, but I think it\u2019s probably more effective to grow that way. ALISON BEARD: When leaders do see growth opportunities, but they don\u2019t have the capacity, at the current moment, to seize them, how do they quickly get up to speed? Or do they just say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to sacrifice that opportunity for a little bit, until we can do this in a more responsible way?\u201d GARY PISANO: What companies should be trying to do, is investing, and I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s so much capacity, but it\u2019s capability in advance. That is, by the time you see the opportunity, if you don\u2019t have the capability or the capacity, it might be too late to get it. Again, the temptation is, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll figure out a way. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. We\u2019ve got to do it now.\u201d But then, really breaking something with much bigger costs. It\u2019s building the capabilities in advance that you think you\u2019re going to need to grow. And sometimes, it\u2019s building options, because you don\u2019t always know where the opportunities are going to be, so that you\u2019re ready to pounce on these. We\u2019ve been talking, until now, a lot about younger companies who seem to have plenty of demand, but lack the supply side, lack capability, lack the organizational infrastructure. There\u2019s another set of companies who are much larger who have the opposite problem. They know how to be big, they have a lot of capabilities, a lot of resources, but the markets they\u2019re in are not growing quickly, and they\u2019re stagnating. If we look at some big, well-known companies who have stagnated over long periods of time, GE, IBM, others that don\u2019t grow very fast, they shrink over time. The challenge for them is, they\u2019re trying to restart their growth and they see opportunities, and they want to dive into those markets. Let\u2019s say, markets are shifting, there\u2019s a technology shift, and they want to jump into it, but if they don\u2019t have the capabilities to do it, it\u2019s not going to work well. And that\u2019s why we see so much variance in growth rates within industry. Another point I make in the article is, growing quickly is not just about being in the right industry. If you look at any given industry, the variance in growth rates is really high. It\u2019d be like watching a race where some people are way out in front, but then, a lot of the pack is way behind. And the reason some companies are way out in front really does have to do with their capabilities. And those capabilities didn\u2019t just come out of the blue. They were investing in developing them, and then when opportunities arose, they knew where to deploy them. Look at Nvidia today, it\u2019s the fastest growing semiconductor company, because their kind of chips are really well suited for doing the heavy-duty computing required for machine learning and artificial intelligence. But those aren\u2019t capabilities that just came out of the blue. That\u2019s a company that was, because they were a graphics processing company, building really strong capabilities in that kind of computationally intensive chip, for quite a long time. If you don\u2019t have the capabilities, you can\u2019t play the game. ALISON BEARD: I do want to ask, given that investors, employees, suppliers, customers, want to get behind the growth companies, how do you communicate it, as a leader, if you are going to be more thoughtful, and not chase every opportunity, and make sure you\u2019re building capacity in a way that allows for sustained growth rather than extraordinary growth over a short period of time? GARY PISANO: Well I think it\u2019s articulating exactly that. You need a credible story. And again, it\u2019s got to be strategic. It\u2019s got to have a strategic rationale around, \u201cHere\u2019s the rate we\u2019re going to grow, here\u2019s the rate we think we can grow and grow profitably. And the way we achieve that growth is through these kind of markets, that is this direction. And here\u2019s the method we\u2019re going to use, whether it\u2019s acquisition or organic partnering, and this is how it all fits together.\u201d So, you have to have a credible story. I do think credibility matters a lot with growth. Leaders often blame investors or analysts or Wall Street for saying, \u201cWell, we get pressured to grow quickly.\u201d But what you really get pressured to is to grow credibly. And companies who announce these really aspirational growth goals, for a short while, yeah, when they announce them, sometimes their stock price goes up. It\u2019s like, \u201cWow. Those guys are going to grow really fast.\u201d But then once they disappoint, the markets are pretty unforgiving. There can be pressures to grow quickly. And often, again, as people start companies, they attract investors. The investors want to hear a growth story. And you can easily get lulled into providing a bigger growth story than the organization is going to be capable of delivering. That\u2019s shame on both the company, but also shame on the investors, because you\u2019re not helping yourself any by pushing the company into trying to grow in ways that are not going to work. So, I think you\u2019re much better off with a credible story about the growth that you\u2019re going to be able to achieve, and root it in something that you can be confident about. ALISON BEARD: If you are not in the C-suite, you\u2019re a store manager, a project lead, a division head, and your leaders aren\u2019t thinking strategically in this way. You\u2019re in the position of trying to make the case for less ambitious targets, or more alignment between growth rate, direction, and method. How do you do that? How do you make that case? GARY PISANO: Yeah. Again, I would probably not start out by saying, less ambitious. It\u2019s probably the wrong way to start the discussion. ALISON BEARD: Frame it. GARY PISANO: But even that \u2013 it may be that, a lot of times, what leaders of organizations are doing by broaching the possibility of any goal, any stretch goal, is to get you to think about alternative ways that you can achieve it. The mistake, let me run the counter argument here, if I see an organization that said, \u201cWe want to grow,\u201d I\u2019m going to make up a number,\u201d10% a year,\u201d which would be a very fast growth rate, actually, that\u2019s upper quartile growth rate, \u201cconsistently.\u201d And your part of the organization has been growing 3%. Well, the first thing you should ask yourself is, \u201cWell, what would it take to grow 10%?\u201d Not, \u201cOh. I can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s unrealistic,\u201d but, \u201cWhat do I have to change? Maybe I have to radically overhaul my business.\u201d So gain, I want to be really careful here. I don\u2019t want to squash ambition at all. Sometimes, I want really innovative thinking. And by the way, there may be many companies that are growing at 5% that could grow at 10%. They\u2019re not thinking strategically about their growth. They\u2019re not reworking, \u201cWhat\u2019s our method of growth. With a different method of growth, we could grow more quickly. We could grow more profitably. There\u2019s different markets we could be in. You know, innovation.\u201d All those other things that can contribute to more growth. Again, the takeaway from this article shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cOh, always lower your growth rate.\u201d The normal view is, more growth is better.\u201d And the point of the article is, \u201cWell, not so fast. It\u2019s not always better. It can sometimes be worse.\u201d But sometimes, organizations, more growth can be better, and they should be trying it. If you\u2019re in a division, and you\u2019re hearing a higher growth rate, the first question to ask yourself is, \u201cWell, let\u2019s assume for a moment that\u2019s possible. Let\u2019s assume 10% is possible. How can I make it possible?\u201d And then look at all the things you could do differently, and then have the discussion about what you think is realistic. And maybe you can do 10%, maybe you could do 12%, maybe you can only do 5%. But ground it in the reality of, \u201cWhat are the critical resources we need? How do we get those? How long will they take to build up? What do the markets look like? What\u2019s the right method for us? Do we have to do an acquisition? Are we doing this organically? Do we have to get better leverage through partnerships?\u201d You\u2019ve got a whole bunch of tools. And the article encourages you to look at the whole toolbox, there, to figure out, are there ways that you can grow more quickly, sustainably, and profitably?

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"In an all-caps post on Truth Social today, U.S. President Donald Trump said Apple should fully end its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. Tim Cook meeting with President Trump in 2017\"APPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM,\" he wrote. Trump's post comes one day after Apple held its annual shareholders meeting, during which a majority of shareholders voted against a proposal that asked the company to consider abolishing its Inclusion & Diversity policies and goals. The proposal was submitted by the U.S. National Center for Public Policy Research, which calls itself a \"non-partisan, free-market, independent conservative think tank.\" The organization said that DEI programs pose \"litigation, reputational, and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders.\" Apple recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal, labeling it as an attempt to \"micromanage\" the company's business operations. Apple said that it already actively monitors its operations to maintain compliance with applicable non\u2011discrimination laws. During the shareholder meeting, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that the company may be forced to make changes to its DEI policies in the future, as required by law. Trump believes that Apple should get rid of the policies, rather than modify them. In any case, Cook told shareholders that Apple will always have a culture of belonging. \"We strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" said Apple, in its annual shareholders meeting notice. Trump has criticized DEI programs since returning to the White House. Last month, he signed an executive order that \"terminates 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI) discrimination in the federal workforce.\" In response, some other tech companies like Google have scaled back DEI policies in recent weeks.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"There\u2019s a robust ecosystem of Find My accessories on the market nowadays. All of these accessories would make great additions to your life. After all, what\u2019s a better investment than a way to keep track of their most important possessions?  As a refresher, Find My accessories broadcast a low-energy Bluetooth signal picked up by nearby Apple devices. They do not rely on GPS technology. Instead, that location is transmitted securely and privately to the Find My network. This means that your Find My-enabled item is locatable even if you are miles away, so long as someone with an Apple device happens to be nearby. iOS 18.2, released in December, further upgraded the Find My network with a new system for sharing item locations. You can\u2019t have a list of the best Find My accessories without including Apple\u2019s AirTags. Packed with a U1 chip for Precision Finding support, a built-in speaker, and more, AirTags are a must-have for attaching to your luggage, backpack, keys, and other accessories. AirTags have also improved significantly since they were first released in April 2021. Apple has added new anti-stalking features, upgraded notification alerts, and more. AirTags are not without their faults as they only come in one form factor, lack a built-in attachment mechanism, and are nearly four years old. Still, they represent the best way to start with the Find My ecosystem. Buy AirTags: Best AirTags accessories: While Apple\u2019s AirTag is available in a single form factor, Chipolo makes two different trackers that are fully compatible with Apple\u2019s Find My ecosystem. This means you can add them to the Find My app and track them alongside your Apple products. They can also tap into the Find My ecosystem of Apple devices and AirTags to share the most up-to-date location information. My colleague Benjamin Mayo just reviewed the SwitchBot Wallet Finder and described it as an \u201cincredibly useful accessory to track your wallet\u201d using your iPhone and the Find My ecosystem. In addition to being shaped like a credit card to slide into your wallet, it all features a built-in keyring holder. This makes it easy to attach to something like a lanyard or backpack. Buy the SwitchBot Wallet Finder: Read more in Benjamin\u2019s full review. Another card-shaped option for the Find My network is the Pebblebee Tracker Card. The key differentiator with this one is that the battery is rechargeable. The aforementioned options from Chipolo and SwitchBot do not feature rechargeable or replaceable batteries. The Pebblebee Tracker Card offers up to 18 months of battery life and can then be recharged with a USB-C cable. In addition to the Tracker Card, Pebblebee also sells two other Find My-enabled accessories. The Pebblebee Clip is a small tracker that is similar to the AirTag form factor but with a built-in keyring holder. It features up to 12 months of battery life and can then be recharged using a USB-C cable. Finally, there\u2019s the Pebblebee Tracker Universal Tag with Find My integration. This offers an ultra-small form factor with up to 8 months of battery life and a USB-C port for charging. While I generally recommend buying a standalone Find My tracker, there are backpacks on the market that directly integrate Find My. Both Swissdigital and Hyper offer backpacks with Find My integration. If you\u2019re a traveler, Twelve South has one of the more interesting implementations of Find My that I\u2019ve seen. The Twelve South PlugBug is a USB-C fast-charging brick that integrates with Find My. This means you\u2019ll never lose your charger again.  The Twelve South PlugBug is available in two different versions and can be ordered on Amazon.  While accessories from Apple, Chipolo, Pebblebee, and SwitchBot are my top picks, there are other Find My-enabled options on the market. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"U.S. stocks erased early gains on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia\u2019s highly anticipated earnings report. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up 0.2% and 0.01%. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial index shed 0.4%. Data released in the morning showed sales of new single-family homes in January 2025 were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, missing the consensus for 680,000 and down 10.5% from December\u2019s upwardly revised 734,000. Here are stocks to watch today: AppLovin (APP-2.70%), the top-performing technology stock of 2024, plunged in New York trading on Wednesday after two short-seller reports that questioned the integrity of its AI-driven AXON advertising software.  Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research both issued reports that claimed the company, which offers marketing services to app developers, had misrepresented the advantages of its AI platform and was misleadingly \u201cforce-feeding\u201d app installations to users\u2019 phones to inflate revenue.  Axon (AXON-7.24%) stock surged after the weapons and surveillance technology company reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and issued upbeat full-year guidance. Axon posted adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, topping the analysts\u2019 average of $1.40. Revenue climbed to $575.1 million from $544.3 million a year earlier. Intuit (INTU-3.75%) stock rose sharply following a strong earnings report and mixed guidance for the current period.

Salesforce (CRM-3.63%), a leading customer relationship management technology provider, rose ahead of its earnings report, scheduled for release after the market closes. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-15.68%) stock surged after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Workday sees a \"tremendous opportunity\" with DOGE, the software company's CEO said on Tuesday. \"If you want to drive efficiency in the government, you have to upgrade your systems and we find that as a really rich opportunity,\" Eschenbach said on an earnings call on Tuesday. His comments about DOGE echoed similar remarks he made on a November call. On Tuesday, Eschenbach said despite high tech spending from the federal government, its human resource and financial systems are \"very antiquated.\" He added that most of these systems are inefficient because they are on-premises \u2014 still physically located on local servers. Private and public organizations have been pushing to move their servers to the cloud for cost efficiency, security, and collaboration. On an earnings call in November, Eschenbach said that 80% of the federal government's HR systems were on local servers. Workday makes cloud-based human resource software used by employers for job applications, payroll, and performance evaluations. The company's fourth-quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, beating analyst expectations of $2.18 billion. Revenue grew 15% from the same quarter last year. Workday rose over 12% after hours on Tuesday. The company's shares are down 13.5% in the past year. Earlier this month, Workday cut about 1,750 jobs or 8.5% of its workforce. In a note on Tuesday, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote that Workday has an \"attractive valuation\" relative to other high-growth software companies and international opportunities that can drive long-term revenue growth. Jefferies has a buy rating on the stock. Since May, Workday has been working with some federal agencies, including the Department of Energy and the Defense Intelligence Agency. \"Over the last 18 months, we've started to lean into the federal business and opportunity more aggressively than we've historically done,\" Eschenbach said on Tuesday. Eschenbach also acknowledged that there is \"some uncertainty\" regarding DOGE, which has been throwing back-to-back curveballs at federal employees. Just weeks after offering buyouts, the department asked federal workers to respond to an email asking them to detail what they did last week. Agencies differed on their recommendations to employees before the Tuesday night deadline. About 75,000 federal employees accepted the buyout offer, the Office of Management and Budget said last week. That made up 3.75% of the federal government's 2 million people workforce, under the White House's goal of 5% to 10%. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"No. 2, Lee Shau Kee. This story is part of Forbes\u2019 coverage of Hong Kong\u2019s Richest 2025. See the full list here. Though Hong Kong\u2019s economy grew at a modest pace of 2.5% in 2024, China\u2019s stimulus measures lifted investor sentiment, driving up the benchmark Hang Seng index by more than a third from a year ago. But with lingering property woes and looming trade tensions, the collective net worth of Hong Kong\u2019s 50 richest tycoons only edged up to $301 billion from $296 billion last year. ss The wealth of 30 list members increased, led by Li Ka-shing, who continues to hold the top spot with his fortune up slightly to $37.3 billion. While the prolonged downturn in the property market knocked down shares of his flagship CK Asset Holding, other better-performing investments in his portfolio, such as videoconferencing giant Zoom Communications, made up for the slack. Real estate magnate Lee Shau Kee held on to his perch as the city\u2019s second-richest with a net worth of $29.2 billion. His Henderson Land Development\u2019s latest Hong Kong landmark is The Henderson, a $3.3 billion, 36-story office tower. Property and jewelry tycoon Henry Cheng remained at No. 3 but his fortune, shared with his family, fell the most in dollar terms by $2.6 billion to $19.5 billion. Shares of his Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group slumped as demand in China slowed. Another blow was from Cheng\u2019s debt-laden property arm New World Development, which said it had received offers for its various assets, including a Hong Kong mall under its flagship K11 brand. Alibaba cofounder and chairman Joseph Tsai recorded the biggest dollar gain of $2.3 billion this year, thanks partly to rising Alibaba shares following the January release of a new version of its AI model Qwen. A passion for sports also paid off: Tsai sold a 15% stake in BSE Global, which owns NBA team Brooklyn Nets, for $688 million to American billionaire Julia Koch. Buoyant demand for sports apparel drove up shares of clothing manufacturer Crystal International Group, supplier to brands such as Uniqlo and Lululemon. That boosted cofounder Kenneth Lo\u2019s wealth by 64% to $1.8 billion, making him the biggest gainer in percentage terms. A new face this year is that of Francis Lui, the eldest son of casino mogul Lui Che Woo, who died last November. Francis, who shares his fortune with family, was vice chairman of Galaxy Entertainment Group, one of the largest gaming and hospitality companies in Macau, before he was named as its chairman in December. The other newcomer is Yang Qiumei, who inherited a stake in Chinese AI giant SenseTime from her late husband Tang Xiao\u2019ou, cofounder of the company, who died in 2023. The sole returnee this year is Zhuo Jun, who inherited shares in Shenzhen Kinwong Electronic more than a decade ago from her late husband. The printed circuit board maker\u2019s stock nearly doubled in the past 12 months as demand from auto-related and server companies shot up. Two from last year dropped off including Li Sze Lim, cofounder of Guangzhou, China-based R&F Properties, which got weighed down by debt amid China\u2019s property crisis. The cutoff this year rose to $1.4 billion from $1.1 billion. Full Coverage of Hong Kong\u2019s Richest 2025: Editing assistance and reporting by Anuradha Raghunathan.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"smitten kitchen We jokingly call these meaty, greeny, cheesy, beany, spicy baked chickpeas because, well, internet recipe naming conventions make us laugh but I really think of them as Pizza Beans 2.0. I introduced Pizza Beans 1.0 in my second cookbook, Smitten Kitchen Every Day, where I dreamed of a mash-up of Greek gigante beans in tomato sauce and an American baked ziti, with beans instead of noodles. I called them \u201cpizza\u201d beans to try to convince my then-kindergartener to try them with clever marketing. We still adore the recipe and all of the truly unexpected places it\u2019s landed.     But to be honest, these are even more popular with the family these days. Heartier with chickpeas, Italian sausage, dark greens, extra red pepper flakes for heat, and a pecorino-mozzarella broiled cheesy top, the whole dish seems louder, and even more filling. You can see that our default is still to scoop them onto garlic bread (also helps bring reluctant 4th graders to the table) but they\u2019re also fantastic, with or without the melted cheese on top, over polenta or even pasta. It makes a big pan of beans and the leftovers are great \u2014 perfect for meal prepping.    Podcast! The newest episode of my podcast with J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, The Recipe with Kenji and Deb, is all about brownies, a beloved topic here at the Smitten Kitchen. You can listen to it anywhere you get your podcasts and catch up on any episodes you\u2019ve missed right here, such as Nachos, Meatballs, and Onion Soup.  New episodes drop every other Monday. I hope you enjoy listening as much as we\u2019re enjoying the conversation.  Staub x Smitten Kitchen Braiser: It\u2019s been nine months since I announced that I was partnering with Staub to get them to bring back one of my favorite pans, a squat 4-quart Dutch oven (known as a braiser) shown here. I first bought my braiser in 2014 and have since cooked so many things in, it barely leaves my stove. It\u2019s sold out a few times but is finally back in stock and I hope you get a chance to snag one \u2014 or nudge a friend or family member about the perfect gift for you. You can order yours here. I hope you love it as much as I love mine.   Note: If your mozzarella seems wet or comes in water, drain it on paper towels for a while before grating it so the final dish doesn\u2019t become too watery. Gluten-free: This dish is (of course) only gluten-free if you exclude the garlic bread, or make garlic bread with gf bread.  Glug of olive oil1 medium onion, chopped small3 garlic cloves, minced12 ounces sweet or spicy Italian sausage, casings removedKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper1 teaspoon dried oregano1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or less to taste1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed1 6-8-ounce bundle kale, stemmed, or 4 to 5 ounces kale leaves, cut into thin ribbons3\/4 pound mozzarella, coarsely grated (see Note)2\/3 cup finely grated pecorino cheeseGarlic bread, for serving, if you wish  Make the meaty chickpeas: Heat large saut\u00e9 pan \u2014 if yours is ovenproof, you can even use it as your final baking vessel \u2014 over medium-high heat. Coat with a couple tablespoons of olive oil, and heat oil. Add onion and garlic and cook until they begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add ground sausage, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, breaking up the sausage with your spoon into bite-sized pieces and browning them, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter) and chickpeas and bring mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to keep it at a simmer. Taste for seasoning; I usually add another 1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond brand) and more black pepper here.  Simmer the chickpeas in the sauce for 10 minutes, or if you have more time, simmering them for 20 to 25 minutes softens them in a lovely way. If the mixture looks too thick, add 1\/2 cup water, 1\/4 cup at a time, until you get a thick but saucy consistency. Add kale and let it cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. If you\u2019re preparing the dish for later, or skipping the cheese on top, this is a great place to pause the recipe. You could even freeze it at this point. To finish: Heat your oven\u2019s broiler. If your pan isn\u2019t ovenproof, transfer chickpea mixture to a baking dish. Scatter the top with both cheeses and broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots. Eat right away.  Do ahead: See notes within the recipe about where to pause. You can reheat the chickpeas in a 350-degree oven for 15 minutes; I usually keep the lid on.   6 months ago: Napa Cabbage Wedge with Miso Dressing 1 year ago: Chocolate Raspberry Pavlova Stack 2 years ago: Pasta with Longer-Cooked Broccoli 3 years ago: Lemon Sorbet and Sweetheart Sables 4 year ago: Baked Feta with Tomatoes and Chickpeas 5 year ago: New Classic Wedding Cake + How-To 6 years ago: Bodega-Style Egg-and-Cheese Sandwich 7 year ago: Stromboli and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Cookies 8 years ago: Guacamole and Broccoli Pizza 9 years ago: Banana Puddings with Vanilla Bean Wafers and Taco Torte 10 years ago: Charred Cauliflower Quesadillas and Chocolate Oat Crumble 11 years ago: Garlicky Party Bread with Cheese and Herbs and Fennel and Blood Orange Salad 12 years ago: Egg Salad with Pickled Celery and Coarse Dijon and Salted Caramel Brownies 13 years ago: Cheddar, Beer, and Mustard Pull-Apart Bread 14 years ago: Roast Chicken with Dijon Sauce and Mushroom and Farro Soup and Meatball Subs with Caramelized Onions 15 years ago: Mixed Citrus Salad with Feta and Mint and Edna Mae\u2019s Sour Cream Pancakes and New York Deli Rye Bread 16 years ago: Flaky Blood Orange Tart and Warm Butternut Squash and Chickpea Salad 17 years ago: Rigatoni with Eggplant Puree and Matzo Ball Soup and Dulce de Leche Cheesecake Squares 18 years ago: Miniature Soft Pretzels and Sour Cream Bran Muffins Your email address will not be published.

Just wondering if there is a good alternate bean to use other than the chickpeas. I don\u2019t do well with that bean. Thanks. Seconding this! My son is weird: he likes hummus, but not chickpeas, but does like other whole beans. Or pasta. You can use any other bean or legume you like. You could even use 3 to 3.5 cups of cooked lentils here. Hi Deb!  How many more chick peas would you add to make this vegetarian? Thanks! I used extra firm tofu that was previously frozen (better texture for this IMHO) instead of the sausage and just added a little dried fennel to the pot to give it the Italian sausage flavor. Pizza beans is such a riffable idea. I\u2019ve been doing my own rendition ever since you inspired me with the 1.0 version. I just wanted something with a flavor profile more reminiscent of actual pizza and now it\u2019s in my regular rotation. The beauty of some recipes is how they lend themselves to experimentation. Don\u2019t sweat the details \u2014 you literally can\u2019t make this incorrectly! So true! I call them \u201cunbreakable recipes.\u201d It\u2019s  one of my favorite ways to describe so many of the recipes here. I appreciate getting a good dinner on the table even if I was missing parsley or only had 3\/4# of meat. Oooooh \u2014 I like \u201cunbreakable\u201d to describe recipes like this. I think I\u2019ll be borrowing that! Are there any other Brits on here who find it hard to find the right kind of sausage for this kind of recipe? What kind do you use? I live in Belgium and Italian sausage is also sometimes hard to find.  Italian sausages have fennel, garlic and hot pepper \u2013 so I often use a regular beef or pork sausage, but I add a pinch of lightly ground fennel seeds to get the \u2018Italian sausage\u2019 flavour and then increase the garlic and pepper flakes in the recipe. Yes, thanks, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve ended up doing in the past. Wish we could get Italian sausage round here, it\u2019s much nicer for cooking with! no longer in the UK to try it myself \u2014 but maybe chipolatas? got a similar herb-y onion-y vibe actually looks like m&s has italian sausage (Collection British Outdoor Bred 6 Italian Style Pork Sausages) and therefore ocado too Oh, good to know, thank you! Recipes often take italian sausage out of the casing anyway, so mix the sausage seasonings into some minced pork and fry it up. We made the 1.0 recipe back in December [subbing the gigantes with cannelini, and the kale with spinach, and adding veggie sausage] as our last meal before succumbing to norovirus\u2026 if I used the 2.0 name I don\u2019t think I could get my husband on board with this one. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude02 Looks so good! Deb, I think there may be an issue with your website\u2013 it\u2019s showing everything in brackets that should be coded, e.g. \u201c[recipe title=\u201dZiti Chickpeas with Sausage and Kale\u201d servings=\u201d6\u2033 time=\u201d45 minutes\u201d source=\u201dSmitten Kitchen\u201d sourceurl=\u201d\u201d] [recipe-notes]Note: If your mozzarella seems wet or comes in water, drain it on paper towels for a while before grating it so the final dish doesn\u2019t become too watery. Gluten-free: This dish is (of course) only gluten-free if you exclude the garlic bread, or make garlic bread with gf bread. [\/recipe-notes] [recipe-ingredients title=false] Same here, all posts; tried on 3 different browsers. Oof \u2014 it looks like some code is broken on the site; it wasn\u2019t there yesterday. I\u2019ve filed a ticket. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have it fixed in a couple hours. Sorry for the trouble! Looks great! We love the original in our house. We\u2019re trying to eat more vegetarian- would it work if we just left out the sausage? Or would you add more chickpeas to get the right filling-to-sauce ratio? Thanks! You could just add in a vegetarian sausage. There are some great options out there. I am thinking of trying it with the Impossible sausage or even just the regular Impossible. It\u2019s a great stand-in for hamburger, which is of course not sausage but would still be tasty. You could add more chickpeas or you could just make the original Pizza Beans, which are vegetarian. Just finished a bowl of this and it was verrrrrrry delicious. I prefer the chickpea version to the original! I\u2019m trying to figure out what I\u2019d serve it with instead of garlic bread next time, because it\u2019s a rare occurrence that I have a fresh baguette available for such things. Maybe egg noodles? Open to suggestions! Thanks for another banger, Deb <3 As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Privacy Policy","label":0}

To lead it, Trump has nominated a meme stock-promoting, MrBeast-investing private equity executive and podcast host.\u00a0  Bill Pulte is the grandson of William Pulte, the founder of PulteHomes, the third largest homebuilder in the country today. He started his own private equity firm, Pulte Capital Investments, which focused on buying and selling air conditioning companies. More recently, Pulte has made a reputation as a figure in the \u201cmeme stock\u201d world.  \t           \tSo-called meme stocks are investments that, while not necessarily appealing to conventional market analysts, generate excitement in online communities of retail investors, who try to pump the value of the company\u2019s shares through cycles of viral hype. Supporters of a given meme stock often attach non-economic value to the brand and see themselves as underdogs against large financial firms. Most famously, in 2021, traders led a short squeeze against hedge funds that had bet against the beleaguered retailer GameStop by stirring up nostalgia for the stores and spamming memes across social media, arguing that the business was undervalued. Like many other stocks of this kind, GameStop has shed significant value since the height of speculative frenzy around it, and its fluctuations can be volatile \u2014 as with meme coins, a dubious type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven by similar dynamics.  \tPulte, whose financial disclosures show he still owns stock in GameStop, also appeared on podcasts that promoted Bed Bath and Beyond. (A representative for Pulte emailed Rolling Stone after publication to clarify that Pulte himself \u201chas never told anyone privately or publicly to buy the stock.\u201d) BBBY stock gained an unlikely following among meme stock enthusiasts, when Gamestop CEO Ryan Cohen purchased shares in the ailing company in 2022. In the summer of 2023, months after Bed Bath and Beyond filed for bankruptcy, Pulte reportedly said he was \u201ccaptivated by the people and motives of the incredible BBBY community.\u201d\u00a0  \t            \t \t\tEditor\u2019s picks \t \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\t\t \t         \tThe $BBBY frenzy didn\u2019t end well: Bed Bath and Beyond\u2019s stock was delisted, and a lot of unsophisticated investors lost money. One thread on the subreddit WallStreetBets \u2014\u00a0\u201dI Lost over 100k to Bed Bath And Beyond\u201d \u2014\u00a0attracted at least 1,800 comments, with a number of people sharing their own losses.\u00a0  \tAccording to The Street, Pulte has \u201cengaged with retail investors through his X account,\u201d but, looking at his account today, it\u2019s hard to know what exactly was said: the social analytics site Social Blade indicates Pulte deleted some 24,756 tweets in November. (His current X bio describes Pulte as the \u201cInventor of Twitter Philanthropy,\u201d referring to his practice of giving money directly to needy individuals who tweeted at him. By Pulte\u2019s own accounting, he has disbursed more than $1.6 million this way.)  \tLast year, Pulte announced that his family had acquired Bed Bath and Beyond bonds with the apparent goal of recouping some money investors who lost it. At the time, Pulte tweeted that, \u201cOverpaid executives, short sellers, and other key figures contributing to the perceived corruption of Wall Street will have to answer to retail shareholders, and the Pulte family is committed to doing everything it can to ensure answers.\u201d (The tweet has since been deleted.)\u00a0      \t \t\tRelated Content \t \t       \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tAccused Rapist, Sex Trafficker Andrew Tate Allowed to Leave Romania for U.S.\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tJimmy Kimmel on Trump's Gaza Video: 'Like a Cruise Ship Crashed Into Saddam Hussein's House'\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tU.S. Forest Service Chief Retires Amid Sweeping Layoffs, Writes Emotional Letter to Staff\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tElon Musk Says He'll Go on 'Daily Show' After Jon Stewart Blasts DOGE\t\t \t         \tPPSeeds, a YouTuber with whom Pulte has collaborated on multiple occasions and who is also said to have promoted BBBY, held a event during which Pulte was given an award that says \u201cBill Pulte Fucks\u201d on one side and \u201cOnly the Young\u201d on the other.

WEX stock surged 6% post the announcement. Separately, are the clouds lifting? See Super Micro To Spike 20% More? After its recent rise, WEX stock looks fairly priced - making it an ambivalent pick to buy at its current price of around $160. We believe there are some minor concerns with WEX stock, which makes it fairly priced given that its current valuation looks moderate.  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of WEX stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of WEX along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, WEX stock is currently valued in line with the broader market. \u2022 WEX has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 2.8 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 10.8 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 12.3 vs. the benchmark\u2019s 24.4 WEX's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. \u2022 WEX has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 18.0% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 6.1% from $2.5 Bil to $2.7 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 2.2% to $666 Mil in the most recent quarter from $651 Mil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) WEX's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 WEX's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $688 Mil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 25.9% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500)  \u2022 WEX\u2019s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $605 Mil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 22.8% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) WEX's balance sheet looks strong. \u2022 WEX's Debt figure was $4.6 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $6.4 Bil (as of 2\/25\/2025). This implies a poor Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 61.8% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $4.3 Bil of the $14 Bil in Total Assets for WEX.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"This picture shows Baidu logo at it's offices in Beijing on February 18, 2025.  (Photo by ADEK BERRY ... [+] \/ AFP) (Photo by ADEK BERRY\/AFP via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com In recent years, Chinese technology stocks have been largely ignored by the market despite the boom in generative artificial intelligence. Yet, this sector has regained attention following the debut of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI model, which offers near ChatGPT-level performance at a fraction of the cost and computing power, underscoring the robust AI capabilities of Chinese companies. Major Chinese tech names have gained momentum over the past few weeks. For example, Alibaba stock has increased nearly 52% since early January, while Tencent stock has risen by more than 25% during the same period. Baidu\u2019s stock (NASDAQ: BIDU) has lagged behind these peers, climbing only about 6% over the same period. Nonetheless, Baidu could see further gains thanks to its advancements in AI\u2014including Ernie Bot and self-driving technology\u2014and by being one of the few publicly traded companies in China\u2019s AI sector. Baidu stock has fallen by over 70% from its 2021 peak, largely due to China\u2019s weaker-than-expected economic rebound following Covid-19. The real estate downturn has reduced home prices, diminishing household wealth and consumer confidence, while youth unemployment remains elevated. As China\u2019s largest search engine, Baidu derives over half of its revenue from digital advertising. With small businesses reducing ad budgets, sales on Baidu\u2019s search platforms have slowed, particularly in key sectors such as e-commerce, real estate, and travel. In Q4 2024, Baidu\u2019s online marketing revenue was 17.9 billion yuan (about $2.5 billion), representing a 7% year-over-year decline. The company anticipates that search advertising revenue will turn positive only in the second half of 2025, suggesting that these headwinds may persist through the first half of this year, thereby impacting overall revenue growth. Baidu\u2019s AI cloud division experienced a Q4 revenue growth increase to 26% year over year, which helped mitigate the weaknesses in its core online advertising business. Baidu has made significant investments in its AI capabilities, including technologies for robo-taxis and generative AI services. The company reports that its Ernie AI model now receives 1.65 billion daily API calls, with external usage growing by 178% quarter-over-quarter. Additionally, Baidu Wenku\u2019s AI features have reached 94 million MAUs (monthly active users), marking a 216% year-over-year increase. Baidu is also considering open-sourcing its AI models to foster broader adoption. As users integrate more of Baidu\u2019s tools into their applications, this could drive increased use of the company\u2019s cloud services for AI-related tasks, thereby boosting revenues. Nevertheless, there may be uncertainties regarding the impact of generative AI on Baidu\u2019s overall strategy. Baidu might need to develop effective monetization strategies, especially as it incorporates more AI into its core search product, since the current technology offers limited advertising potential. Furthermore, competition in the search space could intensify, as Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent are developing their own large language models, potentially challenging Baidu\u2019s market position. Notably, BIDU stock has consistently underperformed the broader market over the past four years. Returns for the stock were -31% in 2021, -23% in 2022, 4% in 2023, and -29% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, is less volatile. Moreover, it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; they have experienced a less turbulent ride, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including rate cuts and multiple geopolitical conflicts, could BIDU face a repeat of its past underperformance in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024, and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2013 or might it recover? The Chinese government now seems more dedicated to implementing economic stimulus measures to spur growth, indicating a move toward a looser monetary policy and more proactive fiscal spending in recent months. Meanwhile, with a price of about $87 per share, Baidu appears to be very fairly valued. The stock is trading at under 9x consensus 2025 earnings, significantly lower than the nearly 40x multiple it reached during the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, Baidu\u2019s net cash position is approximately $11 billion, roughly one-third of its current market capitalization. Excluding the cash position, Baidu stock trades at about 6x forward earnings, which is quite reasonable. We value Baidu stock at roughly $94 per share, slightly above its current market price.

Some of the big names tanked lower and could not find the usual support. At some point the Wall Street algorithms will find the courage to move back in, but it wasn\u2019t today. First, for an overall look at the entire sector, here\u2019s the daily price chart for the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund daily price chart, 2 25 25. This exchange traded fund has 69 holdings that include hardware, software, semiconductor names among other types of technology stocks. The chart shows four straight sessions of selling with the last two below the 50-day moving average. The early January low of near $225 may be a likely support area. Super Micro Computer (NASD: SMCI) Super Micro Computer daily price chart, 2 25 25. The computer hardware maker looked promising again with the mid-February blast up to above $65 but that is now called into question. The stock\u2019s slide since then has taken it back below the 200-day moving average. The fact that the 50-day moving average appears to be turning up is worth following. Super Micro has a market cap of $26.67 billion. Tesla (NASD: TSLA) Tesla daily price chart, 2 25 25. The drop of 8.39% comes with big volume. The price is nearing the level of the up trending 200-day moving average. The early November gap up may be a target for traders. The same thing goes for the late October gap up. Note how the 50-day moving average is turning downward. This price chart has the look of a head and shoulders pattern, not typically a good sign. Tesla\u2019s market cap is $973 billion. Advanced Micro Devices (NASD: AMD) Advanced Micro Devices daily price chart, 2 25 25 The semiconductor stock dropped to a new low on Tuesday. The 50-day moving average in early August had crossed below the 200-day moving average and has remained below it since then. Advance Micro Devices has a market cap of $168 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 103. The new low and the unrelenting slide must be a disappointment to those who purchased the stock as an \u201cAI\u201d name. Intel (NASD: INTC) Intel daily price chart, 2 25 25. The semiconductor maker took off higher in mid-February and it looked like it might fill the huge early August 2024 gap down. Those hopes faded with Tuesday\u2019s -5.27% slide back below the 200-day moving average. This is the second close below it. Intel\u2019s market cap is $99.55 billion.

(Photo by \u00d6mer Sercan Karku\/Anadolu via Getty Images) Workday (NYSE:WDAY), a cloud-based enterprise software provider specializing in financial and human resource management, recently announced its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (fiscal ends in January) performance. The company exceeded analyst expectations, posting earnings of $1.92 per share with revenue reaching $2.21 billion, surpassing the projected $1.78 per share and $2.18 billion respectively. This strong performance was partly attributed to growing demand for the company\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities. Separately, Is Home Depot Stock A Buy After Q4 Earnings? See more on Trefis.com WDAY stock, with -8% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the broader S&P500 index, up 28%. This can be attributed to the company posting downbeat guidance over the past few quarters. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Workday\u2019s revenue of $2.21 billion in Q4 reflected a 15% y-o-y growth, primarily due to a 16% rise in subscription services. The company\u2019s comprehensive financial offerings, and increased AI product adoption fueled sales growth. During the fourth quarter, the company experienced a 240 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin, reaching 26.4%. This combination of revenue growth and margin expansion drove a 22% increase in earnings to $1.92 per share. For fiscal 2026, Workday projects subscription revenue will grow 14% to $8.8 billion, while adjusted operating margin is forecast to improve by 210 basis points to 28%. These projections are above the consensus estimate of approximately $8.5 billion in sales. Workday\u2019s stock is up over 12% in after-market hours, reacting positively to the Q4 results. Volatility isn\u2019t new for WDAY stock. The performance of WDAY stock with respect to the index over the last four-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were 14% in 2021, -39% in 2022, 65% in 2023, and -7% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could WDAY face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think there\u2019s still some room for growth. As an aside, moving on recent news, see Should You Buy WEX Stock At $160? At its current pre-market price of $285, WDAY shares are valued at 9.1x trailing revenues, below the company's five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 10.4x. Given the robust double-digit growth in subscription services combined with enhanced profitability metrics, an upward adjustment in valuation multiples from present levels appears warranted. Despite recent price appreciation, we believe WDAY stock still has potential for further upside.

This essentially means that the company promises to provide not just Android system updates but also underlying \"kernel\" updates (the core of the software, seemingly making it cheaper for manufacturers to provide these yearly upgrades. \"Through this collaboration, OEMs can more seamlessly update the software and security on their devices, ensuring a more secure and long-lasting Android experience for our users,\" said Seang Chau, VP and GM of Android Platform. Qualcomm is said to offer device manufacturers like the ones mentioned above the ability to bring Android software and security updates. Google has already done this since the Pixel 8 series, offering 7 years of updates with its newer Tensor chipsets, and Samsung offers the same software update promise with its latest phones, including the Galaxy S25 series. Now, it looks like Google is trying to bring that same level of support to other phones on the market.  However, Qualcomm adds that the OEM decides whether or not a specific device will come with the extended updates. This means that it will be up to Samsung, OnePlus, or any other manufacturer to decide the level of support these phones will receive. \"We are raising the bar, providing more flexibility for our OEMs and ultimately enhancing user experiences,\" said Chris Patrick, Qualcomm senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android This collab comes with a respite, as customers will potentially get to keep their devices for longer instead of upgrading to new phones every couple of years. This is particularly good for phones with the 7-series chips coming later this year, meaning cheaper devices could also receive extended support usually reserved for premium phones. That said, it's a bummer that older phones, which don't have the latest chipsets, will not get any of these benefits, which means users may have to upgrade to recent-generation phones soon. \"Legacy platforms cannot take advantage of the extended support. Qualcomm Technologies will continue to work with OEMs on their software support needs for legacy platforms across our product lines,\" the presser added.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Wishlisted Our favourite demos from Steam Next Fest Nailed it \r \"There are too many games,\" is a phrase often heard from people who wish to rustle the jimmies of leftists who contend that overabundance and scarcity are market constructs. It's not something you'll hear from me, but I do think there are quite a lot of one type of game, a game that spawns incessantly within the corrupted magic circle of my inbox, as though I were playing out a scripted last stand against insurmountable odds. That game is the roguelike deckbuilder. \r  \r Once upon a time, I thought \"roguelike deckbuilder\" had a certain robust poetry to it. Now, the syllables strike my ears like the banging of icebergs against a foundering hull. Each new arrival harrows with the thought of a hundred deaths, a hundred unlocks, a hundred fresh descents, all of it spiked with this season's flavour of supporting fiction or subgenre - what's for tea, Mother? Soulslikes on toast? I do still enjoy these games, especially the ones that genuinely have some kind of imaginative twist, and I mean no offence to their creators, but I've run out of ways to distinguish them using the puny English language. So I'm glad that Rogue Light Deck Builder is here to hold up a mirror to my aggravation.\r  \r In Rogue Light Deck Builder, you hammer together a wooden balcony in the flickering glow of a dodgy bulb. A joke like that probably doesn't need a whole game to deliver it, but the Steam demo amused me regardless. Here's how it works: you line up a nail with your floating hand cursor, and smash it in by yanking your mouse around as though trying to free it from the mouth of a resentful dog. The hammer connects with a rubbery animal squeak. It vaguely sounds as though you're crucifying Pikachu. \r  \r In a nice send-up of Borderlandsy RPGs with their geysers of damage numerals, words such as \"perfect\" and \"OK\" flop out on impact and settle squidgily on the boards like condemned sausages, to be absently brushed around as you thwack in nails. There are also bugs you can splat, and special nails with clover stems that (I think) bestow bonus earnings. Much of the time, of course, you'll clobber your own hand, which deducts an \"Ouch\" from the invoice emerging from a printing calculator in top left.\r  \r You are doing all this at the behest of your \"husband\", a molten Dark Souls cadaver seated behind a marble desk. He has upgrades to sell, including more resilient hands, more accurate hammers, and slightly less dodgy bulbs. Each time you exit the store the deck needs to be built again. Beyond it sways a suffocating horizon of cyanotype foliage. The priciest unlock is a key that costs one million dollars and is labelled \"escape\".\r   Try it for yourself here. The full game is out 17th March. Sorry for moaning about roguelike deckbuilders, developers! It's partly that I seldom have time to dig into each one and work out what sets it apart. When all you have is the hammer of overwhelm, everything starts to look like the nail of diminishing returns.\r   Rogue Light Deck Builder   PC           Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in                 Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"CLN Asian equities were largely higher as Hong Kong had a very strong day, while Thailand, the Philippines, and Mainland China outperformed, Japan underperformed, and India was closed for Maha Shivaratri, a Hindu festival celebrated annually in honor of the deity Shiva, according to Wikipedia. Today\u2019s subject line refers to Fleetwood Mac\u2019s song \"Go Your Own Way\" as, unlike U.S.-listed China stocks Tuesday, Hong Kong shares had a very strong day. Growth stocks led the market higher. The most heavily traded stocks by value were Alibaba, up +4.82%, Xiaomi, up +5.83%, Tencent, up +3.44%, Meituan, up +0.94%, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), up +5.9%. Hong Kong and Mainland China volumes and breadth were very strong as Alibaba traded 5X the pre-September 2024 stimulus levels. Mainland China nearly traded RMB 2 trillion in total turnover, which is impressive since anything over RMB 1 trillion in volume traded was considered high a year ago. Indices are at\/near big round numbers, with the Hang Seng at 23,787, the Hang Seng Tech Index at 5,953, Shanghai at 3,380, and Shenzhen at 2,097. Just as we mentioned yesterday, many investors are underweighting the space, which is \u201cmost uncomfortable\u201d as the market melts up (yes, knocking on wood). Several catalysts at play today: It was another strong day of buying from Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect with $1.337 billion of net buying concentrated in Xiaomi, Tencent, and Li Auto. Trump\u2019s copper tariff lifted copper prices. It is worth noting that copper, corn, soybeans, and China\u2019s currency appear constructive on U.S.-China relations despite last Friday\u2019s White House release. We are meeting with Terry Branstad, Trump\u2019s first-term ambassador to China and long-time friend of Xi Jinping, next week in New York. I will report back on our meeting. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +3.27% and +4.47%, respectively, on volume up +12.31% from yesterday, which is 247% of the 1-year average. 411 stocks advanced, while 82 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +5.56% from yesterday, which is 233% of the 1-year average, as 14% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). The growth factor and small capitalization stocks gained more than the value factor and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Real Estate, which gained +6.49%, Consumer Discretionary, which gained +5.08%, and Information Technology, which gained +4.19%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector was Energy, which fell -0.14% as the only negative sector. The top-performing subsectors were steel, consumer discretionary distribution, and food. Meanwhile, petroleum and telecommunications were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 4x pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors bought $1.337 billion worth of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs, including Xiaomi, Tencent, and Li Auto, which were large net buys, SMIC and Meituan were moderate net buys. They were net sellers of Hua Hong Semiconductor, a small net sell, and China Mobile, a large net sell. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained +1.02%, +1.10%, and +2.17%, respectively, on volume up +2.20% from yesterday, which is 171% of the 1-year average. 4,063 stocks advanced, while 985 declined. Growth and small capitalization stocks outperformed value and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Real Estate, up +1.86%, Financials, up +1.49%, and Materials, up +1.40%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Energy, which fell -0.03%, and Communication Services, which fell -0.20%. The top-performing subsectors were steel, brokerage, and paper. Meanwhile, motorcycles, telecommunications, and automobiles were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index both fell versus the U.S. dollar. The treasury curve steepened. Copper and steel rose.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"MrBeast's videos are often measured in minutes, yet behind the scenes, the YouTube star prefers to think in years. The creator, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, recently told \"The Diary Of A CEO\" podcast that he doesn't want to train someone for six months only to see them leave his company a few months later. \"The eighth wonder of the world is investing heavily in an employee, and then they stick around for a decade,\" 26-year-old Donaldson said. He called that kind of value \"unfathomable.\" But loyalty to an employer can be hard to come by in the current market. The median number of years US workers had been with their employer was 3.9 in January 2024 \u2014 the lowest since 2002, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's perhaps a sign that job-hopping doesn't necessarily carry the same stigma it once did \u2014 and also that what Donaldson is seeking in tenure and devotion to the work is something not everyone is willing to give. There's evidence that many GenZers are more disillusioned and disengaged than their older counterparts and that many young workers often \"work to live\" after having seen prior generations suffer. Loyalty is \"maybe more the exception these days than the norm,\" said Christopher Myers, the faculty director of the Center for Innovative Leadership at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. But it can benefit workers and employers alike. Myers said Donaldson appears to understand that to keep workers for long periods, he needs to not just invest in them but give them opportunities to demonstrate the know-how they've developed. For his part, Donaldson said he likely spent four years training and working with Tyler Conklin, who writes and directs many of his videos \u2014 including speaking with him five to six hours a day. Now, Donaldson said, Conklin can practically run the show. \"He knows exactly how I think, what I value,\" Donaldson said on the podcast. Margie Warrell, a leadership consultant and author of the book \"The Courage Gap,\" told BI that that investment in Conklin and his loyalty to Donaldson are examples of what can happen when workers feel aligned with leadership on why they're doing the work. \"My guess is that MrBeast creates a lot of shared sense of purpose,\" she said. That, in turn, leads workers to give their best \u2014 not out of obligation but because they love the work. A representative for Donaldson didn't respond to a request for comment. In addition to showing loyalty, Donaldson said some of the company's top performers \u2014 including editors \u2014 often put in the same amount of hours each week as he does. Donaldson said it's \"hard to find\" the kinds of people who match his hard-charging approach to craft and admittedly tilted work-life balance. \"When you do, you've got to treasure them and recognize that they're unicorns,\" he said. Warrell said that founders and top execs often don't operate on a \"balanced, 40-hour week.\" Instead, she said, many people in such roles try to integrate their work as best they can into their lives. \"When you're doing something that's exciting and inspiring, you do work a lot of hours,\" Warrell said. She said that while it's likely not a good fit for everybody, it appears to be an attractive proposition for Donaldson's long-serving employees. \"He's saying, 'Here's part of the value exchange: I develop you, and I want you to hang around because I pour a lot into you,'\" Warrell said.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Nvidia disclosed its first financial results of the year Wednesday, delivering an eagerly awaited earnings report providing early indications of how it will emerge from the release of the less tech-intensive DeepSeek AI model from China, which led to the AI giant suffering the largest single-day market value loss in stock market history last month. Nvidia's centibillionaire CEO and cofounder Jensen Huang. In its fourth fiscal quarter ending last month, Nvidia reported $39.3 billion in revenue, $0.89 adjusted earnings per share and $22.1 billion of net income, equating to year-over-year revenue growth of 78% and profit growth of 71%. Consensus analyst estimates called for Nvidia to report $38.1 billion in revenue and $0.85 adjusted earnings per share ($19.6 billion net income), according to FactSet data. Nvidia\u2019s datacenter unit, which encompasses the company\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) powering most generative AI models, brought in $35.6 billion in sales, smashing forecasts of $33.5 billion. The company said it expects revenue for its spring quarter to come in at $43 billion, give or take 2%, compared to Wall Street estimates of $42.7 billion. In the earnings release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called demand \u201camazing\u201d for his company\u2019s Blackwell GPU system which hit the market late last year. Despite the company\u2019s across-the-board beats, Nvidia stock traded slightly lower in after-hours, with the slightly negative investor reaction potentially stemming from the slight decline in the company\u2019s gross profit margins, which chief financial officer Colette Kress attributed to \u201ca transition to more complex and higher cost systems\u201d in the datacenter division. This was the weakest top and bottom line growth for Nvidia since the quarter that ended April 2023. It\u2019s still extremely robust expansion for a company of Nvidia\u2019s size despite the slowing pace, as Nvidia\u2019s growth dwarfs the 4% revenue and 10% profit expansion most recently reported by Apple, the only company with a higher market value than Nvidia. $72.9 billion. That\u2019s how much net profit Nvidia brought in during its fiscal year ending last month, a 145% year-over-year jump. It\u2019s an even starker 875% bottom line increase from the fiscal year ending in January 2023, as Nvidia took off amid the AI rush. Shares of Nvidia rose nearly 4% during normal trading Wednesday, closing at $131.28. But Nvidia, with a $3.2 trillion market cap, registered its cheapest intraday share price since Feb. 3 on Tuesday after a down start to the week, declining about 3% apiece Monday and Tuesday. This week\u2019s losses come as tech stocks broadly pulled back amid growing investor anxiety about uncertainty from President Donald Trump\u2019s economic agenda; the Nasdaq declined more than 1% each of Monday and Tuesday as the index closed at its lowest level since late November. Nvidia stock entered earnings while navigating an unusually down stretch, trading about 10% below where it stood ahead of its most recent earnings report in November even after Wednesday\u2019s bump. And the stock is down nearly 10% over the last month during the DeepSeek selloff, as the market expressed concerns high-performing generative AI models which can run on less of Nvidia\u2019s pricey semiconductor technology may lead to weaker sales for Nvidia. The earnings report was a \u201cmassive\u201d test for a wobbling stock market with perception \u201cheavily skewed negative right now,\u201d remarked Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives in a Tuesday note. Heading into earnings, analysts remained largely optimistic on Nvidia stock despite the recent holding pattern. The $175 average price target among the 68 analysts tracked by FactSet indicates 38% upside from Nvidia\u2019s Tuesday share price. Wednesday\u2019s earnings call \u201ccould mark the trough in investor sentiment,\u201d predicted Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya, who are among the most outspoken Nvidia bulls on Wall Street with a $190 price target. The California-based Nvidia became the poster child of this decade\u2019s AI revolution as the top designer of the technology training large-language models. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate Nvidia will capture about 95% of the $158 billion global GPU market in 2025. Nvidia\u2019s dominant market share led to its stock to take off, and it was the best-performing stock of 2023 and 2024 among stocks listed on the S&P for the entirety of those years. But Nvidia has not outperformed the broader market recently, gaining 3.7% over the last six months, worse than the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 6.7% return. Huang, the 13th-richest person in the world, downplayed the negative investor reaction to the DeepSeek release, saying last week the idea AI spending will slow down is \u201ccomplete opposite\u201d of the truth.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\".  Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion. The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.  Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.  The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two. Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\" Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.  Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year. We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.  The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.  The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days. Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro. Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.  As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.  Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat. James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors. So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?  It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.  Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard. In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating. They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari. The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.  Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race. In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.  She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.  Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.  The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.  Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.  It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year. Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.  In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood. However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.  Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan. Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.  Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.  Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump. The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes. The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield. Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners. Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo. But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n. The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.  However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars. Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year. But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category. Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.  In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.  Look back on previous class photos: 2024: 10 things we spotted from Margot Robbie to Billie Eilish 2023: Brendan Fraser has a 'whale of a time 2020: From Quentin Tarantino to a Frozen couple 2019: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper among stars 2018: Cardboard cutouts and splashes of colour 2017: Pharrell Williams dresses down Note: there were no class photos taken during Covid Authorities say there was no sign the couple had sustained any injuries, but no cause of death has been given. Morgan Freeman describes the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news.  As the Oscars race starts to take shape, here's the ABC (Anora, The Brutalist, Conclave) of films to watch. Mark Cunningham runs Sherborne Cinema as a \"labour of love\", as film screenings mark its birthday. The much-celebrated actor's filmography includes Oscar-nominated dramas to comedic roles.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Bitcoin continued its downward trend on Wednesday, signaling that the Trump-driven crypto surge may have run its course. The leading crypto is 20% down from its all-time high that was reached just a month ago during Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. Currently, it is hovering around $86,000, down nearly 10% over the past week. Other major cryptocurrencies were either in the red or flat on Wednesday, including Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which was down by 1% in the past 24 hours. Ether\u2019s competitor, Solana, was down by over 4%. In recent weeks, Bitcoin has remained either stagnant or in the red, awaiting a catalyst for price movement. However, its latest decline may be linked to a crypto hack targeting a Dubai-based exchange named Bybit. On Feb. 21, 2025, attackers \u2014 allegedly the North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group \u2014 stole approximately $1.4 billion in crypto assets from the exchange\u2019s wallet. Adding to market jitters, the recent memecoin scandal involving Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei has reignited skepticism and negative sentiment among investors, further weighing on the crypto market. Once hailed as the most successful exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in history, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant withdrawals in recent weeks. Excluding two positive days, they have recorded net outflows totaling $2.7 billion over the past two weeks. On Tuesday, Feb. 25th,  Bitcoin ETFs experienced a record outflow of over $1 billion in a single day. This sustained outflow is naturally putting pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price, signaling that investors are no longer pouring in funds at the same pace as before. Read more: Bitcoin is better than gold. Here\u2019s why Crypto investors had been eagerly awaiting updates on when the Trump administration would begin stockpiling Bitcoin for the national reserve. While several state governments are pushing to establish their own Bitcoin reserves, the federal government remains indecisive \u2014 a delay that may be weighing on investor sentiment. As Bitcoin becomes increasingly mainstream, it is beginning to mirror the stock market\u2019s reaction to macroeconomic conditions. Recent inflation reports, economic data, and a series of Trump-imposed tariffs have shaken investor confidence, adding to the market\u2019s uncertainty.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"   Cool Hunting\u00ae                The iPhone-first digital artist reimagines creative workflows with AI-enhanced tools and effortless accessibility Adobe has introduced the power of Photoshop to mobile devices, providing both accomplished professionals and emerging artists with a user-friendly platform for on-the-go image editing and design. The new Photoshop iPhone app\u2014soon to launch on Android\u2014offers features such as layering, masking and AI-powered tools\u2014all refined for mobile workflows. This innovation empowers creators to pursue their vision anytime, anywhere.  Mobile Photoshop has been highly anticipated, and from our perspective, it\u2019s the AI-powered tools that allow it to excel on smaller touch screens. Manually creating image masks pixel by pixel, especially with a finger, can be tedious, making features like tap to select vital for usability. Seamless access to Adobe Stock and the integration of Firefly\u2019s generative capabilities unlock an expansive array of image options, empowering users to enhance their photography or visualize and collage anything they can imagine. Elise Swopes, who has spent 14 years creating art on the iPhone and now works at Adobe, played a key role in the app\u2019s development by sharing feedback and insights. She also hosts many of the demo videos, like the one above explaining layers. A friend of CH, we\u2019re so excited to sit down with Swopes and chat about the app. Why is Photoshop coming to the iPhone now? We know that many people use their phones, from established creators to aspiring ones. Now, we are ready to introduce Photoshop on mobile in an accessible and intuitive way. Allowing people to have the knowledge and the expertise about what a layer is, what is masking and selection tools, plus access to Firefly with generative expand and generative fill, is a huge opportunity. They also have access to over hundreds of thousands of Adobe Stock images that are all commercially safe. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity because there\u2019s a hole that hasn\u2019t been filled until now. How did you participate in the creation of the app? About 10 years ago, I was part of a program called \u201cmake it on mobile\u201d as a freelancer, which was when we released the iPad version. In the last three or four years, I was invited to the San Francisco offices to give feedback and ideas about what could be next, especially because of my background. Over the last year and a half, since I\u2019ve been at Adobe, I was put into the room to give feedback and my own personal advice about how we should move forward. How does this new app enhance your workflow? 100%, especially when it comes to Adobe Firefly. There are many things implemented that help me ideate and create faster, and create elements and images that I haven\u2019t been able to have access to before, only with stock. But the biggest thing for me is now I can actually print my artwork. I can blow up my artwork because it actually has high resolution, unlimited layers and all the different abilities for me to actually go back into mask and adjust where I haven\u2019t been able to before. Over the last 14 plus years, I\u2019ve literally had to redo some entire edits because I had to merge my layers, and because I had to limit the file size, because I had to move forward and add one more layer, but it would say I couldn\u2019t add another layer because the resolution was only so much. So I haven\u2019t had those limitations here. Is there anything that you\u2019re currently working on, or have recently made, that you\u2019re super excited about? I love to pride myself on the fact that I have a certain style. The fact that I have access to all of these stocks at my whim, without downloading them to my phone, has allowed me to start really playing with collages, vision boards, different types of album art. I mean, there are so many limitations that I was experiencing that now I can kind of have a little bit more fun and not have to worry about all the different space on my phone. So I\u2019d say that the biggest thing I\u2019m mostly excited about is just different look books and collages and all that fun stuff. I can really just really think outside the box a little more than I always have. Do you have words of wisdom for someone who might be wanting to make work for the first time using Photoshop for iOS? Start with what you have. I started off as a college dropout with literally zero money, but I had a broken iPhone 4, and I just started creating in an app and a bunch of different apps that, of course, limited me, but now that I if I had the same access that I have for free with this app, who knows what else could have occurred, but I started where I was with what I had. Wait for that perfect moment to begin. Create with what you have. We have an undo button and a redo button for a reason. If you don\u2019t know what something does, touch it and feel how it feels. See what it does, see how it reacts. If you don\u2019t like it, undo it. If you like it, keep it and then move on to the next. We have masking and layering and adjustment layers and all this stuff so that you don\u2019t have to overthink about what you\u2019ve just done. You can always go back and delete it and restart and have some fun with it. So we have these incredible opportunities now to really express ourselves, to start where we are and to just create. What are you most excited about? The biggest thing about this is also helping educate people about the potential future of what they may be utilizing. We\u2019re really setting people up for a successful future to utilize even bigger apps like Photoshop on web and desktop, After Effects and Premiere. The whole suite really sets you up so that you can understand these different features and tools and continue to elevate and grow. The Photoshop mobile app is available on the Apple App Store, with an Android version coming later this year. The free app offers premium upgrades through a Photoshop Mobile and Web plan. This plan includes additional features on mobile and iPad along with access to Photoshop on the web. All current Photoshop paid plans already include access to Photoshop on iPad and Photoshop on the web.

Here's what we've tested for your iPhone and Apple Watch.\r In our roundup, we're focusing on primarily multi chargers, usually 3-in-1 designs, that are exceptional in a crowded market. They're all certified, either MagSafe or Qi2.\rMagSafe and Qi2 are very similar, with the latter being based on Apple's MagSafe tech. They both deliver up to 15W of power and use magnets to hold the device in proper alignment.\rIf you want to learn more about the differences, we've done a whole explainer. Otherwise, here are our current favorites.\rSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeJourney GlydeJourney has recently launched Glyde, a 3-in-1 wireless charger. It looks chunky at first glance, but it has a few tricks up its sleeve.\rOn top, you'll see the MagSafe compatible Qi2 pad with 15W of wireless power. Next to it is a smaller Qi pad for your AirPods.\r The Journey Glyde opens up to reveal a hidden Apple Watch puck with fast chargingWith a push, it slides to the side, revealing a hidden Apple Watch charger below. This metal-encased watch puck supports fast charging and can lay flat, depending on the Apple Watch band you're using.\rThe sliding feature is nice, but it's not worth recognition on its own. What pulls it ahead further is that it has a built-in 10,000 mAh battery.\r The Glyde also has a 10KmAh battery to power you up on the go or during a power outageIt's perfect because while you use it on your desk or nightstand, the internal battery remains topped off and ready to go. Then when you leave, you take it with you and you have emergency power.\rThis is a fantastic option for hotels, Airbnbs, or camping where you may or may not have power by your bedside. It's very unique and the only way it could be better, is if the magnetic puck was able to tilt up into StandBy mode.\rIt's available from Journey for $169.99.\rHyper Qi2 4-in-1That brings us to Hyper and its Qi2 4-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand. After the original model was so well received, Hyper updated its 4-in-1 charger.\r The updated Hyper 4-in-1 charges an extra device and folds up for travelIt can charge two Qi devices on the bottom (10W and 5W), a MagSafe-compatible device on top, and your Apple Watch. All at once.\rBest of all, it folds flat. So you can use it bedside or on your desk, then fold it down to bring with you.\r The new model switched to Qi2, tilts, and supports fast charge for Apple WatchOn this new model, Hyper moved away from official MagSafe to Qi2, made the magnetic puck tillable, and added a fast charging Apple Watch puck. All largely improve the product.\rWe also like how this can be powered over USB-C, or you can pick up a standard barrel connector and use that instead. You have a choice, based on what you have on-hand.\rAmazon has the updated charger for $159.99.\rTwelve South HiRise 3 DeluxeTwelve South has recently had its MagSafe chargers highlighted by Apple in its keynotes, giving them some much-needed visibility. While there are various options to consider, we love the HiRise 3 Deluxe.\r The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe looks so niceIn the box is a 36W power adapter that includes several international tips. It is a barrel connector instead of USB-C, but it's nice that it's included and compact.\rThe charger is narrow and deep with the Apple Watch puck in the front and an extra Qi charger in the back. The top and the bottom are covered in a very soft vegan leather.\rThe upper magnetic puck is adjustable, tilting forward or back to help you find the right position. Similarly, the Apple Watch puck can lay flat, or pivot up to support Nightstand mode and different bands. \r It has a soft vegan leather on all materials with a metal frameIt also perfectly supports Standby mode when you place your phone horizontally. The Qi charger on the back does up to 7.5W, whether for a second phone or for your earbuds.\rThe all black look and quality materials made this an easy choice to put on our list. Pick it up from Twelve South for $129 on sale.\rNomad Stand One MaxNomad is another well-known accessory maker and they have a few 3-in-1 chargers out there. Our favorite is the recently-launched Stand One Max.\r Nomad keeps updating its chargers. This one uses Qi2 and a fast charge Apple Watch puckThis one is super hefty with an all metal base with silicone and glass surfaces above. It gives it this innate premium feel as well as helps keep the charger in place when you remove your phone.\rOn this updated model, they moved the Apple Watch charger to the bottom. It was previously jutting out from the top, blocking StandBy mode.\rThis lets you use your watch in Nightstand mode when placed horizontally on the bottom. Plus, it now supports fast charging.\r The updated model moved the watch charger lower to support StandByThe new Qi2 pad is color-matched to the body, and easily works with StandBy to turn it into a smart display or alarm clock. The last Qi pad is located behind the Apple Watch for your AirPods.\rIt will run you $150 directly from Nomad.\rESR HaloLock 3-in-1 with CryoBoostAs mentioned, all of these chargers are Qi2 or MagSafe, meaning up to 15W of peak wireless power. But that's peak power, and not necessarily what it gets the whole time.\r The ESR charger uses an internal fan to keep the temperature down while chargingBut what really limits your charging speed, is the heat. They can all do 15W max, but if they get hot, they have to slow down.\rThat's how the ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 with Cryoboost plans to set itself apart. It promises to increase charging speed with the same amount of power.\rThis is the only one on our list that uses active cooling to help reduce temperatures. When the phone and charger stay cooler, it's able to keep the charging wattage higher.\r You can even game on your iPhone while maintaining performance and chargingIf you've ever used your phone while trying to charge it, you know how warm it gets. You could place your iPhone on the ESR charger and game while still keeping the phone cool and charging.\rAs an added benefit, the Apple Watch puck is removable. It's USB-C and can be taken with you or plugged into any other charger, your Mac, or your iPad in order to fast charge your Apple Watch.\rAmazon has the latest ESR charger for $69.99.\rAnker MagGo 3-in-1 portable chargerFinally, a brand many have likely heard of - Anker. This is the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 portable puck.\rIt's a compact charger that can easily slip into your pocket or bag. It wraps up into a little UFO-shaped pod and then unrolls to charge.\r This small charger is great for travelIt's largely silicone with three individual parts. One for your phone at 15W, one for your watch, and one for your earbuds at 5W.\rIf needed, it can wrap up backwards to turn into a small stand. This lets it be used in landscape mode for gaming or watching videos or it can charge in StandBy mode at night.\r It unfolds to charge three devices or it can fold to support StandBy modeThe only downside is that it can't charge the Apple Watch while in StandBy mode. This is fine for us, because we usually wear our watch to bed for sleep tracking anyway.\rIt's available on Amazon for $89.99.

It gives it this innate premium feel as well as helps keep the charger in place when you remove your phone.\r On this updated model, they moved the Apple Watch charger to the bottom. It was previously jutting out from the top, blocking StandBy mode.\r This lets you use your watch in Nightstand mode when placed horizontally on the bottom. Plus, it now supports fast charging.\r The new Qi2 pad is color-matched to the body, and easily works with StandBy to turn it into a smart display or alarm clock. The last Qi pad is located behind the Apple Watch for your AirPods.\r It will run you $150 directly from Nomad.\r As mentioned, all of these chargers are Qi2 or MagSafe, meaning up to 15W of peak wireless power. But that's peak power, and not necessarily what it gets the whole time.\r But what really limits your charging speed, is the heat. They can all do 15W max, but if they get hot, they have to slow down.\r That's how the ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 with Cryoboost plans to set itself apart. It promises to increase charging speed with the same amount of power.\r This is the only one on our list that uses active cooling to help reduce temperatures. When the phone and charger stay cooler, it's able to keep the charging wattage higher.\r If you've ever used your phone while trying to charge it, you know how warm it gets. You could place your iPhone on the ESR charger and game while still keeping the phone cool and charging.\r As an added benefit, the Apple Watch puck is removable. It's USB-C and can be taken with you or plugged into any other charger, your Mac, or your iPad in order to fast charge your Apple Watch.\r Amazon has the latest ESR charger for $69.99.\r Finally, a brand many have likely heard of - Anker. This is the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 portable puck.\r It's a compact charger that can easily slip into your pocket or bag. It wraps up into a little UFO-shaped pod and then unrolls to charge.\r It's largely silicone with three individual parts. One for your phone at 15W, one for your watch, and one for your earbuds at 5W.\r If needed, it can wrap up backwards to turn into a small stand. This lets it be used in landscape mode for gaming or watching videos or it can charge in StandBy mode at night.\r The only downside is that it can't charge the Apple Watch while in StandBy mode. This is fine for us, because we usually wear our watch to bed for sleep tracking anyway.\r It's available on Amazon for $89.99.

The only thing I would add is that some models work better than others based on where and for what purpose you are using a 3-in-1 charging station to begin with.

I've probably tried a half-dozen or more and I've found that my first impression doesn't always hold true for the long run.\u00a0For example, my so-far favorite charging station for my desktop workstation is very similar to the Hyper Qi2 4-in-1 in terms of form factor, but without the folding capability. The things that make it my favorite include it being rather robust, constructed with a lot of metal, and is heavy. It doesn't move around my desk or move when I place my devices on it. When I pull my iPhone 14 Pro Max off the charging stand it doesn't have any separation anxiety and releases in one-handed fashion. If you regularly use your iPhone while it's on the charging station, which I do very often, you don't want the phone to move around when you tough the screen. A robust and heavyweight charging stand does not really travel well, especially if the charger does not fold into a more compact form. Some of the things that make my stationary charging station a joy to use on my desk keep it from being a viable charging station candidate for travel.Looking at 3-in-1 charging stands intended for travel I'm willing to compromise on one-handed operation for the sake of lightning my travel load and saving space. However, I have found that some 3-in-1 charging stations with hinges sometimes lose the tension in their hinges and everything gets a bit sloppy over extended use. Charging stations have movable charging pads and sometimes the charging pads get loose as well. The way the folding feature works is very important. If the unfolded orientation depends of the tension of a hinge alone, rather than a hard mechanical stop, it is more likely to get loose with use unless there is a way to adjust the tension on the hinge.At this point in the evolution of charging stations it's an absolute must-have for me that they support iPhone standby mode. Supporting the Apple Watch's similar night stand feature is helpful, but I can overlook this feature if the iPhone can be placed on the charging station for Standby mode. This allows me to use the iPhone as a nightstand clock, music or ambiance sounds source, and wake alarm. The iPhones that support Standby mode provide settings to dim the screen and use low contrast fonts and images when the room lights are out.Speaking of lights, make sure that any charging station you buy for bedside use doesn't have a big honking LED pilot light or charging state light on it. These multi-device charging stations may seem like a novelty to some people, but having the ability to charge all of your personal devices with a single power cord is a great thing, especially if you're not a fan of cable clutter.

However, after partnering with Polestar, the firm released a couple of other phones which remained almost exclusive to the Chinese market.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Login  Motorola Android The Motorola Moto G Power (2025) is a descendant of a budget-friendly lineup that has remained competitive in the US market for years. Then again, choice is very limited in the US, so the Moto G Power (2025) doesn't have a hard time finding its place. This year's Moto G Power builds upon its predecessor by offering a slightly bigger display and more durable design, making it an even better all-rounder than before. Motorola didn't raise the pricing either. The Moto G Power is now running on a new Dimensity 6300 SoC and paired with a slightly bigger 6.8-inch display, protected by Gorilla Glass 5 this time around. The back retains the 50MP main camera and 8MP ultrawide camera with autofocus. Kudos for including that feature. We are also met by a familiar 5,000 mAh battery, supporting up to 30W wired and even 15W wireless charging.  All that hardware is protected by an IP68\/IP69 and MIL-STD-810H compliant chassis, a huge step forward from last year's \"water-repellent\" design. Let's see how the device meets our expectations. The handset comes in a modest retail box containing only the usual user manuals and a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging and data transfer.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":" Posts about people implementing a \"low-buy year\" may be popping up all over your social media. \"The general definition, I'd say, of 'low buy' is bringing down those nonessential areas. So that, generally, in and of itself, is a very wide scope, taking down everything that's not essential,\" says Christopher Mattern, CFP\u00ae professional, vice president and financial advisor at Wealth Enhancement. Doing a low or no-buy 2025 could be one way of reducing your spending generally, but there are also less restrictive strategies that are just as effective. If you find that a low-buy challenge is too strict for you, consider these three alternatives instead. One way to curb your spending is to prioritize your savings. The pay-yourself-first method provides a framework to help you shift your perspective and place greater importance on saving money. You must allocate some money to your savings with each paycheck before you can even consider other expenses. When you're focusing on saving money, it helps to have clear goals in mind so you know why and when you should use your money in the future. Some examples of savings goals include building an emergency fund, planning for a vacation, or saving for retirement Compare Today's Banking Offers  Instead of cutting all areas of non-essential expenses, you can try reducing expenses in one or two areas. \"You could say, 'I want to cut a certain percentage.' You could say, 'I want to cut a certain dollar amount.' It's just a matter of setting that goal and then diligently tracking it,\" explains Mattern. Many of the best budgeting apps have features to help identify your spending in specific areas. You can use an app to track your spending over time or use your own DIY method if you find that more convenient. If you have variable income or recognize that you tend to spend more during specific seasons, you could make seasonal spending adjustments. \"It could be that you're tightening your belt that month for any reason. And then, during other months, you can adjust the other way,\" says Scott Stanley, CFP\u00ae professional, founder, and wealth advisor of Pharos Wealth Management. \" In other words, you're not trying to tackle an entire year at once. You're breaking the months up and in more manageable chunks.\" Just like with category-specific spending, you want to have a general understanding of where your money is going and how much money you're saving. Estimate Your Interest Earnings Using a strategy can give you the structure you need to actually save money, but to make it all worthwhile you also have to consider where you're keeping your extra cash. Ideally, you want to put your savings somewhere where it can grow because it can lose value over time due to inflation. \"What I do is I have different savings accounts for different purposes. And you know, it used to be that that wasn't really practical, because you'd have to pay fees for having multiple accounts, and it just was cumbersome and expensive. But now banks make it possible to have multiple accounts without any additional fees,\" says Stanley. Many of the best banks have savings accounts without monthly maintenance fees, meaning you do not need to maintain a certain amount of money in your account or meet other requirements to waive fees. A high-yield savings account is an especially good spot for short-term savings because it offers a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account, and many also do not have common bank fees. However, if you don't need your money for a few years or want to put it toward retirement, investing is a better option for long-term savings. Just keep in mind that investing involves risk, so you don't have a guaranteed rate of return \u2014 and could even lose money depending on how the market moves. Don't know where to start?

DeepSeek says its AI model, Janus-Pro-7B, is better than Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3. The model is a major upgrade on its previous image generator, Janus, which was launched in late 2024. The multimodal AI can read, as well as generate images.  DeepSeek made Janus open-source and available to download from Hugging Face.  Open-source models differ from proprietary ones like those created by OpenAI, as they do not generate direct revenue for companies. Alibaba\u2019s announcement comes amid ongoing debate over whether AI models will eventually become commoditized.  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made detailed plans to restructure the start-up away from its original non-profit status and convert it to a for-profit company. However, earlier this month, Elon Musk made a $97.4 billion bid to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI to disrupt Altman\u2019s plans.  \u201cIt\u2019s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,\u201d Musk says in a statement provided by his attorney Marc Toberoff. \u201cWe will make sure that happens.\u201d Become a PetaPixel Member and access our content ad-free. \u00a9 2025 PetaPixel Inc.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Good product designs solve a user problem, occasionally a problem the user didn't realize they had. Other product designs emerge when companies try to apply some technology they've mastered to a new market, answering a question no one asked. I think this product falls in the latter category, but I'd rather hear directly from the target market, which is musicians. Cooler Master is a Taiwanese company that makes gaming accessories, like chairs that deliver haptic feedback. They've repackaged that technology into this Throne X, a stool targeted at musicians.     It uses \"sound-to-vibration\" internals to essentially serve as a haptic metronome. It can be set to keep its own beat, or provide the sensation of the beat that is already being played. \"Sitting on the Throne X, musicians can feel the rhythm pulsing through their bodies, intuitively performing on the beat, better synchronizing with their bandmates, and immersing themselves in the art of music,\" the company claims.    Musicians among you: Does this actually seem useful? And would you pay the $1,000 this will reportedly retail for?  This technology has existed for decades, although maybe not under this new brand name. A lot of musicians started using a home-theater device years ago called the \"Buttkicker\" for live performance -- it was originally designed to be placed under couch cushions as part of a \"feel it rather than hear it\" home theater system, but a lot of drummers and bass players were quick to adapt it to drum thrones -- and as a platform to stand on -- in order to really feel the kick drum or the bass without having to crank monitors or IEMs for less feedback or quieter stage monitoring. Seems like the \"ThroneX\" is just putting a new name and hefty pricetag on a not-so-new idea. Long time drummer here. It actually works albeit a lot cheaper than $1000. You run a monitor with a 15\u201d driver & eq down the mids & kick the bottom. Your kick drum locks into the bass well. You can be squarely on the beat or play slightly before or after for effect easier.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Thanks to Sarah Lamont and Jaylen Darling for their contributions Everyone talks about the $84.4T great wealth transfer in the context of liquid assets expected to be passed down over the next 20 years. However, fewer people are addressing the $15.5T in private business wealth that is much more operationally complex and obviously harder to inherit. SBA Office of Advocacy, Cerulli Associates, Federal Reserve, F-Prime Analysis  Despite retirement-aged owners (boomers and older) owning 63.1 percent ($9.78T) of the private business wealth \u2014 $4.25T of which we estimate is distributed amongst small business owners with less than 500 employees \u2014 the inherent problems of transferring this portion of wealth creates ample market opportunity for startups in this space to address. For instance, only about 52 percent of heirs claim to actually want the family business which is exacerbated by the fact that the smaller the business, the less likely owners are to engage in exit planning. Stats like these suggest that many retiring SMB owners will need to consider alternative exit strategies outside of passing down their business to their children. More and more retiring owners will likely be selling their business to external buyers, which comes with a vast amount of challenges and pain points for both sellers and buyers. The challenges and pain points that SMB sellers and buyers face are vast: F-Prime Analysis Numerous players are adding value along the process of business ownership transfer from document preparation to deal execution. Acquisition marketplaces like Beacon, Get Acquired, and Tresle are aggregating demand and providing value through free valuation estimation calculators, access to advisors that facilitate deal transactions, and an anonymous listings platform that allows sellers to \u201cmatch\u201d with and approve prospective buyer inquiries. Companies like Boom are supporting companies in the early selling phase, helping owners with key management issues and valuation services to get businesses ready for the marketplace. Baton which just raised $10M in Series A funding and Tresle\u2019s Plus product offers custom marketing assets for sellers; Beacon vets their buyers even going so far as to conduct background checks in specific cases; and Baton and Acquire.com provide a virtual \u201cdata room\u201d to standardize document review and initial due diligence. Buyer-focused acquisition marketplaces are also providing unique value-adds. Companies like Private Market Labs leverage AI to gather a database of on-market small business deals for buyers. OffDeal leverages AI to match and connect buyers with the best off-market acquisition targets. Village Wellth boasts a financing solutions product, Aquirewell, that links buyers with advisors to review financials and structure deals as well as assess their lending readiness and find the best lending options by connecting them with multiple lenders. Boopos offers acquisition financing loans for recurring revenue businesses. Alternatively, business owners who don\u2019t want to sell their business to external buyers can consider employee ownership transfer as an alternative exit strategy. Employee ownership as an exit strategy refers to an owner selling their majority stake in the business to the employees either directly or indirectly. There are multiple types of employee ownership structures with the most common model in the US being Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), with over 6,000 companies and favorable tax incentives. While each employee ownership type has its own tax and governance incentives, across the board employee ownership has shown to be a viable and compelling exit strategy that results in a preserved legacy and company culture and potential for ongoing involvement or gradual transition for the selling owner going through an already emotional process of selling their business. Common Trust is one startup that is taking advantage of the market opportunity by helping owners design and execute an employee ownership buyout using a customized purpose trust \u2014 an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) \u2014 that is cheaper than its more regulated ESOP counterpart. Startups in the space have the opportunity to get in front of selling owners who value company legacy preservation, tax benefits, and the flexibility of selling internally vs to external buyers. F-Prime Analysis On the other hand, the not-so-pretty side of business ownership transfer is that not all of them succeed. Companies like SimpleClosure and Sunset are addressing the clean up process for a sliver of the 80 percent of businesses that don\u2019t survive by efficiently managing the dissolution process for owners. Traditional expectations of business owners to pass down their companies beyond generations are insufficient to deal with the impending demand of millions of business owners seeking retirement over the next decade. While the private business wealth transfer is well over trillions of dollars, numerous startups are adding value for selling owners and prospective buyers that are cheaper and more efficient than a traditional broker and go beyond a standard classified ad posting. The business wealth transfer space has never been more exciting, yet it needs serious investment in new infrastructure to scale and improve the investor experience. For entrepreneurs who\u2019ve also spotted this opportunity, now is an opportune time to build category-defining companies. At F-Prime, we have been partnering with the builders of fintech infrastructure for more than 50 years, including early investments in Alibaba, Flywire, Toast, Quove\/Plaid, Vestwell, and FutureAdvisor\/BlackRock. We could not be more excited by the opportunity we see in business ownership transfer, and the chance to partner with the founders who will define this category.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Lenovo showing off a series of ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 laptops No PC company embraces excitement and innovation more than Lenovo, which always loves to announce new products and prototypes at CES \u2014 as it did again this year. Lenovo announced a slew of gaming products that I covered in a separate article; in this piece I look at its new commercial PC offerings such as the ThinkBook G6. In both categories, Lenovo\u2019s willingness to take risks is what sets it apart from other PC OEMs, and this year the company is once again bringing a robust lineup of new and improved products and industry firsts. This laptop was the star of the show for Lenovo at CES 2025. It was so popular, in fact, that Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips brought it onto The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and wowed his global popstar guest Bad Bunny. That video made it to the top five trending videos on YouTube and got over a million views in under a day. So, what made this laptop so exciting? Well, it\u2019s the first commercially shipping rollable laptop, which gives the user more screen space without increasing the form factor of the device. I got the opportunity to play with this laptop at Lenovo\u2019s booth during CES 2025, and it was truly eye-opening to see it expand from a 14-inch screen to 16.7 inches in a matter of seconds. The potential for this feature is virtually unlimited, but I can already imagine people working on code or in spreadsheets loving this capability. The ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable laptop, in its base mode and extended Lenovo co-engineered the laptop with Intel, which means that it sports an Intel Core 7 Ultra processor, giving it fairly good battery life. I would say that this is far from the thinnest laptop that I\u2019ve seen from Lenovo, but you have to remember that a considerable amount of the display needs to live under the keyboard when it\u2019s rolled up. Lenovo says that this ThinkBook will be available starting in June 2025 at $3,499. Lenovo was also one of the first companies to embrace foldable laptops, so I\u2019m not entirely surprised to see it being the first with a rollable as well. Both technologies have their place, but I do believe that having a diversity of foldables and rollables will be good for the PC industry. Like all ThinkPad Aura Editions, this is also an Intel-based notebook \u2014 but with a major redesign from Lenovo. The X9 is a slimmer notebook than the X1 Carbon I recently covered. It comes in two sizes, 14-inch and 15-inch, and features a redesigned compute and cooling stack. There\u2019s a physical bump on the bottom of the laptop where most of the compute and cooling lives, which also means that Lenovo can finally put a Thunderbolt 4 Type-C port on each side of the laptop for charging. Unfortunately, those are the only two USB ports on the laptop, accompanying the headphone jack and HDMI port. That aside, this ThinkPad X9 has upgrades across the board. I was quite impressed with the form factor and glad to see that Lenovo has listened to user complaints about issues like not having USB-C ports for charging on both sides of the laptop. Lenovo also addressed one of my biggest complaints about earlier generations by upgrading to a 9-megapixel webcam, significantly improving the video conferencing experience. As with the X1 Carbon, Lenovo opted for an OLED on this laptop and certified it with MIL-SPEC 810H durability. The X9 Aura also features a 100% recycled cobalt user-replaceable battery, and the chassis is made of 50% recycled aluminum. Lenovo has also included a bunch of smart AI features which include Smart Modes, Smart Share and Smart Care. There are also many useful accessories for it, including the new 65-watt GaN nano adapter that I also used on the X1 Carbon. There\u2019s a new X9 Charging GaN Dock, which serves as both a dock and a charger, as well as a new multi-device wireless mouse with AI capabilities and a trigger for Lenovo\u2019s AI NOW, its app for AI features. There are even true wireless earbuds and origami sleeves for the laptop to make it easier to use and travel with. The 14-inch and 15-inch versions of the X9 start at $1,239 on Lenovo\u2019s website. The Yoga 9i lineup is probably where Lenovo could use some consolidation or improve its product naming scheme. The fact that there are three different versions of the Yoga 9i is very confusing. The Yoga Slim 9i is a 14-inch notebook with a 120-hertz OLED display that has a 98% screen-to-body ratio and is the first commercially available laptop with the webcam under the display. The Yoga Slim 9i is also a Copilot+ PC powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor with a 48 TOPS NPU, and it features a beefy 75 Whr battery \u2014 all while weighing only 2.62 pounds. The Yoga Book 9i is another 14-inch notebook, but features a dual-OLED display configuration, along with a magnetic wireless keyboard and an understandably huge 88 Whr battery to power both displays. Somehow, it still weighs only 2.69 pounds. This is not to be confused with the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition, which is yet another 14-inch notebook featuring an OLED display, but ships with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and Copilot+ PC capabilities. It also has a 75 Whr battery, but weighs 2.91 pounds. The Yoga Slim 9i will start at $1,849 in February, while the Yoga Book 9i will begin selling in May at $1,999, and the Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition will start at $1,599 in February. Last but certainly not least is the ThinkCentre Neo 50q desktop PC. Normally, there isn\u2019t much to talk about when it comes to business desktop PCs, but this one is special because it\u2019s a very small form-factor PC running the newly announced Qualcomm Snapdragon X or Snapdragon X Plus processor. This should make it an extremely accessible platform for getting Copilot+ capabilities on a desktop, which has been limited to laptops up until now. While there have been some AMD- and Intel-based mini desktop PCs announced by companies such as Geekom, those are focused mainly on SMB users and not as much on consumers. The ThinkCentre Neo is also considerably smaller than the standard NUC-style desktop PC we\u2019ve seen for years, and it could easily be mounted on the back of monitors without the user being aware of its presence. Lenovo is pricing the Neo 50q at $849, and it will be available starting in February. I am excited to get my hands on this device mostly because of its size, but also because of its low cost and (what should be) relatively high AI performance. Lenovo\u2019s continues to take risks in its consumer and business PCs, and to work closely with the leading chip vendors to enable unique and powerful AI solutions. The company is also leveraging AI to help deploy PCs more quickly and maximize ROI with programs like AI PC Fast Start for enterprises, which focus on deploying the right AI-ready devices to the correct users and pairing those devices with lifecycle services to ensure a high level of support. Lenovo has lots of unique products coming down the pipeline this year, and I\u2019m interested to see how the market responds to them, especially with major expectations of a refresh coming this year accelerated by the end of Windows 10 support.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"All eyes will be on Nvidia when they report earnings after the close. (Photo by Jakub ... [+] Porzycki\/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Key Takeaways The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are in the midst of a four-day losing streak following losses on Tuesday of 0.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The Russell 2000 was down a fraction of a percent; however, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the one index up on the day, gaining just under 0.5%. While the beginning of the week has felt slow, rest assured that will change starting Wednesday, after the close. If there is one stock that continues to have a potential hold on the market, it\u2019s Nvidia. The chipmaker is scheduled to report earnings after the close. Looking back at the last four quarters of earnings, the stock notched gains on the day after announcing three out of four times. The sole down day was this past November when the stock fell 1%. But in the three quarters prior, shares were up 3% in August, 2% in May and 16% last February. Now, prior performance is not something I rely on, but it is worth noting the stock has dropped 6% this year and is off almost 18% from its all-time intraday high set in January. That may make it attractive for many who have waited for a pullback to get long. Heading into earnings, the options market is implying a move of roughly $13 by Friday, which would mean a range of $113 to $139. A few other stocks in the news this morning include Lowe's. The big news here was that same store sales saw an increase for the first time in nearly two years. That stock is currently higher by 4% in premarket. Shares of General Motors are also up 4% in premarket. The automaker announced a $6 billion stock buyback program and plans to raise its dividend by 25%. Lastly, Alcoa's CEO is warning that tariffs on the aluminum industry could result in the loss of 100-thousand U.S. jobs as a result of tariffs. There is one economic report due out on Wednesday: new home sales. I don\u2019t think this report will garner much in terms of headlines, especially given so much focus on Nvidia. However, it\u2019s a number that may help contextualize the overall economy. The bigger economic reports will come Thursday and Friday. The most recent Durable Goods report is scheduled to come out before the open Thursday, and then on Friday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures report will be released. The PCE has been the report the Federal Reserve relies on most heavily for gauging inflation. For Wednesday, all eyes will be looking toward Nvidia. I expect much of the chipmaker sector see some positioning ahead of the report. We have heard multiple times this quarter about companies planning greater and greater investment in artificial intelligence and it would make sense that Nvidia would be the beneficiary of at least some of that spending. Therefore, it's not simply the last quarter results that matter, but forward-looking statements are arguably even more important. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

The stock fluctuated in after-hours trading after closing up 3.7%. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter \u2014 a 78% increase from the previous year and an all-time high. Consensus had been for $38.1 billion. Net income was $22 billion for earnings per share of 89 cents, also beats. Nvidia\u2019s full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% \u2014 also above Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $42 billion. \u201cWe\u2019ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips \u201camazing\u201d as companies roll out reasoning AI models.  The company\u2019s gross margins will be in the low 70s,  but is expected to return to the mid-70s later in the fiscal year as Blackwell fully ramps up, CFO Colette Kress said on Nvidia\u2019s earnings call. Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue rose 93% year on year to a record $35.6 billion last quarter. However, data center sales in China remain low due to restrictions, Kress said, adding that the company will continue complying with chip export controls. Ahead of the earnings, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up production of its Blackwell chips \u2014 despite shockwaves from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. In December, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia\u2019s reduced-capability H800 chips. The startup\u2019s\u00a0powerful reasoning model, R1, spooked investors in January, causing Nvidia\u2019s stock to plunge 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value \u2014 a record loss for a U.S. company. \u201cNvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,\u201d Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told Quartz ahead of the results. The company dominates \u201cthe technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don\u2019t even know they need yet.\u201d  Encouraging updates on production and shipments of the Blackwell platform will probably move the stock, Kunjan Sobhani, lead semiconductor analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Quartz ahead of earnings. Investors are wary of a potential \u201cair pocket\u201d in growth between the first and second quarters of the current fiscal year as customers move to Blackwell  from Hopper, he said. \u201cThat is the spot when the Hopper shipments could really come down, and the Blackwell ramp  \u2014 from a quarter to quarter perspective \u2014 might not be enough to show significant sequential growth,\u201d Sobhani said, adding that Blackwell could \u201ccatch up in the second half.\u201d For Nvidia\u2019s reputation and valuation, \u201cthe sequential expectations matter,\u201d Sobhani said. \u201cIf they say something which agitates this sort of concern further, that could imply temporary volatility in the sentiment and the stock.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Anthropic touts its latest AI as the most intelligent and first hybrid model, with a visible step-by-step thinking process.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Anthropic recently unveiled Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI, touting it as the \"most intelligent model to date\" and the \"first hybrid reasoning model on the market.\" According to the company, the new model generates near-instant or extended responses to queries. Users can see the model's step-by-step thinking process, while its API can control how long Claude 3.7 Sonnet thinks before responding to a query. The model also ships with significant enhancements across coding and web development. Aside from the new hybrid reasoning model, Anthropic is also launching Claude Code. As the name suggests, it's a command line tool for agentic coding. However, it's only available in preview and allows developers to assign tasks to the AI model directly from a terminal. Last year, a report emerged indicating that top AI labs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, may be unable to develop advanced AI models due to a lack of high-quality content for training. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman disputed the claims, indicating \"there's no wall,\" echoing former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's about the lack of evidence indicating scaling laws have begun. AI labs are seemingly inclined and leaning more on reasoning models than previous iterations that heavily relied on online resources amid rising copyright infringement concerns. In the standard mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet represents an upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In extended thinking mode, it self-reflects before answering, which improves its performance on math, physics, instruction-following, coding, and many other tasks. This is the case with Anthropic's latest model. Claude 3.7 Sonnet ships with a drop-down menu that allows you to select the thinking mode you'd like to use depending on your query's complexity. For instance, you can select Normal mode, which is the basic option often \"best for most use cases.\" However, there's an Extended Mode option for complex queries, which best handles coding and math challenges. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. \u201cWe've developed Claude 3.7 Sonnet with a different philosophy from other reasoning models on the market,\u201d Anthropic added. \u201cJust as humans use a single brain for both quick responses and deep reflection, we believe reasoning should be an integrated capability of frontier models rather than a separate model entirely. This unified approach also creates a more seamless experience for users.\" It's worth noting that the new model might take a tad longer (up to a few minutes) to generate a response, especially when dealing with complex tasks or queries.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Soundboks redefines how loud a Bluetooth speaker can be.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.   Join Namerah Saud Fatmi as she explores the cool, quirky, and sometimes downright odd world of smartphone accessories, gadgets, and other nerdy toys every week. SOUNDBOKS sent me an insanely large, nearly 21-kilo package last week. This box encompassed a Bluetooth speaker of epic proportions. In fact, the speaker was so large in size and made such bold promises I decided to test it out in the field to examine its value. I was part of a team arranging a community-centered bazaar in my town over the weekend. This presented itself as the perfect opportunity to test the SOUNDBOKS 4 speaker's prowess. I may have overestimated its capabilities by forgoing a PA system altogether in favor of this mammoth speaker at the venue. You'll find out in a bit if that was a smart decision. Sure, 126 decibels sound loud enough for an outdoor event with hundreds of people buzzing around, buying food and other knickknacks from small businesses and vendors. But what looks good on paper hardly ever reflects perfectly in real life, so I was nervous going into this hands-on trial. First off, the SOUNDBOKS 4 is by no means the cheapest wireless Bluetooth speaker of the sort on the market. You can find plenty of other 200W portable speakers priced well below its $999 price tag and from far more established brands like JBL and Logitech-owned sub-brand Ultimate Ears. However, SOUNDBOKS brings something unbeatable to the table: a 40-hour battery life on the go paired with audio that gets as loud as 126 decibels thanks to its trio of 72W RMS amplifiers built-in. Even the 200W JBL Partybox 310 only manages to produce about 80 decibels of sound. If you run out of juice, the entire battery box \u2014 or BATTERYBOKS as the brand likes to call it \u2014 slides out of the back and conveniently plugs into any USB-C cable and 65W USB-C charger for fast charging. As if that's not enough already, you can buy more of these chunky 12.8 V LiFePO4 batteries separately to always have swappable power when needed. One BATTERYBOKS will set you back $149. You can also charge the SOUNDBOKS 4 while the BATTERYBOKS is plugged in and hooked up to the speaker. The only drawback here is that this compromises its water-proofing in doing so. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android With a soundstage as large and capable as this, the SOUNDBOKS 4 almost sounds good enough to be a PA system replacement for outdoor events and larger parties. Not familiar with PA systems? That's an abbreviation for a public address system that consists of mixers, amplifiers, and speakers all hooked up to create one unified sound system. This kind of system is absolutely necessary for large events and gatherings, be they festivals, bazaars, conventions, parties, concerts, or markets. Usually, a decent PA system with wide enough coverage can cost a pretty penny, starting from $500 for incredibly basic ones and going up to $10,000 for premium setups. Instead of renting out a setup like this, I decided to use the SOUNDBOKS 4 for music and announcements at our local bazaar. Since I only had one SOUNDBOKS 4, this left me with one-directional audio, which doesn't sound equally great from every angle of a field or area. Still, there were many upsides to this. First of all, had I actually paid $999 for the SOUNDBOKS 4, it would be an investment. After hosting just two large events at $500 a pop per rental, you already get your money's worth instead of renting audio equipment. From the third event onward, it'd be free if you compare it to rental fees. The SOUNDBOKS 4 can be paired wirelessly with other SKAA-enabled speakers or other SOUNDBOKS speakers to create a wireless stereo setup, which fixes the multi-directional audio problem. Unfortunately, Bluetooth 5.0 means that this speaker isn't Auracast-ready, which is a shame because not everyone has an SKAA-enabled speaker lying around. I really hope the brand refreshes this gigantic rugged Bluetooth speaker once the Bluetooth Auracast standard is readily available.  Of course, if you want to connect something via cables, like a mixer, an amp, a musical instrument, or a microphone, you can do so very easily. The SOUNDBOKS 4 has one AUX in and one AUX out port, as well as dual 1\/4\u201d XLR inputs to hook up relevant audio or video equipment. There are three connectivity modes on the speaker, and you can set up a PIN to restrict connection. This is managed through the mobile app, which is also where you can manage audio presets and access the custom equalizer. Not to mention, the goliath has a perfectly sized hole at the bottom for mounting on a standard speaker mount. This, in effect, can help you create a wireless PA system that's also waterproof and doesn't need cables to connect, beating out the current systems that are widely used and rely on grounded sources of power or generators. Admirably, the speaker's IP65 water-resistant rating is true to its word. Believe me, did I put that to the test? In the midst of the bazaar, heavy rain came pouring down upon my crew and me. The entire venue was nearly flooded, but the SOUNDBOKS 4 kept blasting on, pumping music to lift our (literally) dampened spirits. My biggest qualm about the SOUNDBOKS 4 was its weight and size. Although there are handles carved into both sides of the outdoor speaker, it's way too heavy for me to carry. If you have special medical conditions that restrict you from picking up hefty loads, you'll need an extra pair of hands or two to help you transport the darn thing. As the rain stilled and the sun came out again at the bazaar, the SOUNDBOKS 4 continued to function. It lasted through a scorching hot day, quickly becoming a storm without any technical errors. My team of organizers had originally intended to rent a PA system, but the SOUNDBOKS 4 was sufficient for music and small announcements during the event. If you're someone who hosts big parties or events regularly, I highly recommend the SOUNDBOKS 4. This speaker sounds better from a distance, which is just nice for the outdoors. It can actually replace a PA system and bring extras to the table, such as portability and waterproofing. For best results, though, I suggest getting two of these bad boys to create a stereo sound system that's loud enough for a gathering of 200 people.   Bombastic sound The SOUNDBOKS 4 gets unbelievably loud, so much so that you can comfortably use it for a huge event with about 150 to 200 people in attendance. The battery life is a champion among portable speakers and its robust design is something to write home about. Namerah enjoys geeking out over accessories, gadgets, and all sorts of smart tech.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).Bitcoin's sharp price declines have dominated news headlines this week, but major corporate BTC holder Strategy (MSTR) has been in a downtrend for more than three months. Trading around the $250 level on Wednesday, Strategy is lower by about 55% since peaking at $543 on Nov. 21. Investors in leveraged MSTR products have suffered even greater losses. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) has plunged 90%, while the T-REX ETF (MSTU) has declined 85%. Despite the decline in bitcoin, Strategy's BTC acquisition remains profitable. Since initiating purchases in August 2020, the company is up 32% on its holdings, with an average cost basis of $66,300 per BTC and an unrealized profit of $10.65 billion at bitcoin's current price of about $87,000.  A closer look at Strategy\u2019s convertible debt highlights potential \u201cliquidation prices\u201d or forced bitcoin sales. Notably, all of the company's 499,096 BTC remain unencumbered, meaning Strategy has not pledged any bitcoin as collateral. An earlier convertible note using bitcoin as collateral with Silvergate Bank was fully repaid. According to Bitcoin Overflow on X, Strategy has $8.2 billion in total outstanding debt, backed by 499,096 BTC, currently valued at $43.4 billion. The short answer: As long as the value of Strategy's bitcoin exceeds its debt levels, the company would not need to sell any of its BTC holdings. In other words, bitcoin would have to decline all the way to approximately $16,500, or roughly another 80% from current levels. Taking a more detailed look, two of the six outstanding convertible bonds\u2014the 2029 and 2030 issues\u2014are below their offering price. They're large bonds, though, accounting for $5 billion out of the $8.2 billion total. Even then, the debt does not mature until 2029, allowing time for recovery. And in theory, Strategy could roll over more paper, if that were to happen. If the value of the company's bitcoin were to drop below debt levels at the time the convertible bonds matured, and the MSTR stock price was below the conversion price (which would be very likely in that scenario), Strategy \u2014 in order to prevent massive dilution in its stock \u2014 would likely decide to sell bitcoin to repay the bonds in cash rather than converting them into equity.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"The boss of The Pok\u00e9mon Company believes the series can last for at least another 50 years if it continues to innovate. First launched on Nintendo's Game Boy in 1996, the video game has expanded into films, TV and toys to become one of the world's highest-grossing media franchise. Most recently, the trading card game based on the cute creatures at the centre of its universe has seen a surge in popularity - but it has also brought scalpers and frauds to the hobby. CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, who has been in charge of the company since 1998, spoke to BBC News ahead of its yearly update about the secret of its success, tackling challenges, and the series' future. Pok\u00e9mon Day is an annual livestream showcasing upcoming releases, upgrades and events. Fans got an extended look at upcoming Nintendo Switch title Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A, and learned it would be released later this year. There was also a first glimpse of Pok\u00e9mon Champions - an upcoming mobile game that appeared to be inspired by the Stadium series focused on battles. And the company also showed off additions to the digital and physical versions of its trading card game. Mr Ishihara wasn't giving away too much ahead of the event but says the company's long-term goal is to \"enrich both the real world and the virtual world\". Pok\u00e9mon GO - the company's successful mobile phone app that works with a device's GPS to place monsters in the real world - is an example of this. \"This is what I think is the biggest strength of Pok\u00e9mon, and it's important for us to come up with this kind of idea,\" he says.  \"So that's how I think of what we want to achieve next.\" One of the hottest topics among long-term Pok\u00e9mon fans today is scalpers. The resurgence of the collectible card game has caught the attention of resellers who buy up new packs in the hope of landing rare, valuable cards. YouTuber Logan Paul switched a lot of people on to the potential profits of the hobby when he paid $5.3m (\u00a33.9m) for the most expensive Pok\u00e9mon card ever. Gaming companies have long had an issue with the second-hand market, and Mr Ishihara says it \"prevents new products from being sold\". \"When the second hand market becomes more valuable because of rarity, that is problematic because our business is affected.\" Fans have suggested The Pok\u00e9mon Company could produce a greater volume of hard-to-find or limited-run items but Mr Ishihara says it cannot do much to control the resale market. \"Those items are seen to be valuable because they're rare or seen as vintage \u2013 and it's not our place to say that they're not,\" he says. On the topic of counterfeit products Mr Ishihara is more direct, and says the company's legal teams have fought \"rigorously\" against clones and fakes since the beginning.  It recently won a long legal battle against the Chinese company behind a copycat mobile app. And earlier this year it joined Nintendo to sue the makers of Palworld - an online multiplayer survival game described as \"Pok\u00e9mon with guns\". It alleges developer Pocketpair infringed patents, which it has denied. Pok\u00e9mon has continued to bring new fans to the franchise by expanding into anime, card games, movies and toys alongside its video game titles. Mr Ishihara says fans now \"span several generations\" and believes \"the biggest reason behind their success is the fact that Pok\u00e9mon became a tool of communication\". Last weekend, about 13,000 Pok\u00e9mon fans headed to the European leg of the International Championships at London's Excel Centre. It demonstrates Mr Ishihara's point that people have found their way into the series through various means. Fans Justin, 25, and Marina, 28, who turned up to the event in Team Rocket costumes, tell BBC News they got into Pok\u00e9mon by watching the animated TV show as children. \"I just loved all the designs, all the different characters,\" says Justin. \"They were just really really cute.\" Marina says in-person events have become a chance for her to meet fellow fans. \"I always used to want to go to conventions and these sorts of events. \"So being able to be here and network and make friends has been such a blessing,\" she says. The Pok\u00e9mon Company is unusual because it is a private company. Other well-known Japanese brands, such as Nintendo and Hello Kitty maker Sanrio, are publicly traded and answerable to shareholders. Mr Ishihara believes this allows his company to keep a single-minded focus on one thing.  \"Pok\u00e9mon is the only thing we do at the Pok\u00e9mon Company,\" he says. \"So whatever profit we make from Pok\u00e9mon gets reinvested in Pok\u00e9mon.\" He adds that this means the company doesn't have to field questions about expanding or creating new characters from shareholders. \"Our answer will be: 'We'll go bust when Pok\u00e9mon is no longer popular'. \"I don't think they will like that.\" At the end of 2023, longtime hero Ash Ketchum and his best pal Pikachu bowed out of the animated Pok\u00e9mon series. The series has continued without the well-loved duo, but one of the \"hardest questions\" Mr Ishihara gets asked is what they're up to now. \"Even though the TV camera may not be following them, Ash's journey is continuing and his partner Pikachu is right next to him.\" With the franchise set to mark its 30th anniversary next year, rumours are already beginning to swirl about special plans for the occasion. Remakes or re-releases of the original Game Boy games are high on many fans' wishlists. Mr Ishihara doesn't have much to say on that at the moment, but wants to maintain a focus on \"connecting the real and virtual worlds\".  \"If we continue focusing on our mission, Pok\u00e9mon can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary,\" he says.  \"But if we become complacent and go with the flow, that's when Pok\u00e9mon will go downhill.\" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":" Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Rarely has a single company's earnings report been so closely watched by Wall Street as a make-or-break moment for the broader market. Nvidia, the chipmaker whose central role in the global artificial intelligence arms race has turned it into one of the world's most valuable companies, reported its much-anticipated quarterly results Wednesday. It posted $39.3 billion in revenue, up a hefty 78% for the quarter that ended in January and ahead of analysts' expectations. But for many investors and analysts, the wildly profitable company's financials reveal more than just the state of Nvidia's own operations. And many are likely to take notice of the chipmaker's forward-looking statements Wednesday, which signaled slowing profit-margin growth. The chip giant's importance is due to two major factors: its sizable valuation (meaning that its stock price can weigh heavily on the market as a whole, including the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average) and its role in the AI sector (which now factors heavily into broader U.S. economic growth). Ahead of the earnings, Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said it would be a \"massive day\" for global markets looking to \"gauge the demand trajectory of the AI Revolution.\" Among X's more finance- and tech-focused crowd, the earnings had caused enough anticipation to spark some tongue-in-cheek jokes. As if to underscore just how on edge traders were, Nvidia's stock price swung higher and then lower and then higher again in the minutes right after the report came out. As of about 5 p.m. ET, the shares were up about 2% from where they closed Wednesday afternoon. Brand-name tech firms looking to build out their AI capabilities have purchased Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips by the heap \u2014 a buying spree that has turbocharged the company's share price. Between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024, Nvidia's stock climbed some 880%, making it at the time the most valuable publicly traded U.S. firm, with a market capitalization over $3 trillion. Thanks to that surge, Nvidia is now the second-most-important component of the S&P 500 index, behind only Apple. Nvidia's earnings are heavily scrutinized as a barometer for the economy at large, the growth of which during the past two years has been powered in large part by investments in AI and data center capacity. Yet so far this year, Nvidia shares were down 5% heading into its earnings report amid growing doubts about whether the breakneck pace of global AI investment could be sustained. This week, a report emerged that Microsoft, one of Nvidia's largest customers, was pulling back on its data-center spending. Microsoft has since denied that \u2014\u00a0and many of Nvidia's other key customers, including Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Amazon, all plan to make significant investments. Nvidia, and the AI landscape in general, has also been shaken by the seemingly sudden rise of DeepSeek, a China-backed AI platform that reportedly requires far fewer computing resources \u2014\u00a0and mostly taps chips made by Nvidia rival Intel. More broadly, the U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown amid questions about the strength of consumers and the prospect of higher inflation tied to President Donald Trump's plans to impose tariffs.

Synchronize your marketing programs with buyer needs to deliver hyper-personalized, AI-driven experiences that amplify engagement and impact. Investments in AI have reached unprecedented levels. According to a World Economic Forum report, the global AI infrastructure market was valued at $35.42 billion in 2023, and projected to reach $223.45 billion by 2030. Our own Q4 2024 market research indicates that 55.4% of B2B marketing teams are investing in AI to automate and analyze data to produce actionable buyer and buying group engagement and accelerate conversions. However, this rapid adoption has revealed a key challenge: the lack of cohesive strategies for these unprecedented investments. Microsoft\u2019s 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report echoes this, revealing that 60% of leaders are concerned over their organization\u2019s AI strategy, while 59% are uncertain about AI\u2019s impact on productivity. For B2B marketers, the real opportunity lies in leveraging AI-optimized data analysis, combined with AI agents, to enable buyers more effectively in a market defined by complex buying journeys and large, defensive buying groups. The strategic use of AI allows marketers to harness vast pools of data to develop buyer-centric strategies that address these complexities and empower decision-making. In addition, AI can be leveraged to enhance and append market and marketing insights to demonstrate the tangible value of these efforts. In this article, I will share key tactics for leveraging AI to enable buyers \u2013 and increase conversions by delivering a rich experience. We have seen a significant trend of buyers conducting their own independent research, with almost 70% of the buying journey spent collaborating with other members of the buying group, according to a recent report by 6sense. To engage these buyers effectively, marketers must shift their focus toward enhancing brand awareness, creating brand preference, and delivering relevant content that supports these buyers in their research and decision-making. In essence, marketers must create a more enriched buyer experience that aligns seamlessly with the preferences and behaviors of entire buying groups, accounting for the unique needs of each stakeholder. AI is uniquely positioned to support these buyer-centric strategies by augmenting and optimizing marketing data. This enables marketers to develop highly tailored and effective strategies to engage buyers at every stage of their journey. Demand intelligence, derived from first-party data sources such as analytics, client relationship management (CRM) data, campaign metrics, and client feedback, is essential for delivering personalized outreach that drives qualified engagement. AI can enhance this personalization by analyzing in bulk and enriching first-party data with firmographic, technographic, and location insights to build detailed buyer personas and detect prospect behavior and intent. This not only improves targeting but also enables precise mapping of buyer journeys, offering the insights needed to craft highly personalized messaging that resonates deeply with each buying group member. Additionally, AI can be leveraged to generate conversational content aligned with user behavior and preferences \u2013 obviously depending on organizational policies regarding generative content. This ensures messaging is both relevant and engaging, further driving demand success. Personalization at scale is a cornerstone of successful Account Based Experience (ABX) strategies, but achieving it can be both complex and resource-intensive. AI offers a tactical solution by streamlining critical tasks such as segmentation and data analysis across large sets of accounts. It can be leveraged to identify pain and friction points in the buyer\u2019s journey, enabling marketers to craft and optimize omnichannel experiences tailored to target accounts. AI also excels at account prioritization, leveraging dynamic scoring and intent data to pinpoint accounts and buyers with the highest likelihood of conversion. This ensures that resources are directed toward the most promising opportunities, driving efficiency and maximizing the impact of ABX initiatives. One of the more exciting use cases of AI is the creation of automated omnichannel nurturing strategies that deliver targeted, cohesive experiences across channels such as email, social media, paid media, and content networks. By leveraging data analysis, behavioral insights, and machine learning, AI can tailor messaging, timing, and delivery to individual prospect preferences. How AI optimization can be utilized across marketing channels: AI has the potential to play a critical role in optimizing performance measurement by providing deeper insights and enabling smarter resource allocation in a timely and cost-effective manner. Below are only a few ways AI can unlock demand performance: The promise of AI lies in driving innovation through efficiency over pursuing growth at any cost. For this reason, sophisticated strategic planning and data analysis should take precedence over ad-hoc content creation tasks. With 55% of buyers using AI to automate and analyze data, and 45% focusing on streamlining and optimizing systems and processes, organizations need clear guidance, realistic expectations, and well-defined outcomes to succeed (findings from our Q4 2024 market research). To achieve this, it is essential to upskill teams in AI and provide a suitable framework for its adoption, including clear guidelines for AI usage, privacy protections, and safeguards against cyber threats. By doing so, Go-To-Market (GTM) teams can develop a structured approach to AI adoption, characterized by robust governance, standardization, and a focus on sustainable, value-driven implementation.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Apple on February 21 withdrew its Advanced Data Protection feature from the United Kingdom following government demands for backdoor access to encrypted user data. The move came after UK officials reportedly ordered Apple in secret to provide unrestricted access to encrypted iCloud not just in the UK, but worldwide.  The development has naturally left some Apple device users in the UK asking questions about the security of their data and whether their digital privacy has been affected. Keep reading to learn the answers.  Advanced Data Protection (ADP) was introduced in 2022, and is Apple's highest level of cloud data security. It is an opt-in feature that expands the number of iCloud data categories protected by end-to-end encryption \u2013 a security measure where data is encrypted in such a way that only the user can access it on their trusted devices, and no one else, not even Apple, can decrypt it. We don't know how many people use ADP (Apple has never released figures) but it is likely that most casual Apple device users have not enabled the feature, either because they don't know it exists or they have old Apple devices that are running older software, making them incompatible with ADP. (ADP requires updated software on all of the devices linked to an Apple Account.) Without ADP enabled, many iCloud data categories use standard encryption. This means categories like iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendars are always encrypted regardless of whether ADP is enabled. The difference is that Apple also holds the encryption keys for these categories and can access the data if legally compelled to do so.  ADP removes this possibility, since the encryption keys exist only on users' trusted devices. In other words, with ADP enabled, even if Apple receives a court order to provide user data, the company technically cannot access it. End-to-end encryption essentially creates a mathematical lock that not even Apple can break. This difference is in how the encryption keys are stored:     Unlike standard encryption, ADP applies end-to-end encryption to additional iCloud data categories including: Apple's move affects two groups of UK users: Notice UK iCloud users now see after the feature was pulledUK users who never enabled ADP will see no change to their current iCloud security. Their data remains protected by Apple's standard encryption, where the company holds the keys and can access the data if legally required.  It's important to understand that not all iCloud security is affected by this change. Several Apple services remain end-to-end encrypted by default in the UK, including: * Messages in iCloud is end-to-end encrypted when iCloud Backup is disabled. When iCloud Backup is enabled, backups include a copy of the Messages in iCloud encryption key to help users recover their data.  The UK government issued a \"technical capability notice\" under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), demanding that Apple create a backdoor allowing British security officials to access encrypted user data globally. This order was made secretly because the IPA makes it illegal for companies to disclose the existence of such government demands. The order would have required Apple to create a backdoor to its end-to-end encryption system, granting UK officials access to user data worldwide, not just within the UK. Worse, Apple would have been legally bound to keep this capability secret, preventing users from knowing about its existence \u2013 which would be basically lying to them about the security of their data. Cybersecurity experts have consistently warned that creating any backdoor to encrypted content weakens security, not just targeted individuals, but for everyone. They often use the analogy of leaving house keys under a doormat \u2013 it creates a vulnerability that can be exploited by anyone who discovers it. Rather than comply with the UK government's demand, which would compromise security worldwide, Apple chose to withdraw the feature from the UK market entirely. In a statement accompanying the withdrawal of ADP, Apple said that it \"remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.\" Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"The mobile gaming world is a vast and lucrative market, with millions of users downloading and playing games daily. However, a common complaint among players is the stark difference between the advertisements for some games and the actual gameplay experience. This deceptive marketing tactic is prevalent, leaving many wondering why it continues and what, if anything, can be done about it. A primary reason for this discrepancy is the use of \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d advertising. Developers often create ads showcasing exciting, high-quality graphics or gameplay mechanics that are either entirely absent from the game or appear only in minimal, highly restricted forms. For example, some games that are advertised as having unique puzzle mechanics are actually match-3 games. This strategy aims to attract a broad audience with visually appealing and engaging content, even if it misrepresents the core gameplay. The goal is to maximize downloads, hoping that enough players will become invested in the game (or make in-app purchases) despite the initial deception. Some companies will invest more in creating eye-catching ads, than the development of the game itself. Another tactic commonly employed is the \u201cfail ad.\u201d These ads intentionally depict someone playing the game poorly, making obvious mistakes that lead to failure. This is supposed to create a sense of frustration and a desire in the viewer to download the game and \u201cdo it right.\u201d Some games advertise using the pin-pulling mechanic that may have almost nothing to do with the game. While seemingly counterintuitive, this approach preys on human psychology. The seemingly simple puzzles and the portrayed player\u2019s incompetence trigger a desire to prove one\u2019s own skill, leading to downloads. The trend of misleading advertising isn\u2019t exclusive to traditional mobile games; it has expanded into the growing market of AI companion apps. Many \u201cAI girlfriend\u201d apps on the Google Play Store advertise themselves with images and descriptions that suggest a level of interaction and responsiveness that may not be entirely representative of the app\u2019s actual functionality. These advertisements can create unrealistic expectations about the depth and complexity of the AI\u2019s capabilities. However, some AI companion platforms, particularly those operating as web applications outside the Google Play Store, take a different approach. These web-based services often prioritize transparency in their marketing. For example, HeraHaven, an AI girlfriend generator, focuses on demonstrating its core features: character customization, interactive conversations, and personality development. This contrasts with the marketing of some Play Store apps, which might emphasize aspects that aren\u2019t central to the user experience. Several factors contribute to the persistence of misleading game ads: Financial Incentives: Advertisers prioritize short-term gains, maximizing downloads and in-app purchases, which leads to profit. Competition: With the mobile app market being so saturated, developers and publishers feel the need to use fake ads to stand out from the rest of the crowd. Free-to-Play Model: Many mobile games are free to download, with monetization occurring through in-app purchases. This model arguably weakens the legal definition of misleading advertising, as users can technically try the game before spending money. Platform Oversight: While Google has policies against misleading ads, enforcement can be challenging due to the sheer volume of apps and ads submitted. Advertising Standards: The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has issued guidelines for mobile-gaming advertisements. The ASA does not have a system of precedent to deal with complaints, but decides on a case-by-case basis. The combination of these factors creates an environment where deceptive advertising can thrive, leaving many users feeling tricked and disappointed. While Google is \u201ccracking down\u201d on unexpected and misleading ads, there are millions of apps that are added to the Google Play Store on a monthly basis, so it is hard for Google to remove them all. Some users note that Google will not proactively remove them. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * Website      \u0394       ","label":0}

TikTok leads mobile spending with $6B in purchases as study shows 70% of platform shoppers convert after viewing content. TikTok, including Douyin in China, earned $6 billion in in-app purchases last year, more than double any competitor, according to Sensor Tower\u2019s Q4 Digital Market Index. This marked a 36% increase from the previous year, showcasing TikTok\u2019s growing financial dominance in mobile commerce. Global in-app purchase revenue reached $39.4 billion in Q4 2024, up 13.5% year over year. Total 2024 revenue reached $150 billion (+12.5% from 2023). Non-gaming apps grew faster, with revenue up 28.2% to $19.2 billion. The revenue gap between apps and games narrowed to just $1 billion, down from $5 billion a year earlier. Recent Ipsos research commissioned by TikTok reveals how the platform reshapes commerce behavior. The study of nearly 4,000 US consumers found that 73% of TikTok shoppers value the platform\u2019s personalized recommendations, with three-quarters agreeing it\u2019s their go-to place for discovering new brands and products. TikTok\u2019s approach to discovery helps drive in-app sales. Two main components of product discovery on TikTok include: This discovery system translates to sales. 70% of TikTok shoppers report purchasing after seeing an ad or shoppable content on the platform. TikTok\u2019s commerce success is built on trust. Ipsos found that 74% of users believe TikTok\u2019s creator content feels authentic, which is higher than that of other platforms. Aaron Jones, Liquid I.V. VP of E-commerce & Media, explained how this authenticity drove results: \u201cAn affiliate creator created an honest review that took off, resulting in a sales lift across omnichannel and a full sell out of the flavor with over 59K total orders on TikTok Shop. Of the purchasers, 88% were new customers.\u201d The Ipsos research identifies three key strategies for brands: iOS accounts for 70% of in-app revenue ($27.5B), while Google Play leads in downloads with 73.6% market share despite hitting its lowest download count (25.1B) since Q1 2020. A recent study by Dentsu showed that TikTok gives advertisers the best short-term ROI in Nordic markets. The study found that TikTok produced an ROI of 11.8. This means that brands earned almost 12 times their initial investment in sales revenue within six weeks of advertising on the platform. Brands that consistently used TikTok as an always-on channel instead of running occasional campaigns saw better sales results and higher returns. In 2025, TikTok is becoming an essential platform for digital marketers due to its solid monetization strategies, noteworthy ROI metrics, and expanding role in commerce.                  Matt G.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Bank of America (BAC+0.20%) is poised to enter the stablecoin market, contingent upon the passage of favorable legislation by U.S. lawmakers, according to CEO Brian Moynihan. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Moynihan stated, \u201cIf they make that legal, we will go into that business,\u201d  according to Decrypt\u200b. Moynihan expressed confidence in the emergence of a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, likening its function to that of money market funds or bank accounts. He emphasized that the bank\u2019s involvement hinges on Congress passing the necessary legislation, which has been suggested to occur within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s going to be a stablecoin, which is going to be fully dollar-backed,\u201d Moynihan said, highlighting the potential for a \u201cBank of America coin\u201d to operate similarly to foreign currency, reported CoinDesk\u200b. The Trump administration has indicated support for clearer regulatory guidelines in the crypto space, which could intensify competition among Wall Street banks, according to Decrypt\u200b. In response to the shifting regulatory environment, other financial institutions are also exploring opportunities in the digital asset space.

Master Google Shopping campaign fluctuations: Uncover causes, troubleshoot effectively, and build client trust with actionable strategies. Managing Google Shopping campaigns is both an art and a science. Even with the most refined strategies and detailed data, performance fluctuations can happen \u2013 and when they do, they often leave marketers scrambling for answers. Understanding why these fluctuations occur, knowing how to respond, and effectively communicating with clients are essential skills for anyone managing these campaigns. This article will explore: Expected fluctuations are those that follow predictable patterns, often driven by external factors like time of year or consumer behavior trends While they can still be challenging to manage, they\u2019re usually easier to anticipate and explain. Seasonality is one of the most common drivers of performance fluctuations in Google Shopping campaigns. Consumers behave differently depending on the time of year, and these patterns often align with major holidays or specific shopping periods. For instance, campaigns tend to see increased traffic and conversions during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, as well as in the lead-up to Christmas. Conversely, industries like outdoor recreation may see a downturn in the winter months. If your campaigns cater to niche markets, other seasonal trends might also come into play \u2013 such as back-to-school shopping in August or summer sales for outdoor equipment. Leveraging historical data can help identify and pinpoint these trends. Proper preparation is key to managing these seasonal shifts. This can include: By staying proactive, you can turn expected fluctuations into opportunities for growth. Broader market trends also play a role in campaign performance. For example, rising interest in eco-friendly products or the emergence of new tech gadgets can influence consumer buying behavior. These trends are often gradual, making them easier to spot and account for in your campaigns. Monitoring industry reports and using tools like Google Trends can help you stay ahead of market shifts. Adjusting your product feeds to emphasize trending items or updating your bidding strategy can ensure your campaigns remain competitive. Competitor behavior can lead to sudden Google Shopping performance changes. For example, a new competitor entering the market may bid aggressively on your top-performing products, driving up cost-per-click (CPC). Alternatively, an established competitor might launch a promotional campaign, temporarily capturing a larger share of clicks. To address competitor-driven fluctuations, conduct a competitive analysis using tools like Auction Insights. If you notice increased competition, consider differentiating your offerings by highlighting unique selling points or adjusting bids to focus on less competitive segments. While expected fluctuations can often be forecasted, unexpected changes in performance are trickier to diagnose. These shifts might not have an obvious external cause, leaving PPC managers to dig into the depths of the Google Shopping campaigns to uncover underlying issues. Below are some common unexpected fluctuations and what to investigate. When impressions suddenly drop, it\u2019s a red flag that your ads are no longer reaching as many people as possible. Several factors could be at play: A sudden drop in conversions is unsettling, especially when impressions and clicks remain steady. Here\u2019s a quick look at where to investigate: It\u2019s important to note that your product data feed is the backbone of your Google Shopping campaigns, and even minor errors can lead to unexpected drops in performance. Regularly auditing your data feed is crucial to avoiding these issues. Ensuring your feed is accurate, up-to-date, and optimized can help prevent performance dips caused by feed-related problems. Sometimes the fluctuations in Google Shopping campaigns are more subtle, but still indicative of deeper issues: Now you\u2019re probably thinking \u2013 don\u2019t algorithm updates only affect SEO rankings? Think again. Google\u2019s algorithm changes can be one of the most common culprits of unexpected fluctuations. These updates can impact how products are displayed, how ads are served, and even which search queries trigger your Shopping ads. Unfortunately, Google doesn\u2019t always announce these changes right away, which means marketers often find out the hard way \u2013 through dips in performance. When faced with algorithm-related fluctuations, your best course of action is to monitor key metrics closely and investigate any significant changes. Look for shifts in impression share, CTR, or CPC that might signal an update. Do some search and discovery testing \u201cin the wild\u201d to trigger your products, and identify if the user experience has changed, and adapt your strategy based on the outcomes. Handling performance fluctuations isn\u2019t just about solving the problem; it\u2019s also about maintaining client confidence. Clients may not understand the nuances of Google Shopping campaigns, so it\u2019s your job to explain the situation in a way that builds trust and sets realistic expectations. Don\u2019t wait for clients to notice a performance dip before addressing it. As soon as you identify a fluctuation, reach out with an explanation of what\u2019s happening, why it\u2019s happening, and what steps you\u2019re taking to resolve it. For example, if a seasonal lull is causing lower conversion rates, provide historical data to show that this pattern is normal and temporary. Data is your best friend when communicating with clients. Use visualizations like graphs or charts to illustrate trends, compare performance to previous periods, and highlight your optimization efforts. This helps clients see the bigger picture and understand that fluctuations are part of a broader strategy. End every client conversation with clear next steps. Rather than focusing solely on the issue, highlight the steps you\u2019re taking to address the problem(s). For example: This reassures them that their campaigns are in capable hands. Set realistic timelines for recovery and provide regular updates. Avoid overpromising quick fixes. Instead, frame your efforts as part of a comprehensive strategy. Performance fluctuations in Google Shopping campaigns are inevitable, but they don\u2019t have to derail your strategy. By understanding the difference between expected and unexpected fluctuations, preparing for seasonal changes, staying vigilant about potential issues, and communicating effectively with clients, you can navigate these challenges with confidence. Remember, fluctuations are not failures \u2013 they\u2019re opportunities to refine your approach and drive even better results for your campaigns.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"Shares of oil and gas giant Antero Resources (AR) are attempting a bounce off four consecutive daily losses and last week\u2019s 4.2% drop, last seen up 0.6% to trade at $37.59. The recent pullback comes after the company enjoyed a nearly 2% post-earnings pop after sharing an impressive fourth-quarter beat after the close on Feb. 12. Over the past 12 months, AR has charged 47% higher. What\u2019s more, today\u2019s attempt to push higher may have additional support, if past is any precedent. Daily AR with 50-day moving average Specifically, Antero Resources stock has come within one standard deviation of the 50-day moving average, a trendline that has historically sparked bullish returns. According to Schaeffer\u2019s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, AR has come within striking distance of this moving average after spending a prolonged period above it\u2014defined as 80% of the past two months and eight of the last 10 trading days\u2014five times in the past three years. On average, AR gained 10.7% one month later and finished higher 60% of the time. A shift of this magnitude from the oil name\u2019s current perch would put the shares at $41.61 -- a more than two-year high. It\u2019s also worth noting that Antero Resources stock has consistently rewarded premium buyers in the past. The security's Schaeffer\u2019s Volatility Scorecard (SVS) score of 85 suggests it tends to deliver larger-than-expected moves relative to the options market\u2019s low volatility expectations.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"MLB Trade Rumors By Darragh McDonald | February 25, 2025 at 7:46pm CDT  For teams looking for help behind the plate, free agency hasn\u2019t been much help lately. As shown in MLBTR\u2019s Contract Tracker, last winter\u2019s biggest deal went to Mitch Garver. The Mariners gave him $24MM with the plan of making him a primary designated hitter. Apart from him, Victor Caratini topped the class with $12MM. This offseason, Kyle Higashioka led the pack with $13.5MM. Next winter\u2019s class could be better, but probably not significantly so. J.T. Realmuto has been one of the better backstops in the game in the past decade but will be 35 years old by the start of the 2026 season. He also might just re-sign with the Phillies. Danny Jansen could have a bounceback on his one-year deal with the Rays this season, but he will still have a checkered injury history and a dismal 2024 campaign tamping down interest. Jose Trevino will draw interest from his excellent defense but he doesn\u2019t hit much. The 2026-27 class has some potentially attractive options in Alejandro Kirk, Ryan Jeffers, Tyler Stephenson and Jonah Heim, but they\u2019ve all had inconsistent careers, so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how they\u2019ll look two seasons from now. The trade market seems to be far more interesting as the current prospect pipeline is loaded with catchers. Baseball America\u2019s Top 100 list features 11 backstops. The FanGraphs list has 16, MLB Pipeline 14, ESPN 12 and Keith Law of The Athletic 15. Not all prospects work out and some of these catchers will end up getting moved to a corner position. But with many of these clubs already having a controllable backstop in the big leagues, future logjams are distinctly possible. Teams these days are generally fine having two catchers in a timeshare, but guys can still get squeezed onto the trade block. Gabriel Moreno didn\u2019t have a path to playing time in Toronto a few years ago and got flipped to the Diamondbacks. Atlanta made Sean Murphy their primary catcher and sent William Contreras to Milwaukee. The Red Sox recently included Kyle Teel in the Garrett Crochet trade, presumably because they feel good about Connor Wong holding down the position for the next four years. The Yankees have Austin Wells, which allowed them to send Agust\u00edn Ram\u00edrez to the Marlins in the Jazz Chisholm Jr. trade. Let\u2019s take a look at some other clubs who could theoretically make a catcher available in the coming years, depending on how things develop. This list is subjective, so feel free to cook me in the comments if I missed one that you like. Teams sorted alphabetically. Braves As mentioned, Atlanta felt good enough about Murphy that they were willing to let Contreras go. They also made a big bet on Murphy by signing him to a six-year, $73MM extension shortly after acquiring him. The first year of the deal was excellent but Murphy\u2019s results tailed off significantly in 2024, which has been a source of frustration for Atlanta fans as Contreras has thrived in Milwaukee. Murphy now has footsteps behind him, as Drake Baldwin is considered one of the top catching prospects in the league. He\u2019s already knocking on the door of the majors, having played in 72 Triple-A games last year. He walked in 15.6% of his plate appearances at that level while striking out just 16.2% of the time and hitting 12 home runs. His .298\/.407\/484 slash translated to a 135 wRC+. With four years and $60MM left on the Murphy deal, plus a $15MM club option for 2029, Atlanta could look to flip Murphy and open a path for Baldwin. Though Murphy will have to bounce back in order to make that a possibility. If they can\u2019t find good value on a Murphy deal, then perhaps Baldwin could follow Contreras and be the next catching prospect traded out of Atlanta. In either case, Chadwick Tromp currently projects as the backup to whoever the long-term #1 is. Brewers As mentioned, William Contreras has been thriving since being traded to Milwaukee. He has slashed .285\/.366\/.462 for a 128 wRC+ over the past two years. His previously-maligned defense has improved significantly. He is controlled via arbitration through 2027. The backup job will likely go to Eric Haase this year, with Jorge Alfaro in camp as a non-roster invitee. They also have Jeferson Quero, one of the top catching prospects in the league, knocking on the door. Though he\u2019s only 22 years old now, he likely would have made his major league debut last year as a 21-year-old if it weren\u2019t for a bite from the injury bug. In 2022, Quero appeared in 90 Double-A games as a 20-year-old. He started 2024 at Triple-A but suffered a subluxation in his right shoulder in the first game of the season. That led to surgery to address a torn labrum, wiping out the remainder of the campaign. If he can stay healthy in 2025, Quero should be lurking in Triple-A. After missing essentially an entire season, the Brewers will probably want to keep him there for a while to get back into game shape. However, he\u2019s already been on the 40-man for over a year now and is down to two option seasons. With Contreras under club control for three more seasons, things might get tight over time. Cardinals As part of their 2025 reset, the Cardinals are moving on from Willson Contreras as their catcher. Despite signing him to a big five-year deal, they never seemed to like his work behind the plate and even moved him off the position for a time in 2023. It seems they hoped to trade him this winter but he wasn\u2019t willing to waive his no-trade clause, so he\u2019ll move to first base instead, likely seeing time at designated hitter as well. That will allow Iv\u00e1n Herrera and Pedro Pag\u00e9s to get the playing time this year. Herrera has been a top ten prospect in the Cards\u2019 system for years. He\u2019s hit .263\/.389\/.437 in the minors over the past four years for a 121 wRC+. He finally got some decent big league playing time last year and responded with a .301\/.372\/.428 line and 127 wRC+. Pag\u00e9s doesn\u2019t have the same prospect pedigree but is a solid defender and fine secondary catcher. Herrera have five seasons of club control and Pag\u00e9s six. The Cards also have a borderline top 100 catching prospect in Jimmy Crooks. A fourth-round pick from 2022, he played 90 games at Double-A last year, meaning he should be slated for Triple-A work in 2025. Of the aforementioned top 100 lists, only FanGraphs had him on there, but that outlet described him as \u201ca glove-first catcher who does enough on offense to be the primary guy.\u201d Cubs Going into 2025, the Cubs are are slated to have Miguel Amaya and Carson Kelly as their catching duo. Amaya was once a notable prospect himself. Held back by some injuries, he is now out of options but seems to have solidified himself as a capable big leaguer. He\u2019ll turn 26 in March and still has five years of club control remaining. Kelly is a solid veteran who just signed a two-year deal with the Cubbies this offseason. Hanging around below them will be Mois\u00e9s Ballesteros. He has hit .279\/.366\/.452 for a 128 wRC+ in his minor league career thus far. That includes 68 games at the Triple-A level last year, when he was just 20 years old. His defense isn\u2019t as highly rate as his offense, however. He has played some first base on the farm and there are those who feel he is destined to end up there. But he\u2019s also only 21 and has reportedly improved his conditioning. The Cubs have a controllable first baseman in Michael Busch, as well as Seiya Suzuki likely to be the regular designated hitter, so things might get crowded one way or another. Diamondbacks As mentioned up top, Gabriel Moreno was squeezed out of playing time with the Jays and got sent to Arizona, where he\u2019s been the primary backstop for the past two years. He\u2019s under club control for another four years. Jos\u00e9 Herrera is likely to be the backup this year. The club also has Adrian Del Castillo firmly in the mix. He put up a huge line of .312\/.399\/.603 in Triple-A last year. Even in the hitter-friendly context of the Pacific Coast League, his 144 wRC+ points to him being well above average. He also got into 25 major league games and hit .313\/.368\/.525. His defense isn\u2019t regarded as highly as his bat, so a move to a first base\/designated hitter role down the line is possible, though he hasn\u2019t played any first base yet. The Snakes have more of a path to playing time there with Christian Walker and Joc Pederson departing in free agency. They acquired Josh Naylor to cover first but he will hit the open market after the upcoming season. Dodgers The Dodgers have had Will Smith as their primary catcher for a while and it doesn\u2019t seem like that will change anytime soon. About this time last year, he and the club agreed to an extension that will keep him in Los Angeles through 2033. Moving out from behind the plate won\u2019t be possible for a while with Shohei Ohtani locked into the designated hitter spot through 2033. First baseman Freddie Freeman is signed through 2027. The club also has Austin Barnes as the backup, though he\u2019s in the final year of his deal. Hunter Feduccia is on the 40-man and could perhaps take over for Barnes next year. Hovering around all this is Dalton Rushing, one of the top prospects in the game. He\u2019s hit .273\/.410\/.520 for a 153 wRC+ in his minor league career, which includes 37 Triple-A games. The Dodgers have given him some playing time at first base and left field to give him a better path to the big leagues. But that is arguably a waste of his skills behind the plate and he might be better utilized headlining a blockbuster trade. Guardians Going into 2025, Bo Naylor should be the regular behind the plate in Cleveland. His bat regressed in 2024 but he was still a useful contributor thanks to his defense. He\u2019s under club control for another five years. Glove-first veteran Austin Hedges will be back to serve as Naylor\u2019s partner. Waiting in the wings is Cooper Ingle. A fourth-round pick from 2023, he has slashed .303\/.426\/.466 for a 153 wRC+ in his minor league career thus far. That includes 25 Double-A games last year, so getting to Triple-A in 2025 is a distinct possibility. Ingle was only a part-time catcher at Clemson and is still considered an unfinished project defensively, but he showed enough development in 2024 that prospect evaluators think he\u2019s viable to stick back there. The Guards might be patient with him but he should be ready for the majors well before Naylor is approaching free agency. Mariners The Mariners have Cal Raleigh, one of the best catchers in the game today. He can be retained via arbitration through 2027. Mitch Garver and Blake Hunt are candidates to be in the backup spot. The club also has Harry Ford, one of the top catching prospects in the league. The 12th overall pick from 2021, he\u2019s hit .261\/.404\/.418 for a 129 wRC+ in his minor league career thus far. He spent all of last year at Double-A, getting into 116 games, and should be in Triple-A this year. He\u2019s also stolen at least 23 bases in each of the past three seasons. However, his stock is down a bit after a mixed 2024. There are some questions about whether he has the defensive chops to stick behind the plate. He got some time in left field last year and the early reviews weren\u2019t favorable. While his offense has been good overall, he had diminished power in 2024, leaving him as more of an on-base guy. That\u2019s a harder profile to pull off if he moves to an outfield corner or first base. Marlins In the short term, the catching situation behind the plate in Miami is rough. Nick Fortes currently projects as the starter despite a career batting line of .222\/.275\/.344. Liam Hicks, a Rule 5 pick who hasn\u2019t played higher than Double-A, could be the backup. But in the long term, things look much better. Both Agust\u00edn Ram\u00edrez and Joe Mack have shown up on top 100 prospect lists. Ram\u00edrez got into 68 Triple-A games last year and is already on the 40-man, meaning he may arrive first. He has hit .270\/.361\/.476 for a 127 wRC+ over the past four years, coming over to the Marlins in the aforementioned Chisholm trade. Mack was selected 31st overall in 2021 and hit .252\/.338\/.468 for a 137 wRC+ last year, mostly in Double-A. He\u2019s considered the stronger defender, so perhaps both can exist on the same roster down the road, with Ram\u00edrez spending some time at first base and\/or designated hitter. Orioles It was a bit of a slog for Adley Rutschman in 2024, as his numbers tailed off badly in the second half. But that won\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s the #1 catcher in Baltimore. The former first overall pick is strong at the plate and behind it, with three years of club control remaining. Gary S\u00e1nchez will be supporting him in 2025 after signing a one-year deal. The question is how Samuel Basallo fits into the picture. He is one of the top prospects in baseball, with each of the aforementioned top 100 lists having him in the top 20. FanGraphs has him fifth overall and Keith Law third. He\u2019s hit .286\/.364\/.477 for a 134 wRC+ in his minor league career. He just turned 20 years old in August. He spent most of last year at Double-A and also got into 21 Triple-A games. There are some concerns around Basallo\u2019s defense, which could push him to first base. He did play a bit of first last year, though that was partially due to a stress fracture in his right elbow. Despite being incomplete as a defender, many believe he still has lots of potential behind the plate due to his talent and youth. Padres Many in the industry view Ethan Salas as the catcher of the future in San Diego. He doesn\u2019t turn 19 until June but will likely be the club\u2019s regular at Double-A this year. His defense is already considered elite. His offensive numbers have been less impressive but that may be because the Friars have been incredibly aggressive in sending him to levels where he\u2019s far younger than his competition. Salas coming up and taking the job in the future would only be a problem if Luis Campusano gets back on track. Himself a former hyped-up catching prospect, Campusano seemed to finally break out in 2023 by hitting .319\/.356\/.491. That gave him plenty of run in 2024 but he responded with a dismal .227\/.281\/.361 performance. His defense was also poor, making him a sub-replacement level player for the year. The Padres went with Kyle Higashioka and Elias D\u00edaz by the end of the year, leaving Campusano off their playoff roster. Due to budgetary constraints in San Diego, Campusano should get a chance at redemption in 2025. He projects to share the catching duties with veteran D\u00edaz, who was brought back via a modest deal this offseason. Campusano has less than three years of service time, meaning he can be controlled through 2028 if he gets things going again this year. Pirates Going into 2023, the Pirates had both Henry Davis and Endy Rodr\u00edguez on Baseball America\u2019s Top 100 list. It seemed possible that two of them would be battling for the future catching job in Pittsburgh, but a lot has changed since then. Rodr\u00edguez made his major league debut in 2023, with good defense but subpar offense. UCL surgery then wiped out his entire 2024 season. Davis didn\u2019t seize the job while Rodr\u00edguez was out. He has a massive .290\/.409\/.535 line in the minors but has hit just .191\/.283\/.307 against major league pitching. His defense is also considered a tick behind that of Rodr\u00edguez. The Bucs acquired Joey Bart early last season after he had been designated for assignment by the Giants, which turned into a great pickup. Around a couple of IL stints, Bart hit .265\/.337\/.462 in 80 games for the Pirates last year. Bart is out of options and should have an Opening Day job locked in. Davis and Rodr\u00edguez can still be optioned but neither has much left to prove on the farm. They can also play other positions but Rodr\u00edguez seems likely to get a lot of value from his defense behind the plate. Davis hasn\u2019t yet hit enough in the big leagues to justify a corner outfield spot. Jason Delay is also on the 40-man roster, though he\u2019s also optionable. There are still many ways this could all play out but all of these guys are under club control for three more years or longer, so there could be a squeeze down the road. Royals The Royals have had Salvador Perez handling most of their catching duties for over a decade now. He\u2019s entering the final guaranteed year of his contract but there\u2019s a $13.5MM club option for 2026 with a $2MM buyout, making it a net $11.5MM decision. As Perez has started spending more time at first base or as the designated hitter, Freddy Fermin has taken a decent chunk of the playing time. He\u2019s under club control through 2029. The club also has a pair of notable catching prospects on the way, with both Carter Jensen and Blake Mitchell have appeared on some of the aforementioned top 100 lists. Jensen, 21, was a third-round pick in 2021. He\u2019s hit .235\/.361\/.401 for a 117 wRC+ in his minor league career. There have been questions about his defense but he\u2019s made positive strides there. He appeared in 41 Double-A games last year, so getting to Triple-A in 2025 should be doable with a major league debut not out of the question. Mitchell, 20, was the eighth overall pick in 2023. He has slashed .226\/.374\/.405 for a 131 wRC+ in the minors thus far. He only got to High-A for five games late in 2024. His 2025 is also going to be delayed by hamate surgery, so he\u2019s clearly behind Jensen when it comes to near-term MLB readiness. Perez is about to turn 35 but the Royals seem well positioned to pivot to the next era. Fermin has been a decent complement and can be kept around for another five seasons. With two top prospects on the way, perhaps the Royals might find themselves with a logjam, even without Perez. Tigers The Tigers have Jake Rogers as their primary catcher. He\u2019s considered to be above average on defense. His offense is a bit shakier as he strikes out a bunch and doesn\u2019t walk much, but he does have some power, with 31 homers over the past two seasons. He\u2019s under club control through 2026. There\u2019s a chance Dillon Dingler could push him for some big league playing time. A former notable prospect, Dingler hit just .167\/.195\/.310 in his first 87 plate appearances at the major league level. However, he\u2019s put up big numbers in the minors before, including a .308\/.379\/.559 line in Triple-A last year. He has less than a year of service time and still has two minor league options. Detroit also has two notable catching prospects, as both Thayron Liranzo and Josue Brice\u00f1o are on some of the aforementioned top 100 lists. Liranzo, 21, was acquired from the Dodgers in the Jack Flaherty deal. There are some questions about his work behind the plate but he has hit .254\/.381\/.475 for a 137 wRC+ in his minor league career. He spent all of last year at High-A and should be at Double-A in 2025. Brice\u00f1o, 20, has hit .283\/.367\/.439 for a 119 wRC+ in his minor league career. He didn\u2019t catch a ton in 2024 but that was seemingly due to a knee injury as opposed to any concerns about his abilities back there. He got healthy by the end of the year and then went to the Arizona Fall League, putting up a massive .433\/.509\/.867 slash and winning MVP honors. He hasn\u2019t yet reached the High-A level, so he\u2019s a step or two behind Liranzo. Rogers is only under club control for another two seasons, but by the time that clock runs out, it\u2019s possible that Dingler, Liranzo and Brice\u00f1o are all jockeying for position on the depth chart. If a few things go right, it\u2019s possible the Tigers will have more catchers than they need. White Sox The White Sox have been aggressively rebuilding for a while now, trading away just about every viable major leaguer on the roster for prospects. Those many trades have returned three notable catching prospects. At the 2023 deadline, they added Korey Lee via the Kendall Graveman trade and Edgar Quero in the Lucas Giolito\/Reynaldo L\u00f3pez deal. More recently, Kyle Teel was one of the highlight pieces in the Garrett Crochet trade. Lee, 26, has hit just .188\/.227\/.313 in his major league career thus far with rough defensive grades to boot. However, he was considered a top 100 guy not too long ago and could get back on track. The Sox should be able to give him lots of runway to try, since near-term competition won\u2019t be possible after their historically bad 2024. Even if Lee\u2019s prospect shine is gone, the others still have it. Quero, 22 in April, has slashed .280\/.397\/.452 for a 132 wRC+ in his minor league career. Teel, 23, has hit .301\/.404\/.444 for a 141 wRC+. Both players have reached Triple-A, with Quero having played 26 games there and Teel 28. Either or both could plausibly be in the majors this year. Teel is considered a stronger defender than Quero, so perhaps the latter will end up getting pushed out from behind the plate. Or perhaps the Sox will decide that using the trade block to bolster another part of the roster is the best path forward.

Realmuto, Stubbs, Marchan. Stubbs & Marchan are supposedly duking it out for the backup spot but Stubbs has health, talent, and song selection in his quiver. That\u2019s all from memory, PhillyDan.  Non Roster Invitee  2 days ago Giants?  HiredGun23  2 days ago Due to budgetary constraints in San Diego, Campusano should get a chance at \u201credemption in 2025.\u201d I wonder why this keeps being said? I don\u2019t even blame, Dirtyrug anymore. Maybe he\u2019s just following a directive\u2026  RunDMC  2 days ago Tromp won\u2019t make ATL great again with Sandy Leon hitting 2 bombs in less than a week. Hilarious Tromp\u2019s # is 45. Glad he\u2019s leaning into it.  YaySports  2 days ago I think he\u2019ll have to blow Tromp out of the water this Spring to steal that job. Minor league deal vs a guy that\u2019s out of options with team control.  Old York  2 days ago The Catching Market is Facing an Efficiency Paradox Due to Defensive Framing Trends MLB teams have optimized for pitch framing over the past decade, leading to a defensive premium on catchers who can steal strikes. However, with the arrival of an automated strike zone (whether partial or full) likely within the next 3-5 years, this skill will become obsolete. The market is currently overvaluing certain catchers based on a skill that will soon have no impact, while undervaluing bat-first or arm-strength-first prospects who may thrive in a new defensive landscape. The Hidden Trade Opportunity Teams that recognize this inefficiency could exploit it by trading away elite framers while they still hold premium value and targeting catchers with raw power, high exit velocities, and strong pop times\u2014attributes that will become more critical when framing is neutralized. Who Will Benefit? Organizations with a surplus of MLB-ready catchers (e.g., Braves with Drake Baldwin, Brewers with Jeferson Quero, Dodgers with Dalton Rushing) should be actively moving elite framers before their market collapses. Meanwhile, clubs like the Marlins or Red Sox, struggling with short-term catching depth, should buy low on bat-first catchers or those with defensive questions that may soon be irrelevant. This is a classic case of MLB teams failing to adjust to an upcoming paradigm shift. The smart front offices will get ahead of it now.  DroppedThirdStrike  2 days ago Maybe. But good catchers with more understanding of the strike zone will also be able to steal strikes with the challenge system, and get batters to challenge strike calls by making strikes look like balls. Anti-framing.  charles73  2 days ago Love this take. I never thought about catchers being able to bait hitters into making bad challenge requests by framing a stroke to look like a ball. Id love to see that happen.  Old York  2 days ago @DroppedThirdStrike That\u2019s an interesting angle\u2014what you\u2019re describing is essentially a form of reverse deception, where catchers manipulate the challenge system by making strikes appear to be balls, forcing hitters to waste challenges. The problem with relying on \u201canti-framing\u201d as a sustainable skill is that it assumes hitters will consistently challenge pitches they think are balls but are actually strikes. However, challenge data from MiLB testing shows that hitters tend to challenge when they\u2019re sure a pitch is a strike and were called out incorrectly\u2014meaning this strategy has a limited window for effectiveness. Unlike traditional framing, which impacts every pitch a catcher receives, this \u201canti-framing\u201d would only matter in rare edge cases where a hitter second-guesses themselves. If we analyze framing metrics over the last five years, there\u2019s already been a decline in their correlation with catcher WAR. Why? Pitchers are adapting to elevated strike zone awareness, umpires are relying more on tracking data, and as we\u2019ve seen in ABS trials, the long-term trajectory is trending toward zone standardization. That means teams paying a premium for framing today are investing in a depreciating asset. Once pitch framing is neutralized, what\u2019s left? Two primary skills: Pop time & arm strength (which become more important with rule changes that encourage stolen bases) Offensive production (because a catcher who hits 25 homers adds more value than one who saves 3 extra strikes per game) The smart front offices will pivot toward high-exit-velo, strong-armed catchers before the market fully adjusts. A team acquiring an elite framer today is like a business buying up fax machines in 1995\u2014it still works, but its value is about to collapse. Curious to hear your thoughts\u2014do you think MLB front offices are adjusting fast enough, or are they still overpaying for a skill that\u2019s on the verge of irrelevance?  DroppedThirdStrike  1 day ago I think that elite catchers find ways to separate themselves from the pack. Framing has always been an ancillary skill. The main value of a pitcher is, and forever will be, handling a staff and partnering with the pitcher on calling a game.  Teams will adjust and revalue certain skills. I think it\u2019s likely that even with a challenge system in place that certain catchers find ways to gain small advantages. And if hitters, catchers and umpires are using the data to be more accurate on ball and strikes, I can\u2019t see where I\u2019m upset about that.  Ketch  2 days ago Murphy to Boston for Trevor Story.  Money is about the same.  Both teams clear paths for top prospects.  Baldwin in Atlanta and either Mayer or Campbell in Boston.  Ezpkns34  2 days ago Is Boston including a time machine in this trade?  ayrbhoy  2 days ago Cue the \u201cSeattle\u2019s Harry Ford\u2019s numbers were down in 2024 because their AA Park in Arkansas is one of the hardest parks for hitters in all MiLB\u201d crowd!  It does surprise me though, how many articles mention the fact that a lot of SEA\u2019s Hitting Prospects regress in AA w\/o mentioning the Park factor  Joemo  2 days ago Wong isn\u2019t the long term answer in Boston. Guy grades as a bad defensive catcher and his best tool, his speed, isn\u2019t exactly a plus when looking at catchers.  They will need to be aggressive in the trade market as the FA options are not great and they traded Teel.  draker  2 days ago This is an extremely thorough and well-written article. Nice work!

Fenway 1  2 days ago Honestly he just kicks our a** so I want him  SaltLakeBrave  2 days ago To the author of this article, it\u2019s ok to use the name Braves when talking about Atlanta\u2019s team. That is the name of the baseball club. Atlanta BRAVES  highheat  2 days ago Appreciate the effort you put into this one Darragh! I can\u2019t speak for any other teams, but I can on the DBacks: Early in his DBacks tenure, Mike Hazen almost had a fetish for carrying 3 Cs on the Active Roster, so I highly doubt that he trades ADC and Gabby isn\u2019t going anywhere (but we all already know that). Things are a little complicated after he claimed Rene Pinto, because both Pinto and Jose Herrera are out of options; by my estimation, there\u2019s a high likelihood that one of those two gets traded before the regular season starts (with AZ likely preferring to keep Herrera for familiarity reasons). The only way I see both being held is if there is a C injury and the IL allows them to roll into the season without having to drop one of the two. I\u2019m sure any team that\u2019s interested wouldn\u2019t have to give up too much to acquire Pinto, but it would be a bit more difficult for the other three.  Lou Sassoll  2 days ago Kinda crazy how bad ATL got fleeced in that Contreras deal.  WadeBoggsWildRide  1 day ago I was thinking the same thing.  Ichirosasaki  2 days ago Man I\u2019m actually impressed by the number of (potentially) good young catchers in the minors.  Samuel  2 days ago SENSATIONAL ARTICLE! The Catchers\u2019 responsibilities are both the most important, most difficult, and physically taxing of any position to play on a major league team. A quality Catcher is a prerequisite to having a competitive team (and hitting the least important thing he does). Thanks for bringing me up to date on this.  Karensjer  2 days ago I\u2019m not familiar with Oakland\u2019s lineup or front office workings, but don\u2019t they have Soderstrom and Langliers as catchers?  If one doesn\u2019t do a position switch, can\u2019t they trade one of them for whatever?  I would love for Tampa Bay to take a flier one one of them, and at least if they get one of those .180 Batting Average hitters that they love, they\u2019ll get one with 20 HRs.  LGM!  2 days ago Won\u2019t need framing when robo umps take over  Deckard  2 days ago A 5-tool blue chip catching prospect is the dream of every organization\u2026..and Toronto traded their\u2019s away.  dougww  2 days ago You could add 2 or 3 more potential major league starters or backup catchers in the White Sox system. They are way overloaded with catchers. Hopefully they can trade one or two of them for outfield prospects. Then again you need 3 or 4 potential major leagues at every position in the minors.  Redbird314  2 days ago Wow.  If Jimmy Crooks, who hit .321 at AA with a .908 OPS is defensive-first catcher who just \u201cdoes enough offensively\u201d to start, I think he might be a guy to keep an eye on.  highheat  2 days ago FWIW, as early as this season, ZiPS thinks he\u2019s an MLB-average C by WAR with a 92 wRC+ (if he gets the requisite PAs). He\u2019s definitely one to keep an eye on.  C Yards Jeff  2 days ago Orioles get Rutschman in 2019. Then only 2 years later, they spend over 2  mil in signing bonus money on 2 catching prospects; Basallo and Willems.  Somethings gotta give here. Personally, of the three, I like Willems long term behind the plate. Why? Body type preference. Short height and wide body, plays low to ground. Rutchsman at 6\u20192\u2033 and Basallo at 6\u20194, to me, too tall to adequately field the position over the course of a season.  Lrtexasman  1 day ago Astros would be willing to trade Caratini. He hit .269 with 8 HR in around 269 at bats. Switch hitter. Please login to leave a reply.

{"date":"2025-02-26","content":"President Trump has calmly suggested that Apple should consider reevaluating its policies around diversity, equity, and inclusion, while making the case that meritocracy could yield better results and reduce workplace division. Wait, scratch that, President Trump has blasted Apple on social media in an all-caps message, demanding that \u201cAPPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM.\u201d Apple, the most valuable company in the world, which suggests it must be doing something right, advised shareholders against supporting a proposal on Tuesday that would have forced Apple to end its DEI efforts. The company credits its success in part with creating \u201ca culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d While the proposal to end diversity and inclusion efforts failed following a shareholder vote, the fate of Apple\u2019s DEI policy may come down to only one vote: that of President Trump\u2019s. Apple CEO Tim Cook gave a pragmatic response to the failed proposal during the shareholder meeting on Tuesday, per the BBC: \u201cAs the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\u201d Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\u00a0 He noted that Apple did not use \u201cquotas\u201d for hiring \u2013 a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism \u2013 while saying the firm\u2019s strength came from a culture where \u201cpeople with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\u201d he added, saying the company would remain \u201ccommitted to the values that have always made us who we are\u201d. However, Cook\u2019s view on creating a successful workplace with a 3.7-trillion-dollar market cap didn\u2019t please the president. Posting on Truth Social a day later, Trump spat out an all-caps response that likened diversity, equity, and inclusion to malicious deception: APPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM. DEI WAS A HOAX THAT HAS BEEN VERY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. DEI IS GONE!!! We\u2019re not yelling, you\u2019re yelling! From all-caps to red caps, Trump sure loves his caps. Anyway, President Trump, not one to let business leaders lead as they see fit, may dictate Apple\u2019s corporate policy more than CEO Tim Cook would like if the company is forced to comply with new laws or executive orders.
