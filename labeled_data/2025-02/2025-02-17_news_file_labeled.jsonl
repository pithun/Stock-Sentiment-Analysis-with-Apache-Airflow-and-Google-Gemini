{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  Warren Buffett and his deputies pared bets, exited wagers, and added only one new stock to their portfolio in the quarter ending December 31, signaling they once again struggled to find bargains in a buoyant market.          The famed investor's Berkshire Hathaway slashed its Bank of America stake to 680 million shares by December's close, down from more than 1 billion six months earlier, a regulatory filing revealed Friday.               As a result, Berkshire's ownership percentage dropped from over 13% to below 9%, and the value of what had long been its second-largest holding after Apple tumbled from about $41 billion to under $30 billion.               Buffett and his two investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, cut other banking stocks too. They sold 74% of their Citigroup stake, 18% of their Capital One holding, and 54% of their Nu Holdings position. In addition, they trimmed names such as Charter Communications, Louisiana-Pacific, and T-Mobile US.               The Berkshire trio exited Ulta Beauty despite only establishing the position in the second quarter of last year. They also dumped SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, two exchange-traded funds that track the benchmark US stock index, after buying into them a few years earlier.               On the other hand, Buffett and Co. established a $1.2 billion stake in Constellation Brands, the maker of Corona and Modelo beer, and other alcoholic drinks.               They also ramped up their Domino's Pizza wager by 86% and their Pool Corp. stake by 48% after opening both positions in the preceding quarter. Moreover, they topped up holdings such as Occidental Petroleum, Verisign, and SiriusXM.               Despite the slew of cuts, the total value of Berkshire's US stock portfolio inched up to $267 billion as several positions gained value. The company is set to provide more insights for investors later this month when it publishes its annual report along with Buffett's signature shareholder letter.               James Shanahan, a senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones, estimated in a note that \"stock sales exceeded stock purchases for the ninth consecutive quarter, by more than $6 billion.\"               In the first nine months of 2024, Berkshire sold $133 billion of stocks while buying less than $6 billion worth. It also spent less than $3 billion on share buybacks in the period, compared to nearly $70 billion over the previous four years.               The combination of stock sales and fewer repurchases helped to nearly double the size of Berkshire's cash pile from $168 billion to north of $300 billion for the first time.               Buffett is known for plowing billions of dollars into public companies such as Apple, and acquiring massive businesses such as Pilot Travel Centers.               He's repeatedly said that high company valuations have made it harder to find compelling deals, and he's grown more comfortable keeping large amounts of cash out of the stock market. Higher interest rates have also made holding Treasurys more lucrative for Berkshire.               Berkshire's Class B stock closed Friday at just under $480, up about 6% this year and almost 18% over the past 12 months.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  In the last month and a half, Glen Anderson, CEO and co-founder of Rainmaker Securities, has started to see prospective buyers express increased interest in shares of X, formerly known as Twitter.          \"I wouldn't call it a flood, but there's been a decent volume of X orders coming in,\" Anderson said. \"There's a sense that the downside of the story is played out, and Elon is going to work his magic. He seems to be very invested in making it a successful platform.\"               That marks a reversal from last year when he had little luck finding buyers.               \"There was nothing, literally zero, in all of 2024,\" Anderson remembers.               Now, buyers have been interested in purchasing shares at around the same price Musk paid in 2022, $54.20-per-share at a $44 billion valuation, according to Anderson. It's worth noting that expressing interest in buying shares in the secondary market is a lot different than actually committing real money to a transaction.               Fidelity, an investor in X, valued its shares of X at $31-a-share at the end of 2024, according to recent disclosures.               Unlike stock in public companies like Tesla, which anyone can instantly buy or sell, trading shares of private companies is much more complicated, requiring middlemen like Rainmaker to complete the deals. Sellers are usually employees or early investors looking to cash out, while buyers include family offices and hedge funds.                Anderson said there are current deals to purchase shares of X in progress. However, deals can take months to complete, and in the case of X, trading is highly restricted, according to Anderson. None of the deals have closed yet.               \"You're not going to sell without Elon's blessing,\" he said. \"And you're not going to buy without Elon's blessing.\" X approves all secondary transactions.               Buyers on Caplight, another secondary platform, are now valuing X at $42 billion, up from a low of $25 billion in 2023, according to Javier Avalos, Caplight's cofounder and CEO.  Buyers are expressing interest in buying shares of X at $46.50 per share, said Avalos.                 Musk's 2022 purchase was financed through a combination of equity and $13 billion in debt, which has also seen a rebound. Banks led by Morgan Stanley have been offloading billions in X debt at face value, a price higher than they initially anticipated. Investor interest in the debt peaked because of Musk's influence in President Donald Trump's administration, X's equity stake in Musk's AI startup xAI, and improved revenue from X, according to Bloomberg.                Another reason for newfound interest in X shares is investors have bid up the price of other Musk companies after the election and are trying to find other opportunities, according to Greg Martin, Rainmaker's managing director and co-founder.               \"People couldn't put money fast enough into Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink,\" said Martin. \"They've gone through the totem poll of investments, and X is the last one they need to figure out how to find value in.\"               Other secondary brokers and investors still have yet to see substantial interest in X shares, but they expect sentiment could change in the coming months.               \"We haven't seen much buyer or seller interest,\" said Ken Sawyer, managing director and co-founder of Saints Capital, a firm that focuses exclusively on buying secondary shares of private companies.                \"Ultimately, I expect demand will be muted until there is proven traction in the Grok integration, a rebounding in spend from advertisers, and proven monetization with X's creator business,\" said Shriram Bhashyam, chief operating officer of VC deal platform Sydecar. \"If X can deliver on some of these bets, these interests may turn into robust secondary market activity.\"               It is unclear whether X's financial picture is improving. In an internal email viewed by the Wall Street Journal last month,\u00a0Musk sounded pessimistic.           However, Business Insider's recent analysis of four independent data sources suggests that X's pool of advertisers is growing, but it's far from the revenue lost following Musk's 2022 takeover.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Zeeshan Ali has been a drag artist for 10 years and has taken his show all over India. Central to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs. \u201cIt\u2019s an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage,\" says Ali, who is based in Mumbai. But getting that look right wasn't easy in the early days. \"When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric,\" he says. But things are different now. \u201cThe trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. It's no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement.\u201d Indian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the world's biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85% of global demand.  Kolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish.  \u201cMy parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same,\" he says. Hair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair.  It requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value. \"It\u2019s just thrown away but it's gold,\" says Mr Venkatesh. Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and $1 (\u00a30.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair. Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices. For the individual picker, there's not much money in it. \u201cA diligent collector might gather 1\u20135 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to $6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas,\u201d says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him. \u201cWhile our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices.\u201d  Most of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs. \u201cChina has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars,\" says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government.  If India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do. \"When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up,\u201d Mr Cherian says. He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry. \"It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated hair treatment procedures for the hair collected, innovative production techniques for manufacturing of wigs which will make India stand out.\u201d Instead of exporting hair for hundreds of dollars, India should be selling wigs worth thousands of dollars says Mr Cherian. \u201cWe have started working on it but it\u2019s a long way to go. We need to have research and training centres,\" he says. One Indian business trying to make inroads is Delhi-based Diva Divine Hair, co-founded by Nidhi Tiwari in 2009. The idea was to create high-quality hair extensions and wigs that would appeal to a broader range of customers. \"There is a growing need for these solutions due to rising issues of hair loss and thinning among women in India,\" says Ms Tiwari. The company has been helped by a shift in attitude.  \"Once considered a niche or taboo topic, wigs and extensions are now openly discussed, thanks to evolving social norms and a shift toward acceptance,\" she says. Wigs have also seen a lot of development making them more attractive and comfortable. \"Technologies such as 3D-printed wigs and digital colour-matching tools offer highly personalised options. Lightweight, breathable wig caps and improved adhesives have given customers to wear it for long time without discomfort,\" says Ms Tiwari. At the top end of the hair market is Temple or Remy hair. Much of the supply comes from Hindu temples in the south of the country where hair is shaved off in an act of veneration and faith. Raj Hair International is one of the biggest traders in the Temple hair business.  Craftsmen at the company's Chennai factory sort and grade the hair according to colour, texture and length. \"Remy hair has aligned cuticles, hair flows uniformly in one direction, which leads to less tangling and a silkier texture. This is high-value hair,\" says George Cherion, the company's chief executive. The firm tries to waste as little of the hair as possible. To help with that it developed a machine to untangle the hair. It's allowed them to work faster with fewer staff.  \"Our mission is to constantly upgrade the technology,\" says Mr Cherion. Business is booming.  \"Indian human is in demand globally due to its high quality, natural look, and thinness. The demand is skyrocketing,\" he says.  Back in Mumbai Zeeshan Ali wants to see more Indian wigs on the market. As well as making them more affordable, he has a design suggestion: \"A wig that can create a wow factor.\" More young people are presenting to audiology teams in England with difficulty processing sound. Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.  Kindness influencers give away money and gifts but not everyone supports their work. Students explain their hopes for the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship. Many staff are using AI at work without the permission of their employers. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"investors who choose stocks selling at extravagant valuations \u2014 such as 100 times revenue \u2014are ... [+] fighting an uphill battle. There are no sure ways to win in the stock market. But here\u2019s a fairly sure way to lose: Invest in a stock that sells for 100 times revenue or more. The price\/sales ratio for General Motors is less than one, for McDonald\u2019s Corp. about 9, and for Microsoft about 12. Even Tesla, which has a loyal and rabid following, goes for less than 13 times sales. When I\u2019m looking for stocks to buy, I usually want to see a ratio of 2 or less. Stocks that sport a price\/sales multiple of 100 or more are hope stocks, dream stocks. And they are popular stocks, at least with speculators. That\u2019s why they sell for such an extravagant multiple. Let me suggest a few of these stocks to avoid. They are red hot, and might burn you. Strategy Inc. (MSTR) \u2013 known until this month as MicroStrategy Inc. -- fetches 139 times revenue. The company, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and run by Michael Saylor, sells business software but has posted a loss in four of the past five years. Its value comes from the trove of Bitcoin Saylor has accumulated -- and continues to accumulate. That hoard consists of 478,740 bitcoins, making Strategy the largest single holder in the world. The current market value of its coins is around $47 billion. But the market value of the stock is much greater than that, about $87 billion. So why do people buy Strategy stock instead of just buying the coins? There are several possible reasons \u2013 they may, for example, think Saylor is a shrewd cryptocurrency market timer \u2013 but I think it\u2019s folly. IonQ Inc. (IONQ), out of College Park, Maryland, sells access to the use of quantum computers and is also working on ways to improve such computers. Josh Schneider, a writer for IBM Blog, says that quantum computing uses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics and \u201cwill soon be able to solve complex problems that supercomputers can\u2019t solve, or can\u2019t solve fast enough.\u201d IonQ\u2019s revenue for the past four quarters was about $37 million. The stock market values the company at more than $8 billion, for a price\/sales ratio of 210. Based in Redwood City, California, Revolution Medicines Inc. (RVMD) is working on a new type of cancer therapy. It involves inhibiting uncontrolled cell growth by altering certain genes known as RAS genes. All 15 Wall Street analysts who follow the company recommend its stock, many of them strongly. I feel that the stock is highly speculative, since the price\/sales ratio is more than 8,000. I wish the company luck, but I\u2019ve seen many promising oncology stocks bite the dust in the past. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is a nascent business run by President Donald Trump. I think many people buying the stock are expressing their political preferences through an investment lens. Revenue in the past four quarter was less than $3 million. The company\u2019s market value is well over $6 billion. So, the price\/sales ratio is more than 1,600. I think Trump can grow the company dramatically \u2013 but I feel the stock is priced as if that had already happened. AST SpaceMobile Inc. (ASTS) went public in 2021 by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The stock was a dud until mid-2024, when the company signed an agreement to provide satellite service to AT&T\u2019s mobile phone network. In the past year, it\u2019s up more than 800%. Analysts predict a huge increase in revenue this year and next, but they don\u2019t project profitability until perhaps 2027. Their average one-year price target ($34.20) is less than 7% above the current price. The price\/sales ratio here for the moment is more than 1,800. I\u2019ve written 19 previous columns on stocks selling for 100 times revenue. In 15 cases, the stocks I warned about did worse than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Total Return Index over the next 12 months. In 13 cases they sustained losses. My warnings covered 84 stocks. Sixty of them declined, and 21 of them fell 50% or more within a year. The average one-year return for all 84 stocks was a loss of 22.2%, while the S&P gained 9.3% on average. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn\u2019t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn\u2019t predict the future. Disclosure: In a hedge fund I run, I have a short position in Strategy Inc., betting on a decline.  One Community.

We are not responsible for them in any way.  I'd like to see real samples of jobs AI allegedly replaced. Maybe spammers, but we don't consider those real jobs. Sounds like co's use AI as cover to lay off rather than admit their biz is just in a slump. I am currently tasked with developing content for AI to replace my position, I am hoping to get the opportunity to implement it I work at a relatively small, highly technical company that relies on a software that usually requires an entire department to support. I am one of three people who do everything from daily end user support to implementing projects for new features. Almost 80% of what I do could be handled by automation, but our end-users who are freakishly talented and paid to do the science-stuff the company relies on, would hate it since we really \"grease the wheels\" and make their lives easier. The very likely outcome is that we can get AI to behave human enough to handle most human interactions, allowing the team to implement new versions, etc which are needed. I feel that if I pass on this I will miss a transformation in IT and lose future career opportunities if I want to work past normal retirement age, which I plan on. Yep. At the beginning of the current AI hype, I thought that LLMs could at least do simple bureaucracy reliably and that would have cost a lot of jobs. But LLMs apparently cannot even do that. The only jobs lost seem to be from other causes and then lying about it. The only way interest rates are coming down in the near future is if there's a recession or if the fed chairman is replaced by someone really irresponsible, and the likely outcome of that is bad. Tariffs increase inflation. High interest rates fight that. Cutting taxes massively when the economy is booming invites a lot more inflation too. Perhaps companies will eventually end up hiring more people after the ai thing is reassessed. That's what everyone is saying isn't it? No labor-saving technology actually results in job loss in the long term - people just use that labor saving tech to create new jobs! I think people who say that are the kind of people who forget how complex history can be.

US Retail Sales Plunged Along With Temperatures in January After a Bustling Holiday Season [cnn.com] Cutting taxes in itself won't affect the economy much. The biggest bang out of tax cutting came with Kennedy, Reagan tried it but then he increased the deficit spending, and the U.S. was just figuring out how to get out of the oil embargo. So the economy got better. What will increase inflation is that the tax cuts are they are talking about are only possible by increased deficit spending. Picture how el Bunko ran his companies. He bankrupted 3 casinos. His alleged \"real estate\" company was convicted of fraud in New York, it seems the only thing he built was cooked books. Anyone remember el Bunko University? It too was convicted of fraud. His social media \"company\" just announced they lost $400 million in the last year. That's $400 million in other peoples' money he and his cronies have stolen. Sooner or later, it will declare bankruptcy, and he'll be in his happy place. The tat he's selling from the Oval Office now hasn't been built. He waits until they get enough orders and then radios his Chinese manufacturers to make something. And the small print in his ad copy says you cannot rely on when it will arrive or even if what you bought is what will be delivered. Now picture a U.S. run like one of is alleged companies. The only way interest rates are coming down in the near future is if .. the fed chairman is replaced by someone really irresponsible, Sounds like it'll be happening some time in the next few weeks, then. What do you do with your money when you think there's going to be 44% inflation, but the stock market is overvalued and gold (which has gone up 42% in one year) is also overvalued? I guess real estate and commodities? It's not AI, it's just the VC bubble that popped. The economy was being supercharged by massive amounts of venture capital being poured into new companies, most of which failed (as most new companies do, but when you add more money, it creates more new businesses, which creates more failure). Most of these companies were white-collar. Since more money was being dumped into businesses, they had to hire more workers. So they created a market for new (additional) white-collar employees. Now that the VC money has dried up (they finally decided to stop burning money), so has the extra businesses, and thus jobs. But those additional white collar workers are still hanging around looking for nonexistent jobs. I know multiple people who know absolutely nothing about tech, and were never interested in it, but figured \"well I can just get a job in tech, that pays well\" and are spending money on bootcamps right now, for shit like \"data engineers\". They're never going to get a job. But they'll continue to be unemployed and applying for these positions, because they hope the gravy train will come back. (it won't) Au contraire, LLMs are quite good at creating bullshit. It is basically the only thing they can do well. So somebody with \"skill\" and \"experience\" that actually can solve problems but is somewhat lacking in character and \"decency\" (whatever that means) is a \"bullshitter\" in your book? But what it's probably doing is replacing entry level knowledge workers.  And the new ones aren't going to learn the same knowledge that the older ones developed.  They'll learn different things.  I don't think you can make a blanket judgement of better or worse.  Is it better to write to a compiler language than it is to write to assembler?  But there are problems that can only be understood at the assembler level.

I don't disagree about tariffs but it's not like everything with the economy turned sour the moment trump was elected the second time. The economy has been unhealthy since since 2008 at least. a collapse has been long overdue and postponed repeatedly by all manner of tricks. You are engaging in denial and hand waving The global economies collapsed in 2008 [wikipedia.org], after years of the US economy supporting an unsustainable real estate market, and tanking the planet when the eventual market readjustment occurred Obama attempted to stimulate the economy, while Congress worked to limit the amount of spending and the Treasury kept interest rates low [brookings.edu], which kept the debt from ballooning as a result of Presidential and Congressional behaviors. Trump added to the debt, while reducing tax income with the help of republicans in Congress [americanprogress.org] and Biden paid for it by having to spend his terms battling inflation, which had been going down for 36 straight months [usinflatio...ulator.com] leading into Trump's second term Trump's statements before his send term and behaviors since have had direct and negative effects on the global economy, and I will be surprised if it is not harkening another recession The economy never recovered after 2008. Aside from whether Biden could have really done anything about inflation as president, the notion that it got better during his time is pretty laughable.  Trump can do plenty of damage but some the perceived accelerated decline from here will be due to the general realization of how unhealthy the economy already was. We get headlines about \"hot\" CPI over 4% or 5% when anyone who's been to a grocery store knows it's far worse. I never defended Trump, I am telling you it  Like I said, Denial >The economy never recovered after 2008. You are going to have to put some stats and definitions of \"recovered\" behind that before I BEGIN to believe you. Is under 3% employment good or bad? Is 16M+ Jobs good or bad? Is increasing infrastructure projects in the US good or bad? Is a gas price lower than 2019 good or bad? >I never defended Trump, I am telling you it was already bad. So? Really \"it was already bad\" How so? \"You are going to have to put some stats and definitions of \"recovered\" behind that before I BEGIN to believe you.\" The major holes blamed for the 2008 collapse, such as hedge funds (granted they are no longer as profitable as they were), derivatives, and subprime loans, were not patched. Dodd-Frank, which was already toothless, died under Trump with the democrats' help in 2018. The the SEC's corruption and lack of real oversight around insider trading also has not changed and is in fact as flagrant as ever  Wrong, Trump's policy are about addressing the wealth gap. While yes American's do pay the import taxes, the point is to trigger retaliation by other countries.  America produces a lot natural resources and farm products and far few finished goods than we once did.  What we need to do is to make food and energy cheap. That is how you help the bottom of the latter.  Guess what China is already threatening to retaliate on American food stuffs, USAID isn't buying to send it abroad. yes in the very short term big  Yup. They are crying in Instagram. Boo Hoo. They voted for this now they are FAFO. Yet they still think he's doing the right think in his other wars against OTHER people they don't like. They just don't want it to affect them. If only the government would just buy all their stuff and destroy it to drive the prices up or something. They are so selfish and undeserving. We'll see how many faces the leopards get this time. It's everyone's faces. The more farm consolidation, the more processing consolidation, and the more food-borne diseases are spread with fewer alternatives available.

They will realize they have so much grain they can't give that shit away to public.  Domestic staples get cheap.  No, the specific grains and pulse crops which are exported get cheap, most meat and fruits and vegetables stay the same, some fruits and vegetables get a lot more expensive, everything out of season is going to be really, really expensive.

Unforunately, that isn't the case. They can get everything they need from other sources. We represent 25% of their agriculture imports, not 25% of their total food available.

Working as an industrial control engineer, making well north of the $100K from the article, I have needed to turn away headhunters as recently as today, and she was not even the second this month. High-end process control work is comfortably white collar, is something in demand in more or less all localities and something that generally cannot be outsourced because of the need for on-site presence during startups and for troubleshooting. Demand is always growing, and even through I am in my middle 40s, only work with 2 or 3 guys younger than me, not enough new people getting into it. Tell your kids to leave web stuff to other people, study a combination of computer science and electrical engineering, nurture at least some interest in mechanical or chemical engineering, and away you go. The current situation seems to be symptomatic of a root cause that has worked far more mischief than simply wrecking the white collar job market. It started in 1913 when the 2nd biggest mistake produced by this continent (the 1st was slavery, but this country did what no other country in the history of mankind has been altruistic enough to do, we fought a war to end that evil) we passed the income tax as the 16th Amendment.   Given enough time, it has created the rust belt by making manufacturing too expensive within the USA so the factories with their jobs went first to Japan and then on to India and China. Fortunately, there's a cure for this.   It is to repeal the 16th Amendment, making manufacturing in the USA profitable again, and nuking all the insidious tentacles of that amendment - taxes on personal, corporate, capital gains, estate, self employment, payroll, gift, etc. to act as a millstone around the necks of the American people. Passing the FairTax would create a luxury tax on items for sale at retail and services, starting that the 1st dollar you spend above the poverty line for your living situation - single, married, married with X dependents - and completely untax the poor who would be free to spend any spare money they can identify on things like mechanics tools rather than sending $1,530 of a $10K earnings to Washington.   Plus, the FairTax would fully fund Social Security and Medicare forever.   And the FairTax specifies the repeal of the 16th amendment in 7 years, or else it sunsets.   So no sales tax AND income tax, it would be sales tax replacing income tax. The president has spoken of abolishing income taxes, so has identified it as an enemy of the people as many FairTax supporters have.  Write.  End the scourge, and bring prosperity back to the USA. 60's here, steady high-5 low-6 figure income Rolled everything into a telecom I worked for and lost it all, worked for company with a full pension that cut it short and riffed me when investments in real estate almost sunk the company.

I have seen people strive their whole career and then get downsized, with little recourse for another position and put a bullet through their head the same afternoon Your lack of empathy borders on psychopathy, get help This is why things like Social Security are important and necessary.  Yes we can yell about personal responsibility until we are blue in the face but people are famously irrational and situations as you describe are not uncommon at all.  In the 1920's this fact that people past working age had no money affected everything else, it's a big drag on the economy to have the retired age group poor or relying on their families, thus the SSA is borne. Forced savings by whatever form it takes is a necessary thing, people are just not gonna be responsible enough to do it on their own, it's a bit of a privilege to be able to financially plan decades into your future, to not have to choose between saving for retirement or paying your mortgage today.  The failure of the 401k system is testament to that as well.  [economicpo...search.org] Remove all high paying jobs, and social security and medicare will implode. Social security and medicare is a pay as you go system. People working now are paying into the system to support those in retirement. Everybody working low paying jobs because of the death of white collar jobs will reduce the amount of social security medicare axes being paid into the system. If social security and medicare do go away, you'll see one or more of the following occur: 1. The elderly will have no choice but to become dependent on their children (If they have any) and will move in with them.2. There will be more elderly dying on the streets.3. Euthanasia (via physician assisted suicide) of the elderly will become an option in some states. Yes this is important, I used the term \"forced savings\" colloquially but despite common thought nobody \"pays into\" Social Security, like the dollars that came out of my paycheck this week are not the same dollars I will get in another 20-ish years, those dollars will come from yours and my kids paychecks.  Your money is not guaranteed, it's an institution, we have to support it to keep it (also remove the contribution cap). or you know we could just cap benefits, such that they are also calculated based on 166,000 and whatever inflation adjustments we want to add. High earners in theory needed more SS income to cover the cost of up keep on larger homes, life in higher cost of living regions etc. However these same people are the ones who are best able to save and plan for their financial futures and they have more options than ever in terms of leaving their high costs areas when they retire, downsizing homes etc. There is no rea  Sorry, it should be implied that by removing the cap it goes hand in hand with capping benefits.  Fact is the SSA will need more money to maintain payouts amongst a declining population (and if we now don't want immigration in high enough numbers to maintain something has to give) so high income earners contrinute more but get their same contribution. It may not be \"fair\" but alas if you are over the cap chances are you are already in the highest bracket as you said you are in fact doing fine and marginal ut  or you know we could just cap benefits, such that they are also calculated based on 166,000 and whatever inflation adjustments we want to add.You really didn't know that benefits are already capped?

I've received the capped maximum since I started receiving the benefit.That's going to end soon, though, as soon as Musrump implements means testing for Social Security recipients. Just because you've paid into the system all your adult life doesn't mean you are entitled to the benefits you earned. That money is needed to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy, after all.

If you're old, but you've got a gun, that levels the playing field somewhat. That was an interesting paper you linked though I confess I only read the summary.  The upshot is \"the 401k system has failed to provide participants with sufficient retirement savings by the time they hit retirement age.\"  So, that's why it has been pronounced a failure: the people who used it, as instructed, have reached retirement age with too little money to retire. Well, that assumes that helping people to retire was ever the goal.  It certainly was the ostensible goal.  But remember that it was rolled in right at the same time that pensions were rolled out of the private sector.  Companies were downsizing like mad to deny current employees any further vestment in their pensions, and of course killing the policies.  The 401k was presented as an alternative. Why was the country's economic leadership united in this action?  Was it because they honestly believed that the pension system was letting people down, and this 401k system would make all their employees be better off?  If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you. The pension was an excellent deal for employees, which is exactly why employers axed it.  It involved too much money trickling down from the wealthy to the working class.  They wanted more of that money to trickle up.  So they replaced it with a system that forces you to purchase stock on an ongoing basis, thus sending your money right back up into the coffers of the wealthy who control most of the economy.  The flow here is a little bit indirect, since 401k programs don't necessarily include stock in the specific company that one works for.  But that wasn't necessary for the big picture.  The groups that pushed the plans on us are in a different position than we are when it comes to the stock market.  They are well diversified and can make trades and take actions that are unavailable to us (and that most of us don't even know about).  So their wealth increases overall when our participation in the market increases overall, regardless of specifics. So, the 401k plan worked beautifully.  It distracted us enough that we didn't unify in political action against the dissolution of the pension plan, and it left us converting a big chunk of our wealth into stock holdings which wound up benefiting them overall. The fact that it leaves many retirement-age people with too little money to retire is just a side benefit.  Keeping them in the workforce longer helps keep salaries down overall. So, from their perspective, it was a supreme success. Aside: despite the greed and evil on display here, stock investing (wisely) is still the best option for wealth accumulation for us.  It benefits the upper 1%, but it also benefits us (more than just regular old interest would).  This is still the best deal in town, even if it is a deal with the devil. It benefits only those who are well-connected. Given the attacks on the federal government by the current party in power, could trigger a constitutional crisis where blue fights blue -- The 1929 stock market crash and subsequent bank runs could repeat again. Those who are well-connected will have sold their investments and moved their money offshore or into precious metals. With the advent of memecoins, being able to move money and bypass FinCEN and SWIFT is becoming a lot easier.  People would have their wealth in a coin (with knowledge of when to jump from one coin to another because the rug pull will happen at a date\/time), while everything else winds up tanking. The only real hope we have is that quantum factoring of ECC becomes just a feasible possibility, which will completely implode cryptocurrency exchanges as we know it. No pensions were bankrupting the private sector as people started to live to darn long.  Then people either ended up a defunct pension or got shuffled on the federal guarantee corporation and also getting a tiny fraction of what they were owed. It did not work! but I will agree with you the 401k is the ultimate scam.  It was done to turn Wall streets greatest unfunded liabilities (pensions) into giant slush funds that investment bankers could do whatever they wanted with as long as it had a thin veneer of fid   It involved too much money trickling down from the wealthy to the working class. They wanted more of that money to trickle up. So they replaced it with a system that forces you to purchase stock on an ongoing basis, thus sending your money right back up into the coffers of the wealthy who control most of the economy  But the money was trickling up anyway- when the organization put money into a traditional pension fund, the money wasn't buried in a hole for 30 years, it was invested.  Maybe invested in lower-yield but safer places, but invested nonetheless.  So the wealthy coffers got their mitts on it either way.  Second thought is that traditional pensions had a serious design flaw.  If the organization's part of the deal was just \"pension pays X dollars after Y years\", then the company had too much flexibility in putting seed money into the account.  Eg:  - year 1: \"based on a 3% annual growth rate, we need to put in Z dollars this year into the fund this year to keep pace with the target\" - year 2: \"money's a little tight, but I think we'll get 3.1% annual growth rate so it's ok to put in less this year\" - year 3: \"money's still tight, but the new tax laws will support a 3.2% annual growth rate.  Let's put in less again\" ... - year 30: \"they're retiring now, we'll go bankrupt if we actually have to cover the X dollars we promised.  Federal government, you're our only hope!\" The world you reference looks nothing like the one we all live in. So you started saving back when a house cost $30k? Run all that through the inflation calculator and get back to me. You said you \"rolled everything into a telecom i worked for and lost it all\"  not trying to open old wounds, but that's called gambling.  Having a lack of empathy towards people who gamble their savings away, or insist on having the latest and greatest of everything, take expensive trips all the time, etc. rather than save doesn't make someone a psychopath.  \u00a0 \u00a0  ... put all their eggs into one basket.

The Republicans and the rich have been F*ing us for what, 60 years over CuLTurE and the Dems have mostly stood by and quietly cleaned up after them, going oh well... but not rocking the boat too much - except in the CuLTurE war. THERE the Dems are all about standing proud. Poor people though? Nah. That really isn't their thing either. And you Bootstrap it. Good for you. Well, I hope if you ever fall off a cliff you can get back up from  Grandpa, run all your rosy figures through the inflation calculator https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/data\/infla...

Literally the worst type of person in the world, blames the poor for being poor, blames those who got ripped off for getting ripped off. Bite me asshole. I had 2 different 401Ks drop to nearly nothing at different times. I diversified everything as suggested by financial advisers at the time, and I got to watch my $20K, plus my employers $20K  drop to a grand total of $6K in the dot com crash. One fund went to actual zero, all the money was just gone. 2008, same thing, more money. Then the company I worked for went out of business in the recession, and no one was hiring. After 18 years of work, $16,000 of total retirement savings, less than one third of my contribution, zero of my employers match funds, zero in interest, not my fault, I didn't control when I entered the work force, and had no say in the economic bubbles. I know a lot of people this happened to. The fact that you have no empathy for me or anyone else who didn't have your luck just shows what a remorseless, total prick you are. What a sad appeal for validation. What a lot of words to say \"Got mine, fuck you\". Reality is that you have to save for later, and most people don't.  It doesn't matter how much you make, as long as you make enough to eat and have some left over, you have to save for the future. If you don't, then either shit is so bad you can't see the point OR you're living beyond your means.  Plenty of people live beyond their means and then are shocked when they retire to poverty.  I'm not sorry for those people.  They played a lifetime round of FAFO.

In principle, yes.  But because of the current very top-heavy arrangement of the US economy, wages have a very big gap to catch up with consumer inflation and real estate inflation.

Really? So Bernie Sanders, and AOC, and Tlaib, and othes are rich? > So Bernie Sanders, and AOC, and Tlaib, and othes are rich? So you pick the outliers, and not the rule? Lol. Next you'll be telling me that fish don't swim in water because  McDonald fish filet exists and THEY are on land. Truth is in national and even state politics you will MOSTLY find the rich. In the 115th Congress the combined wealth of all members at that time amounted to at least $2.43 BILLION, marking a 20 percent increase compared to the preceding Congress. So they DON'T have any money? LOL. You are delusional. MOST of them are RICH. That averages out to $243 Million per senator. Sanders is rich compared to me, now. Still wanted him to be president though, because he got there by writing books, not by exploiting his office. In simple terms, a recession occurs when economic output declines from one period to the next. If your nation makes cuts its labor force, then eventually that decline in production will bubble up into economic reports. During a recession, some people have little choice but to take a standard of living cut. This of course isn't directly reflected in the business that once employed that person. But when cuts are occurring over a broad portion of the population, the can show as a cooling off in consumer spendin  And then you look at the comical-level ineptitude that the last few IT disasters (Crowdstrike, MS Exchange Online, etc.) had at their root and see that these cost \"savings\" are probably driving actual costs (for society) up and up.

It's just more convenient than needing to run to the bank to get the cash, then run across town to hand dad\/cousin\/etc. whatever it was you were passing back and forth that month for whatever reason. Can't you just do a normal electronic bank transfer, through your banking app? Many US banks and credit unions don't offer regular bank transfer options to third parties. You can only transfer to yourself. The typical options for others is wire transfers. Most institutions charge high fees for both domestic and international outgoing wires. The recipient must also share full banking details with the sender, which is not the case with payment apps, including Zelle.There is a new service called FedNow which my CU supports, but very few institutions do. It is free. As a Briton, this all sounds so wildly backwards.I wonder what resulted in the UK's system being so convenient and cheap...was there some government pressure, or what? Weird.In New Zealand, transfers between major banks happen almost instantly. Some smaller banks take a few hours to clear. All New Zealand banks can transfer money between themselves.All you need to an account number and optionally a name to verify against. It's also free for most people. Canada, Interac, which runs most of the ATM network, runs a similar thing. All you need is an email address, optionally a security question, and the transfers are pretty well instant, no fees either and covered by most or all banks and credit unions. I don't feel like reading Zelle's TOS again (I skimmed it years ago when someone was asking if they could send me money using it, rather than through PayPal), so I had ChatGPT do it for me - not much has changed.  In a nutshell, it's like one step above cryptocurrency when it comes to protection against fraud (specifically, fraudulently initiated transactions, such as if a hacker gained access to your account), but for any transactions where you've legitimately sent the money and the other party turns out to be a scammer, you're pretty much out of luck. Personally, I didn't find it worth the risk of linking yet another online payment service to my account for what is essentially a digital equivalent of cash.  It's probably useful to people who are sending money to distant family members (such as a kid away at college), but is just too risky for online transactions. If you're meeting up IRL you may as well just use cash, and if you're transacting with someone who is going to ship an item, you're better off using a payment service with some form of purchase projection. That makes it pretty much in line with any other use of a bank.  Withdraw cash?  They won't get involved.  Write a check?  Once its cashed it's gone.  Wire transfer?  If they haven't withdrawn the money yet you can get a hold put on it and get it reversed, but only if it hasn't been removed yet.   What more are you really expecting them to do? The nice thing is it doesn't require you to add another app to your phone or attach to your bank account.  It's isn't giving your info to a third party or inserting a  In a nutshell, it's like one step above cryptocurrency when it comes to protection against fraudThe fundamental problem in America is that you leave fraud protection up to the terms of service of a private entity rather than something legally enshrined in your banking laws. This is less of a zelle issue and more of a government issue.

This is less of a zelle issue and more of a government issue. All my Zelle transactions are processed within a few seconds. I've never experienced a days-long wait. Are you suggesting his\/her experience is atypical or what? Yes. I was surprised to find that Zelle has higher dollar volume than venmo: 151 million consumer and small business accounts are enrolled to use Zelle, an increase of 16 million from 135 million in 2023. Zelle transactions grew 25% from 2023 to a total of 3.6 billion, exceeding $1 trillion in annual payments volume for the first time. It's heavily pushed by the banks.  Honestly, for b2b transactions, Zelle is probably a reasonable idea.  But since it's run by the banks, Zelle cares about consumers as much as (most) banks care about consumers.  Which is \"well, I guess we need to work with these tiny pests since the govt comes down on us if we don't.\" I somehow suspect that with the new administration, even that small push will vanish.  Which surprises exactly nobody. Yes indeed, nearly 100 million people in the US use Zelle. It's becoming the default peer-to-peer payment app for people who *don't* use Apple. https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/statist... [oberlo.com] It's pretty popular in New York for paying street merchants, food carts, etc.  For the merchant, it's the convenience of a credit card but without the processing fees.  Some buyers might prefer fumbling around with their phone for a while over carrying & forking over cash.  And both sides get some reduction in risk and loss from robbery. I'd certainly be hesitant to use it for any sort of \"shipping\" transaction (no buyer protections) and for those concerned about privacy, both parties see each other's registered names and emails\/phone numbers.  From TFA:  Change likely prompted by CFPB lawsuit  While Chase didn't share what exactly prompted this decision, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sued Early Warning Services (Zelle's operator) and three of its owner banks (Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) in December for rushing the service into the market to compete with other payments platforms like Venmo and CashApp and failing to implement adequate consumer safeguards.  According to CFPB's lawsuit, this resulted in hundreds of thousands of Zelle and bank customers losing over $870 million since the payment service was launched.  The affected consumers were also denied assistance and told to contact the scammers to recover their money, while the banks failed to investigate their complaints and provide them with legally required reimbursement for errors and fraud. The Trump Administration, via Elon Musk and DOGE, is trying to get rid of, or otherwise shutdown, the CFBP.

Elon Musk's DOGE takes aim at agency that had plans of regulating X [npr.org]  Vought orders CFPB to stop investigations and suspend new rules from taking effect [pbs.org] CFPB is an \"agency\" which is funded through the Federal Reserve but wields Executive authority  Exactly. CFPB purports to be independent but also exercise executive authority of government,  And the US constitution does not allow this, so it is inherently unconstitutional to have an executive agency with access to any of the US government's executive authorities or powers. Per the constitution: the executive power is exclusively vested in the president.  Which means that executive powers can be exercised only under the president's direction and the president can remove any person or people from being delegated executive powers.    Any act of congress which purported to expand or constrain the power of any Office as provided by the constitution conflicts with the supreme law of the constitution meaning that it is superceded by the constitution and is invalid. For example, one of the first laws ever ruled unconstitutional was a section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was in the Marbury v. Madison case,   Because that law purported to expand the power of the Supreme court  to take original jurisdiction in a case where an order of mandamus was sought against the president.  The ruling was the applicant had the legal right and the order was the proper remedy, but the supreme court lack the authority to make the remedy. If congress remains at liberty to give this court appellate jurisdiction, where the constitution has declared their jurisdiction shall be original; and original jurisdiction where the constitution has declared it shall be appellate; the distribution of jurisdiction made in the constitution, is form without substance.   Affirmative words are often, in their operation, negative of other objects than those affirmed; and in this case, a negative or exclusive sense must be given to them or they have no operation at all.   It cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect; and therefore such construction is inadmissible, unless the words require it. 128 To enable this court then to issue a mandamus, it must be shown to be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or to be necessary to enable them to exercise appellate jurisdiction... 162 It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land, the constitution itself is first mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the constitution, have that rank. 163 Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument. 164 The rule must be discharged. For most Americans, getting laid off and having to take a lower-paying job is enough to end up having to come face-to-face with the business end of the debt collection industry.  The CFPB was created because after the last major recession, a lot of debt collectors weren't following debt collection laws.  They could get away with it because, prior to the CFPB, your only realistic recourse when a debt collector did something illegal was to sue them - a potentially expensive and time consuming process. If you'v  I sell machines for glasswork that I make in my home CNC shop. Some customers pay with zelle. They almost always report problems like confusing and kinda random dollar and time limits.My wife wasted hours trying to send her daughter money with zelle.It might be OK for buying lunch, but for anything over $1000, not very good I paid a contractor to install a whole-house generator, several thousand dollars, with Zelle. I use it all the time to pay my mowing crew. No issues. So you're suggesting that his\/her experience is atypical, or what? Correct, I'm suggesting that his\/her experience *may be* atypical.   If the banks are not charging a fee they banks can't give protections needed for commerce such has chargebacks  The banks ARE collecting a fee.    You have to deposit money with them to use Zelle, and every deposit increases the bank's reserves, and the bank is allowed to loan out 10x the money you deposited to them.   When you deposit $1000 they are lending out  $10,000.    At 10% or more APR in interest on $10k comes out to about $1000 a year in profit off your 1k deposit. The fee in this case is your money  When you deposit $1000 they are lending out $10,000Not this again. No that is absolutely not true. When you deposit $1000, they lend out roughly $950 or so.  When you deposit $1000 they are lending out $10,000 Not this again. No that is absolutely not true. When you deposit $1000, they lend out roughly $950 or so. If the banks are not charging a fee they banks can't give protections neededAhhh yes those poor banks who are all offering services without making money. \/sarcasmNo sorry you don't need to charge a fee on every single thing you do to offer guarantees on the thing in question. The protections are provided from the general pool known as \"revenue\" which banks make in many ways. Most other countries have zero issues mandating banks provide fraud protection, even if they don't charge a transaction fee for a debit transfer.

I can understand the sentiment.  But how about protecting the older people who usually have trouble telling fact from fiction as their brains age?  I suppose most of us will get there eventually.  Should the govt. provide us some protection from scammers or should it be a wild west? Realistically, as a bank you've gotta assume that if you offer a product for transferring money online, then at least some of your customers are going to use it for online purchases (even though it's not intended for that purpose).  It's like how various products have warnings not to use them in ways that you know people are going to do anyway, like sticking q-tips in ears. Those social media sellers were working from home, and their RTO was automatically amended to include them as well How is Chase going to identify if a Zelle transfer is social media related? I built a fence and split the cost 3-ways with the adjoining neighbors who paid me via Zelle. I've used Zelle to get payment for items I've sold in person to people I know.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  It's a parenting rite of passage when a child first becomes interested in making their own money. At our house, it started with a lemonade stand, as it often does. But then, I blinked, and my 12-year-old was somehow running a full-fledged handmade goods business.          This journey has been largely self-driven. She's built her own website, participates in local makers' markets, and reinvests her profits into expanding her business's offerings. My spouse and I support her interests with tools and encouragement when needed, but we've discovered that often, the best way to support her as a young entrepreneur is to step back, providing her the space to explore, make mistakes, and figure things out on her own.               I won't lie; her process can feel unpredictable, which is sometimes uncomfortable and hard to watch as a parent. For example, when she launched her website, all shipping costs were the same. Then she received an order (from a very kind friend of mine) in Canada. As anyone who has shipped something out of the country knows, it's an entirely different process \u2014 and a much higher cost. My instinct was to step in and smooth things over at the post office. Perhaps cover the extra cost. But I held back.               By staying quiet, I gave her the space to problem-solve. She covered the extra costs with another source of money, filled out the customs forms with help from the postal worker, and immediately adjusted shipping prices on her website to prevent future problems. This experience helped her further consider costs and work to ensure her business remains sustainable \u2014 while also building her resilience and ingenuity.               The lesson for me was the reminder that entrepreneurship isn't about perfection; it's about learning and adapting. And that the financial lessons she's learning now \u2014 how to budget, plan, and adjust \u2014 will serve her well into adulthood.               Thankfully, my spouse and I aren't the only resources our daughter has. Early on, we found classes geared toward kids who want to start or run a business on Outschool. From 1:1 business coaching to group camps, our daughter has learned about marketing, competitive analysis, and more.               She also participates in Youth Biz, a local program that runs seasonal markets and business camps. Through their workshops, she's created a business plan, built a mobile app, and learned the basics of small business finances, including how to pay sales tax to the state.               She has also experienced the power of networking with other young entrepreneurs and local market vendors. She walks around at every makers' market she participates in, observing pricing, product displays, and customer interactions. She takes mental notes on what works and what doesn't, constantly refining her approach. All of this is a continuous learning experience that helps her improve her business acumen.               While a lemonade stand seems like a small thing, it can be the start of something bigger. I quickly realized that helping my child learn about running a business is teaching her lifelong skills in financial literacy in a tangible and meaningful way. While, initially, she was excited to spend her earned money on typical kid things like candy or Target runs, she started looking at money differently after a couple of months and after an experience selling at a holiday market where she made around $200.               These days, she's more thoughtful; instead of spending it all right away, she puts about half of the money she earns either into savings or back into her business by buying materials to create new items or investing in things like a card reader. Over the past year, she's grown so much, both as a business owner and as a confident, resourceful young person. When she comes up against a challenge, she's more likely to consider various angles and try to solve it these days. Best of all, she approaches it with curiosity and by asking for help from the many resources she's gained.       Parenting a young entrepreneur has been just as much a learning experience for me as for her. I've had to fight the urge to step in, fix things, and make her path easier. But I've learned that true support isn't about removing obstacles \u2014 it's about giving her the confidence to navigate them herself.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Apple is set to \"significantly change\" the iPhone's design language later this year, according to a Weibo leaker. In a new post, the user known \"Digital Chat Station\" said that the \u200ciPhone\u200c's design is \"starting to change significantly\" this year. The \"iPhone 17 Air\" reportedly features a \"horizontal, bar-shaped\" design on the rear, likely referring to an elongated camera bump. On the other hand, the Pro models purportedly adopt a \"large horizontal matrix design.\" Last week, leaker Jon Prosser a shared render of the iPhone 17 Pro. The \u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c's three rear cameras will apparently be arranged in a familiar triangular layout, but housed in an all-new rectangular bar that extends all the way across the back of the device. The ultra-thin \"\u200ciPhone 17 Air\u200c\" is also rumored to feature a horizontal rear camera bar. The first major rumor about the iPhone 17 lineup's design changes came from The Information's Wayne Ma, who said in November last year that the rear of the \u200c\u200ciPhone 17 Pro\u200c\u200c models will feature a new part-aluminum, part-glass design. The top half of the back will be made of aluminum and feature a \"rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass,\" while the bottom half will continue to be made of glass to support wireless charging. This new aluminum camera bump will also be larger than that of previous models. The new Weibo post also referred to an impending \"large foldable model,\" which should increase competition in the market. The account has previously posted accurate information about the iPhone 12 mini's display, iPhone 15's upgraded sensor, and iPhone 16 Pro size increases. The \u200ciPhone 17\u200c lineup is expected to debut as usual in the fall. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

The Chevrolet Blazer EV.R NASCAR Prototype builds a high-tech electric racer atop the series' Next Gen chassis and suspension componentry.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Rivers, cofounder of Oasis Energy Drink. It has been edited for length and clarity.          Wesley Fowler and I have been friends since fourth grade. That's when we met, playing football outside Atlanta, where we grew up. We played all together all through middle school and high school. Our families were intertwined, and we were best friends. I was even a groomsman at Wes's wedding.               We have always had an interest in becoming entrepreneurs together. I've been a serial entrepreneur, with some ventures more successful than others. Wes has worked mostly in the corporate world, though he's dabbled in entrepreneurship too.               A while back, we ran a promotional company in Atlanta together. It worked well, but Wes moved away about three months in. Since then, we have been always talking about possible collaborations. Two years ago, we found one we thought would really work: Oasis, a natural energy drink.               Working with Wes isn't my first time starting a business with a friend. I had a company with a friend in the past, but it didn't go well. I managed to save the friendship \u2014 I just recently attended an NFL game with him \u2014 but the company just wasn't meant to be.               What makes things work well with Wes is that his strengths are my weaknesses, and vice versa. I came up with the idea for Oasis, but Wes is the market genius who brought my idea to life. I'm good with numbers and operations, while he has a creativity I envy. When we bring those strengths together, it feels like we have a super power.               One thing we have in common is that we like to do things with a sense of urgency. We never let problems pile up, and we're constantly working on the company together, even when that means late-night phone calls after our families are asleep.               Friendship is still the foundation of our relationship. We've been friends for 31 years now and business partners for two years. We relate to each other man to man first. Sometimes, that means understanding family obligations. My kids are older, but Wes has two small kids and is in a more intensive parenting stage. I make sure he has space for that.               Since we have such a long history, we're not caught up in ego. We respect and trust each other, but we're not trying to prove anything. Sometimes, I'll get on a call thinking I know exactly what direction we should take. Wes will have a different idea. I'm humble enough that I can hear him out and change my mind if what he says makes sense.               We also give each other a lot of autonomy. Wes makes marketing decisions without needing my OK, and I do the same on the operations side. That frees us up to spend our time together talking about bigger decisions.               Being an entrepreneur means constantly solving problems. We've had plenty over the past two years, but we've been able to work through them all because of our friendship. Wes and I both have high emotional intelligence and never lose our tempers. We can tell each other when we need more time to think over a decision, and we trust that we're in this together. After 31 years, we wouldn't know anything else.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Whether it is back on the NES or the best Switch games coming out today, Nintendo has always been home to the best platformers on the market. The Mario\u00a0games obviously set the standard for the genre, but now there are tons of other games that rival our favorite plumber. We live in a golden age of platformers where we\u2019re getting both the best 2D and 3D platformers ever created, and the Switch is home to nearly all of them. Of course, with such a popular genre, there are also a lot of platformers that feel more like pitfalls. No matter what style of jumping you enjoy, we made sure to only include the most solid platformers you can get on your Switch for this list. Don\u2019t forget to see what upcoming Switch games might also scratch your platforming itch. Note that we will only be including one game per franchise on this list to offer a greater variety of games. Video game genres ebb and flow in terms of popularity, but the first-person shooter (FPS) has remained one of the biggest for generations. While there are plenty of amazing FPS games on PS5 and Xbox Series X, with most even being cross-platform games, the PC is still the ideal platform for shooters. You're free to use a standard controller on PC, but mastering the mouse and keyboard controls allows you to play at a much higher level. Of course, not every FPS game is a multiplayer game, and developers have pushed the genre to its creative limits on PC. Steam alone is overflowing with options, with more upcoming video games releasing every day. If you need a new FPS in your life and want to weed out the duds, check out our selection of amazing FPS games on PC. \t\tValorant\t Nintendo Switch 2 \u2013 First-look trailer Nintendo has given us an official time for its Nintendo Switch 2 Direct: April 2 at 9 AM ET, 6 AM PT. A Direct had been promised when Nintendo first revealed the Nintendo Switch 2, but in its usual fashion, the company provided only the bare minimum details. And even though we now know the exact time of the stream, Nintendo hasn't given any more information on the console itself. Even when the system launched, the Nintendo Switch was clearly the weakest console of the generation. While the best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games were pushing graphics to the limit, Nintendo was more focused on delivering fun experiences you could play on your TV or in handheld mode. Despite its lack of raw power, which the Switch 2 addresses to some degree, it hasn't stopped the system from delivering amazing open-world games with vast landscapes to explore. Sure, they may not have the best graphics, but the simple fact that such massive experiences are playable on the Switch makes them technical marvels. These aren't watered-down experiences where it counts, which is the fun factor, so let's list off the best open-world games for the Switch you should be playing. \t\tThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\t Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"AI can make your sketches look better in Gallery, Notes, and virtually anywhere else.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  With the Samsung Galaxy S25, the company doubled down on AI. The trio of smartphones \u2014 the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 are equipped with a bunch of Google AI and Galaxy AI tools and features. One of them is called AI Drawing Assist, and it's a general term for all the ways Galaxy AI can turn quick doodles into generative AI masterpieces. AI Drawing Assist can be used throughout the One UI 7 that powers the Galaxy AI and is accessible in a few different ways. If you're curious about how to use AI Drawing Assist with Samsung apps and across One UI, this guide covers everything you need to know. AI Drawing Assist is available on the entire Galaxy S25 series, but also older Galaxy phones, including the S24 series, S23 series, S22 series, Z Fold 6, Z Flip 6, Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4, Tab S10 series, Tab S9 series, and Tab S8 series. It's not available on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, according to Samsung. \"Ultra\" phones that feature an S Pen will have access to more precise drawing or sketching, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra can't use Air Commands like older S Pen-equipped models. The official Samsung Notes and Gallery apps have built-in support for AI Drawing Assist. Alternatively, you can use AI Drawing Assist anywhere by calling up AI Smart Select or Drawing Assist from the Edge panel. The easiest way to use AI Drawing Assist is by opening the Edge panel, which can be done from anywhere in One UI. From there, you can use Smart Select to alter any image on your screen or use Drawing Assist to create one from scratch. Here's how to do it: 1. Swipe left on the Edge panel toward the upper-right part of the screen. 2. Tap either AI Select or Smart Select, depending on what is shown on your device. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android 3. With AI Select or Smart Select, tap on something on your screen to select it. 4. Tap Sketch to Image or Drawing Assist to open the editor. Draw something or use text to describe what you want to change. 5. From there, tap one of the six Drawing Assist styles and press Generate.  6. When you're happy with your image, use the toolbar to copy the creation to your clipboard, share it, or download it. After that, you've made your first Drawing Assist creation. If you don't need to remix an existing image and want to start your own from scratch, you can skip the Smart Select process by pressing Drawing Assist directly from the Edge panel. AI Drawing Assist is built into certain Samsung apps, with no need to use the Edge panel. The stock Samsung Gallery app \u2014 not Google Photos \u2014 is one of them. Here's how to use Drawing Assist and Sketch to Image in the Gallery app: 1. Open the Gallery app and tap a photo you want to edit. 2. Tap the Photo Assist icon (it looks like three stars). 3. Press the Sketch to Image button. 4. Use the drawing tool to sketch what you want to add to the photo. You can use the eraser tool and undo\/redo buttons to refine the sketch. 5. Tap Generate when you're finished sketching.  6. Press Save copy when finished. Now, the photo you edited with AI Drawing Assist will be saved to your Gallery. A similar mechanism for using AI Drawing Assist is available in Samsung Notes. After sketching something in Notes, you can refine it with Sketch to Image and Drawing Assist. Here's how it works: 1. Create a new note in Samsung Notes. 2. Tap the Note Assist icon (it looks like three stars). 3. Press Sketch to Image and select the drawing you want to edit. 4. Pick a Drawing Assist style and tap Generate.  5. After getting your image, you can tap Generate one more to get another option. 6. When you've found one you're happy with, tap Copy to add it to your clipboard or Replace to swap the AI Drawing Assist image with your original sketch.  If AI Drawing Assist on the Samsung Galaxy S25 sounds a little familiar, it should. We've seen many of these features on past Galaxy phones and tablets, like Sketch to Image, but they haven't been tightly integrated like they are on the Galaxy S25. Specifically, this is the first time AI Drawing Assist can handle multiple inputs \u2014 like a photo and a sketch, or a photo and a text-to-image prompt. This makes AI Drawing Assist on the Galaxy S25 more versatile than ever, and it's a fun way to one-up your notes are images. During my testing of the base Galaxy S25, I got more than a few great images using Samsung's generative AI.   The latest Galaxy flagship The Samsung Galaxy S25 is a flagship phone built from the ground up with AI. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, which can handle on-device AI processing. There are also tons of unique Google AI and Galaxy AI features, such as Samsung's AI Drawing Assist.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Veja, the French footwear company famed for its eco-sensitive footwear, is dipping a toe into trends. Not that Veja, with its prior Marni and Rick Owens collaborations, is fashion-agnostic by any means. But Veja has mostly restricted its oeuvre to more classic sneaker shapes that only occasionally align with contemporary yens. Now, Veja is having its cake and eating it, too. The Veja Panenka, named for the \"light touch\" penalty kick perfected by Czech football player Anton\u00edn Panenka, is overtly inspired by all the classic terrace shoes, including one that currently dominates mainstream sneaker discourse. It's a low-profile shoe, wearing \"VEJA's softest leather yet\" on its upper, according to a release. Fresh as that may be, the Panenka's paneling and silhouette ought to be familiar to anyone familiar with today's big sneakers. So what Veja's Panenka stand apart? Honestly, not much. But, at the same time, that's the point. Already well-loved by folks seeking understated shoes with an eco-savvy bent, Veja already produces a few sneakers in a similar vein, including its Volley shoe, which turns 20 in 2025. That's because though Veja's appeal is at least partially derived from its reputation for conscious production, its uncomplicated design language is perhaps even more important to the Veja-buying demographic. As such, its entry into a sneaker scene currently owned by the many offshoots of Samba is less of a challenge to the status quo than an exploration of a similar parallel. By its very nature, the Veja Panenka shoe, available February 20 on Veja's website, sidesteps much of the sneaker-world hubbub. It's practically exempt, really, functioning more like a \"grown-up\" alternative to extant styles perceived as comparatively youthful (this is because those shoes are especially popular with kids: For proof, just check TikTok). With its \"adult\" terrace sneaker, Veja claims an interesting edge. Most of the other peers in this space are producing shoes either \"hyped\" or made terrifically exclusive by four-figure price tags. Veja's Panenka shoe is instead an object not directly tethered to any cultural context. What's left? An imminently wearable shoe.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"The RTX 5080 didn\u2019t blow us away in our testing, but there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s the second fast graphics card in the world, behind Nvidia\u2019s ludicrously-priced RTX 5090 halo card. Still, if you are sitting on a last-generation RTX 4080 Super, or found one at a good price second hand and are weighing up the pros and cons, it\u2019s useful to know how these cards compare. So, let\u2019s take a look at the RTX 5080 and RTX 4080 Super, to see how the measure up. Just want to buy a new card right now? Check out our guide to the best graphics cards for 2025. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any good news to share on either card, on either pricing or availability. The RTX 4080 Super initially launched at the start of 2024 with a price tag of $1,000, boosting the original 4080 with enhanced performance and a better price (down from $1,200). While it maintained that price for most of its lifecycle, the 4080 Super is no longer in production and we can\u2019t find it in stock anywhere. They are still some on second-hand sites, but they\u2019re listed for over $1,200. The RTX 5080 launched on January 30 2025, and quickly sold out. We\u2019ve had a number of stories in recent weeks about stock being almost non-existent, and while it should pick up in the coming months, expect it to be short for some time to come. Its initial retail price was $1,000, but Trump tarrifs and supply constraints mean it regularly goes for over $1,500 when available, and you\u2019ll have to spend over $2,000 if you\u2019re buying from scalpers on Ebay or similar. On paper, there isn\u2019t a lot of difference between these two cards. There are a scant few percent more CUDA cores in the newer RTX 5080, a couple of extra RT and Tensor cores, comparable clock speeds, memory counts, and memory bud-widths. The only standout difference here, is the faster memory, which gives the 5080 about 30% more overall bandwidth. The newer card is based on the more-advanced Blackwell architecture, but it uses the same process node, so there are no major advantages to find there. Arguably, the biggest generational change here is support for multi frame generation as a part of DLSS 4. Unlike a lot of RTX 50 card comparisons, we\u2019ve had a lot of hands-on time with both cards in this head to head. That gives us a firm foundation to state that though the RTX 5080 is the faster card, it\u2019s not by as much as we\u2019d like to see.  In 4K across a range of 13 different games, the 5080 is less than 20% faster. While that\u2019s nothing to sniff at, it makes it hard to justify that big upgrade price all by itself \u2014 even if you can sell your old 4080 Super at a good price right now.  We saw even less distance between these two cards at 1440p, and though it\u2019s fair to say that both cards are more designed with 4K gaming in mind, they are fantastic for high frame rate play at this resolution too. With around a 17% difference between them, the RTX 4080 Super really holds it own. Things are a little different when we talk ray tracing, as there, even small performance enhancements count. In the most demanding games, you\u2019ll still find added performance from the 5080 and it will get you more playable frame rates, even without DLSS doing some heavy lifting. When you do enable ray tracing, though, and particularly frame generation, it\u2019s worth noting just how big a difference that can make. You won\u2019t want to use it in every game and the 5090 still stands well ahead of anything else out there, but the 5080\u2019s ability to generate all those added frames does give FPS a big boost. It\u2019s a strange situation we find ourselves in at the start of 2025. Both the RTX 4080 Super and RTX 5080 are excellent graphics cards for high-end, 4K and ray traced gaming. But should you pay the exorbitant $2,000+ fees for the 5080, when that should really be netting you a 5090? But then you shouldn\u2019t really spend $1200+ on an RTX 4080 Super in 2025, should you? Unfortunately, while GPU stock is so low, you really are stuck with what you can find at a reasonable price, and that\u2019s incredibly limited. If you can wait, the landscape of new GPUs will be far clearer by mid-March, when we should have the 5070 Ti and AMD alternative, RX 9070 XT, to consider too. Nvidia's best graphics cards are notorious for being power-hungry beasts, but some freshly leaked prototypes show that the company had much bigger plans. Various engineering samples surfaced on the Chiphell forums, including a prototype of the RTX 4090 with not one, not two, but four 16-pin power connectors. Will such designs ever see the light of day? The leaker shared pictures of board prototypes going all the way back to the GTX 10 series, with the latest GPU being the RTX 4090. However, the leaker claims that the RTX 5090 was also prototyped with up to four power connectors, although such a card wasn't among the pictured boards. Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5090 is facing early concerns as reports of melting 16-pin power connectors have emerged, evoking memories of the infamous RTX 4090 connector failures. Two separate incidents have surfaced, both pointing to potential issues with the GPU\u2019s power delivery system, despite Nvidia\u2019s efforts to prevent such problems with its updated 12V-2\u00d76 connector standard. According to The Verge, the first reported incident involved an RTX 5090 user on Reddit who noticed a burning smell while playing Battlefield 5, leading them to inspect their system. Upon closer examination, they discovered that their power cable had melted on both ends\u2014where it connected to the graphics card and where it plugged into the power supply unit (PSU). Over a month after the initial announcement at CES 2025 (if you can even call it an announcement), we still don't know much about the future of AMD's RDNA 4 lineup. We know the cards are set to launch sometime in March, but their specs remain a mystery. However, there's an even bigger secret that's still yet to be revealed: The pricing. After a bumpy lead-up to the launch of the RX 9000 series, pricing is the one thing that AMD needs to get right. The latest leaks imply that AMD will price the cards \"very aggressively,\" which could be good news -- but it might still not be enough for it to rival some of the best graphics cards.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London. Our US team is observing Presidents' Day, so I'm bringing you a shorter version of the newsletter.          In case you missed it, Jamie Dimon's comments on work-from-home last week went viral. In a leaked recording, the JPMorgan CEO explained to staffers why remote work is a detriment to his company \u2014 using language that was at times colorful and confrontational.               However, copies of the audio obtained by BI suggest that remote work was just a sliver of the conversation. Dimon also addressed a wide range of issues, including the impact of AI, reducing corporate bureaucracy, and the bank's fintech failings.               In today's big story, many federal workers have expressed outrage and despair at President Donald Trump's workforce mandates \u2014 but what do the ones who voted for him think? BI spoke with four Trump-supporting federal workers to find out.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   \"It shouldn't have come to this.\"           That's what one federal worker who voted for Trump told BI amid the president's ongoing efforts to reduce the federal workforce. And no, they haven't changed their stance on supporting Trump.               As of last Thursday, about 75,000 federal employees had accepted the president's buyout offer. That's about 3.75% of the federal workforce, inching closer to the White House's goal of reducing the federal staff count by 5 - 10%.               It's a strange position to imagine yourself in: voting for a president who, weeks into his new administration, places your livelihood at risk.       But this is the exact scenario some federal workers are now facing.           Four of those workers spoke to BI's Ana Altchek and Ayelet Sheffey about how they're feeling.               \"I voted for Trump. I wanted to see some positive change,\" one federal employee of 17 years said. But they didn't know that change could put their job in jeopardy.       Some of the workers BI spoke with are still standing by the overall mission to reduce government waste.           \"They're uncovering a lot of waste and abuse there,\" one worker said. \"I just can't believe some of the stuff that they're finding which is a total waste of taxpayer money.\"               Elon Musk's DOGE has been targeting federal agencies it deems wasteful to lower government spending. In the weeks since Trump took office for the second time, DOGE has applied Silicon Valley's \"slash and burn\" mentality to multiple agencies, including USAID.               Following a lawsuit from federal employee labor unions, a federal judge partially blocked Musk and Trump's attempted shutdown of USAID \u2014 which legal experts had told BI is illegal without approval from Congress.               Meanwhile, one of the federal workers who voted for Trump said they supported the president's approach. \"I think overall, we're going to end up better off with him as president,\" the worker said.       Read everything the workers said here.  A former Silicon Valley engineer wrote on Substack about why he left behind 'staggering' stock grants to work for DOGE.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"SANTA CLARA, CA - JULY 15:  An Intel sign is displayed in front of the Intel company headquarters ... [+] July 15, 2008 in Santa Clara, California. Intel has reported a 25 percent increase in its second quarter earnings with net income of $1.6 billion or 28 cents per share compared to $1.28 billion, or 22 cents per share one year ago.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images) The stock of Intel has been in freefall for 5 years. The tech sector marks a major turning point today with stories of Intel possibly being sold off with TSMC and Broadcom showing interest in acquiring separate segments. Although some people find this development shocking, it fits an analysis I have conducted over the years that illustrates the vital necessity of strategic change. Intel\u2019s stock price is a sobering reminder that active maintenance of technology superiority is not permanent. The historical falls of titans like Kodak, Nokia, and BlackBerry, each of which misread the direction of their sector and failed to adapt, confirm this truth. Once leaders in their areas, these businesses were marginalized by more agile rivals better suited to the changing needs of the market. Intel\u2019s story adds to this one by showing how even the most established businesses must keep innovating to be relevant in the always-developing technological scene. Intel\u2019s stock slide in the semiconductor market is evidence of the effects of its slowness in reacting to important technological innovations made by AMD and NVIDIA. These businesses quickly included chiplet architectures and powerful artificial intelligence into their devices, but Intel's slow penetration of the mobile computing industry added to their fast-fading supremacy. This situation reflects the extreme reality of technological development: companies who ignore to innovate with speed and insight could quickly move from industry leadership to obsolescence. The choice to sell segments of its operations highlights more serious strategic flaws. Through its efforts to diversify into other businesses including quantum computing and foundry services, Intel has yet to make up for its delay in adjusting to major market developments. This repositioning is seen as a strategic realignment and a required reaction to systematic innovation shortages. Pat Gelsinger, CEO of US multinational corporation and technology company Intel, waves to ... [+] journalists after the signing of an agreement between the German government and Intel at the Chancellery in Berlin on June 19, 2023. (Photo by Odd ANDERSEN \/ AFP) (Photo by ODD ANDERSEN\/AFP via Getty Images) Intel\u2019s stock problems reflect a modern rereading of a recurring motif in the annals of technology. Think about Xerox, who created the first desktop-like interface and mouse but failed to commercialize these ideas, therefore allowing Apple and Microsoft to profit from them going forward. Similarly, Yahoo was formerly the major player in the internet market; but, when Google enhanced its search technologies and ad-revenue policies, it lost its leadership. These cases, like Intel's, emphasize the need of businesses embracing change, constantly innovating, and adjusting to emergent technologies. Clearly, staying ahead of the technology curve is the main lesson for companies as well as for investors to avoid obsolescence. This story reminds us strongly of the risks associated with depending too much on past achievements and the constant technological development. Intel tock Vs Nasdaq 5 Years  For investors in the technology industry, Intel\u2019s present place in the investing scene is quite instructive. The continuous volatility with Intel strikes a balance between possible risk and great possibility resulting from reorganization and innovation. This scenario emphasizes to investors the need to evaluate businesses not only depending on their current capacity but also on their agility and foresight to turn depending on demand of the market. The company\u2019s attempts to restructure its approach and reaffirm its market share highlight the difficulties experienced by well-known tech giants in a fast-changing environment. This continuous change not only tests Intel's endurance but also serves as a guide for investors on the possible long-term returns from depending on a company's capacity for reinventions. Intel's demise will give insightful analysis of the success of such changes in the tech industry as it negotiates these waters, reminding investors of the dual character of risk and reward in high-stakes tech investments. Moreover, Intel's failure encourages investors to think about the wider consequences of market adaptation and technical innovation. It emphasizes the need for constant innovation and adaptability in preserving sector leadership. Watching Intel's calculated moves offers a real-time case study on the effects of market changes and the strategic reactions that may either build or destroy a tech giant.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Healthcare stocks, new lows The health care sector is likely reacting to the uncertainty created by the effect of cuts to the federal budget now being implemented by one of three government branches: the executive aka the White House.

With the Senate voting to make the anti vaccine proponent Robert F.

Revealed ahead of its official debut at Kia\u2019s 2025 EV Day, both the sedan and hatchback variants capture the brand\u2019s \u201cOpposites United\u201d philosophy, merging performance with practicality and eco-conscious engineering to challenge competitors like Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Designer: Kia The EV4\u2019s launch marks a pivotal moment for Kia as it redefines what drivers can expect from a budget-friendly yet technologically advanced EV. By focusing on harmonizing striking aesthetics and sustainable innovation, Kia has created a vehicle that stands apart in a crowded market. The exterior design of the EV4 exemplifies a refined balance of contrast. The sedan version adopts a bold \u201clong-tail\u201d silhouette inspired by classic sports cars, featuring a low-slung nose, an elongated rear overhang, and a distinctive two-piece roof spoiler that minimizes aerodynamic drag. Its front fascia\u2014with vertical LED headlights, a blacked-out grille panel, and the signature \u201cStar Map\u201d lighting\u2014reinforces Kia\u2019s evolving \u201cTiger Face\u201d identity, while sharp character lines and 19-inch triangular-motif wheels exude motion even when the car is at rest.       In contrast, the hatchback variant offers a versatile profile without sacrificing style. Its steeply raked rear window, integrated rooftop spoiler, and vertical LED taillights create a modern, urban appeal enhanced by geometric patterns on the lower body panels. Black C-pillars produce a striking floating roof effect and shared wing-shaped bumpers on the GT-Line trim\u2014accented by aggressive front intakes and gloss-black details\u2014ensure that both models communicate a unified design language. This \u201cOpposites United\u201d approach, championed by designer Karim Habib, blends technical precision with organic curves to establish the EV4 as a new typology in the compact EV market.        Inside, the EV4 continues its innovative streak by merging futuristic technology with eco-friendly materials. The cabin centers on a panoramic 12.3-inch widescreen display that integrates the digital cluster and infotainment system, flanked by a 5.3-inch climate control touchpad. Kia\u2019s ccNC (connected car Navigation Cockpit) software enhances the driving experience with wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and even ChatGPT-powered voice commands, ensuring that drivers remain connected in an intuitive manner.  Sustainability is woven into the very fabric of interior design. Kia has partnered with Swiss firm Bcomp to integrate ampliTex\u2122\u2014a flax-based composite\u2014into key areas such as seat backs, console tables, and door panels. This advancement reduces component weight by 40% compared to conventional plastics while cutting CO\u2082 emissions by 85%. Additionally, the use of 3D-knit covers crafted from recycled PET yarn eliminates fabric waste, and natural dyes from madder roots and walnut shells lend the recycled cotton upholstery an earthy palette. Complementing these sustainable features, the introduction of \u201cMind Modes\u201d allows drivers to customize ambient lighting, ventilation, and interface graphics, offering a tailored experience that can shift from high-energy \u201cPerform\u201d to calming \u201cSerenity.\u201d The EV4 is built on Hyundai\u2019s 400V E-GMP platform, which supports both single-motor rear-wheel drive and dual-motor all-wheel drive configurations. Early estimates indicate that the base model produces 201 hp (150 kW) and accelerates from 0\u201360 mph in 6.9 seconds, while the dual-motor variant offers 282 hp (210 kW) with a 5.8-second sprint. The GT-Line trim may further enhance the driving dynamics with a performance-tuned suspension and a brake-by-wire system, ensuring that the EV4 delivers both efficiency and excitement.  Battery and charging capabilities further underscore the EV4\u2019s appeal. Buyers can choose between a 58.3 kWh battery\u2014offering roughly 250 miles (EPA) or 300 miles (WLTP)\u2014or an 81.4 kWh option that extends the range to approximately 310 miles (EPA) or 375 miles (WLTP). The 400V architecture supports a 150 kW DC fast charging system, which can charge the battery from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes, while an 11 kW AC charger is available for overnight charging. Priced between $35,000 and $45,000, the EV4 is positioned to undercut the Tesla Model 3, making it an attractive option for European buyers who favor the hatchback\u2019s versatility and U.S. drivers drawn to the sedan\u2019s sporty design. Kia\u2019s use of a modular production platform further drives cost efficiency, an essential factor in the competitive budget EV market. Kia\u2019s EV4 is a bold statement in design, sustainability, and performance. By integrating customizable \u201cMind Modes\u201d that enhance driver engagement, utilizing bio-sourced materials to reduce environmental impact, and delivering specifications that rival higher-priced competitors\u2014all at a 15% lower price point\u2014Kia sets a new benchmark for affordable EVs.  With its official launch set for February 24, the EV4 is poised to redefine expectations for sub-$40,000 electric vehicles on a global scale. This comprehensive approach not only challenges established players in the market but also paves the way for a future where advanced technology and sustainability go hand in hand.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"By Cristen Hemingway Jaynes. Originally published at EcoWatch. According to a new report by independent research group Climate Central, the climate crisis has driven weeks of hot temperatures in West Africa\u2019s \u201ccocoa belt,\u201d where roughly 70% of the cocoa in the world is produced, impacting harvests and likely causing record chocolate prices. Between July of 2022 and February of last year, cocoa prices jumped by 136 percent, partially due to climate extremes in the region, a press release from Climate Central said. \u201cClimate change, due primarily to burning oil, coal, and methane gas, is causing hotter temperatures to become more frequent in the four West African countries responsible for producing approximately 70% of the world\u2019s cacao \u2014 the key ingredient in chocolate,\u201d the report, Climate change is heating up West Africa\u2019s cocoa belt, said. \u201cWhile many factors, such as precipitation and insect-borne infections, can affect cacao trees, excessive heat can contribute to a reduction in the quantity and quality of the harvest \u2014 potentially increasing global chocolate prices and impacting local economies in West Africa.\u201d The bean pods of the cacao plant are used to produce cocoa, and they thrive under specific ranges of rainfall and temperature. Warm to hot temperatures as high as 90 degrees Fahrenheit are best for cacao growth, but any higher and the quantity and quality of the harvest can be affected. The analysis looked at how human-caused climate change has impacted the frequency of the cocoa belt\u2019s daily maximum temperatures over the past decade (2015 to 2024). The study focused on 44 of the major cacao-growing regions in the top four cocoa-producing countries: Ghana, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Cameroon and Nigeria. Other major producers of cocoa include Brazil, Chile, Peru, Indonesia and Ecuador, but they were not included in the analysis. Climate change had the largest impact on cacao-growing regions in Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 two countries which produce more than half the world\u2019s cocoa, supporting millions of workers and farmers\u2019 livelihoods. In both these countries, an average of roughly 40 days of daily maximum temperatures higher than 90 degrees Fahrenheit were added in the past 10 years due to climate change. Nigeria and Cameroon saw an average of 14 and 18 more days, respectively, of cacao-limiting heat each year due to global heating. Most \u2014 28 of 44 \u2014 of the areas analyzed in the study experienced a minimum of six extra weeks of heat that limited cacao growth annually. \u201cGrowing cocoa is a vital livelihood for many of the poorest people around the world and human-caused climate change is putting that under serious threat,\u201d said Osai Ojigho, policy and public campaigns director at Christian Aid, as The Guardian reported. Changing rainfall patterns can put additional strain on cacao growth, Climate Central said. Well-distributed and adequate rainfall is necessary for cacao plants, which do best in areas with yearly rainfall totals from 59 to 79 inches and with dry spells that last three months or less. Much of the annual variation in cocoa production can be attributed to rainfall fluctuations. Climate change is predicted to increase frequent and\/or large transitions between very wet and very dry conditions in many parts of the globe, including in West Africa, which could potentially affect cocoa production. Last year\u2019s worldwide cocoa price increase was caused by inconsistent rainfall patterns. Since late 2023, failed cacao harvests have contributed to a major jump in cocoa prices on the New York and London markets where cocoa is traded, reported The Guardian. On Wednesday, cocoa prices on the New York exchange had soared to over $10,000 a tonne after a mid-December peak of more than $12,500. For decades, New York prices have mostly been steady at $2,000 to $3,000 per tonne. Swiss chocolatier Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli said in January that it would raise prices once again to offset the rising cost of cocoa. Future threats to cocoa production also include smuggling, illegal mining and cacao swollen shoot virus, which impact the quality and quantity of cacao harvests, creating added challenges for farmers and driving up the price of chocolate.  Heat above 90 degrees Fahrenheit not only limits chocolate production, but is dangerous for the farmworkers who harvest cocoa. \u201cExtreme heat compounds other dangerous and physically-demanding working conditions, including exposure to chemicals, lifting heavy loads, and long hours. Many cocoa farmers make less than $1 equivalent per day and are older adults or children \u2014 both groups that are at higher risk of heat-related illness,\u201d the press release said. \u201cSince about 90% of cocoa is produced by small-scale operations, the changing climate is a significant factor that directly harms the lives and livelihoods of cocoa farmers.\u201d Adaptations \u2014 including breeding more heat- and drought-resistant plants, shading cacao plants with taller trees and shifting production to locations that are likely to have more suitable future conditions \u2014 can help farmworkers cope with changing climate conditions, but can\u2019t fully prevent the disruptions and challenges of cocoa production. According to Narcisa Pricope, a geosciences professor at Mississippi University, cacao is facing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d largely due to cacao-producing regions\u2019 increasingly dry conditions. Pricope said the biggest factor in the aridity was greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cCollective action against aridity isn\u2019t just about saving chocolate \u2013 it\u2019s about preserving the planet\u2019s capacity to sustain life,\u201d Pricope said, as The Guardian reported. Let them eat carob. It is all well and good to not care about high prices for luxury products but do not forget the farmers and producers who make a living in the chocolate industry, they\u2019re suffering more than the folks who can\u2019t get their chocolate fix. Carob is what I was forced to eat back in the 60s and 70s as a child.  I found it unpleasant then, and I don\u2019t think I would like it now.   Good baker\u2019s chocolate was always expensive, but I love good chocolate and have been willing to spend money that I don\u2019t have on it when baking.  Along with vanilla beans, coffee, and eggs, I might have to think about the luxury of using real ingredients in my food. I had carob a few times when young.   When viewed as a chocolate substitute, it tastes strange and disappointing.    But if its taste were analyzed and worked with in its own terms, it could perhaps be used for good things to eat, like mesquite beans which are also a dry-country tree-borne legume pod. I note the article mentions failed harvests but not changes in overall tonnage produced. Kevin Walmsley on YT channel \u201cInside China Business\u201d has a different take on the reason for the rise in cocoa prices.  China dealing directly with growers and taking substantial stocks out of the international market leaving shortages that push up the price. https:\/\/youtu.be\/2vXsdFntbzc?si=vzjEM339g3SsOKCk The US might hesitate to go to war for Taiwan, but for Chocolate\u2026 watch out.  And everybody better keep their hands off the coffee! I have a hunch that we probably are, albeit sonewhat quietly.  The leading producers of cocoa are in West Africa, the erstwhile French colonies thst remain under enormous French influence still, the same places where French presence has been questioned a lot lately and rumors are swirling about changing diplomatic orientation\u2013Cote d\u2019Ivoir, Ghsna, etc\u2026 https:\/\/africasacountry.com\/2023\/09\/nothing-good-comes-of-france September 22, 2023 Nothing good comes of France By Mbaye Bashir Lo France is not a new problem for Africa. Since the 19th century, it has stood in the way of the continent\u2019s self-determination. Nearly half of the African Union\u2019s 54 member states are former French colonies. In 20 countries south of the Sahara the French language and France\u2019s economic interests still dominate. An unsettling fact emerges when examining the economic landscape: none of the 10 largest African economies are French-speaking. Yet, six of the poorest 10 nations on the continent are predominantly Francophone. Eleven out of the 14 countries that use the currencies of the CFA franc, * which France backs, are listed among the least developed by the United Nations. * Coop\u00e9ration Financi\u00e8re en Afrique centrale Mbaye Bashir Lo is associate professor of the practice of Asian and Middle Eastern studies and international comparative studies at Duke University. Notice the remarkably low per capita GDP and investment levels.  Ghana has been used for resource extraction, rather than resource development.  China in Hainan shows what developing a self-sustaining cocoa-chocolate industry should be about: https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Publications\/WEO\/weo-database\/2024\/October\/weo-report?c=652,&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,NID_NGDP,NGSD_NGDP,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP,BCA_NGDPD,&sy=2017&ey=2024&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Ghana, 2017-2024 Real GDP, percent change Investment, percent of GDP Savings, percent of GDP Inflation rate, percent change General government gross debt, percent of GDP Current account balance, percent of GDP It certainly might be so. And inside china business  blog points out that China has been buying direct and is cutting out the normal supply chains and China is buying a lot of chocolate. Which is contributing to the rise in prices.  How much I don\u2019t know.  8 minute video. https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=2vXsdFntbzc I\u2019m not sure the sources in that YT, but all the standard sources I know of confirm what any chocolate lover who regularly visits China would guess \u2013 China is a very small scale consumer of chocolate, and nearly all local suppliers are foreign (Mars is actually the biggest player in the Chinese market).  Total Chinese imports are not much bigger than many small European countries and its mostly in the form of imported final products, not cocoa.    Buying cocoa direct is quite standard practice by big players in the industry, either because they want to secure supplies long term, or they want to maintain high quality levels. TIL that cacao agriculture and \u201cbean-to-bar\u201d artisanal chocolate-making are on their way to becoming a thing in Hawaii. https:\/\/westernipm.org\/index.cfm\/ipm-in-the-west\/agriculture\/building-a-sweet-niche-for-hawaiian-cacao\/ We do this !  We live on the Big Island of Hawai\u2019i, growing cacao and making chocolate from it.  Hawai\u2019i is the only place in the US where cacao will grow and produce beans, and there is a fast growing local movement of bean-to-bar, tree-to-bar, and tree-to-treat producers.  Some of the chocolate is really good !  If you\u2019re visiting Hawai\u2019i, check out the local cacao growers and chocolate makers \u2013 you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised. This is already a \u2018thing\u2019 in Far North Queensland, Australia where a nascent cacao and chocolate industry is making its presence felt. https:\/\/www.charleys.com.au\/ The official answer is weather and disease. Disease may (or may not be) weather-related, which may or may not be climate-driven. Looking at the Statista summary, I see that decreases of several years are not uncommon. It would be interesting to overlay with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation pattern. I predict a torrent of climate change news articles over the next year or so that are really ENSO-driven, whose cyclical signal is much larger than the longer climate change signal. We are currently in La Nina and sea surface temperatures are near record highs. Not sure what you mean by ENSO-driven but it\u2019s clear that something is broken and what we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t because of the ENSO \u2013 rather, the ENSO is a symptom of the disease. El Nino Southern Oscillation https:\/\/www.weather.gov\/iwx\/la_nina Winter: Warmer in the deep south, cooler everywhere else, dryer in the south (from Atlantic to Pacific) \u2013 more fires, wetter in the Pacific Northwest  However, if La Nina ends in a few months (likely), we may transition back to El Nino in summer, for hot and hotter. This post sent me on a bit of a search. I wondered whether the workers would be able to relocate with the farm. This would seem to be the prerequisite for \u201cshifting production to locations that are likely to have more suitable future conditions \u2014 can help farm workers cope with changing climate conditions\u201d. Since the cocoa bean is relatively picky in terms of moisture, temperatures and soil, this would supports any relocation being over short distances, which would seem less daunting for farmer and workers. Still, according to cacaonet.org 90% of cocoa farmers are smallholders, so would they have the means to manage even a \u201csmall\u201d relocation? Perhaps they would with government support, but otherwise the outcome might instead be that the cocoa farmer gives up. Xocolatl (Chocolate) was the drink of Aztec royalty, also a ceremonial drink. Average Mexica would have been lucky to have a few sips. I wonder if weather fluctuations affected harvest of cacao beans? Could have been trade routes, long way from where cacao beans are grown with human porters (no horses). I feel for those cacao workers in West Africa. \u201cCollective action against aridity isn\u2019t just about saving chocolate \u2013 it\u2019s about preserving the planet\u2019s capacity to sustain life,\u201d Pricope said I have suspected for a while the popularity among symbol manipulators of doomerist thinking on climate change is a minor contributing factor behind the loss of trust in experts.   In this corner, we have Narcisa Pricope, geology professor.  Knows how to make speeches, use a laptop,  and tastefully decorate her Zoom backdrop bookshelf.  Thinks cacao is kaput AND WE\u2019RE NEXT!!! And in this corner, we have Cleetus Awriightus, hillbilly.  Doesn\u2019t know jack about climate science, and may or may not think it\u2019s a globalist scam to sell low-flow toilets or whatever.  But he knows how to dig a ditch, dress a deer, drill a well, weld a stack of dimes, and so on.   One of these contenders has a skillset which is comparatively well-suited to survival in the Mad Max hellscape that climate change is unleashing.  The other one, emphatically, does not.   Well, why trust the expertise of anyone whose philosophy on life itself is so pathetically languid and defeatist?   Climate change is a frequent topic of conversation on James Meadway\u2019s Macrodose podcast.  I\u2019ve really appreciated how he avoids this same histrionic doomerism, and instead contextualises climate change as another front on the battle against enshittification, with things just steadily getting crappier as the world warms.  Chocolate, perfect example.  A future (near future!) where chocolate costs dozens or hundreds of dollars a pound, that\u2019s really going to suck.  And humans will still be around to contemplate how badly it sucks. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *       ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Amsterdam, Netherlands - March 28, 2023: Signage for an Hermes store in Amsterdam Against a backdrop where the personal luxury market declined 2% in 2024 and only about one-third of luxury brands achieved growth last year, Herm\u00e8s went into overdrive, rising 15% at constant exchange rates year-over-year to reach nearly $16 billion (\u20ac15.2 billion). After Herm\u00e8s growth slowed in second and third quarter, 13% and 11% respectively, fourth quarter revenues shot up 18% to $4.2 billion (\u20ac4 billion). Even luxury leader LVMH dropped 2% year-over-year, including a 2% shortfall in the second half of 2024, and number two Kering was off 12% in the fourth quarter, capping a dismal year down 12%. \u201cIn 2024, in a more uncertain economic and geopolitical context, the solid performance of the results attests to the strength of the Herm\u00e8s model and the agility of the house\u2019s teams, whom I thank warmly,\u201d said executive chairman Axel Dumas in a statement. To make that thank you more meaningful, the company will reward all 25,000 employees a roughly $4,700 year-end bonus (\u20ac4,500), topping the $4,100 (\u20ac4,000) bonuses handed out in 2022 and 2023. Acknowledging the company\u2019s commitment to being a responsible employer that \u201cshares the fruit of its growth with those who contribute every day to it,\u201d Dumas also assured investors and employees the company will stay the course preserving its \u201cfundamental values of quality, creativity and savoir-faire;\u201d in other words, the company\u2019s know how. While currency fluctuations had a negative $246 million (\u20ac 235 million) impact on revenues, consolidated net profit grew 7% to $4.8 billion (\u20ac4.6 billion). At closing on Friday, Herm\u00e8s stock in Paris was up over 4% and jumped nearly 25% this year. All geographies contributed to the quarterly and annual uptick. Even in Asia, pulled down by a luxury market decline between 18% and 20% in China, according to Bain, Herm\u00e8s scored a win with annual revenues up 10% overall, including 23% growth in Japan. Asia is Herm\u00e8s top market at $8.5 billion, accounting for over half of total revenues. In remarks, Dumas affirmed that all countries in Asia, including China, grew in 2024. He added predicting 2025 prospects for China is \u201ccomplicated,\u201d yet said, \u201cBig picture: there\u2019s some positive signs.\u201d Europe is the company\u2019s second largest market and grew 17% year-over-year to $3.8 billion. This comes against a luxury market that was basically flat there, according to Bain. France, up 14%, was a bit weaker than the rest of Europe which advanced 19% year-over-year. Number three market, the Americas, produced 16% growth to $3 billion and bounced 22% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were bolstered by the opening of a new store in Princeton, NJ and reopening of its relocated Atlanta store, bringing the number of U.S. stores to 41. While Herm\u00e8s has little penetration in the Middle East and other markets \u2013 less than 5% of annual revenues \u2013 it doubled sales there last year. Hermes will continue to \u201cintegrate sales\u201d in the region, Dumas said in the earning call, with emphasis on stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Leather goods and saddlery, its top performer generating just under one-fourth of revenues, led all categories in growth up 18% to $6.8 billion. Following that in size, was ready-to-wear and accessories at $4.6 billion and up 15%. Its other sectors category is number three at $2 billion, which includes jewelry and Herm\u00e8s home products. Combined, jewelry and home goods advanced 17% year-over-year. Silk and textiles were a relatively poor performer last year, up a modest 4% to $1 billion, but the category turned more positive in the fourth quarter posting 7% growth. Perfume and beauty ended the year at $560 million and grew 9% year-over-year and 17% in the fourth quarter. Herm\u00e8s remains heavily invested in perfume and makeup, including lipsticks and nail polish. In skincare, the largest category in beauty, it continues to \u201ctry to find the right way,\u201d i.e. the Herm\u00e8s way of doing it. Watches was the sole exception among Herm\u00e8s product categories, dropping 4% to $604 million.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"With the Mac transition to Apple Silicon, Apple replaced its 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac models with one singular 24-inch iMac. Many had assumed that there\u2019d eventually be a larger iMac, perhaps a 30 or 32-inch model, maybe even an iMac Pro. However, we\u2019re yet to see that come to fruition. Despite the fact that it\u2019s been three years since the 27-inch iMac was discontinued, and Apple has since said it\u2019s not making another 27-inch iMac, there\u2019s still some hope. Lets discuss. Back in November 2023, shortly after the launch of the new M3 iMac, Apple made an interesting statement to The Verge. The company normally doesn\u2019t comment on future product strategy, but they did here, and it was pretty clear about the fact that the company doesn\u2019t plan on releasing a 27-inch iMac in the future. During keynotes, the company has even made reference to the fact that the 24-inch iMac is a great middle ground for both 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac models. However, there\u2019s one key component to these statements: the simple fact that they\u2019re all in reference to a 27-inch iMac specifically. As wild as that may sound, Apple never dispelled the idea of a larger iMac as a whole. Just a 27-inch one. In this weeks edition of the Power On newsletter, Mark Gurman mentioned that Apple \u201cremains interested\u201d in the professional market, and that a larger-screen iMac might still arrive in the future: The company remains\u00a0interested in the professional market, though, and it\u2019s\u00a0planning new\u00a0Mac Pro and Mac Studio models.\u00a0Apple also will probably\u00a0eventually get around to offering a larger-screen iMac. Gurman also stated that Apple is \u2018exploring\u2019 a larger iMac model back in August: A larger iMac remains something Apple is exploring as well, but it\u2019s unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later. Additionally, towards the end of 2023, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that he believes a \u201chigher-end 32-inch mini LED display iMac\u201d will launch in 2025. Given the fact that we haven\u2019t heard many details since then, Apple has likely pushed it back further in the pipeline. Nonetheless, it isn\u2019t entirely off the table. Ultimately, we don\u2019t know for sure whether or not a larger iMac will launch. We can certainly say it isn\u2019t off the table, and based on Apple\u2019s comments, we can also say that it isn\u2019t going to feature a 27-inch display. If one does launch, it probably won\u2019t be until at least next year. What do you think about the possibility of an iMac Pro return? Let us know in the comments.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"I have spent a large part of the past twelve years advising nearly three dozen international governments as to how to best approach creating a legal framework that can work in a global marketplace. And on the heels of those significant policy changes, my legal team and I were deeply involved in numerous international transactions; assisting with the navigation of trade standards, financing, and attempting to harmonize the relevant import\/export guidelines to facilitate global commerce. In fact, these were some of the earliest steps towards global commoditization of the cannabis plant; led by ambitious, entrepreneurial-minded companies who saw and understood the global vision that is so foreign (pun intended) to most in the industry \u2014 even to this day. To think about leveraging an established trade platform at that time would have been a tremendous help. But no viable platform existed at the time. SAFED, ISRAEL: A worker at a cannabis greenhouse at the growing facility of the Tikun Olam company ... [+] on March 7, 2011 near the northern city of Safed, Israel. (Photo by Uriel Sinai\/Getty Images) But the global cannabis market has undergone a seismic shift in the past decade, evolving from a stigmatized industry to a legitimate and rapidly expanding commodity market. Legalization across multiple jurisdictions, changing societal perceptions, and the growing demand for cannabis-derived products have all played pivotal roles in this transformation. As the industry matures, platforms like CanXchange, Leaflink and Leaftrade are at the forefront, shaping the future of cannabis trade by fostering transparency, efficiency, and scalability in a complex global market. Technology plus commoditization tends to equate to a more interconnected and functional industry. Alex Arkentis, CEO and Co-Founder of CanXchange, tells me that \u201cCanXchange is not just building a platform; we\u2019re creating the foundation for a transparent and interconnected global cannabis market. Our mission is to empower every stakeholder, from growers to buyers, with the tools they need to succeed.\u201d After all, information creates a level playing field and is very powerful. Once relegated to the shadows, cannabis is now recognized as a valuable agricultural commodity. With a projected global market size of $82.3 billion by 2027, the industry spans a diverse range of products, from medicinal cannabis and CBD oils to industrial hemp and recreational marijuana. The commoditization of cannabis has been driven by several factors: A. Legalization: Over 50 countries have now embraced some form of cannabis legalization, whether for medical, industrial, or recreational use. This shift has allowed businesses to operate legally, spurring investment and innovation. B. Consumer Demand: The demand for high-quality cannabis products has skyrocketed as consumers increasingly seek alternatives to traditional pharmaceuticals and embrace sustainable, hemp-based solutions. C. Supply Chain Formalization: As the market matures, so does its supply chain. Growers, processors, distributors, and retailers are adopting best practices to ensure consistent quality and traceability, much like other agricultural commodities. Despite its rapid growth, the cannabis industry faces unique challenges. Regulatory discrepancies between countries and even within regions create a fragmented market. For instance, while cannabis may be fully legalized in Canada, it remains federally illegal in the United States (with limited exceptions for hemp-derivatives), complicating cross-border trade. Additionally, the lack of standardized pricing, quality benchmarks, and reliable trading infrastructure has made the industry susceptible to inefficiencies and volatility. As the cannabis industry navigates its growing pains, CanXchange has emerged as a game-changing platform that addresses these challenges. Designed as a central hub for the international trade of Industrial Hemp, Medical Cannabis, CBD, and cannabis derived products, CanXchange bridges the gap between suppliers and buyers by providing a professional, efficient, and secure trading environment. The platform operates with the principles of transparency and reliability at its core. On the other hand, platforms like LeafLink and LeafTrade focus on serving local markets, particularly within the United States. These platforms facilitate the smooth exchange of goods between dispensaries and growers, operating more like traditional marketplaces tailored to regional supply chains. By addressing localized needs, they ensure that recreational cannabis products are traded efficiently within state boundaries, complementing the broader push towards a formalized global trade network. Arkentis notes that \u201cThe cannabis industry is at a pivotal moment. By formalizing its trade with the right tools and platforms, we can ensure it becomes a legitimate global commodity, much like coffee or cocoa. At CanXchange, we are committed to leading this transformation with transparency and efficiency.\u201d As cannabis becomes increasingly accepted on the global stage, its trade is likely to follow the path of other agricultural commodities. Greater regulatory alignment, the development of transparent pricing mechanisms, and the adoption of advanced technologies using AI tools will all play pivotal roles in shaping the market\u2019s future. If platforms like CanXchange start adding services and products such as financing and insurance (which is something that it is currently developing with some large institutions under trial) we will see the commoditization of cannabis materialize faster than ever. Arkentis notes that \u201cfinancing is the lifeblood of any commodity market, and cannabis is no exception.\u201d He goes on to suggest that \u201cby integrating robust financial services into the cannabis trade, such as credit facilities and insurance, we can empower businesses to scale, mitigate risks, and create the foundation for a truly commoditized global market. This is the key to unlocking the industry\u2019s full potential.\u201d These additions would not only address critical gaps in the current market but also drive other exchanges and market makers to create financial products such as futures and options, similar to those available for other soft commodities like coffee and cocoa beans. While regional platforms in the US like Leaflink and Leaftrade continue to serve local markets effectively, global players are pushing the industry towards a more interconnected and efficient framework. By fostering professionalization and scalability, these wholesale platforms are preparing the cannabis market to meet the demands of a rapidly growing industry. With the right tools, technologies, and market strategies in place, the global cannabis trade is poised to become one of the most dynamic and innovative sectors in modern agriculture, unlocking vast economic potential and driving sustained growth in the years ahead. For cannabis to thrive as a global commodity, standardization is key. Consistent pricing, quality benchmarks, and reliable trading infrastructures are essential for fostering growth and instilling confidence in the market. The growth of the cannabis trade isn\u2019t just about economics; it\u2019s about innovation, sustainability, and creating opportunities across the globe. Platforms like these are paving the way for this industry to reach its full potential. The global trade of cannabis represents one of the most dynamic and promising frontiers in modern agriculture. Through new digital platforms like the ones mentioned above and their services the industry is no longer confined by its challenges but empowered to thrive as a transparent, efficient, and credible commodity market.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Over the last several years, the number of potential buyers in the business for sale market has exploded. The problem however is the supply of good businesses has not increased. Quality deal flow remains a massive challenge in the lower market and for larger institutional buyers like PE firms. One would also think that with more buyers the prices upon which businesses sell would increase drastically yet this is not the case. According to BizBuySell\u2019s 2024 Insights Report, the median sale price of small businesses increased by 3% in 2024. So yes, one could argue prices are being pushed up but nowhere near in relation to the number of increasing active buyers. Why The Rules of Supply and Demand Are Not Taking Hold Baby Boomer businesses are not coming to market as predicted In the lower market, the so-called \u2018silver tsunami\u2019 of retiring baby boomers without succession plans has not materialized. The ratio of businesses listed on public business for sale websites that sell according to the broker community has been in the 25 to 33 percent range for years and has not improved. Social Media con artists are polluting the water Social media has corrupted the industry with an onslaught of loudmouth promoters with little or no experience selling high-priced courses, advisory services, and making misleading claims that good businesses can be acquired for no money down. Or worse, that individuals can acquire these and then have them run absentee. It is complete nonsense. Simply apply logic \u2013 why would the owner of any good business consider selling their company to a complete stranger for no money down when they can easily sell it for attractive terms to a wide stable of interested buyers on the open market? Yet, many people believe these opportunities actually exist. As PT Barnum said: \u201cthere\u2019s a sucker born every day\u201d. Exhausted depressed businesswoman leaning on a wall covered with financial charts and feeling ... [+] hopeless, business failure concept  Business buyers have given themselves a fancy title that means nothing There has also been a huge increase of individuals who have labeled themselves \u2018Searchers\u2019 to dovetail on the Stanford search fund model. If you are not being paid a salary and have committed capital established for you by a search fund, you are not a \u2018Searcher\u2019. You are someone looking to buy a business. Further, when you mislabel yourself as a Searcher and you make inquiries with business brokers, they will laugh you off if you make that claim but you do not have committed capital behind you. There is a limited pool of investors in the lower market Obtaining funding to acquire a small business is not easy. Commercial banks, outside of SABA 7a loan programs are not going to lend money to an individual that has no collateral, no operational experience, or track record regardless of how solid the business may be that they want to acquire. Thinking you will locate a good business and then find many willing investors is not an intelligent approach. Get SBA pre-approval and also know that seller financed deals are how the vast majority of lower market transactions get down. Online Communities usually produce more questions than answers There has also been an increase in online communities of prospective business buyers. Fundamentally, it sounds good to some people \u2013 the ability to interact with like minded people to ask questions to people in similar situations. It is absurd. Why would anyone trying to accomplish something new seek out advice from individuals that are trying to do the same thing? Imagine, you have this universe of people who aspire to buy a business, yet they have no experience, little resources and usually no business operational experience and they are asking questions and getting advice from a group of individuals who have the same deficiencies. Talk about the blind leading the blind. It is insanity. The Average Person and MBAs Are On Equal Footing  Buying a business is a blue-collar process. You must roll up your sleeves and get your fingernails dirty. If you do not have any experience in buying businesses, then step one is to acquire the knowledge you need to successfully navigate the 23 steps in the process. MBAs from the best business schools have zero advantages in this process; they may think they do, and I have talked with many who believe exactly that, and they are all wrong. That formal education is great for hanging a diploma in their office, but what they teach at those schools does not transfer to the real-world of business buying. I am a prime example; I have purchased 14 companies including one co-investment and never went to university. If you have an open mind and a willingness to learn, acquiring businesses can be easily done by anyone, if you are willing to put in the work. Whichever Way The Crowd Is Running Head In The Opposite Direction  Expertise is what determines whether you will be successful at acquiring a business. Not an expert? Not a problem. Align yourself with believable people who have already done what you are trying to accomplish. Commit to learning everything you can about each of the stages of the business-buying process. Invest in resources that are presented by those with a track record of success acquiring companies. This is how you learn about business types, multiples, good fundamentals, issues to look out for that can become major problems after you buy and all other components to the process of buying a business. Do not think of yourself as a \u2018Searcher\u2019 \u2013 you are a \u2018Finder\u2019. Get out and meet with business owners and sellers. Nothing replaces face-to-face meetings. This is how you learn what it takes for specific businesses to thrive and whether you have that exact skill set or aptitude. You must match your greatest skillset to a business that requires that expertise to drive revenues and profits.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Andreas Cleve, saus his company Corti is building foundation models specific to healthcare Coinciding with last week\u2019s AI Action Summit in Paris, new figures from Dealroom point to a massive increase in artificial intelligence investment at a time when VCs have been paring back their dealmaking in other sectors. According to the data, AI companies raised $110 billion in 2024, representing a 62% increase from the year before. However, the bulk of this capital - $80.7 billion to be precise - was directed at US companies, with investment into Europe and China coming in at $12 billion and $7.6 billion respectively. In the case of generative AI, 83% of the money raised went to American startups and scaleups. So where does all this leave European ventures? Given that much of the money invested has gone into foundational work - such as the development of large language models - largely carried out in the U.S., can Europe\u2019s companies compete? Well, once the foundational work has been done, there should, in theory, be countless opportunities for startups that can create applications and use cases. That was a view expressed immediately after the AI Action Summit by Robert Lacher, founding partner of Visionaries Club, a Berlin and London-based VC fund. \u201cFoundational models have absorbed the lion\u2019s share of venture capital funding in 2024, but we believe investment in application layer businesses will skyrocket in 2025,\u201d he said. Joel Hellermark agrees. He is founder and CEO of Swedish Sana Labs, a company providing an AI platform that enables businesses to reach into their many applications to not only to access data but also to compile research, write reports and prepare documentation. As he sees it, Europe has the talent base to create solutions that deliver a tangible return on investment. \u201cEurope has the talent to take a global position in Applied AI,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it comes to foundational research we don't have the funding but we can take advancements and create models that people want to use.\u201d To that end, Sana - which has raised $130 million in VC capital to date - has partnered with OpenAI to create its applications. Hellermark says the key to winning business is the provision of products that can demonstrably deliver an ROI to buyers. For instance, Sana says that by using AI agents to research, process and output information, customers can achieve productivity gains of 90%. But there is more to the European AI story than startups using U.S.-developed language models as the basis for their applications. Jarek Kutylowski is a founder and CEO of translation company DeepL. The company has developed its own LLMs, but as he stresses it has specialised in the information required to build translation services. This, he says, is a differentiator. \u201cWhile many translation and AI tools are powered by general-purpose models designed for a wide range of tasks, the DeepL Language AI platform is purpose-built for communication and language use cases,\u201d he tells me in response to emailed questions. \u201cDeepL Translator is powered by our next-generation language model, which leverages proprietary LLM technology finely tuned language.\u201d As he describes it, the models are tutored by language experts. He argues this creates a knowledge base that tends to be superior to translation platforms powered by more generalised LLMs. A similar approach is taken by Corti, a Copenhagen-based company providing what it describes as a co-pilot for healthcare professionals. The mission of the business is to use AI to help doctors and other practitioners with patient assessment and clinical decision-making. The company has developed its own LLM. One that is specific to healthcare. \u201cWe have built something from the ground up,\u201d says CEO and co-founder Andreas Cleve. \u201cWe are a foundation model vendor, but it is a model that is built for a trillion-dollar market called healthcare. Our LLMs focus on one aspect of reality.\u201d Cleve says European companies have an opportunity to thrive by working on foundational models that home in on specialist fields. This, he says, is something that plays to Europe\u2019s strengths. \u201c In Europe, we are good at the hard problems rather than the general, mass-produced product. A Rolex rather than Timex.\u201d There is perhaps a blurring of the lines here between foundation and application. Businesses working in specialist fields must also enable customers to use the technologies at an application level. To this end, Corti solutions can be integrated via APIs to existing medical systems. DeepL also seeks to bridge the gap. \u201cWe focus on delivering high-impact applications through our Language AI platform. By bridging foundational AI development with enterprise-grade applications, we ensure our technology is both cutting-edge and directly valuable to businesses, governments, and individuals worldwide,\u201d says Kutylowski. Usability will undoubtedly be a key battleground. Hellermark says AI tools are still at an early stage in terms of the way that users interact with the technology. \u201cThere is a massive opportunity to define the UI and the OS for AI. It\u2019s like we are still in 1984 when we have yet to see a truly personal computer. We mainly interact with AI through chat and we have fairly simple integrations with the rest of the ecosystem. Europe has the talent to take a global position in Applied AI,\u201d he argues. The three scaleups featured in this article have already indentified their routes to market and found customers. For many companies at earlier stage, that challenge lies ahead.                         One Community.

Here\u2019s how it works.  As much as we love the OnePlus 13, most buyers looking for a new Android phone are probably going to choose between Google or Samsung handsets. They're available through U.S. carriers, are familiar to longtime Android users, and offer best-in-class software. Now that the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 are out, I used both phones side-by-side to figure out which one is best. We already have a full breakdown of how the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 shake up on paper, so I'm going to focus on the intangibles here. Things like how each phone feels in the hand or what it's like to use Pixel UI or One UI 7 on a daily basis. Boy, are there a lot of them. You might think that as the base-model representatives of the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 series, these two phones have a lot in common, but that just isn't the case. The biggest thing you'll notice when picking up either device is that the Galaxy S25 is lighter, and not by an insignificant margin. It only weighs 162, which makes it the lightest major flagship on the market in the U.S. By comparison, the Pixel 9 weighs 198 grams, and that's more than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Google may have figured out how to make the Pixel 9 feel premium this generation, but it hasn't cracked the perfect weight yet. The Galaxy S25's weight, plus its compact form factor overall, makes me want to pick it up more than the Pixel 9. It's more comfortable to hold, and I can promise that you'll notice the 36-gram difference without needing to look at the spec sheet. It makes even more of a difference if you like to use your smartphone with a case, because that'll of course add more weight and thickness.  The Google Pixel 9 is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S25 overall, and I'm not sure that's a good thing. The former has a 6.3-inch display, while the latter has a 6.2-inch display. At 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm, the Galaxy S25 is downright tiny, especially when you factor in the rear cameras. They protrude less from the back glass than the Pixel 9's camera bar, so it won't rock as much on a table. The displays themselves use similar technology. They're both OLED panels with 120Hz variable refresh rate support and high brightness capabilities. I'd say the Galaxy S25 is slightly less reflective and is easier to view outside, but both are excellent and flat screens.  When the Pixel 9 first came out, it was my favorite Android base model yet, and I thought it was capable of going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 16. It would've taken a lot for the Galaxy S25 to top the Pixel 9 in my book, and Samsung did just the right things for that to happen. To be clear, Samsung didn't do everything perfectly. I wanted to see new camera hardware and a fresh design. But it did the right things. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android What do I mean by that? Well, Google has always had a pitch with the Pixel lineup. By going with the Pixel 9, you might not have a phone that wins every benchmark. However, you're going to get a device that is very well-optimized, has fantastic software, and excels at AI tasks. Here's the thing: the Samsung Galaxy S25 is arguably better optimized, with just-as-good software, and with better AI tasks. Samsung and Qualcomm worked together to make the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and it's a breakthrough. Geekbench 6 tests below provide a snapshot of how the Galaxy S25 performs against the Pixel 9 in synthetic workflows. Samsung wins, and it's not particularly close. Benchmark Samsung Galaxy S25 (Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy) Google Pixel 9 (Tensor G4) Geekbench 6 (single-core) 3,025 1,572 Geekbench 6 (multi-core) 9,640 3,792 More importantly, the Galaxy S25 is now the leader in AI processing \u2014 a title the Pixel 9 held not too long ago. Google's Tensor G4 processor ran laps around the outgoing Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the Galaxy S24, since it could process up to 45 tokens per second. Qualcomm answered with a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform that can handle 70 tokens per second for AI tasks, besting Google's flagship. So, the Galaxy 25 is better at raw performance and AI processing, but what about software? I've been the first to criticize One UI over the years \u2014 I've written multiple articles slamming Samsung's tendencies to bog phones down with bloat and duplicate apps. However, there is no getting around the fact that One UI 7 is a breakthrough, and it might beat Pixel UI for the first time. The reason I quite enjoy One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25 is that it gives you the best of both Google AI and Galaxy AI. It has great Gemini and Circle to Search support and was the first phone to support Gemini's multi-app actions. It also has Magic Editor support via Google Photos. On top of that, it has all of Samsung's magic, including Object Eraser, AI Drawing Assist, and AI Select. It's not an exaggeration to say that Samsung is offering the best of both worlds with the Galaxy S25. Meanwhile, Google might have a few Pixel software exclusives, but there's no way to get the expansive Galaxy AI suite on a Pixel 9.  Put it all together, and I think the choice between the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9 is clear. The former is lighter, more compact, and faster, with more AI and software features. Now, before you run to buy a Galaxy S25 for $800, there is a limitation you should know about. It's the camera system, which has been recycled since the Galaxy S22 series and is getting extremely old. As you can see from the photos I've captured with the Galaxy S25 in the gallery below, that leads to results that are just okay. If you need better cameras, get the Google Pixel 9. That's basically the only reason I'd recommend the Pixel 9 over the Galaxy S25, which is not something I expected to write before testing these phones side-by-side. The reality is that Samsung has officially surpassed Google in terms of raw performance, optimization, and AI processing. With many of Google's best AI features coming to the Galaxy S25, there's little reason to favor the Pixel 9 as it currently stands.   The top compact Android Samsung's Galaxy S25 is faster and smaller than the Google Pixel 9 \u2014 with more AI features thanks to the inclusion of both Galaxy AI and Google AI. As such, if you want the best small Android flagship today, it's your best option. However, you'll need to look past dated camera hardware and a familiar design.

With regular U.S. mail service suspended and the post office, schools, banks and the stock market closed, the low-key holiday lends itself to relaxing at home or enjoying the day out. Here's what's open and closed this Presidents Day. U.S. Postal Service: Regular USPS mail services are suspended on Monday in observance of the national holiday, according to the U.S. Postal Service's\u00a0website. That includes all residential and business deliveries by regular mail and retail transactions. But Priority Mail Express mail, which is delivered all year round, will be delivered on Feb. 17. The Postal Service will resume its normal delivery and collection schedules on Tuesday, Feb. 18. DHL,\u00a0FedEx and\u00a0UPS: All three major shipping companies will be open on Presidents Day, although FedEx notes there may be \"Early on-call pickups and drop box pickups in some areas.\" Banks are closed on Presidents Day, one of 11 federal holidays\u00a0recognized\u00a0by the Federal Reserve. Customers can still make transactions at ATMs or online on Feb. 17. The U.S. stock market will also be closed in observance of the federal holiday. Originally celebrated on Feb. 22, George Washington's actual birthday, Presidents Day was moved to the third Monday in February in 1971 by an act of Congress known as the Uniform Monday Holiday Act.\u00a0 One of the biggest sales days of the year, Presidents Day \u2014 an unofficial name coined by advertisers \u2014 has become more associated with big savings on TVs and mattresses than the life of America's first president.\u00a0 With nonessential federal employees given the day off, most government offices such as courthouses, Department of Motor Vehicles, and public schools and libraries are closed on Presidents Day. The Department of Sanitation is closed in most cities, but in some places, like Los Angeles, it will remain\u00a0open.\u00a0 Most major supermarket chains, including Albertsons, Aldis, Costco, Kroger and Trader Joe's, are open on Monday, Feb. 17., but you may want to check ahead when it comes to local grocers. You'll be hard-pressed to find a fast-food chain that isn't open on Presidents Day, which is one of the busiest days for restaurant food delivery,\u00a0according to DoorDash. Anne Marie D.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"The iPhone SE 4 will pack many changes when it launches this week, including a dramatic redesign, an A18 chip, and full Apple Intelligence support. However, one lingering question in my mind is whether Apple will finally upgrade the iPhone SE\u2019s base storage from the current measly 64GB.  The second-generation iPhone SE introduced in 2020 started at 64GB of storage for $399, and you could upgrade to 128GB for $50 and 256GB for $150. The current-generation iPhone SE 3 that launched in 2020 starts at 64GB for $429, while the 128GB costs $50 more and the 256GB costs $150 more.  An incredibly sketchy leak this week from a Chinese retailer claims that the iPhone SE 4 will start at 64GB (via MacRumors). I would not put any stock into this rumor, as it\u2019s almost certainly placeholder information as we await Apple\u2019s official announcement of the device.  Apple Intelligence is perhaps the best argument in favor of Apple finally deciding its time to increase the iPhone SE\u2019s base storage from 64GB. As we\u2019ve reported, Apple Intelligence takes up around 7GB of storage on your iPhone. That\u2019s a hefty chunk of storage, particularly if an iPhone only has 64GB of space to begin with.  It\u2019s only a limitation if that\u2019s the only storage. For many people that is more than enough. They want  cheap iPhone for FaceTime and iMessage not to download libraries of music and hundreds of apps. I would argue that not having a cheap low storage option is worse.  For that reason, I feel confident in predicting that the iPhone SE 4 will increase its base storage configuration from 64GB to 128GB. We\u2019ve seen Apple make hardware changes to accommodate Apple Intelligence needs in the past, and I think that same thinking will apply to the iPhone SE 4. I could very well be proven wrong, but that is where I\u2019m planting my stake for now.   Looking outside of the iPhone SE lineup, Apple ditched the 64GB storage tier on its flagship iPhones with the launch of the iPhone 13 in 2021.  Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone SE as soon as Wednesday, so we\u2019ll know more details then. In the meantime, how much storage do you think the cheapest iPhone SE 4 will offer?

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"President Donald Trump has significantly influenced the cryptocurrency industry in recent months, as he has positioned himself as a pro-crypto advocate. His stance has sparked increased market activity, with several cryptocurrencies experiencing notable movements this year and poised for further gains in the coming months. As we progress through the first quarter of 2025, let\u2019s take a closer look at the cryptocurrencies that are drawing attention and could be worth watching this quarter. 2 \/ 7 Since Donald Trump was reelected as the 47th President of the United States, the leading cryptocurrency has repeatedly shattered all-time highs. On the day of his inauguration, Bitcoin surged to a record $108,786, fueling investor optimism for a potential Bitcoin Reserve announcement. Several states have already expressed interest in stockpiling Bitcoin, and developments on this front could emerge this quarter. As of mid-February, Bitcoin is trading at $95,000. 3 \/ 7 Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been closely following Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory but has yet to surpass its all-time high reached in 2021 at $4,878. Despite this, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the blockchain industry, serving as the foundation for thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) and enabling a wide range of use cases, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With its robust ecosystem and continuous network upgrades, Ethereum has significant room for growth in the near future, positioning its native token, Ether, as one to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. As of mid-February, Ether is trading at $2,600. 4 \/ 7 Solana is one of the fastest-growing major cryptocurrencies. It competes with Ethereum in terms of speed and has emerged as a strong platform for hosting hundreds of decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, several popular memecoins are developed on the Solana blockchain, which has further expanded Solana\u2019s use cases. Following the successful launch of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, there are strong indications that Solana ETFs may be launched soon. Several asset management companies have already submitted applications for them. Investors should keep an eye on this development, as it could make the Solana token a focal point this quarter. As of mid-February, Solana is trading at $192. 5 \/ 7 XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, an open-source blockchain. It is used by the Ripple payment network to facilitate cross-border transactions and is designed to act as a bridge currency. It\u2019s important to note that Ripple, the company, operates the network but does not own XRP. Ripple has been involved in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for years, as the financial regulator accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. The situation now appears to be more favorable for Ripple. In August 2024, a court ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine for violating investor-protection laws, significantly less than the $2 billion sought by the SEC. Moreover, there are speculations that the SEC may soon approve XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of mid-February, XRP is trading at $2.4. 6 \/ 7 Cardano has been rising following Trump\u2019s reelection. There are rumors that its founder, Charles Hoskinson, might join the Trump administration in 2025. While these speculations remain unconfirmed, Cardano\u2019s price is on the rise.  Furthermore, the chances of approval for Cardano ETFs have increased since the crypto asset management company Grayscale has filed for one, which is expected to raise the token\u2019s price. As of mid-February, Cardano is trading at $0.8. 7 \/ 7","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  A major new study on weight-loss drugs poses a new idea for addiction treatment: small doses of Ozempic could help people cut down on drinking and smoking.          For years, GLP-1 medications have been changing people's relationship with snacking.               This week, JAMA Psychiatry published the results of a small but significant trial that showed a similar effect on alcohol cravings. For two months, 48 people with alcohol use disorder were given either a small weekly shot of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, or a placebo. Those who received the drug drank 30% less than usual and reported fewer cravings.               The federally-funded study is the first randomized controlled trial \u2014 the gold standard of clinical research \u2014 to look at Ozempic and alcohol cravings, after years of reports from Ozempic users that they feel less attached to alcohol.               There was a bonus finding, too. Cigarette smokers who received a dose of semaglutide reduced their daily cigarette consumption more than those who got the placebo.               Researchers say the results open up a whole new world of possibilities for drug developers. Could we manufacture a new, smaller dose of GLP-1 drugs that people can use to break habits?               \"I could absolutely see microdosing come into play,\" Gregg Stanwood, a behavioral neuroscientist at Florida State University who was not involved in the study, told Business Insider.               \"That could be a good thing if someone does it and successfully has a Dry January and maybe they go back to drinking in February, but it reduces binges and they go into something that's more sustainable for everyday life.\"               We still have major questions about what that could look like. Further trials are needed with different doses, a longer period of time, on more people.               Still, scientists are buzzing about this trial, what it teaches us about our brain's reward system, and the drug-development potential.               Here are a few reasons for intrigue, according to three researchers:               We still have a lot to learn about how GLP-1 drugs work on the brain, though studies on alcohol offer some clues.               It's tempting to think that, because semaglutide can help people cut down on calories and sugar, it similarly reduces the \"appetite\" for alcohol. It's not that simple, Anders Fink-Jensen, professor of psychiatry at the University of Copenhagen who's researched the effect of GLP-1s on substance use disorders, told BI.               For example, animal studies showed that GLP-1 drugs not only reduced alcohol cravings in mice, but also slowed down the urge for a fix in rats who were craving cocaine, which is calorie-free.               \"We know quite little about it,\" Fink-Jensen told Business Insider. \"We just don't really know how the drugs get there. There are areas for regulating appetite and we know it reaches these areas. But how it gets to the rest of the brain, we don't really understand.\"               One theory is that GLP-1 drugs mitigate dopamine rushes in the brain, the feeling of pleasure triggered by certain behaviors like eating candy or sipping expensive whiskey.               It does that by boosting a specific type of protein through complex cellular processes scientists are still working out.               \"It acts as a vacuum cleaner for dopamine, basically sucks the dopamine up,\" Stanwood told Business Insider. \"Rewards like drinking, gambling, sex, share a mechanism to increase the amount of dopamine in your brain. Cleaning up the excess dopamine reduces incentive for those behaviors.\"               There is huge potential for this area of research. Whoever can explain what, exactly, GLP-1s do to the brain will be the toast of the pharmaceutical industry. Treatments could be developed for alcohol use disorder \u2014 and so much more.               \"Addictions in general, also functional addictions such as gaming addiction,\" Dr. Markku Lhteenvuo, a researcher from the University of Eastern Finland who specializes in how drugs affect the brain, told BI.               So, the race is on. Central dopamine regulation is \"the most rooted for\" theory, Lhteenvuo said, but there is no shortage of research teams looking for other explanations.               It's hard to assess the safety of such treatments without understanding quite how drugs like Ozempic work in the brain, though.               \"The question is, does GLP-1 receptor activation do this all the time or just when dopamine is excessive?\" Stanwood said. \"If it's all the time, that could be a problem because we need these dopamine hits to reinforce these wonderful things like hugging your kids, listening to music, having chocolate cake. We don't want to clamp that down to nothing.\"               So far, research is supportive of the theory that GLP-1s act on excessive dopamine levels. A key finding of the latest study is that participants didn't stop drinking entirely, or even less often, but they were less likely to drink heavily and fewer drinks per session when they did.               In the future, it's feasible that GLP-1s may be a tool for people to manage their drinking.               The tricky part is safety.               Stigma around addiction could scare off investors from developing a GLP-1 for substance abuse disorders, researchers told BI. Ozempic has other lucrative and appealing applications for which companies could develop next-gen medications, like preventing heart attacks or kidney disease.               \"It could easily take three or four years or much longer if they're not interested or if data are not so positive as we hope them to be,\" Fink-Jensen said.               People can \u2014 and do \u2014 take GLP-1s off-label for weight loss, finding Ozempic (technically a diabetes drug) from gray market websites. Fink-Jensen said it's a risky move, even under supervision, since we don't yet understand exactly how to use this drug for addiction.               \"We really suggest that people should avoid prescribing these compounds now and wait for more strong data.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":" The day of hearts might be over, but the colors associated with it are everlasting. Red and pink have their seasons, especially when it comes to trends in the mobile market. Although not exactly a hot item, the hottest hue of pink is such a rare sight that it almost always becomes the talk of the town whenever a pink phone is launched. There is perhaps no other phone brand that knows that better than Motorola, and it\u2019s bringing one of its most iconic pink brands back with a little help from a very pink celebrity. Pink overload like the above is exactly what you\u2019ll get with the new Limited Edition Razr+ foldable phone designed as a collab with hotel heiress and media personality Paris Hilton. No need for stickers or cases that will bulk up a relatively thick phone, because this very pink foldable will probably give you all the pink you could ever want and then some. And by \u201csome,\u201d we mean more pink accessories to match! Designer: Motorola        Of all the mobile phone manufacturers in history, Motorola is arguably the one with the most experience with pink. Part of the campaign that made its ultra-thin RAZR V3 clamshell launched more than two decades ago was its Hot Pink variant, very rare and very chic in that era. Of course, Paris Hilton, whose fame was skyrocketing back then, was at hand to associate herself with the phone and vice versa. Who better to boost the new Razr\u2019s presence than this fashionista?        If you\u2019re a hot fan of hot pink then this limited edition Motorola Razr Plus might be for you. Yes, it comes preloaded with tons of Paris Hilton\u2019s wallpaper and special ringtones, but if you have no care for those, you can easily remove them and still keep that engraved \u201cHot Pink\u201d branding on the phone\u2019s hinge. Then again, for an additional $200 for this special edition, you might be more than convinced to keep them for posterity\u2019s sake.  This pink edition also comes with, you guessed it, a pink case to keep your foldable phone protected on the outside without losing too much of that special color. It\u2019s not as vibrant as the phone\u2019s natural color, of course, but that\u2019s because of the more muted vegan leather texture that you\u2019ll get in exchange. With the, yes, pink strap options, you\u2019ll be turning the Razr Plus into a tiny pink purse, at least when it\u2019s folded up.    It\u2019s quite curious that Motorola would suddenly launch this Paris Hilton edition of the Razr Plus phone, without at least launching a new model yet. Granted, this particular segment of the already niche foldable phone market hasn\u2019t been getting that much attention lately, so anything that would spark interest will probably help, even if it\u2019s a blindingly pink color.   Going to CES is a lot like going on a treasure hunt.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Last year, European healthtech companies raised $11.6bn, making it the most backed sector of 2024. And for good reason. As breakthroughs in AI, chemistry and biotech unfold at a rapid pace, the speed of healthcare innovation is ratcheting up alongside. That means there\u2019s a huge number of incredible concepts, products and tech coming down the track. Combined with the current market conditions and intensifying societal needs, today\u2019s healthtech founders have a chance to truly transform global health outcomes. As VCs, we are constantly looking for the hidden gems or untapped ideas that will go on to unlock this level of societal, global impact. When it comes to healthcare, that means seeking out founders pursuing breakthroughs that can transform patient care, tackle long-standing inequalities, spot or prevent illnesses, and empower individuals to take control of their healthcare journey. Ultimately, we\u2019re looking for the innovators and innovations that will help billions of us live better, fuller lives. As the market continues its trajectory of success and impact, here\u2019s where I\u2019m currently looking for the next \u2018hidden gems\u2019 of healthtech: The power of proteins We\u2019re only just beginning to grasp the full potential of protein interactions and their impact on drug discovery, treatment efficacy, and new therapeutic possibilities. DeepMind's AlphaFold has already been a game-changer, predicting the structures of 250 million proteins and unlocking unprecedented insights into the foundation of our biology. With its work cited over 28,000 times, the ripple effects on disease prevention and drug discovery is set to be profound. Companies like A-Alpha Bio are already exploring the predictive strength of protein-to-protein binding, and I expect to see many more innovators try to leverage these insights to tackle persistent health challenges and drive the next wave of therapeutic breakthroughs. Just last week, Latent Labs, founded by former DeepMind scientist Simon Kohl, raised $40m to use AI to create new therapeutic molecules to deliver more personalised treatments \u2013 just the latest sign of how much momentum is building in this space. Breaking open the biobank Banks may store wealth, but the UK Biobank stores health; it\u2019s quite literally a treasure trove for potential public health breakthroughs. With its vast collection of patient information, it\u2019s an incredible resource that could help tackle some of the biggest public health challenges we face today. This kind of data can be the key to developing targeted, evidence-led interventions that address the most pressing health disparities and conditions \u2013 whether it\u2019s tackling diseases that disproportionately affect specific groups or finding more personalised treatment options. Nightingale Health, for example, analysed blood samples from 500,000 Biobank participants, and used it to build the world\u2019s largest blood biomarker database, enabling earlier detection and personalised treatments, and showing how the right data can drive solutions to long-standing health challenges. VCs like me are on the lookout for more founders tapping into this goldmine of data and using it to make a real difference at scale. Opportunities also lie outside of existing data sets. We\u2019ll be paying close attention to companies which are able to generate or collect new unique patient data to drive insight into underserved areas of health. This data \u2013 combined with public datasets \u2013 can be used to develop drugs, run smaller, more targeted clinical trials, and develop decision-support tools for clinicians. Going further with GLP1s  Originally introduced as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, we are now seeing evidence that GLP1s - or so-called weight loss drugs - can help address a range of health issues, from anxiety and addictive behaviors to inflammation and even slowing the progression of Parkinson\u2019s. And it feels like this is just the start. As GLP1 applications expand, I\u2019m keeping a keen eye on how they can help close the health gap for communities that have long been overlooked when it comes to breakthrough therapies and believe some exciting startups will soon start operating in this space. With the continued rise of GLP1s there are also enormous opportunities to address the side effects they cause and to improve the delivery mechanism, as well as provide the right diet and nutrition coaching to help people sustain their weight loss. After all, the challenge isn\u2019t just about losing weight, it\u2019s about staying healthy in the long run. AI as an accessibility tool  AI stands to be a real accessibility game-changer in healthtech. I\u2019ve seen it first-hand. Just last month I got a Doctor\u2019s letter for my son that was so filled with acronyms and jargon, I felt like I needed a PhD to understand it. But I uploaded a photo of it to ChatGPT and it was able to translate that dense language into something I could actually digest. I was instantly more informed about my son\u2019s health. If I can struggle with deciphering a Doctor\u2019s letter in an affluent part of the world, imagine the challenges elsewhere. Health literacy is an enormous issue across the world. Marginalised communities often face extra hurdles in making sense of medical information, and that\u2019s where AI can really level the playing field. If we get the right tools into the hands of patients, no matter their background, we could see a dramatic improvement in outcomes. This is particularly true for elder care where it\u2019s even more important to involve family members in care decisions. Everyone deserves to be a proactive participant in the management of their own good health, so I\u2019m excited to see what founders can achieve in this space. Meeting mental health needs Mental health, particularly among young people, is in need of some fresh thinking right now. With anxiety and depression on the rise due, in part, to the pressures of a social media-driven world, healthtech has a lot to offer. There\u2019s often no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to mental health, which means there\u2019s room for a lot of innovation from different companies. Mental health issues in young Asian, Black, and minority ethnic communities have risen more steeply in recent years, while these challenges have long been more pronounced among women and those in deprived areas. This makes the need for inclusive, accessible solutions even more pressing. Many underserved communities face unique mental health challenges, and tech can help fill those gaps, offering support where it\u2019s lacking. Another key challenge in this sector is ensuring that we have enough mental health professionals to meet demand. As Emma Silverman, Partner at TMV, points out, \u2018over half of master\u2019s level graduates in mental health fields never obtain their practice license.\u2019 This is opening the door for innovative solutions that expand the professional pipeline. One such company, Silverman notes, is Motivo Health. By facilitating the supervision hours required for licensure, Motivo helps to break down the traditional barriers that can prevent qualified graduates converting into practicing professionals. Mental health is a complex space, and we\u2019re excited to see more startups making strides with sustainable solutions that will shape the years to come. Healthtech isn\u2019t about chasing the fountain of youth; it\u2019s about empowering us to live healthier, longer lives. These hidden gems aren\u2019t just ideas \u2013 they\u2019re breakthroughs set to reshape healthcare and drive meaningful societal change. VCs are watching closely.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Traffic lights on one of streets with marihuana green shape light in Switzerland Swiss lawmakers have introduced a bill to legalize recreational cannabis in an effort to curb the illegal market. The Health Committee of the House of Representatives approved last week a draft bill aimed at relaxing restrictions for adults. The proposal, which received 14 votes in favor, nine against, and two abstentions, is intended to curb illegal market activity, safeguard public health, and establish a non-profit sales framework. Recreational cannabis is still illegal in Switzerland, though minor possession was decriminalized in 2012. While pilot programs for regulated cannabis distribution are ongoing in several cities, this bill marks a significant step toward legalization, though the legal market will be controlled by the state. The proposed legislation would put recreational cannabis sales under a state monopoly, as products would be sold at licensed physical shops and one state-approved online shop, and revenue from sales would fund harm reduction, addiction services, and subsidies for health insurance cost savings. This model differs from the commercialized systems in Canada and the United States, where private enterprises are free to develop the legal market. The bill requires strict quality controls on cannabis products, including neutral packaging, prominent warning labels, and childproof packaging. Advertising would be completely prohibited, including not only cannabis products but also seeds, cuttings, and paraphernalia. Taxation would be based on the level of THC, with products having higher levels of THC to be taxed more. Swiss adults would be allowed to cultivate up to three flowering female cannabis crops for personal consumption, and purchasing and possession would be made subject to regulation. Public consumption rules would complement existing passive smoking protection laws in an effort not to expose the public to secondhand smoke. This bill, however, keeps cannabis classified as a dangerous narcotic. The commission's draft, which is based on work since 2021 and recent pilot trials allowing controlled access, is a reaction to widespread concern at the current prohibitive approach. During the summer consultation period, an explanatory report will be released, allowing stakeholders and affected parties to provide feedback on the draft. In Switzerland, it is estimated that about 300,000 people regularly consume cannabis. In 2018, the Federal Council stated that the existing cannabis prohibition under the Narcotics Act has failed to adequately safeguard the population. Lawmakers argue that despite the prohibition, cannabis use persists, the black market thrives, and there is no quality control or consumer protection. They believe that a well-structured legal framework could address these long-standing issues, drawing consumers away from the illegal market. Currently, the state leaves control of the market to illegal actors, which results in harmful effects, such as natural hemp being mixed with toxic substances, according to the bill's press release. \"The prohibition of cannabis, compared to legal drugs, is not based on current scientific evidence, especially since the harm caused by tobacco and alcohol is no less,\" the justification section of the draft states. \"This moral and legal inconsistency is becoming increasingly difficult to justify. Only a regulated market aligns with the principles of Swiss addiction policy.\" In May 2024, a group of citizens launched a popular initiative to add a new article to Switzerland's federal constitution legalizing cannabis. If this bill becomes law, Switzerland will be the fourth European country to legalize recreational cannabis. Malta became the first European Union member state in 2021 to legalize recreational cannabis for personal use and establish cannabis social clubs. In 2023, Luxembourg legalized cannabis for personal use, and a year later, Germany became the third country to legalize it for personal use, also establishing cannabis social clubs similar to Malta. Additionally, Germany, by removing cannabis from controlled substances, eased access to its medical use, attracting foreign investment. However, unlike these countries, which have legalized cannabis for personal use without creating a legal market, Switzerland plans to establish a state-controlled market. However, this model may limit private investment entering the market.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that Apple will launch a new product on Wednesday, February 19. The most likely release is the much-anticipated iPhone SE 4, but there are a few other possibilities. Here\u2019s everything you need to know. The iPhone SE 4 has been rumored for over two years, and it\u2019s going to be a massive upgrade to Apple\u2019s most affordable iPhone model. The revamp will include an all-new design inspired by the iPhone 14, along with major internal performance improvements and an upgraded camera. According to Bloomberg, the iPhone SE 4 is almost certainly the product Apple will announce on Wednesday. I\u2019m pretty excited to see this thing actually hit the market, and I think it has a shot at being a big success if Apple gets the pricing right. The M4 MacBook Air will offer a handful of upgrades over the M3 version. The big change, of course, will be the faster performance and better efficiency offered by the M4 chip. Perhaps most notably, this should lead to an increase in battery life as well.  The M4 chip will also unlock a higher top RAM configuration of 32GB for the MacBook Air. For comparison, the M3 MacBook Air tops out at 24GB.  Another big change: the M4 MacBook Air will support two external displays even when its lid is open. Currently, the M3 MacBook Air only supports two external displays when its lid is closed.  The M4 MacBook Air is expected to launch soon, with supply dwindling at Apple retail stores. Whether or not that happens this week or later this spring remains to be seen. Apple is working on two updates to the iPad lineup. First, there\u2019s the iPad 11, a new model of its most affordable iPad. The iPad 11 will feature faster performance with Apple\u2019s A17 Pro chip paired with 8GB of RAM. That\u2019s a significant boost from the iPad 10, which is powered by the A14 Bionic chip and 4GB of RAM. These upgrades will enable Apple Intelligence support on Apple\u2019s cheapest iPad.  Additionally, Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Air. This will just be a basic spec bump update, with a performance boost from the M2 chip to the M3 chip. There\u2019s a brand new product expected to join Apple\u2019s lineup this year. As 9to5Mac reported last September, Apple is working on a new smart home command center with a square display and an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence support.  Bloomberg has also extensively reported on this product. According to Mark Gurman, the device will feature a 7-inch display and be \u201cabout the size of two iPhones side by side, with a thick edge around the display.\u201d  The device\u2019s design is centered around being attached to a wall and will be available in silver and black color options. Bloomberg\u00a0also reports that there will be \u201cbases with additional speakers that can be placed in the kitchen, on a nightstand or on a desk.\u201d\u00a0 While Apple was initially targeting a March release for the new smart display product, more recent reporting suggests the device will ship later than anticipated.  Last but not least, we\u2019re still waiting for Apple to release the next round of software betas for all of its platforms. iOS 18.4 is expected to bring multiple new Apple Intelligence features, including Siri with personal context, on-screen awareness, and in-app actions. Bloomberg reports that the first iOS 18.4 beta will be released as soon as sometime this week. In addition to iOS 18.4, Apple will likely release iPadOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, tvOS 18.4, and watchOS 11.4. I\u2019d bet on this week focusing on the new iPhone SE 4. This is a hotly-anticipated addition to Apple\u2019s product lineup that will put Apple Intelligence at a much lower price point. Most 9to5Mac readers who care about the latest and greatest hardware might think it\u2019s a boring announcement, but it\u2019s a key market for Apple. Based on last year\u2019s schedule, we\u2019re overdue for the release of the first iOS 18.4 beta. Whether or not that materializes this week remains to be seen.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Apple will debut its first new product of the year this Wednesday. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the launch through a tweet last week. While we can\u2019t say for certain that the new product launch will be, it\u2019s highly likely to be the new iPhone SE 4, which may receive a new name. Given all previous reporting, the most likely outcome from Wednesdays announcement is to be a new iPhone SE model. To quickly recap, we\u2019re expecting a new 6.1-inch OLED display, an upgrade to USB-C, a 48MP rear camera, Face ID, as well as many other modern iPhone features. The new iPhone SE will also be the testbed for Apple\u2019s first in-house 5G modem. Some sketchier rumors suggested that Apple may choose to brand this new iPhone SE model with a new moniker: iPhone 16E.  Tim Cook referred to the new product launch as \u201cthe newest member of the family.\u201d While this doesn\u2019t say anything for certain, many are speculating that it likely suggests that the iPhone 16E naming will come to fruition. Only time will tell. Some other products that are on track to launch early this year include: These are more than likely launching later in the spring, but they are technically on the table for this weeks Apple announcement. Apple does have a number of exciting announcements in the pipeline for the first half of the year, but many won\u2019t necessarily fall within early spring. For example, AirTag 2 shouldn\u2019t launch until \u201cmid 2025\u201d, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman. This AirTag upgrade will include a couple of nice quality of life upgrades, including much improved precision finding. Apple is also working on a new smart home hub, which some refer to as \u2018HomePad.\u2019 While this product was initially on track for a March debut, recent reports suggest that it might not hit the market until a little bit later.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  If you were to describe dealmaking in 2024, you might say it's the year Wall Street got its swagger back.          US companies announced more than $1.43 trillion in deals last year, the highest amount since 2021, when a dealmaking frenzy resulted in a record $2.51 trillion in US M&A activity, according to the deals tracker LSEG. The uptick \u2014 combined with signs of economic growth and a more relaxed approach to regulations under the Trump administration \u2014 has led some industry leaders to suggest that the M&amp;A freeze that started in 2022 may finally be coming to an end.               \"There's a lot of pent-up energy in capital markets, particularly around the financial-sponsor community, and that will be unleashed,\" David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, said at a financial industry conference in February. \"I am very confident we will get back to 10-year averages\" in historical dealmaking contexts, he said, adding, \"This year could be one of those times.\"       Bankers have good reason to be hopeful: There were 96 megadeals, or deals over $5 billion, announced globally last year \u2014 the most since 2021, according to LSEG. Such deals are the lifeblood of the biggest investment banks as they can generate hundreds of billions in fees for firms. Last year's M&A activity generated advisory fees of about $33.4 billion, a 7% increase from roughly $31.3 billion the year before, LSEG said.               Some of the multibillion-dollar tie-ups facilitated by the battle-hardened M&A bankers on this year's list included the nearly $36 billion sale of the food manufacturer Kellanova to the snack brand Mars and the $26 billion takeover of Endeavor Energy Resources by its rival Diamondback Energy.               To find out which bankers helped their firms benefit from last year's boom, Business Insider partnered with MergerLinks, a UK-based data provider that reviews M&A performance, to present the sixth annual edition of \"The Rainmakers,\" a list of the top 20 investment bankers ranked by overall transaction volume in the US.               This is the first year a woman \u2014 Anu Aiyengar of JPMorgan \u2014 has snagged the No. 1 spot. It's also the first time more than one woman has made the ranking.               Aiyengar, JPMorgan's global head of mergers and acquisitions, was joined by Lily Mahdavi, who was recently promoted to cohead of M&A in the Americas at Morgan Stanley.               It's Aiyengar's fourth appearance. Other repeat names include Suhail Sikhtian, who leads Goldman's natural-resources practice; Blair Effron, a cofounder of the elite-boutique investment bank Centerview; and Stephan Feldgoise, Goldman Sachs' head of M&A.               More notable, perhaps, are the unusually high number of new faces \u2014 including Mahdavi and her fellow Morgan Stanley dealmaker Steve Munger. Also new to the list are Centerview's Todd Davison, Jefferies' Conrad Gibbins, and Xavier Loriferne of JPMorgan Chase. In total, nearly 50% of the members on this year's list \u2014 nine names \u2014 are making their inaugural debut, MergerLinks said.               The 2024 list also marks the first time a Jefferies banker has made the top 20.               MergerLinks tracks publicly announced deals and calculates deal values on a net basis, including both equity and debt components. To make the individual league table, a banker must have been the lead advisor on either side of a transaction.               Deal sizes are sourced from MergerLinks and public press releases and include the target company's net debt. The transaction values are converted from British pounds to US dollars at the average 2024 exchange rate. As a result, some deal prices announced in dollars throughout the year may not match up.       Title: Global head of M&A       Number of deals: 14       Value of deals: $83.2 billion               Aiyengar became JPMorgan's solo head of mergers and acquisitions in 2023 but has been with the bank since 2002. She's routinely cited as one of the financial services industry's most powerful and influential female leaders. She has appeared on the list three times in the past.               Her 2024 deals included:      Advised Rio Tinto, a global mining organization, its $6.7 billion acquisition of the chemicals firm Arcadium Lithium. Title: Global head of M&A Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $78.2 billion Feldgoise was named Goldman's global head of mergers and acquisitions following a management reshuffle of its investment banking division in January. Feldgoise was previously a cohead of M&A and has also led the investment bank's consumer and retail coverage group. He joined the firm in 1997 and became a partner in 2008. This is his second time on the list, with his first appearance being two years ago. His 2024 deals included: Advised the data center firm AirTrunk in its roughly $15 billion sale to the private equity firm Blackstone.  Title: CEO       Number of deals: 7       Value of deals: $76.2 billion               Boutros is the CEO of the tech-focused investment bank Qatalyst. Previously, he was a senior banker at Credit Suisse, where he served as chairman of both the global technology and healthcare groups.

Gallea joined Goldman Sachs from JPMorgan in 2018 after spending nearly two decades there. He has distinguished himself as a leading banker in the industrials sector.               His 2024 deals included:       Title: Chairman of global M&A       Number of deals: 6       Value of deals: $49.8 billion               The longtime global M&A leader moved into a new role as chairman last year so he could spend more time advising Barclays' top clients. Posternack joined the firm in 2008 after it bought Lehman Brothers, his previous firm. He led its natural-resources practice and its M&A takeover defense business.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"blockchain and financial technology.  The race to remake global finance is heating up, and the starting gun has already fired on Wall Street. While traditional banks grapple with systems that trap trillions in idle capital, a new financial architecture is emerging from the fusion of blockchain technology and traditional finance (TradFi). The prize isn't just eliminating the friction that costs the industry billions in settlement delays and reconciliation headaches\u2014it's fundamentally rewiring how money moves. Early movers aren't just experimenting anymore; they're driving the financial blockchain market toward a projected $49.2 billion by 2030, up from $2.1 billion in 2023. The shift isn't just theoretical. At Davos 2025, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan likened crypto to established payment systems: \"If you go down the street here and buy lunch, you could pay with Visa, Mastercard, a debit card, Apple Pay, and so on. In that sense, cryptocurrency would just be another form of payment.\" Behind the glass towers of Wall Street, this future is already materializing. The DTCC\u2019s Project Ion, leveraging distributed ledger technology, is rewiring financial infrastructure\u2019s fundamental plumbing by shifting from batch to real-time processing and creating a single, unified transaction record\u2014slashing reconciliation costs and delivering significant savings. Already handling over 100,000 bilateral equity transactions daily, with peaks reaching 160,000 trades, Project Ion operates within today's T+2 settlement framework while blazing the trail toward T+1 and potentially T+0 settlement\u2014a shift that could unlock billions in capital currently trapped in settlement limbo. Banking giants BNY Mellon, Citi, and JP Morgan aren't just watching from the sidelines\u2014they're already all in. Cross-border payments remain the industry's biggest bottleneck\u2014slow, costly, and reliant on an outdated patchwork of intermediaries. Trillions move across borders every year, yet transactions can take days, saddled with 4%+ fees and opaque banking rails. Enter stablecoins\u2014by converting fiat into digital tokens on global blockchain networks, banks unlock 24\/7, near-instant money movement at scale. This innovation lets institutions bypass correspondent banking friction entirely, settling transactions in minutes rather than days. JPMorgan Coin already processes $1 billion in daily settlements, and the broader market for tokenized dollars is on track to hit $400 billion by 2025. The economic case is striking: where traditional transfers trap money for days and drain substantial fees, blockchain-powered stablecoins deliver instant settlement at a fraction of the cost. This shift has tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon building Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms, accelerating enterprise blockchain adoption. The transformation spans every corner of finance. Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Standard Chartered have launched blockchain initiatives to streamline operations, while payment giants Visa and Mastercard are integrating the technology into their global networks. Asset management leaders Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are pushing into real-world assets (RWA), recognizing blockchain's potential to transform asset tokenization and settlement. Franklin Templeton's expansion of its money market fund across Solana, Ethereum, Stellar, and other major blockchain networks signals a new phase\u2014traditional asset managers are no longer experimenting; they're building multi-chain infrastructure for the future. Global crossborder digital payment and tokenization Three key forces are accelerating blockchain's adoption in TradFi: First, legacy banking systems struggle to meet real-time global demands; second, regulatory clarity around digital assets is improving; third, institutional investors\u2014once skeptical\u2014are now integrating blockchain solutions to bridge traditional and digital finance. Unlike early blockchain disruptors who sought to replace traditional finance, today's players are bridging legacy systems with digital innovation\u2014prioritizing functionality over disruption. The road ahead presents a delicate balancing act. As banks and financial institutions embrace blockchain, they must navigate the fine line between pushing innovation forward and staying within regulatory bounds. Enterprise solutions like R3 Corda are emerging as crucial bridges, offering the institutional-grade infrastructure needed for this transition. At the same time, decentralized networks are evolving to put compliance first\u2014pointing toward a future where innovation and regulation coexist in harmony. Among new solutions, Chainlink, Aave, and Compound are pioneering DeFi infrastructure, while Graphite Network is bridging TradFi and DeFi, offering verification and compliance-focused solutions that major institutions can trust. A reputation-based Layer 1 blockchain, it integrates privacy-preserving KYC (ZKPs), institutional compliance, and high-speed transactions (1,400 TPS at low fees). Each account has a behavior-based reputation score, protecting users from untrustworthy members. Verified single-user accounts and Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 deliver compliant, scalable blockchain solutions for large projects. However, institutional players face a fundamental challenge: aligning blockchain's transformative promise with TradFi's relentless demand for speed and reliability. As titans like Nasdaq, CME Group, and ICE explore blockchain integration, they confront a staggering benchmark\u2014traditional financial networks routinely process upwards of 65,000 transactions per second during peak times, a volume that would overwhelm most blockchain systems. While Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon have delivered incremental speed boosts and reduced costs, these fixes simply can't scale to meet the colossal throughput and near-instant finality demanded by modern institutional finance. This staggering performance pressure has sparked a new wave of foundational innovation. Rather than merely patching existing systems, emerging Layer 1 solutions are reengineering the blockchain's very core to tackle scalability and efficiency at an enterprise level. Among these, DevvE integrates enterprise compliance frameworks with Web2 functionality through RESTful APIs. Backed by global patents and a non-custodial instant settlement exchange, DevvE enables real-world asset tokenization with excellent scalability and lightning-fast L1 transaction speeds. Will Stewart, a veteran in global finance, recently joined DevvDigital\u2019s Board to drive institutional adoption, reinforcing DevvE\u2019s position as a key player in financial evolution. With scalability solutions maturing, attention has shifted to perhaps the most transformative application of blockchain in traditional finance: asset tokenization. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is blockchain\u2019s most promising institutional use case. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and UBS are exploring tokenization, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have already run controlled pilots testing digital representations of bonds and private equity. Early security token pioneers like Polymath and Harbor proved feasibility but lacked mass adoption. Today, platforms like Securitize, tZERO, and Templum have taken the lead, effectively bridging traditional finance with blockchain. As tokenization gains traction, AI-driven compliance is emerging as a competitive edge. Rexas Finance is leveraging this approach, allowing users to tokenize a wide range of assets, from real estate to intellectual property, while ensuring automated compliance and global trading capabilities. With $45M+ raised and 47,000+ holders, Rexas provides a secure, scalable infrastructure that streamlines asset management for both institutional and retail investors. Seamless multi-chain integration enables fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions, making asset tokenization more accessible. Moving forward, successful platforms will be those that balance blockchain\u2019s limitless potential with institutional finance\u2019s practical requirements. With DeFi platforms projected to reach a $100 billion valuation, the transformation isn\u2019t theoretical\u2014it\u2019s happening now. While blockchain promises to revolutionize finance, its journey is fraught with significant risks. The $165 million ASX blockchain upgrade failure in 2022 starkly reminds us that even the most well-funded projects can stumble. But it's not just about failed implementations \u2013 the stakes are exponentially higher when it comes to security. Picture a smart contract flaw that could instantly freeze millions in assets or a private key breach that makes traditional password hacks look like child's play. This is why financial giants aren't rushing headlong into the blockchain future. Instead, they're adopting what insiders call a \"walk-before-run\" strategy: JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs maintain their battle-tested legacy systems alongside blockchain pilots, while BNY Mellon is investing heavily in blockchain forensics. Their message is clear: in the race to transform finance, security isn't just another checkbox \u2013 it's the foundation upon which everything else builds. Global financial institutions are already committing billions to blockchain integration. The next phase will bring standardization, deeper integration, and hybrid financial models that blend traditional and blockchain infrastructure. By accelerating settlement speeds and eliminating inefficiencies, blockchain isn't just upgrading financial systems\u2014it's fundamentally reimagining them for the digital age.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Ref 1518 in stainless-steel It was 1941, when the entirety of the world was at war, that Patek Philippe had other plans and instead embarked on producing reference 1518, one of the most complicated wristwatches of its time. Inspired by the likes of a unique ref 130 with simple calendar, the 1518 began the lineage of serially produced perpetual calendar chronograph wristwacthes, which have since grown to become Pateks most important and complicated non chiming line. The 1518 was produced primarily in yellow gold but also in fewer numbers in pink gold. Four examples were also produced in stainless-steel, and these are some of the most collectable watches that ever left Patek Philippe in Geneva. One of these four is now up for private sale through Monaco Legend Group at the hands of none other than vintage legend Davide Parmegiani. Ref 1518 in stainless-steel Parmegiani is one of if not the most important vintage watch dealers and has had the pleasure of selling all four of the steel 1518s at least once in his lifetime. This now marks the second time he has been given the privilege to sell this particular example, baring case number 508,475 and movement number 863,196. Along with another similar example baring case number 508,473 and movement number 863,193 which sold at Phillips in 2016 for over $12 Million, this is possibly the finest of them all. Produced in 1943, the extract from the archives states that it was sold three years later on July the 29th 1946, probably for a retail price in the region of $2,500. The extract also states that the watch was delivered with a dial featuring raised gold indexes and more importantly a steel bracelet. The provenance is unmatched. Patek Philippe Extract from the Archives for the present 1518, stating its production in 1943 and ... [+] subsequent sale on July 29th 1946 with the presence of a matching steel bracelet. In 1989 the watch was consigned at the Orion auction by Italian businessman Gerolamo Etro, fetching an impressive $ 281,600. A serious amount of money for a watch back then, probably the equivalent of around $700,000 in todays money, which makes it sound rather modest indeed when you hear the asking price at the bottom of this article. The Orion auction catalogue from 1989 featuring the present 1518, in this image on a leather strap. Six years later in 1995, the watch was consigned to Antiquorum by Swiss collector Ernst Schuster, where it featured on the front cover of the catalogue accompanied by two single button chronograph wristwatches and the only white gold example of the ref 2523. The 1518 and one of the single button chronographs were the only two which didn\u2019t end up in the Patek Philippe Museum later on. However, the watch actually went unsold, along with all three of the other watches on the cover. In fact, a whole lot of treasures went unsold in this particular auction, including two other examples of the ref 1518. The cover of the Antiquorum catalogue from 1995 featuring the present 1518 in good company on the ... [+] right. On the left sit two single button chronographs from the 1920s and 1930s respectively, as well as a white gold 2523. After this unsuccessful appearance, Dr. Crott purchased the watch and then sold it to a german collector for $531,869. It was in 2004 that Davide Parmegiani purchased the watch from this mystery collector for $1.1 Million, and this was the first time he had the pleasure of dealing with it. Naturally he included it in his book \u2018The Collection\u2019, all about the most impressive pieces he had handled over the years. Well this now marks the at least the fifth time that Davide Parmegiani has had the pleasure of selling a steel 1518, and the second time he finds himself selling this particular example. It is undeniably one of the most important and collectable Patek Philippes that remains in the hands of private collectors and outside of the Patek Philippe Museum. For the juicy part you\u2019ve probably been waiting for, the watch is welcoming offers in excess of $20 million. For more information visit the Monaco Legend Group Site.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Kiev, Ukraine - December 03, 2017 : Bitcoin coin and mound of gold nuggets bitcoin cryptocurrency When it comes to bitcoin versus gold, gold is the senior market. Bitcoin is not digital gold, it has different use cases. However, there is a similarity between the two assets. While my bitcoin socks got a great reaction when I was walking around LEAP 2025 in Riyadh, they do not have the same impact as wearing a gold Vacheron Constantine watch, seeing a building coated in gold leaf or eating a steak coated in gold at Salt Bae\u2019s restaurant in Dubai. Gold is embedded in our DNA through eons of natural selection, a fact still evident today in the bars and night clubs of Monaco. Bitcoin is better suited as flight capital for the fleeing rich, and we can imagine plenty of villains bailing out of their dire situations with crypto rather than unwieldy and insufficient stacks of cash and gold. However, crypto is not a great store of wealth. Sorry, believers \u2013 Bitcoin is not secure. There is no such thing as a cold wallet, or at least not one at absolute zero. Fort Knox is more secure than Satoshi\u2019s wallet. It is frustrating that hardly a day goes by without supposedly \u2018secure\u2019 crypto proving as vulnerable as a gold Rolex at 1 a.m. in a red-light district. This is one of several current crypto weaknesses which mean that bitcoin can never replace gold, or for that matter replace fiat currency. But let\u2019s forget all the bitcoin maxi versus old geezer gold vs bitcoin debate and let\u2019s look at the current situation. Bitcoin is in an equilibrium. That equilibrium has a lot of noise in it, as you would expect, but it is clear that for now it\u2019s going nowhere. However, when it eventually moves, it will move significantly \u2013 either up or down: The bitcoin chart is in an equilibrium and could breakout either way That may sound obvious, but for a trader, it\u2019s critical. A breakout will come, and traders will jump on board for the ride. Before a breakout \u2013 barring unexpected developments \u2013 the trading range typically compresses as the market makes up its mind. When volatility drops to a low level, you get the break out. This pattern has repeated in past Bitcoin rallies, and I\u2019ve used it to predict breakouts. There will likely be a rerun of this pattern \u2013 unless an unforeseen event comes out of the blue to disrupt the trend. To me the current setup is not bullish, it appears finely balanced. However, the bubble in crypto AI tokens, which boomed and died, is not a good omen for more crypto joy because historically that kind of froth signalled the end of the run. But it\u2019s not the time to give up yet \u2013 the way to go is to watch and wait. Gold, on the other hand, is an entirely different story: The gold chart shows a classic boom pattern The chart shows a classic boom chart pattern, complete with a ballistic curve. At this moment, gold is surging, while Bitcoin remains range-bound and volatile. Gold is for war while bitcoin is for flight. The former may of course come before the latter and they both could boom. But that\u2019s just speculation. The key is to trade based on what you see, not what you think. And right now, the charts show that gold is the cool kid on the block, while crypto looks tired. To me, there is no existential conflict between gold and crypto. They are both assets denominated in dollars, not the other way around. However, only gold looks like a strong one-way bet. Remember, a chart reflects what has already happened, and where gold trades today is probably an early warning of the kick in the pants the U.S. delivered to Europe this week. If this U.S. stance is strategic \u2013 and after all it should be \u2013 then gold will run and run. Gold is for war.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the press before signing an executive order in the Oval Office ... [+] of the White House on Friday February 14, 2025.   (Photo: Demetrius Freeman) U.S. president Donald Trump\u2019s threats of slapping trade tariffs on major international partners, imposing additional sanctions on Iran, and raising the prospect of bypassing Europe to settle the Russia-Ukraine war directly with Moscow continue to hang over the global oil market. The Brent front-month crude oil contract traded within a range of $74.19 to $75.35 per barrel on Monday, having opened in the U.S. at $74.67 per barrel, while the West Texas Intermediate traded within a range of $70.12 to $71.40 per barrel, having opened at $70.70 per barrel. Both benchmarks hardly moved last week as well, with the president\u2019s words and actions having created a fair bit of uncertainty, accompanied by pretty cagey trading both in Europe and Asia. A settlement of the Russia-Ukraine war, no matter how half-baked, will likely be price negative for crude oil trading, with an expectation of additional Russian barrels coming on to the market in a post-war setting. Similarly, an escalation of international trade wars on account of tariffs imposed by the White House on key global trading partners and their subsequent response, will also be price negative, with connotations of depressed demand due to lower economic activity. Meanwhile, additional sanctions on Iran may be deemed as price positive if they are seen to hurt Tehran\u2019s capabilities to get its crude off to the market, with China being the Islamic Republic\u2019s main reported buyer of crude. The market is therefore searching for much need directional clarity, which, so far, has evaded it. That\u2019s after oil prices hit a three-month high on January 10 with Brent touching $80. The rally proved to be short-lived because the wider market fundamentals remain weak alongside anything else the U.S. president may or may not say or do. For starters, the consensus, including among Chinese commentators, is that China's demand may plateau before the end of the decade. As such, this will likely be a blow for the global crude market because China accounted for 50% of global oil demand growth between 2000 and 2023. That is bang on averaging an annual increase of 518,000 barrels per day, according to the Energy Institute\u2019s 2024 Statistical Review of World Energy. Such a performance is unlikely to be repeated by China over the next 12 months (and perhaps going forward). Meanwhile, non-OPEC supply is largely expected to rise over the corresponding period. According to the International Energy Agency, non-OPEC+ producers remain on track to increase their output by about 1.5 million bpd in 2025, led by the U.S., Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Argentina. Downward pressure on oil prices may also persist courtesy of a relatively stronger dollar. The Dollar Index rose last month to 108.92 to its highest levels since October 2022. It has since retreated to a level of just above 106. A stronger dollar makes buying oil relatively dearer for non-U.S. importers, with the greenback being the preferred currency of the global commodity market. This lends further bearish weight that is already proving hard for global oil markets to lose, regardless of any action Donald Trump may take over the coming weeks.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Update, Monday Feb 17, 2025: This article has been updated with potential pricing details on the iPhone SE. Apple CEO Tim Cook stands next Sofia Leyva at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store (Photo by Alexi ... [+] Rosenfeld\/Getty Images) This week, we should see the launch of the new iPhone SE. As Apple returns to the mid-range market for the first time since 2022, what impact will the smallest and cheapest iPhone have on the rapidly changing smartphone world? First of all, the iPhone SE needs to change the iPhone. Apple saw its global market share in the smartphone market fall by five percent in the last quarter of 2024. Given this is directly after the launch of the iPhone 16 family, Tim Cook and his team will have been expecting more from the first iPhones designed for Apple Intelligence. The iPhone SE is a chance for Apple to boost sales across the iPhone range in 2025. It is a mid-range handset with a brand reputation that focuses on matching the power of the leading iPhone line but at a cheaper price. That makes the iPhone SE an attractive starting point for someone joining the ecosystem or looking to bring a relative into Apple\u2019s world. While the iPhone SE may not be as big a seller as the main line, as the first new iPhone in the mid-range since 2022 it can bring a new demographic to the iPhone. Yet the practical switching costs are high, especially if a user is heavily invested in an app ecosystem or a specific cloud-based service. Android handsets in the expected price range do not have a performance deficit to the main iPhones, let alone the iPhone SE. If performance is no longer a differentiator, if the price is no longer a deciding factor in the purchase, and the switching costs are too high, Apple will need to change the conversation in the market to move the iPhone SE away from \u201cfor the faithful and their friends\u201d to \u201cthe first choice of everyone at this price point.\" A young woman walks past an Apple Store on March 25, 2024 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Sean ... [+] Gallup\/Getty Images) Update, Monday Feb 17, 2025: Reports from Chinese retail stores suggest the retail price of the iPhone SE will be at the high end of the range, with the entry-level priced at $499. While the specs listed show the expected and welcome update to 8 GB of memory, it also lists the storage of the iPhone SE as 64 GB. That\u2019s half the storage of the iPhone 16 and will help create options for Apple staff to upsell to either more storage on a new SE or the larger iPhone 16. With 64 GB, Apple\u2019s core files will take up nearly a third of the iPhone\u2019s storage. iOS needs around 17 GB of storage for the code and the first-party app, and Apple Intelligence needs a further 7 GB, leaving 40 GB of storage for your apps, data, music, video, and photos. That\u2019s not much, given modern file sizes. Those buying the cheapest $499 model will have to be economical with their storage. No doubt Apple would prefer to advertise the $499 price but push people to the presumed $599 model with a more usable storage level. The iPhone SE is expected to be priced between $479 and $499 for the entry-level model (depending on Apple\u2019s storage choice). Android has the run of the market that sits in this $450-$550 price range, with Google\u2019s launch of the Pixel 6a in the summer of 2022, a few months after the then-current iPhone SE 2022 model, leading the charge. The competitive nature of the space has seen significant advances in all areas. Many handsets come with flagship-leading chipsets, multi-lens cameras, fast refreshing displays, long battery life, and the latest software advances. Yet every Android manufacturer follows the same path. Where is the disruptor that can stand up and say there is a different way of thinking about this price point? That would be the iPhone SE. Putting the numbers in a straight head-to-head with the Android competition, the iPhone SE will lose in each category. Yet Apple has rarely sold any of its hardware purely on price or value for money. It has offered something different, be it in a philosophical approach to design, practical choices over connectivity, and fanatically addressing security concerns. Android manufacturers cannot ignore Apple's decisions with the iPhone SE hardware. With the tight integration of iOS and the hardware, Apple can offer more stability to end users with an extended support window. The iOS user interface remains stripped back, with almost no options to customise away from Apple\u2019s solitary vision. And Apple\u2019s fanatical and public focus on security can change the conversation in ways no other manufacturer can. The iPhone SE will get a lot of attention over the next few months because it is the latest iPhone and due to every mid-range Android smartphone needing to be compared to something different\u2026 which will be the iPhone SE. The name and capability recognition of the SE is going to be significant. How the likes of Google, Samsung, Honor, OnePlus and others address these differences will change the market. Whether it consolidates around Android's view or Apple\u2019s view remains to be seen. AI techniques have been used across the smartphone and mobile computing market for decades. The introduction of generative AI techniques to process large data sets to effect change in the user experience is a fundamental change in what a smartphone can deliver. Since Google launched the Pixel 8 series as the first AI smartphones in 2023, there have been rapid advances in the quality of options available for consumers and the quantity of software choices on offer. Can Apple step into the market and impose its view on how things should be done? It is perhaps too late for a wholesale change to happen in the market. Apple is late to this market, only announcing its plans in June 2024 at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The awkwardly backronymed Apple intelligence debuted one month after the launch of the iPhone 16, and the first generation software suite is not expected to be complete until the launch of iOS 18.4 in late March 2024. The majority of Android manufacturers are rolling out completed second-generation AI software on their latest smartphones. Apple is late to the party with an inferior product. So, how can Apple use both the iPhone SE and Apple Intelligence to impact the direction of generative AI? Apple\u2019s approach to AI makes a fundamentally different choice to Android, prioritising local processing data. Android has a broader remit driven by the capability of cloud-based servers for more intense calculations and a wider range of apps and services. It will be easier for Apple to change track and expand into the cloud if needed in the future. Still, if the conversation can be driven to focus on personal data not leaving a phone, the Android manufacturers will need to consider making similar choices around local processing. Apple must also decide if staying with a smaller on-device only approach will leave it behind. Currently, there are areas where Apple has ceded the functionality to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT service (and by endorsing ChatGPT, it gives OpenAI a clear victory against other AI providers, solidifying its place in the market). As generative AI's scope and power increase, smartphones will need to improve their capability to deliver. Yet the iPhone SE\u2014assuming it follows previous models\u2014will likely stay on sale for many years without any hardware upgrades. As AI expands, Apple may find that the most significant impact of the iPhone SE will be on itself. As the specs are superseded, Apple may be forced to move more in-demand AI features into the cloud to allow its mid-range phone to stay relevant. The iPhone SE is a series of small steps that may not add up to much individually. But small steps can take Apple great distances. Apple will be hoping that it can bring the market closer to Apple\u2019s ideals and, in turn, bring more customers to Apple over the next few years. There is also a danger that pushing to make the iPhone SE relevant over the next few years could drag Apple closer to the current market and weaken its unique offering. The iPhone SE is going to change the smartphone market. The question is in which direction? Now read about the three new features that will help the iPhone SE stand out to consumers...

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The Bank of Japan is on course to finish offloading millions of dollars of stocks that it bought from beleaguered banks during the financial crisis two decades ago sooner than scheduled, a development that throws into focus the fate of its considerably larger holdings of exchange-traded funds. The book value of share holdings acquired by the BOJ stood at \u00a552.8 billion ($345 million) as of Feb. 10, according to the latest BOJ report on its account. Considering the pace of its monthly selling has consistently been about \u00a510 billion over the past few years, the central bank could dispose of all the remaining assets in about five months. The bank said in 2015 it would finish selling down these shares by March 2026. It\u2019s a key consideration for investors. Many BOJ watchers are of the view that authorities wouldn\u2019t likely sell the assets purchased from banks and ETFs simultaneously over concerns of potential market ructions. An early finish to the bank stock operations raises the possibility that the BOJ may telegraph its intention to sell ETFs by kicking off discussions with market participants on the process as early as this year.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Scalpers will be left high and dry if this stock forecast pans out  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5090 may be extremely thin on the ground right now \u2013 you\u2019d be lucky to find one still (note that our guide on where to buy the GPU could help in that quest) \u2013 but maybe you should wait anyway, because if a new rumor pans out, this won\u2019t be the case for much longer. The supply of RTX5090 will be stupidly high soon. Scalpers will cry so hard\ud83d\ude02February 15, 2025 MEGAsizeGPU is a regular contributor to the hardware rumor scene on X and claims to have knowledge of Nvidia\u2019s GB202 supply. Those are the chips used in the RTX 5090, and apparently graphics card makers are getting \u201ctons\u201d of supply of GB202 (complemented with the necessary VRAM, so there\u2019s no chance waiting for GDDR7 video memory is going to hold up production, either). That\u2019ll mean they will be able to make a lot more RTX 5090 graphics cards, of course, to sell into retail channels. This apparent surge in supply \u2013 add your own seasoning \u2013 won\u2019t come through to shelves immediately, though, because as noted, the boards still need to be manufactured and distributed. Therefore, MEGAsizeGPU guesses that we will start to see a lot more RTX 5090 GPUs available to buy in \u201cabout one month\u201d or so, and this is caveated as a guess, I should stress.  A month sounds on the optimistic side, but if this is true, there\u2019ll be an increase in supply soon enough, and it won\u2019t be too long before the shelves are potentially stuffed with RTX 5090 GPUs. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I say that they\u2019ll be stuffed because what we must remember about the Blackwell flagship is that it\u2019s a very niche proposition. Indeed, given the price hike with the MSRP over the RTX 4090, the RTX 5090 is even more of an out-of-reach enthusiast graphics card, so the audience for this particular GPU is pretty narrow, frankly. A sudden surge in supply as predicted will probably mean that there are RTX 5090 models sat at shelves, finally, and hopefully prices will therefore normalize more, back towards the MSRP. So, if you were at all tempted to buy an RTX 5090 at the higher prices some retailers are charging, or indeed a resold GPU on an auction site, the clear advice here is: sit tight. It certainly seems worth waiting, as we should see the results of this apparent move from Nvidia coming through soon enough (and I\u2019m betting more rumors will soon flag this as being correct, if it really is true). As MEGAsizeGPU points out, the \u201cscalpers will cry so hard\u201d and that might teach folks a lesson that price gouging new hardware, especially seriously expensive goods, may not be a wise course of action, and it doesn\u2019t come without risks. On a broader note, this is the first glint of an optimistic forecast for Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPUs that we\u2019ve had since they were launched (it\u2019s been a whole lot of doom and gloom otherwise). Nothing is mentioned about the RTX 5080 by the leaker, but still, we can hope that if GB202 supply is getting better, perhaps other chips (GB203, and GB205, the latter being the engine of the RTX 5070) are perhaps due for an uptick too, and maybe more of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5000 graphics cards will see healthier stock levels. That said, VideoCardz, which noticed the above post on X, also points out that what some retailers appear to be doing is heavily favoring pre-built PCs with new Blackwell GPUs, rather than selling them as standalone products. Regardless, if a lot of RTX 5090 stock is coming through, there should not be an availability problem before too long.

Now, WA Labor has promised to implement a scheme to encourage big developers to invest in build-to-rent projects if re-elected. WA's housing crisis has become a major issue in the state election campaign. (ABC News: Glyn Jones) The state government says the plan will help grow the Perth rental market, with the city last year crowned the least affordable for renters in the country.\u00a0 But just how much of a difference will build-to-rent incentives really make? Much as the name suggests, build-to-rent projects are purpose-built for the long-term rental market. They are typically large apartment complexes developed by private capital or super funds, with only two such developments currently operational in Perth. Construction is well underway on the UniLodge Perth Central development, a build-to-rent initiative.\u00a0 (ABC News: Keane Bourke) This is in comparison to traditional apartment complexes, which do not typically have a single owner. Build-to-rent projects can be quicker to get up and running, as there is no need to sell off all, or a portion, of units in a plan before work begins. Ongoing maintenance could also be made easier, due to all works going through a single owner instead of a body corporate or strata management. Under the plan proposed by the state government, WA would establish a $75 million 'Build to Rent Kickstart Fund' to entice investors. This Perth high-rise apartment block under constriction is a build-to-rent initiative.\u00a0 (ABC News: Keane Bourke) The fund would provide low-cost finance of up to $250,000 per apartment for build-to rent-projects, including no-interest loans during construction and low-interest loans once the development is up and running. On top of this, land tax concessions would increase to 75 per cent on build-to-rent projects with more than 40 dwellings starting in the next three years. \"These two initiatives will put WA at the front of the pack to attract new build-to-rent projects.\" Premier Roger Cook said. WA Premier Roger Cook spruiked the development at a media event in Perth on Monday.\u00a0 (ABC News: Keane Bourke) The fund is expected to produce about 400 long term rental homes, Associate professor in urban planning at the University of Queensland Dorina Pojani said build-to-rent had an important role to play in improving access to affordable housing. \"Some people in Australia will never be able to afford to buy. There will be some people who will rent forever,\" she said. \"We think of ourselves as a nation of homeowners, but we are not.\u00a0 \"We have lots of tenants, and we need to help those make sure that they can stay in the accommodation they currently have.\" Dorina Pojani says Australia is no longer a nation of homeowners.\u00a0 (Supplied) Dr Pojani said one thing to remember was increasing the supply of rental accommodation did not necessarily mean the price of rentals would drop where those properties were built. With the state election now just three weeks away, the housing crisis is weighing heavy on the minds of regional voters across the state. \"What an increase in supply does is it helps decrease the prices across the region once there has been a new rebalancing of the region,\" she said. \"One would need to increase the supply of new rental units within the same suburb by a whole lot before people can see prices come down right in that suburb.\" Professor of housing and research policy at the University of New South Wales Hal Pawson agreed the policy would make WA desirable for build-to-rent investors. But he said the scheme was not a \"silver bullet\" for the housing crisis. \"If you introduce new land tax tomorrow, then the impacts of that could feed through in two, three, four years \u2026 it's not an instant hit by any means,\" he said. Professor Hal Pawson says the initiative won't be a quick fix for WA's housing woes.\u00a0 (ABC News: Tony Ibrahim) Professor Pawson said build-to-rent developments were typically more resilient to market cycles, meaning their contribution to the housing market could be felt in the medium or long term. \"The more we can restructure the housing market to contain a larger fraction of a market resilient product like build-to-rent, that's beneficial for the economy overall,\" he said. Housing is expected to be a key issue in the 2025 WA election, but experts say neither party's promises will make much difference to those struggling to get a foothold in the market. Build-to-rent has been adopted more widely in places like United Kingdom, but Professor Pawson said this had not happened overnight. \"Until around about 2012, build-to-rent hardly existed at all in the UK,\" he said. \"Since then, it has taken off in a really significant way, and there's more than 200,000 units now of purpose-built rental housing in the UK. \"There is a recent example of a sector that has gone from almost nothing in a market which previously was almost entirely dominated by mum and dad landlords, just like ours, to being a significant part of the rental market.\" Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute managing director Michael Fotheringham said institutional ownership accounted for less than one per cent of the rental supply in the country. \"By contrast, more than 70 per cent of the rental supply is owned by small-scale investors, your so-called mum and dad investors, who own just one investment property,\" he said. Michael Fotheringham says there is an aversion to high-rise accommodation in Australia.\u00a0 (ABC News: Patrick Rocca) Dr Fotheringham said build-to-rent was far more prevalent overseas due in part to Australia's aversion to high-rise accommodation. \"We build less apartments and more freestanding houses than most other parts of the world,\" he said. \"Freestanding houses outnumber apartments six to one in terms of new constructions.\" A handful of the developments are scattered across Australia's east coast, but Dr Fotherington said most were marketed as premium housing instead of an affordable living solution. \"Governments have talked for a number of years about build-to-rent as a means of generating affordable supply, but in the absence of subsidy or planning rules that require affordable supply within the development, often that hasn't actually materialised,\" he said. To combat that, WA Labor's proposal would require developments benefiting from the Kickstart Fund to reserve 30 per cent of homes as \"affordable rentals\".\u00a0 The rent on those properties would not be allowed to exceed 25 per cent of a tenant's income.\u00a0 The state government also acknowledges build-to-rent alone would not fix WA's housing crisis. Housing Minister John Carey said the fact Perth's rental vacancy rate has doubled over the past 12 months to 1.9 per cent \u00ad\u00ad\u2014 which is still outside the 2.5 to 3.5 per cent considered typical for a balanced market \u2014 points to the success of the government's investment in housing. \"Our incentive to bring back AirBnb into the housing market, plus bringing back vacant homes, has also brought back more than 400 homes,\" he said WA Labor is also promising $79.5 million to boost social housing delivery to an additional 1,000 homes each year if re-elected. Opposition housing spokesperson Steve Martin said the Liberals had \"better policy\" than Labor, including hundreds of millions of dollars to fund so-called 'enabling infrastructure' like power and water connections.\u00a0 Topic:Interest Rates Analysis by Jacob Greber Analysis by Michael Janda Topic:Race Relations Topic:Courts Topic:Housing Policy Topic:Homelessness Analysis by Keane Bourke Topic:Housing Policy Cost of Living Elections Homelessness Housing Policy Perth State and Territory Elections State and Territory Government WA Topic:Interest Rates Analysis by Jacob Greber Analysis by Michael Janda Topic:Race Relations Topic:Courts Topic:Courts Topic:Land Clearing Topic:Courts Topic:Sexual Offences We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":" Thanks to its affordability and ease of production, plastic has pretty much made its way into every aspect of modern life. That\u2019s not just limited to consumer electronics, furniture, or tableware, but even medicine and supplements all use this material. According to a 2019 study, there will have been over 9 million plastic pill bottles in the market by now, and many of these end up in landfills rather than recycled properly. The trend these days in packaging is to substitute plastic with more sustainable materials, whether it\u2019s recycled plastic or paper. That\u2019s a bit harder to do in the medical field, which has stricter requirements than simply replacing plastic. Fortunately, it seems that the wait is finally over and the industry\u2019s first sustainable prescription pill bottle made with 100% recyclable paper. Designer: Parcel Health        Like with every bit of plastic, those iconic orange pill bottles look harmless, even though their contents may or may not be. While some have their prescriptions refilled using the same bottle, most others simply throw away theirs once they\u2019re done. That\u2019s especially true for supplements and pills that don\u2019t get refilled but still come in plastic bottles.        Tully Tubes are trying to prove that there is no reason for this status quo to remain. Made from 100% sustainably sourced paper, the cylindrical bottles are certified by the US FDA, among other agencies, for use in food and medicine packaging. That said, not all of the bottle is made of paper. The child-resistant cap is still made from plastic, but at least uses post-consumer recycled plastic to offset the environmental impact.  Of course, you can\u2019t just have a paper bottle and call it a day, and this design takes a few more steps to make it appropriate for this particular use. It is, for example, resistant to water, humidity, and heat, thanks to a three-layer construction. It is covered with a food-safe and compostable coating to protect it from water and the elements as well. And when it\u2019s time to throw it away, a proprietary pull tab lets you separate the paper and plastic parts so you can safely compost the bottle itself while the cap gets sent to a recycling plant.   While such a revolutionary sustainable pill bottle complies with pharmaceutical requirements, it also opens up opportunities that regular plastic bottles don\u2019t offer.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"The latest report on Apple\u2019s plans for a larger iMac suggest that the company may still be missing something. Apple did something almost unprecedented back in 2023 when it specifically confirmed there was no new 27-inch iMac on the way, but it did leave the door open for a larger iMac \u2013 perhaps something with a 32-inch screen. But a report from Mark Gurman yesterday threw something of a spanner in the works \u2026 Apple is famously secretive about its plans for future products, dating back to a strongly held belief by co-founder Steve Jobs. Steve argued that there was a magic to a surprise announcement which would be lost or diluted if the company revealed its plans ahead of time. Tech writers know there\u2019s no point asking Apple to comment on any product rumors, but you do get the occasional optimistic analyst raising questions in earnings reports. Apple always responds the same way, with a statement that it doesn\u2019t comment on reports of unannounced products, on its product roadmaps, on its future plans, or similar. Back in November 2023, however, there was a very rare exception. Asked about the fact that it hadn\u2019t launched an Apple Silicon version of the 27-inch iMac, the company said that it wouldn\u2019t be doing so. As we noted at the time, that didn\u2019t mean it was ruling out a larger iMac than the 24-inch model. We\u2019ve been arguing for years that it was time for an iMac with a larger screen than 27 inches. It\u2019s not 2009 anymore. We now live in a world where 34-inch monitors are commonplace, 40-inch ones are not unusual \u2013 and there are even 49-inch models around. Alongside these, the iMac display, impressive as it is in terms of resolution, looks cramped. and Today, 27-inch monitors are very commonly used in dual and triple monitor setups, rather than on their own. Of course, I\u2019ve also argued that a larger iMac could be considered redundant. If you want a large-screen Mac, you can buy an Apple Silicon Mac mini and the monitor of your choice. The Mac is small enough to even attach to the back of the monitor. But 27-inch iMac owners in the comments were quick to disagree. In what world is \u201cStick it behind the display, and you never even have to see it\u201d the Apple way? Have we lowered our standards to the point where we\u2019re willing to accept moving backwards from a single box that does everything? From similar comments there and elsewhere, it became clear that there are plenty of people who don\u2019t want to compromise on the all-in-one form factor. And a report from Mark Gurman over the weekend seemed to offer hope. It wasn\u2019t exactly Gurman\u2019s most definitive statement to begin with: Apple also will probably\u00a0eventually get around to offering a larger-screen iMac. The update that I would like to see: 30 inch iMac with the same microprocessor and memory options as a MacBook Pro.  I am still using my 27 inch iMac. Several associates are also using five to ten year old 27 inch iMacs. Why? The large screen iMac is the perfect executive computer. It has a nice sleek, clean appearance and fits nicely on a desk. There isn't a bunch of cables messing up the desk or inviting someone to trip on. Part of the magic of Apple is esthetics. The Mac mini is not about esthetics - it is all about a box you can toss somewhere. I left Dell because I liked Apple\u2019s large screen all in one iMac.  The Mac Studio or Mac mini with a Studio display is overpriced and is the wrong form factor for me. By eliminating the large screen iMac Apple has killed my reason for buying a second computer.  If I am going to be stuck with a box and cables, I will just use my existing Macbook Pro 16 and have the same mess of cables as a Mac Mini or Mac studio.  For some a basic 24 inch iMac is fine. Unfortunately, Apple Silicon hasn\u2019t been good to me. The larger screen iMac may not be a hot seller but I know several individuals who have yet to switch to Apple silicon because they like their large screen iMacs. Probably and eventually are not encouraging words for those waiting impatiently to upgrade. But when we put that line in context, it gets even less reassuring: The company remains\u00a0interested in the professional market, though, and it\u2019s\u00a0planning new\u00a0Mac Pro and Mac Studio models.\u00a0Apple also will probably\u00a0eventually get around to offering a larger-screen iMac. The implication here is that Apple sees a larger iMac as a professional product, pointing to a future iMac Pro with a bigger screen. What\u2019s missing here is anything about a bigger consumer-level iMac. And that\u2019s what many seem to want. Right now, if I were an Intel 27-inch iMac owner who\u2019s been waiting to upgrade to an Apple Silicon model, and isn\u2019t interested in downgrading to a 24-inch screen, I\u2019d be feeling pretty depressed.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"A new report suggests that Apple and Meta could end up competing in the humanoid robots field. The social media company is said to be making \u201csignificant investment\u201d in this product category, with a focus on household chores. But if Apple does proceed with its own reported domestic robot plans, the Cupertino company could have a huge advantage \u2026 Say the word \u2018robot\u2019 to most people and they immediately think of a sci-fi humanoid robot able to perform domestic chores \u2013 a kind of robobutler.  Apple is already rumored to be working on this type of device. Bloomberg last year described this as a \u201cskunk-works project,\u201d a name given to something worked on by a small team of people acting largely on their own initiative, and quite distinct from the company\u2019s main product development roadmap. I expressed my view at the time that this is a decade or more away, if Apple even goes forward with it. Indeed, a report last week suggested that we may be waiting several years just for a relatively simple table-top robot, despite the revelation of that cute table lamp. Bloomberg reports that Meta has developed a strong interest in AI-powered humanoid robots, seeing this as a key focus. Meta has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.\u00a0The company is making a significant investment into the category \u2014 futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks\u00a0[\u2026] Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores [and] has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc [\u2026] Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday. Interestingly, it suggests that the first robot may not have Meta branding; the company is more interested in providing the AI smarts for hardware built by other brands. However, it says that we may see Meta-branded robots further down the line. While I still see truly capable domestic robots as a long-term bet, if there\u2019s one thing likely to accelerate the timeline it\u2019s multiple companies competing in the same area. Perhaps Meta\u2019s jump into this field might see Apple\u2019s humanoid robot project promoted from hobby to something more mainstream within the company. So far, autonomous robots have been geared to commercial use. This includes Boston Dynamics\u2019 dog-like Spot, designed for patrol and inspection duties, and looking like something straight out of a terrifying dystopian SF movie in which packs of these device hunt down humans. But the company does have the humanoid Atlas model in development, pitched at warehouse and manufacturing duties. I'd never buy a Tesla robot, if it's like the rest of their product range the build quality would be awful, the software only half finished and the rest coming in a future update. It would be like all tesla products, a good talk for the investors and consumers waiting years for features promised year on year and never arriving.  The idea of a robot giving the nazi salute as I get home would put me off too. The transition to domestic work is likely to take significantly longer simply because of the very different price points consumer robots have to hit. Tesla is working on a model it expects to cost $30,000, which is a very niche market even if the real price doesn\u2019t end up being inflated in the usual Tesla-esque way.  Having a humanoid robot in your home is going to be a pretty scary prospect for many, not least because it could feel almost as intrusive as having a stranger in your home \u2013 a stranger equipped with multiple cameras. Apple\u2019s privacy focus and reputation could turn out to be a very big advantage. Photo by\u00a0Alex Knight\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":" Entrepreneurs Create Jobs and Wealth for US Society and Bureaucrats Create Wealth Destruction As the political landscape shifts with a Trump-Musk administration, one of the most immediate and profound impacts will be a reduction in government waste. With billions in governmental inefficiencies expected to be curtailed, the ripple effects will extend beyond budget savings to job losses, particularly in government and social services. Given that government and social services have been two of the largest job growth sectors in the past five years, this shift raises an urgent question: Where will the new jobs come from? The U.S. labor market has long relied on private-sector innovation to drive job creation, particularly in the entrepreneurial sector. Over the past year, the S&P 500, representing approximately 28.3 million jobs, has experienced a net job loss of 48,000. However, within this group, a subset of 45 entrepreneurial companies created 64,000 jobs, meaning that the remaining 455 companies collectively shed 122,000 jobs. This trend underscores a crucial reality: Without the growth driven by entrepreneurial companies, job losses in large, established firms would be even more pronounced. Further complicating the employment landscape is the ongoing trend of job outsourcing. Many large corporations, despite reporting employment growth, are expanding their workforces overseas rather than within the United States. Take Accenture, for example. The consulting giant, once a U.S.-based firm and now headquartered in Ireland, has expanded its workforce from 624,000 to 799,000 employees over the past three years. With operations in more than 120 countries, it is likely that few of these new jobs have been created domestically. As outsourcing accelerates, the U.S. faces an increasingly precarious employment outlook unless substantial policy and economic shifts are implemented. The economic data reveals a stark contrast between entrepreneurial firms and their larger, bureaucratic counterparts. Over the past two years: These differences highlight a powerful reality: The backbone of U.S. economic growth lies in entrepreneurial innovation. As government and social service jobs decline, the need for job creation shifts squarely to high-growth, innovative companies. This presents both an economic imperative and an investment opportunity\u2014entrepreneurial companies not only create more jobs but also drive superior revenue, profit, and stock market performance. So how do we support this vital sector? The key lies in ensuring that these high-growth companies have the capital they need to expand. With the new administration poised to champion business-friendly policies\u2014potentially through mechanisms like a sovereign wealth fund\u2014there is a clear opportunity to fuel entrepreneurial expansion. However, waiting for traditional S&P 500 corporations to lead the charge is not a viable strategy. Their bureaucratic structures and slow-growth models suggest they will continue their pattern of stagnation. Ultimately, for America to maintain its competitive edge in the global economy, it must double down on fostering entrepreneurship. Job growth, economic expansion, and investment returns will hinge on supporting these dynamic firms, which have proven time and again that they are the engines of innovation and prosperity.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"People stand next to an entrance of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in the Pudong district in Shanghai ... [+] on June 5, 2024. (Photo by HECTOR RETAMAL \/ AFP) The explosive growth of U.S. tech stocks such as Nvidia in the past year has been a focal point for global stock investors. One long-time U.S. financial industry executive who works with Asian firms thinks new businesses from that part of the world will disproportionately shine in the coming years. \u201cAbout five years ago, when we were talking about Asia economically, we were talking exclusively about China. And I don't believe there's any country that will replace China,\u201d New York-based Marcum Asia Co-CEO Drew Bernstein said in a recent interview with Forbes China. \u201cBut we've seen business in Asia broadening right now to include places like Southeast Asia, specifically Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, and now also Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's no doubt in my mind that at least over the next 10 years, the majority of what I consider to be industry-disruptive unicorns will be coming from Asia,\u201d predicted Bernstein, who is a Forbes.com columnist. \u201cI can't tell you exactly from where they will come from. Certainly, China will have its fair share,\u201d he said. China already had a fair share of IPOs in 2024 \u2013 more than 40, though many were modest. \u201cWhen you peel back the onion a little bit, only two or three raised significant money,\" he said. \"Most of those IPOs were very small and raised $5-15 million. That's mainly friends and family money.\u201d \u201cThe trend has been that if you are a company, have good cash reserves, and are making money, then you are probably sitting on the fence. If you needed money, you went to the markets and took what they offered. And if you didn't, then perhaps six months later, you'd get 50% of that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you saw the rest of the small companies from Asia that did small IPOs,\u201d Bernstein said. They understand the complications and time it takes to go public, so they were willing to earn enough money for maybe two years or so to be public, give themselves the time to execute their business plans and for valuations to come better, and then do second or third rounds.\u201d So, what\u2019s ahead for China, the region\u2019s biggest economy? \u201cI'm an eternal optimist about China. I've been working in China for 25 years right now. Every year over the last 15 years, people have been telling me how the market's about to just dissipate; somehow, my business increases almost every one of those years,\u201d he said. Drew Bernstein. Photographer: Peter Foley\/Bloomberg. Going forward, many companies that received VC funding in 2020 and 2021 \u201care about at the end of that timeline for those investments, where they want to try to achieve liquidity,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, many China PE deals are structured with rachets where management will lose control or be forced to liquidate if they don\u2019t get public within the promised timeframe. The CSRC isn\u2019t approving many listings right now, so they have a gun to their heads.\u201d In addition, SPACs that raised money for mergers and acquisitions involving Chinese businesses will face pressure to complete those plans. \u201cThere's a lot of pressure out there right now that will allow the markets for China (companies) to be beneficial,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThe U.S. markets will allow the Chinese companies to do add-on rounds, meaning that after they go public, they can raise as much as they want. I'm optimistic for those companies right now. And given the election, there's more clarity, at least than before, and more to come.\u201d As for the return of President Trump to the White House and its impact on China business, Bernstein said: \u201cAnybody that thinks they have a road map of Trump 2.0 and China-U.S. relations is delusionary. It'll probably come down to what he had for dinner or breakfast the morning before,\u201d he smiled.   \u201cThat said, on one side of the coin, you have these proposed tariffs,\u201d as well as the rise of Marco Rubio to be Secretary of State. \u201cHe has been one of the fiercest, ferocious China hawks. He's also been one of the principal architects of the opposition against a company like Shein going public in the United States. But I doubt Trump would let him set economic policy towards China.\u201d \u201cOn the flip side of the coin, you have people like Elon Musk, who has invested significantly in China and has appointed himself as Trump's \u2018Chief Buddy.\u2019 Elon has an excellent understanding and respect for China and its technical prowess and value system,\u201d he said. The nomination of Paul Atkins as head of the SEC is another positive signal for asset classes, including small cap IPOs, crypto, and SPACs, that have been subject to heavy scrutiny under Gary Gensler\u2019s leadership. \u201cI would imagine that the SEC policies now will become more hands-off and pro-capital formation towards fundraising and transactions. \u201cThe U.S. can\u2019t claim to be the world\u2019s greatest capital market without winning the world\u2019s best, most competitive companies,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is Trump doesn\u2019t want to see our stock markets falling behind in the global league tables and losing out to Hong Kong, London, or Shanghai.\u201d \u201cSo, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the market. Trump likes to be a master deal maker, which is a perfect opportunity to make a master deal with China. Perhaps they use the tariffs as a bargaining chip, but I think there's an enormous opportunity. In any case, investors should buckle up for an exciting, bumpy rollercoaster ride.\u201d ","label":1}

Published on21 hours ago  The OnePlus 13 is a strong contender for the best Android phone of the year so far, with a great design, blazing-fast performance, and a huge battery. We\u2019ve heard leaks about a pocket-friendly OnePlus flagship phone in recent months, and it now sounds like this device won\u2019t sacrifice battery life. Weibo leaker Digital Chat Station has claimed that an upcoming small OnePlus flagship phone (tipped to be the OnePlus 13 Mini or OnePlus 13T) will offer a 6,000mAh battery at the very least. This would be a huge battery for a smaller smartphone. In fact, this would be larger than the batteries inside the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (5,000mAh) and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL (5,060mAh). It would also be a little larger than the vivo X200 Pro Mini, which features a 6.39-inch display and a 5,700mAh battery. This huge capacity is likely possible due to silicon-carbon battery technology. This enables more capacity for the same physical size as a standard lithium-ion battery or the same capacity in a smaller physical size. In fact, the OnePlus 13 uses this tech for its 6,000mAh battery. Otherwise, the tipster also reiterates that this OnePlus phone will pack a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and a flat display. We\u2019re guessing that there\u2019ll be a few compromises in exchange for a smaller form factor (e.g. wireless charging, camera sensor size), but we\u2019re keen to see more pocket-friendly flagship phones on the market.","label":0}

We love it. We\u2019ve made many memories in it, and it\u2019s served as the headquarters for the Art of Manliness. Our house is home for us. With that said, something I\u2019ve learned as a homeowner during the past 14 years is that owning a home is pretty freaking expensive. And many of the expenses I\u2019ve had to lay down cash for have been for things that weren\u2019t even on my radar when Kate and I signed the mortgage. These extra, overlooked costs of owning a home are often called \u00e2\u0080\u009cphantom costs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Phantom costs include things like maintenance and repair costs, rising property taxes, and insurance premiums. If you want to know the true cost of homeownership, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to take into account these hidden costs in addition to the more obvious ones. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about buying a home, phantom costs definitely need to be on your radar as you decide whether to buy a home or continue renting. If you own a home, you need to know about them so you can budget for them. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break down everything you need to know about phantom homeownership costs. There have always been phantom\u00a0costs with homeownership. But in the past five years, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten significantly steeper. According to Bankrate.com, the average homeowner now shells out $18,118 annually ($1,510 monthly) on property taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance. That\u2019s a 26% jump from 2020, when these expenses averaged $14,428 annually. To put that in perspective, if you\u2019re paying the national median mortgage payment of $2,256, these additional costs add another 67% to your homeownership-related expenses. Basically, to own a home in America today, you\u2019ll likely have to pay expenses that are equivalent to buying a used car every year. While $18,118 is the average in annual phantom homeownership costs, they\u2019ll vary due to where you live. According to that Bankrate study, here are the states with the highest yearly phantom homeownership costs: And here are the states with the lowest: One factor making phantom costs even steeper is the increasing age of America\u2019s housing stock. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median age of owner-occupied homes is about 40 years old. That\u2019s a lot of aging roofs, worn-out HVAC systems, and creaky appliances waiting to fail. Our home is nearly 40 years old, and while it\u2019s in pretty good condition, it\u2019s at the point in its lifecycle where things are wearing out and need to be replaced. Most of our phantom costs have come from replacing and repairing things. Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the repairs I\u2019ve had to fork over money for during the past 14 years: Inflation and rising labor costs have only caused home maintenance costs to go up. I\u2019ve seen this firsthand. We had to replace some windows in our home shortly before the pandemic. After the pandemic, we had to replace another set of windows that were just like the first, but the cost had increased significantly due to inflation and higher labor costs. Besides repair and maintenance expenses, other phantom homeownership costs include property taxes, insurance premiums, and HOA dues. Reports show that property taxes have been rising throughout the United States during the past five years, primarily driven by the pandemic-era home price boom. According to ATTOM, a real estate analytics company, property taxes in America have increased 25% since 2019. Home insurance costs have increased by 74% in the past five years. Several factors have contributed to rising home insurance costs, including increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, rising construction and labor costs, and inflation. (One thing you can do to manage home insurance costs is to shop around. I was able to save thousands of dollars a year last year by switching home insurance companies.) If you live in a neighborhood with a homeowner\u2019s association, you\u2019ll likely have to pay dues. I didn\u2019t think about that when I bought our house. And those dues have increased in the past five years due to rising maintenance costs. When you add up all the additional expenses I\u2019ve put into my home, the actual cost of homeownership has been much more than the\u00a0original buying price of our house alone. Knowing what I know now about the actual cost of homeownership, do I regret buying my house? Not at all. Like I said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our home. We love it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awesome to have a place to call our own. In our calculus, the costs of homeownership have been worth it. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to travel all that much. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not clothes horses or foodies. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re homebodies who not only live at home, but work from home, so having a place we really enjoy inhabiting is important to us. But I do wish someone had warned me about these hidden costs before I bought the house. It would have helped me budget better and set aside money for repairs and maintenance so I wasn\u2019t blindsided when I had to fork over a bunch of money for this, that, and the other unforeseen thing. How much should you set aside monthly for home maintenance and repair costs? According to the experts, a good rule of thumb is to budget 1\u00e2\u0080\u00933% of your home\u2019s value per year\u00a0for phantom costs. This will vary based on location, the age of the home, and whether you\u2019re in an HOA. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how that translates into a monthly savings target: Besides setting aside money for home maintenance costs, another thing you can do to mitigate phantom costs is to do regular home maintenance on your home. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and all that. If you\u2019re considering buying a new home, make sure you include phantom costs in your decision calculus. It will help you make a more clear-eyed decision. If you own a home, start that maintenance fund now, not later. Build that 1-3% savings cushion into your budget, and treat it as non-negotiable as your mortgage payment. Your future self will thank you for it.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":" Bitcoin (BTC) has been relatively listless this month, hunching below $100,000. However, this hasn't deterred traders from continuing to bet bullishly on the leading cryptocurrency. This month's most preferred options play has been buying the $110,000 call expiring on March 28, with buyers paying a cumulative net premium of over $6 million for the bullish exposure, according to the Deribit options flow tracked by Amberdata. A call option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish, looking to hedge downside risks. \"Looking at the month-to-date flows for on-screen traders\u2026 the buying of March $110K calls has been the most active trade,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Bitcoin has mostly traded within a narrow range of $95,000 to $100,000 this month. The bulls have had some positive developments to chew on, like the continued accumulation by MicroStrategy and Abu Dhabi's recent reveal of a $436 million investment in the bitcoin ETFs. However, renewed macroeconomic headwinds, highlighted by last week's hotter U.S. inflation data and frequent liquidity drains caused by the boom-bust cycles of memecoins and other small-cap tokens, appear to be capping the upside potential. Over the weekend, a token called LIBRA zoomed to a market cap of over $4 billion, only to erase 90% of that within minutes. Argentina's President, Xavier Milei, initially promoted the coin late Friday but backtracked in a few hours, causing a controversy that has him facing legal issues in his home country. \"Some bullish headlines hit for BTC last week, but that didn't materialize into any real spike higher for spot prices,\" Magadini said, referring to Abu Dhabi's investment. \"Combine this news with bearish memecoin market drag (a source of bearish headlines) such as the\u00a0$Libra drop, pump-fun mania and growing supply of alts [altcoins] and I see this market in stand-still. Together, this reinforces my 'sideways' market, lower volatility market thesis,\" Magadini added.

{"date":"2025-02-17","content":"Ethereum's ether (ETH) showed strength through the weekend, spurring investor hopes of a break in its lackluster price performance, only to foreshadow a market-wide decline. In a muted trading session due to the U.S. holiday, ether ground as much as 7% higher to a Monday session high of $2,850, outperforming the rest of the crypto market. Then, it gave up most of the gains, dropping back to $2,730 as the broader market fell, with bitcoin (BTC) falling to $95,500 from just above $97,000. Still, ETH held onto its 2% advance over the past 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 Index and BTC were about 2% lower.   Traders were quick to point out past occasions, like late January and early February, when a brief ETH rally foreshadowed broader weakness in crypto prices. Then, ether's 10% rally to $3,400 in three days ended in an ugly capitulation event over trade war concerns, with BTC dropping 13% and ETH tumbling 35% to nearly $2,000 through a low-volume weekend.  Eth pumps for 5% -->Entire market in next hour pic.twitter.com\/jOMX3RpOaX Ether's strength occurred as memecoin fiascos such as Argentina's LIBRA on Solana and BNB Chain-based BROCCOLI \u2014 inspired by former Binance CEO CZ revealing his dog's name \u2014 weighed on the tokens of rival layer-1 networks. \"ETH\u2019s recent price action isn\u2019t an outperformance \u2014 it\u2019s more of a catch-up to where it should be,\" Aran Hawker, CEO of trading automation platform CoinPanel, told CoinDesk over Telegram. \"Some traders may have rotated back into ETH from SOL, but there\u2019s no clear trend shift or structural change. Any perceived outperformance could be erased by the next major market move.\" Joel Kruger, a market strategist for LMAX Group, was more optimistic, saying the price action might be a sign of ether ending its multiyear slide against bitcoin. \"There is evidence of ETH potentially wanting to finally put in a major bottom against bitcoin after downtrending since 2021,\" Kruger said in Monday's market note. \"We believe it will be important to keep a close eye on the current monthly high in the ETHBTC ratio, with a break back above to encourage the reversal outlook.\" Crypto traders' interest in betting on ETH spiked on Monday relative to BTC, CoinGlass data shows. Open interest for ETH futures rose 12% to 9.27 million contracts (worth nearly $2.6 billion) on all exchanges combined over the past 24 hours, led by offshore marketplaces Binance and Gate.io while BTC futures open interest grew only 1%.
