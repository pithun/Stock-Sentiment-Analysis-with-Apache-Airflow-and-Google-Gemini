See our ethics statement. Cricut has announced new versions of its crafting machines designed to print, cut, and emboss various materials using a collection of swappable tools. The new Cricut Maker 4 and Cricut Explore 4 are the first updates to both machines in nearly four years and offer faster cutting speeds for some materials, improved accuracy, and cheaper price tags.  The machines will be available starting on February 28th, 2025. They\u2019ll still start at $249.99 for the Cricut Explore 4, and at $399.99 for the Cricut Maker 4, and both will be available in sage and seashell color options. The four-year-old Cricut Explore 3 sells for $319, while the Maker 3 is $439, so the cheaper price tags for the 4-series line could help make the new machines more accessible to new users. Both models come with a bundle of crafting materials to complete 10 initial projects. The Cricut Maker 4 and Explore 4 look nearly identical to their predecessors but are up to twice as fast when cutting through materials like cardstock and vinyl, Cricut says. The speed improvements won\u2019t be quite as dramatic when using thicker materials, but the upgrade will still appeal to crafters who sell their creations on sites like Etsy and are looking to upgrade their output. Cricut has also introduced a new optical sensor on both models that works alongside a light that better illuminates materials, according to CNET. The upgrade should help improve cutting accuracy, no matter what the lighting conditions are in your crafting room. Although there are differences between both machines\u2019 capabilities, they\u2019re mostly dependent on the types of projects you\u2019re looking to create. The pricier Cricut Maker 4 is designed to work with over 300 different types of materials, including thicker options like leather and balsa wood, and a wider variety of cutting and embossing tools. The cheaper Cricut Explore 4 is limited to around 100 different materials, including thinner stock like vinyl, card stock, and iron-ons. In 2021, the company frustrated existing users with plans to limit monthly uploads to its Design Space software used to prep projects before sending them to the machines. Subscription fees were announced for users wanting to expand the number of designs they could upload, but after much backlash, Cricut scrapped those plans entirely. While the new machines don\u2019t require subscriptions, the company still offers a Cricut Access subscription for users who heavily rely on pre-made designs and projects available through its Design Space app. Cricut Access also expands the number of fonts and images available through the app and includes discounts on materials.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"As President Trump has announced varying tariffs over the last month, tech stock prices have dipped, with investors fearing broad impacts on different parts of the tech sector. Shares of NVIDIA, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and AMD have all wobbled, responding in part to news that Trump might implement a 25% tariff on semiconductors shipped to the U.S.\u00a0 The possible tariffs are said to be part of Trump\u2019s plan to try to get more semiconductor and AI-related manufacturing in the U.S. But industry insiders say that they\u2019re not yet changing any of their longterm approaches \u2014and are mostly viewing the tariff threats as simply another input factor in a volatile industry whose prices are constantly shifting.\u00a0 \u201cTariffs are more of a blip as opposed to a strong headwind,\u201d says Scott Almassy, semiconductor lead at PwC. Nazar Khan, the COO and CTO of the data center company Terawulf, adds: \u201cNo one's really changing what they're doing because it's just too much guesswork.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s semiconductor tariffs could go into effect as early as April 2, he said.\u00a0 In the short term, industry players are working to try to dodge those costs as much as possible. Khan says that Terawulf is trying to expedite deliveries so that they arrive before the tariffs do. For deals that will be realized later this year, business partners are negotiating who will bear the extra cost. \u201cSome suppliers have been like, \u2018We\u2019re not taking it\u2014you have to pay it,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cOthers are willing to share in the cost because they want us to sign a deal now rather than waiting to see what happens on the tariffs.\u201d\u00a0 As economists have pointed out, the cost of tariffs is often passed directly to the end consumer.\u00a0 Read More: What Are Tariffs and Why Is Trump In Favor of Them? \u201cIn the first trade war, the evidence was very consistent, and strikingly so, that 100% of the tax was passed forward to the American buyer,\u201d says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u00a0 She recently wrote a paper predicting that Trump\u2019s tariff proposals in January on Canada, Mexico and China would cost the typical US household over $1,200 a year. The semiconductor tariffs specifically would likely cause anything with a chip\u2014including gaming devices, cars and smart fridges\u2014to increase in price. But prices for AI products like ChatGPT may not increase in the same linear way, due to several factors. For one, prices inside the AI world have never been static. The Deepseek breakthrough last month reinforced the longstanding trend that the cost of training and maintaining models decreases periodically as technical processes get more efficient. \u201cThe question becomes, was the trend going down so much that the 25% is absorbed?\u201d says Khan.\u00a0 The demand for AI also remains extremely high, which means that many companies in the ecosystem are operating with comfortable margins and can weather a percentage change in their profit. \u201cUsers are so willing to pay right now that it's probably less impactful for those folks who are procuring them and building out the clusters,\u201d Almassy says.\u00a0 One of the most dominant forces in the chip industry is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which manufactures the chips that power phones and laptops and are central to the output of key American AI players like NVIDIA.\u00a0 One of Trump\u2019s main reasons for the semiconductor tariffs, he said, was to try to bring more of their chipmaking to U.S. territory. In February, he accused Taiwan of taking \u201cour chip business away,\u201d adding: \u201cIf they don\u2019t bring it back, we\u2019re not going to be very happy.\u201d Leaders from both parties have supported this mission, wary of America\u2019s outsized dependence on a specialized product manufactured on an island nation that China seems intent on controlling.\u00a0 President Biden tried to use a different approach that included incentives: Last year, the Commerce Department pledged up to $6.6 billion for TSMC to expand its Arizona facilities as part of Biden\u2019s CHIPS Act. But TSMC\u2019s progress on that facility has been stymied by repeated delays related to regulatory complexities and a lack of local expertise.\u00a0 Recently, most Taiwanese chipmakers have downplayed the potential impact of semiconductor tariffs, including Vanguard, who said that the tariff\u2019s impact would be \u201ctrivial\u201d and that they were not considering setting up shop in the U.S. Last month, Taiwan\u2019s economy minister said that \u201cthere is an advantage of technological leadership and that cannot be replaced.\u201d\u00a0 Almassy agrees. \u201cEspecially at the leading edge of AI, which is where Taiwan is, there is no alternative at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cTaiwan companies will probably be able to pass a lot of that on to their direct customers, who will then have to figure out what they're going to do with it.\u201d\u00a0 Some of those customers are major American AI companies like NVIDIA and OpenAI, who are leading the country\u2019s progress in the so-called AI arms race against China. Some analysts say that the tariffs could actually slightly hamper those companies\u2019 efforts to maintain their lead, especially as AI labs in countries like France or Japan will be able to buy chips tariff-free. \u201cIt does probably hamstring American companies a little bit by increasing their costs,\u201d Almassy says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re the leader and your resources cost more, you have further to fall than someone not as advanced.\u201d\u00a0 A representative for NVIDIA declined to comment. At the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, an NVIDIA executive said that tariffs were \u201can unknown until we understand further what the U.S.government's plan is.\u201d\u00a0 It is possible that the tariffs will cause companies to shift their factory locations. But Almassy says that many of these relocations were underway well before the tariff threats, as companies sought to make supply chains more resilient and head off shortages like the ones that unfolded during the pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s a general movement by the industry to diversify where the supply chain sits,\u201d Almassy says. In a conversation with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon in September, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that if the company\u2019s access to Taiwanese components was disrupted, \u201cwe should be able to pick up and fab it somewhere else.\u201d But he added that Nvidia probably wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve the same level of \u201coutperformance or cost.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Trump claimed one victory in this regard when Apple announced that it would open an AI-related factory in Texas and spend $500 billion to hire 20,000 people in the U.S. But analysts point out that Apple made similar promises at the beginning of both Biden and Trump\u2019s earlier presidential terms.\u00a0 Plenty, of course, could change over the next six months. Trump said that he eventually planned to raise the tariff rate even higher, which could force companies to adapt. But for now, many companies that are part of the semiconductor supply chain are choosing to sit tight and see how everything unfolds. \u201cThe market's moving very fast, and it takes time to develop and build new factories,\u201d Khan says. \u201cSo the tariff in and of itself may not be determinative for someone to decide to move a facility from Malaysia or Mexico to the US. They may not have the capabilities, money, understanding, or expertise.\u201d\u00a0 Contact us at letters@time.com","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Renault exited the Russian market in 2022, selling its assets for a single ruble. Now, the French carmaker may need to pay 112.5 billion rubles \u2014 about $1.3 billion \u2014 if it seeks to return after the war, its former Russian partner Avtovaz said. The stipulation is a sign that foreign firms looking to return to the market could face high compensation demands. In the case of Renault, Maxim Sokolov, the CEO of Avtovaz, said the company and the Russian state had invested 112.5 billion rubles in the business since its exit through 2025. \"It is clear that these investments will have to be reimbursed somehow upon return,\" Sokolov said, according to the TASS state news agency. US President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness for the US to reconcile with Moscow, spurring recent discussions about a return of Western businesses \u2014 such as Renault \u2014 to the market. In 2022, Renault sold its 67.6% stake in Avtovaz to the Russian state with the option to buy back its assets within six years. The automaker took a 2.2-billion-euro write-down from the exit from the market that was its second largest, after France. A spokesperson for Renault told Business Insider the company didn't \"foresee any change for the short term\" regarding a return to business in Russia. The company didn't comment on Sokolov's statements. David Szakonyi, an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, told BI that Sokolov's comments about compensation should be taken seriously, even if Russian officials were also posturing. The exit of foreign businesses created winners at home in Russia, some of whom picked up assets at fire sale prices. \"Freely allowing foreign companies back in is going to diminish their profit streams and make life a lot more competitive, so if that is going to happen, Russia wants some kind of compensation for liberalizing its market,\" said Szakonyi, who's a specialist in Russia's political economy. Sokolov's comments echo others in Russia recently signaling tough negotiations for departed companies that wish to return. Anton Alikhanov, the Russian industry and trade minister, told reporters on Thursday that Russia was \"not waiting for anyone with open arms\" and that there would be \"a price to pay for past decisions.\" Szakonyi said Russia was likely to continue with such \"cocky rhetoric\" amid its rapprochement with the US. \"It feels that it survived just about the worst the West could throw at it and persevered through that adversity and now comes out even more confident, even more emboldened, to make demands on the West and dictate the terms of both political and economic dealmaking going forward,\" he added. Three years into the war in Ukraine, 475 foreign companies have left the Russian market completely, according to the Leave Russia database from the Kyiv School of Economics. The fast-food giant McDonald's and the coffee chain Starbucks were two high-profile brands that left the market, with their assets bought by Russian businesses. McDonald's rebranded to \"Tasty and that's it\" and Starbucks became Stars Coffee. Even though Russia is a large market, analysts have said recently that businesses are likely to be cautious about returning to the country, even if sanctions are lifted. Russia's wartime economy is facing problems including high inflation, currency volatility, and sky-high interest rates. President Vladimir Putin's ironclad reign presents concerns about the rule of law and safety. \"While Russia says it's open to doing business again, it didn't actually signal any change of tone or policy,\" said Szakonyi, who added that much of Moscow's rhetoric was probably aimed at the Trump administration's appetite for dealmaking. Investors are also likely to remain wary after a wave of corporate nationalization and asset seizures in the past few years that redistributed international company wealth to the Russian state and oligarchs. Szakonyi said Russia had proven that business property rights protections, investor guarantees, and a hospitable business climate were things of the distant past. \"Without them in place, I see no reason why Western companies would risk again with Russia as such a volatile, unpredictable regime,\" he said. \"It has proven that it doesn't care about property rights and that it talks out of both sides of its mouth and is not trustworthy.\" Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Can a President make money out of thin air? On paper, yes. Donald Trump and Elon Musk have been talking a lot about Fort Knox lately, the place where America keeps its official gold reserves. Both have said they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna take a trip to the site soon to check it out and make sure the gold is there. According to Trump and Musk, they wanna make sure no one stole the gold. The reality behind the scheme may be something stupider and more dangerous: they know the gold will be there and know they can use it to create a Bitcoin reserve. The idea that Fort Knox is missing gold is a well-worn Boomer Facebook conspiracy theory. Trump and Musk love those. On February 24, while meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump opined on the possibly missing gold. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re actually going to Ft Knox to see if the gold is there. Because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said during the appearance. Musk has been posting on X about the issue off and on over the past few days. The gold is probably there. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of it, and the chances that someone would ferret it away without anyone noticing are zero. Non-authorized personnel have gone into the vaults to inspect the gold only three times before. President Franklin D. Roosevelt went in 1943. Congress went with a group of journalists in 1974. In 2017, during the first Trump presidency, then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited with McConnell. There are pictures of the pair grinning like idiots, holding up gold bars, and signing their names on the wall. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 1943 visit by Rooselvet that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most instructive here and may hold the key to using America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gold to jumpstart a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Which would, to be clear, be very stupid. This issue has been covered extensively and in-depth by Nathan Tankus on his blog, Notes On the Crises. To hear Tankus tell it, the Fort Knox trip is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca scam built atop an accounting gimmick wrapped in bullshit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the president making money out of thin air. The President has the authority to set the price of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gold. Roosevelt did this in 1934 after America went off the gold standard. At the time, the U.S. said the price of gold was worth $20.67 a fine ounce. Roosevelt said it was actually worth $35, and so it was. He created $2,819,000,000. It was a book-keeping trick, but one that allowed him to invest in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About a billion of it sat on the books and was used to avert the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first debt ceiling crisis in 1953. When Trump and Musk visit Fort Knox, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find 5,000 tons of gold sitting in gold bars. Gold that the U.S. currently values at $42 an ounce. Gold that would be worth $2,800 an ounce on the open market. With the wave of a hand, Trump could change the price of U.S. gold and inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. Treasury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet. He has the authority; the Supreme Court says so. Roosevelt caused a constitutional crisis when he upped the price of gold in the 1930s. SCOTUS ruled in his favor in Perry v. United States. Trump may be served by the precedent. And what to do with an $800 billion dollar windfall? Why, buy Bitcoin, of course. The idea to change the price of gold and use the cash to start a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has been around for a while. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced a bill into Congress in the summer of last year called the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act. Lummis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Act would have the Treasury issue new gold certificates based on the current market price of gold and then use those certificates to buy up Bitcoins. Could this actually happen? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living in weird, stupid, and unprecedented times. The President says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planning to take the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s richest man on a trip to Fort Knox. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that when they get there, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say that the gold hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vanished at all. They may say that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far more of it than they expected.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"The best thing a company can do for its product\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially for its sales numbers\u00e2\u0080\u0094is to convince the users that it\u2019s essential to living. Google is certainly leaning into that narrative with the Pixel Watch 3. This week, Google\u2019s third-gen smartwatch received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Loss of Pulse Detection feature, which was announced alongside the smartwatch, though it\u2019s been dormant pending clearance. Once the feature rolls out later next month, the Pixel Watch 3 can immediately call for help if your pulse goes out. The feature has been available in the E.U. since the smartwatch\u2019s debut last fall, but this is the first time it\u2019s available in the U.S. Loss of Pulse Detection works precisely as advertised: your heart rate goes null, and the Pixel Watch 3 immediately enters emergency mode. It starts a countdown and sounds off an alarm. If you don\u2019t respond within seconds, it automatically calls emergency services, provided you set that up beforehand with an Android device. Google says the watch will be able to differentiate between an immediate cardiac event and simply taking off the watch for the day, suggesting that there will be few false positives. Google touts multi-check, an AI-based algorithm that studies the multipath heart-rate sensor for patterns to detect when it\u2019s genuinely a nuanced situation. The company claims it \u201crigorously tested\u201d the algorithm with \u201cover hundreds of thousands of hours of data\u201d while also cross-referencing it with \u201ca diverse range of experts,\u201d including cardiologists and high-level emergency medical professionals. I accidentally triggered the Pixel Watch\u2019s Fall Detection feature before, though it was on the last generation\u2019s hardware. It happened when my foot slid down a hill after a poor landing. False positives happen, but that\u2019s why there\u2019s a few-second countdown and alert so you can call it off when that happens. Regardless, expect Google to market the feature around town, especially since the Apple Watch still can\u2019t do this kind of thing.

Whether you're new to mobile gaming or you're looking to upgrade your existing setup, I just found a gaming smartphone deal that should not be skipped. The unlocked RedMagic 10 Pro, one of the most powerful Android gaming phones on the market, just scored a 15% discount at Amazon, knocking the price down to its lowest point yet. \u00a0 The powerful device just hit store shelves in late 2024, but it's already impressed users with its gorgeous display, massive 7,050mAh battery, and Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (the same processor that powers the Galaxy S25 Ultra). It's possible that the price will dip a bit further when Prime Day hits in July, but if you don't want to wait, this is an incredible deal on an incredible unlocked phone.\u00a0 RedMagic 10 Pro (Black) 256GB: $749 $636.65 at Amazon The latest gaming smartphone from the bright minds at RedMagic, 2024's 10 Pro is a powerful device specially built to stay cool and lightning-fast during the most intense gaming sessions.\u00a0 Buy the phone unlocked from Amazon today (in Black only) and you'll score a straight 15% discount, which is the largest price drop that the device has ever received from the retailer. If you need more storage, the 512GB version of the phone is also receiving a 15% discount at Amazon. \u2705Recommended if: you want one of the most powerful gaming phones ever built, with a stunning 144Hz display, days of battery life, and an advanced cooling system for long play sessions.\u00a0 \u274cSkip this deal if:\u00a0you want a jack-of-all-trades smartphone; you need great cameras or long software support (the RedMagic 10 Pro is only set to receive one OS upgrade, which is a major bummer).\u00a0 The first thing that you'll notice about the RedMagic 10 Pro is its display. The phone boasts a glorious 6.85-inch AMOLED display with a butter-smooth 144Hz refresh rate, ensuring that you'll never have to worry about lag or stutter when you're playing graphics-intensive titles. That's around the same size as the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display, but the RedMagic 10 Pro also utilizes ultra-thin bezels to maximize screen space. Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the RedMagic 10 Pro is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, a processor that's widely considered to be one of the best chipsets on the market today. The phone also features a 7,050mAh that's estimated to last up to 52 hours on a single charge, plus the device's built-in cooling system and built-in fan ensure that overheating will never be an issue.\u00a0 To be clear, the RedMagic 10 Pro is a gaming smartphone before all else, so if you're looking for a jack of all trades, your money would be better spent on one of the other great Android phones that are out right now. With the 10 Pro, you're settling for average cameras and fewer OS upgrades, plus you'll want to check with your carrier to make sure that the phone can access its local 5G network.\u00a0 In other words, if you're ready to use one of the best gaming phones on the market, this RedMagic deal is an outstanding opportunity. But if you just want a phone that's good at, well, being a phone, I've got plenty of other deals to recommend.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"The best of the internet, delivered straight to your inbox! \"If you\u2019re unable to answer these questions, that likely means you need to take some steps to get involved for your own protection.\" HuffPost Writer The content\u00a0is\u00a0appealing. Williams\u2019 TikTok has 1.3 million likes across her videos touting the benefits of relying on a partner to take care of you. In that regard, I was also a tradwife throughout my 12-year marriage.\u00a0 Throughout my first marriage \u2014 in our early 20s \u2014 my husband and I muddled through, three young children in tow, making the best life we could. We eventually divorced, I became a single mom, and a bit more muddling ensued. I was always one step behind, stressed out, overworked and underemployed. Then I remarried.\u00a0\u00a0 When I became pregnant with my youngest \u2014 with older kids in public school \u2014 my \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d and medical history made the pregnancy high risk. We agreed that I should quit my job. So I did, and immediately began nesting.\u00a0 I began creating the white picket fence life I thought I wanted. We even started homeschooling. If I was going to be home all day anyway, why not? I became a master of pinning craft ideas on Pinterest, meal planning and decorating my home.\u00a0 In 2019, I started working from home here and there, taking on ghostwriting and freelance work, but none of that money truly contributed to the household. I let my husband take care of everything related to running the home. He\u2019s a CPA and financial adviser by trade, so why would I \u201cworry my pretty little head\u201d about any of that? Had I asked, he likely would have shared the details. Neither of us gave it much thought, though, and it worked well for a while.\u00a0\u00a0 After our divorce hearing, I walked out of the local courthouse a homeowner, having been awarded the family home, but blissfully unaware of the ramifications.\u00a0\u00a0 I was suddenly solely responsible for the home maintenance, utilities, property tax and homeowners insurance. I received a crash course on adulting. I was even hit with an HOA violation letter because my home needed a good pressure washing. Of course it did; my husband hadn\u2019t lived there for nearly a year. A patch of lichen had taken up permanent residence on my mailbox.\u00a0 HOA and amenities fees were immediately due. The sprinklers needed to be programmed; with that, of course, a water bill increase. I would need to schedule and pay the lawn guy (that mulch wasn\u2019t going to spread itself). I also quickly realized I\u2019d better start budgeting some sinking funds for the property tax due after the holidays.\u00a0 My ex-husband and I just fell into traditional gender roles; it was easier than putting in the work. When he moved out, he struggled with working his air fryer, ordering delivery on his phone and navigating the grocery store. I hadn\u2019t necessarily dug my head in the sand over the years, but I sure hadn\u2019t been as proactive as I could have.\u00a0 Shari Rash is the founder and financial advisor at GWA Wealth. \u201cI speak with women all the time, when out socially or at moms groups, that once they hear what I do for a living I get the response, \u2018Oh, my husband handles all of that,\u2019\u201d she told HuffPost.\u00a0 Rash said that it\u2019s often a significant event that prompts a person to act or become actively involved in managing their finances. Typically, this event tends to be something negative \u2014 perhaps the loss of a parent, unemployment, divorce, the death of a spouse, or even witnessing one of those events happen to someone close.\u00a0\u00a0 According to a report by Bank of America, 94% of women believe that they will be personally responsible for their finances at some point during their lives, yet they are less involved in long-term financial decisions than their partners. Nearly half of the 3,500 women surveyed said they feel confident about their finances, but only 28% feel empowered to take action on them, the report says. \u00a0 Rash encourages women to take an active role in household finances, whether they work outside the home or not. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re tracking the stock market daily and day trading your accounts. It means you know what your household has and you\u2019re included in the conversation,\u201d she said. A parent\u2019s hands-off approach to family finances has a larger effect within a family unit.\u00a0 \u201cKids are like little sponges, absorbing every detail of our behavior, especially when it comes to relationships and finances,\u201d certified public accountant\u00a0Maya Corbic said. \u201dThey\u2019re shaping their money mindset as they observe how we interact with money and each other. Everything they see, hear and feel becomes their perception of \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Corbic\u2019s goal is to teach every child how to become a financially independent adult. \u201cMany moms who attend my parent workshops share stories of how their upbringing influenced their views on finances,\u201d she said. \u201cFor instance, some grew up in households where fathers solely made financial decisions, leading to the belief that only men handle investments. This perpetuates the notion that women shouldn\u2019t be involved in financial matters and must rely on men for financial security.\u201d\u00a0 Corbic advises parents to be aware of the messages they\u2019re sending children and that they \u201cconsciously model healthy financial behaviors and empower them to develop a balanced and informed relationship with money.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 One way to do this is by dedicating time each month to review the household budget, discuss spending habits and prioritize savings. \u201cRegular \u2018money dates\u2019 serve as a cornerstone for financial harmony,\u201d Corbic told HuffPost, adding that they promote transparency within the family and emphasize the importance of intentional discussions about family finances.\u00a0 Rash urges those who depend financially on their partner to immediately dig in and do the work. But this doesn\u2019t just apply to those falling into traditional gender roles in their relationships; all adults who are sharing their lives with a partner can benefit from becoming more financially aware. Important topics to discuss with your partner include:\u00a0  For couples using the services of a financial adviser, Rash suggests you begin by asking yourself the following questions:\u00a0  \u201cIf you\u2019re unable to answer those questions, that likely means you need to take some steps to get involved for your own protection,\u201d Rash said. While I still have a long way to go, with each new experience, I gain the financial confidence and self-esteem that I lacked while living the tradwife lifestyle. I have an upcoming appointment with a CPA, opened an investment account, began paying more attention to my retirement accounts, and most importantly, I\u2019m gaining skills, knowledge and wisdom that I can share with my children so that they can protect their financial futures.\u00a0This article originally appeared on HuffPost.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"The company says it eclipsed a billion monthly active podcast users.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Nearly a year after Google made the surprising decision to shutter Google Podcasts, it appears that YouTube has successfully emerged as its replacement. The company recently shared its \"big bets\" for YouTube in 2025, and one of them seems to be paying off early. In a blog post today, Feb. 26, YouTube shared that it eclipsed one billion monthly podcast viewers \u2014 an important achievement for the platform. \"This milestone underscores how YouTube has come to play an essential role in podcasting for creators and audiences, and how our investments to improve the podcast experience on YouTube are paying off,\" writes Tim Katz, the VP of partnerships and podcasts at YouTube. \"Podcasts with video are more than just a trend, they meet audiences where they are: on YouTube.\" The monthly active viewer threshold is just part of the reason YouTube is taking a victory lap for its podcast delivery efforts. The platform claims that it is \"the most frequently used service for listening to podcasts in the U.S. and often the first place people go when looking for a new podcast,\" citing an Edison Research report from October 2024. The report found that YouTube is more popular among podcast listeners than both Spotify and Apple Podcasts. In terms of market share, Edison reports that YouTube Music is the most popular podcast delivery service among weekly podcast listeners ages 13 and up. It has 31% of the market, compared to 27% for Spotify and 15% for Apple Podcasts. Edison's metrics measure \"listening, not downloads, across all networks, shows, and platforms,\" per the report. Last year, YouTube says viewers consumed over 400 million hours of podcasts on its platforms \u2014 both audio and video podcasts. The move comes as Google embraces YouTube and YouTube Music for podcast delivery. It's continuing to grow YouTube's podcast functionality. At the end of last year, the company added shareable links that let listeners start shared podcasts at a specific timestamp.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Palantir CEO Alex Karp talks a big game when it comes to his employees. He's boasted on several occasions that Palantirians, as the company refers to employees, are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of tech workers. \"If you work for Palantir, everyone knows you're good,\" Karp said on CNBC's Squawk Box on February 18. \"No credible institution in commercial life can really be built without Palantir or an ex-Palantirian,\" Karp has also said. The company, which reported just under 4,000 full-time employees as of December 2024, recently hit an all-time high in its stock and brought in $2.87 billion in revenue in 2024. Following its most recent earnings report, Palantir hit a $240 billion market cap, surpassing companies like McDonald's and Disney. It hasn't only been clear skies, however, as Palantir's share price is down nearly 30% from its all-time closing high earlier this month. So do the people hiring from the tech talent pool buy Karp's glowing view of Palantirians? Business Insider spoke to half a dozen tech recruiting professionals to find out if having Palantir on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is as powerful as Karp has made it sound. Deepali Vyas, a senior Partner and global head of data, AI, and FinTech at global consulting firm Korn Ferry told BI she can \"absolutely say that he's right,\" and she considers Palantir the Goldman Sachs of the tech industry. \"I've pulled people from Palantir,\" Vyas said. \"They are a home run every single time.\" While she said Palantir employees tend to work long hours, the company has a \"very hands-on culture\" that allows even junior employees to work alongside the \"brightest minds\" at the company. Vyas said having that proximity helps create a certain level of training. Vyas said another factor that makes Panatir stand out is its ability to recruit people who are passionate about their work. \"There's something in the sauce there,\" Vyas said. \"They want to work on the complex problems because that's what excites them.\" Jason Saltzman, Director of Growth at Live Data Technologies, a company that tracks employment changes, told BI that \"Palantir seems to be the stop on people's career journey that accelerates them the most.\" Almost a quarter of former product managers at Palantir have since become founders, he said. Ex-Palantir employees also tend to end up at a big tech company or \"one of the hottest startups,\" Saltzman said. Google and Meta as well as Anduril and OpenAI employ many former Palantir workers, he told BI. \"Not only is Palantir a rubber stamp on someone's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that allows them to go onto whatever they do next, but also many of them want to go solve the world's biggest problems that are shaping the future as we know it, either by joining a company or starting their own,\" Saltzman said. Aaron Sines, director of technical recruiting at global cloud consulting firm Edison & Black, told BI that there's some truth to Karp's statement, but overall he's seeing a \"results revolution\" among companies, where outcomes are placed above academic credentials and company names. \"My team tells me all the time results are almost always coming over academic credentials,\" Sines told BI. Natan Fisher, the cofounder and co-CEO of tech and legal recruiting firm SingleSprout, similarly told BI that companies want to know how employees \"operated under constraints, and whether they can drive impact in their environments.\" \"No doubt, Palantir is a strong hiring signal, but the idea of a golden ticket in tech is outdated,\" Fisher said, adding that \"the real hiring market doesn't reward brand names alone, it rewards execution and adaptability \u2014 who built what and scaled systems at speed.\" Fisher said that tech companies often seek to hire from \"multiple high-caliber\" talent pools such as Ramp, Stripe, Linear, and Notion, adding that they aren't clients of his. Sines said that Palantir has a reputation for seeking out top talent and having a \"rigorous\" and \"results-oriented\" hiring strategy. However, he said that while it carries a \"badge of honor,\" for some clients, it may signal too much intensity for others. It depends on how companies perceive culture, Sines said. Farah Sharghi, a job search coach and former recruiter at tech companies including Google, Lyft, Uber, and TikTok, said that while Palantir's hiring process is \"very stringent,\" a good employee at Palantir may not be a good employee everywhere else because \"there might be some nuances to some companies versus others in terms of cultural fit.\" \"A Palantir engineer who's used to working on some particular type of technology might not thrive in another different size company or different cultural company,\" Sharghi said. \"So it's really subjective relative to what the company does, what their needs are, and so on.\" While culture may vary across tech companies, Sharghi says the guiding philosophy when it comes to hiring is largely the same across the board. \"They're not looking for breadth of experience,\" she said. \"They're looking for technical depth of experience.\" Alan Stein, the CEO of career-accelerating service Kadima Careers, told BI that \"Palantir is a good brand name,\" but although it was considered, it didn't make his list of the top 100 companies that will accelerate your career. \"I don't think that's as impressive as some of the other companies,\" he said. Stein, who has worked at several Big Tech companies, including Google and Meta, said that while Palantir candidates can definitely leverage their experience into data, engineering, or government roles, it doesn't have the same brand recognition as some other bigger companies, or Ivy League institutions like Harvard. \"My hunch is more people would prefer four years of Harvard on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\" Stein said.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"     Your CD earnings aren't all yours to keep. Be sure to budget for paying the government their share.    There's a lot to love about certificates of deposit. They're low-risk, protected by federal insurance and offer guaranteed returns. But like savings and other deposit accounts, you must pay tax on the interest your CD earns. The government treats interest on CDs and other transaction accounts as taxable income. Read on to learn everything you need to know about paying taxes on your CD investments. Read more: Best Tax Software of 2025 \"Interest paid on your CDs will be taxed as ordinary income just like wages when you file your taxes,\" said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant with TurboTax.\u00a0 That means your CD interest is taxed at your ordinary federal income tax rate based on your tax bracket. Tax rates for the year 2024 range from 10% to 37% and depend on your income and filing status, Greene-Lewis said.\u00a0 If you earn at least $10 in interest from a CD during a year, your financial institution must report that interest to the IRS. If you invest in a short-term CD that matures the same year it was purchased, you'll have to pay tax on it for that year. If you invest in a long-term CD that matures after 12 months or more, you'll have to pay taxes on whatever interest accrues annually along the way.\u00a0 \"The interest will be reported and claimed on your taxes for the year it was paid,\" Greene-Lewis said. For example, let's say you opened a two-year CD in January 2024 that matures in January 2026. When you file your 2024 tax return, you'll pay taxes on the interest you accumulated in the CD through the end of that year. When you file your 2025 return, you'll pay taxes on the interest earned that year. And in 2026, you'll owe taxes on the interest accumulated in January of that year. You should receive Form 1099-INT reporting how much interest you earned each tax year by Jan. 31, Greene-Lewis said. But \"even if you don't receive a copy, you still should report the interest earned on your taxes,\" she said. The interest you earn on a CD is subject to federal, state and local taxation, with tax laws varying by jurisdiction. Unless you live in a state with no income tax, you should expect to owe both federal and state taxes on your CD interest. Since state-level tax brackets are a bit more complicated than federal tiers, you can use this breakdown from the Tax Foundation to get an estimate of the percentage of your CD earnings that will go to the state government. Note that state laws on interest income vary widely. New Hampshire, for example, just eliminated its state tax on interest and dividends. Fifth Third's CD Maturity Calculator is a helpful tool for estimating your federal and state tax bill (toggle the advanced feature to access it).\u00a0 You'll pay taxes on your CD interest regardless of whether you withdraw the money.\u00a0 For example, let's say you open a five-year CD right now and plan to leave it untouched until the term is up. You'll be paying taxes on interest until the CD reaches maturity, and you'll receive a 1099-INT form for every year the CD accrues interest. If you decide to take out your money before the CD matures, most banks and credit unions will hit you with an early withdrawal penalty. You can deduct the cost of the penalty on your taxes, reducing what you owe.\u00a0 So let's say you earned $70 in interest in a calendar year, but you paid a $45 early withdrawal penalty because you needed the funds before the term was over. You'll owe taxes only on $35 of interest. Your bank or credit union will likely mail you a copy of your 1099-INT form, or you can access it through your online account.\u00a0 The interest you've earned will be in Box 1 of the form. You'll need to enter that number in the \"taxable interest\" section of whatever tax return form you file with the IRS. If you earned more than $1,500 in interest and dividends between your CD and other investments, you'll need to file a Schedule B. You can't avoid reporting CD interest on your tax return, but you may be able to delay your payment obligation.\u00a0 \"You can potentially lower or avoid paying taxes on CD interest by purchasing a CD in a tax-advantaged account like an IRA or 401(k),\" Greene-Lewis said. By putting your CD in one of these tax-deferred accounts, you won't pay taxes on the interest until you withdraw the funds during retirement, she said.\u00a0 The upside is that you may be in a significantly lower tax bracket when you retire. The downside is that your interest earnings from CDs will likely be much lower than you'd get from riskier investments in the stock market. So while you can shrink your tax bill with this approach, you might be limiting your overall retirement fund. A certificate of deposit can be a valuable part of your savings strategy, but when you're calculating your interest earnings, don't forget that the government will want its share.\u00a0 Tax reporting has many nuances: standard versus itemized deductions, charitable contributions, mortgage interest deductions, and more. It might be worth it to hire a tax professional\u00a0to ensure you follow the appropriate guidelines and minimize your stress.","label":0}

A playful skit at the start of his review shows a customer asking for Apple Intelligence, no MagSafe, a notch, and an Action button in an iPhone.\rSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe lack of MagSafe is, again, a big sticking point. Third-party cases can bring back the magnets, but Qi charging just isn't comparable to the faster MagSafe speeds.\rThe camera takes okay photos with an older-generation sensor and features. It just doesn't have the same camera performance as modern iPhones.\rBrownlee speculates that the entire purpose of the iPhone 16e is to have an iPhone at the bottom of the price ladder and entice customers to choose the base model. Otherwise, the price just doesn't make sense.\r\"Every single person considering the 16e should start by considering the 15 Pro,\" he said. \"It's just, everything about it is better.\"\rThe Verge: eh, it's alrightAllison Johnson writing for The Verge says the iPhone 16e is everything she loves and hates about iOS. It's an iPhone through and through, but Android is offering better features at a lower price.\rCustomers that don't look for all the specs won't care and will buy this entry model, but more fussy ones will have a conundrum. Either it's MagSafe that will make you consider a more expensive iPhone, or the camera.\r iPhone 16e offers several modern features, but cuts out a few essentials. Image source: AppleiPhone 15 is only $100 more and has MagSafe, the Dynamic Island, and an ultrawide camera, but it lacks Apple Intelligence. It's a tough call and depends on the individual's needs.\rThe long battery life is useful and will likely get most people through a day of use. Battery health is a different question that can't be answered until these devices are used for much longer periods.\rThe C1 performed without issue, and Johnson says not noticing any differences is a good thing. Watching videos, making FaceTime calls, and uploading media didn't pose any problems.\rPeople coming from an iPhone 11 might see the iPhone 16e as a good option. However, those invested in MagSafe would likely prefer that over Apple Intelligence.\rWall Street Journal: Apple's 'cheap' iPhone isn't so cheap. But is it a bad deal?Nicole Nguyen writing for The Wall Street Journal says iPhone 16e is a decent choice for anyone that wants the basics. However, older models at a discount may be more enticing.\rThe battery life increase to 26 hours of video playback is an impressive feature. She notes that she would go to bed with 60% or more left on the battery each day.\rAgain, MagSafe is sorely missed. No access to magnetic wallets, stands, and chargers hurts, especially for those with a collection.\rNguyen says the \"e\" in iPhone 16e stands for \"envy,\" which she felt any time she looked at a MagSafe-compatible iPhone while testing the device. Customers should consider the year-old iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro, which will still get years of updates from Apple.

A playful skit at the start of his review shows a customer asking for Apple Intelligence, no MagSafe, a notch, and an Action button in an iPhone.\r The lack of MagSafe is, again, a big sticking point. Third-party cases can bring back the magnets, but Qi charging just isn't comparable to the faster MagSafe speeds.\r The camera takes okay photos with an older-generation sensor and features. It just doesn't have the same camera performance as modern iPhones.\r Brownlee speculates that the entire purpose of the iPhone 16e is to have an iPhone at the bottom of the price ladder and entice customers to choose the base model. Otherwise, the price just doesn't make sense.\r \"Every single person considering the 16e should start by considering the 15 Pro,\" he said. \"It's just, everything about it is better.\"\r Allison Johnson writing for The Verge says the iPhone 16e is everything she loves and hates about iOS. It's an iPhone through and through, but Android is offering better features at a lower price.\r Customers that don't look for all the specs won't care and will buy this entry model, but more fussy ones will have a conundrum. Either it's MagSafe that will make you consider a more expensive iPhone, or the camera.\r iPhone 15 is only $100 more and has MagSafe, the Dynamic Island, and an ultrawide camera, but it lacks Apple Intelligence. It's a tough call and depends on the individual's needs.\r The long battery life is useful and will likely get most people through a day of use. Battery health is a different question that can't be answered until these devices are used for much longer periods.\r The C1 performed without issue, and Johnson says not noticing any differences is a good thing. Watching videos, making FaceTime calls, and uploading media didn't pose any problems.\r People coming from an iPhone 11 might see the iPhone 16e as a good option. However, those invested in MagSafe would likely prefer that over Apple Intelligence.\r Nicole Nguyen writing for The Wall Street Journal says iPhone 16e is a decent choice for anyone that wants the basics. However, older models at a discount may be more enticing.\r The battery life increase to 26 hours of video playback is an impressive feature. She notes that she would go to bed with 60% or more left on the battery each day.\r Again, MagSafe is sorely missed. No access to magnetic wallets, stands, and chargers hurts, especially for those with a collection.\r Nguyen says the \"e\" in iPhone 16e stands for \"envy,\" which she felt any time she looked at a MagSafe-compatible iPhone while testing the device. Customers should consider the year-old iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro, which will still get years of updates from Apple.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Hello there! Feeling nostalgic about those old Taco Bell\/Pizza Hut combo restaurants? Well, there's a new dynamic duo in the neighborhood: Applebee's and IHOP. We got to try out their first hybrid restaurant in the US, which is hoping to appeal to young diners. In today's big story, the economy is showing signs of slowing down and some are saying DOGE isn't helping things. What's on deck Markets: An inside look at what life is like at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office. Tech: Nvidia posted another big earnings beat. Business: Jeff Bezos has a new rule for The Washington Post. But first, we're taking it slow. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The economic growth spurt some were hoping for with the new administration is coming up short. President Donald Trump's second term promised tax cuts, deregulation, and an environment that would get an economy firing on all cylinders. But investors and economic experts are raising concerns about a slowdown this year. Neil Dutta, the head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, outlined how the US economy is starting to look sluggish. The market is also indicating something's amiss, as the 10-year US Treasury yield has dipped recently. That's a key benchmark of DOGE's success \u2014 lower yield means lower lending costs for consumers \u2014 but it's not dropping for the reasons DOGE wants, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. The group's cost-cutting efforts are actually further muddying the economic outlook, according to some, leading yields to drop as investors look for a safe haven. Dutta highlighted two things that have kept the economy humming \u2014 consumer and government spending \u2014 showing signs of strain. To Dutta's point, a trio of economic data released last Friday on consumer sentiment and housing indicated all was not well, which led stocks to have their worst day of the year. He's not alone in his concerns. Last week, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen listed several factors \u2014 tariffs, less immigration, and cuts to government spending \u2014 for why he was \"actually pretty negative for the first time in a while\" on the economy's growth potential and where the markets are headed. The Point72 founder said he expects a \"significant correction.\" Truist chief market strategist Keith Lerner is also treading carefully. Just six weeks after talking about a buy-the-dip opportunity, Lerner downgraded US equities for the first time in years from attractive to neutral. Predictions of an economic dropoff predated DOGE and the administration. Before the election, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the US economy's growth would ease up in 2025. And as we're less than two months into Trump's second term, a lot is subject to change. But in the short term, DOGE's intent to clean up government waste could be speeding up the economy's slowdown. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer highlighted DOGE (in addition to tariffs and immigration) as \"potential growth headwinds.\" All this might sound counterintuitive. Wouldn't reducing the government's massive deficit be good for the economy? Billionaire Ray Dalio said rising debt could lead to a financial \"heart attack\" if not addressed. But Cohen said the cost cutting is like a shock to the system. \u200b\u200b\"When that money's been coursing through the economy over many years and now potentially it will be reduced or stopped in many ways, it has to be negative for the economy,\" he said. 1. Bitcoin turns bearish. The crypto token has taken a tumble \u2014 down as much as 13% from its January high \u2014 and has officially entered bear territory. Tuesday was a real drag, with bitcoin ETF investors pulling over $1.1 billion. Between policy promises falling short and last week's $1.5 billion hack of crypto-exchange Bybit, confidence in bitcoins and altcoins has faltered. The volatility takes its toll, with crypto addiction becoming a growing concern. 2. Goldman takes the Lone Star state. Southern hospitality, an open-door culture, box seats at Mavericks games \u2014 these are just some of the highlights of working at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office, according to five employees who spoke to BI. And more perks are on the horizon with Goldman planning a new Dallas campus with rooftop gardens, childcare, and more. 3. Elliott Management founder Paul Singer doesn't have fun at work. The man behind the $72 billion fund knows how to have a good time: He likes skiing, snowmobiling, and playing the keyboard. At the office, though, Singer is all work and no play, preparing for risks at every turn. In a recent interview, Singer spoke about the stresses of running a firm and his concerns about the market, but he's in it for the long haul. 1. Nvidia shrugs off DeepSeek concerns with a strong earnings beat. The chip giant reported revenue of $39.33 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates by more than $1 billion. On the earnings call, Nvidia's CFO said that demand for Blackwell chips also exceeded expectations \u2014 and the stock rose in after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang said that AI models like DeepSeek's R1 need 100 times more compute, on the call. 2. Is having Palantir on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 the golden ticket for tech hires? CEO Alex Karp seems to think so. BI spoke with six technical recruiting specialists to find out if this was the case. Some weren't so sure, saying the industry prefers strong results over credentials. Palantir may also still struggle with brand recognition, and its culture could be a turn-off for those hiring. 3. Amazon's AI-powered Alexa+ is finally here. After slow progress, the tech giant unveiled its long-awaited voice assistant on Wednesday. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said the upgraded Alexa can invent bedtime stories, offer recipes, and book reservations through partner companies. Here's what to expect \u2014 and how much it'll cost. 1. Model Karolina Kurkova and her husband are at war with an exclusive private island club. In a lawsuit, the model and her real-estate broker husband are alleging Fisher Island Club's board of directors threatened them and wrongfully expelled them from the club, harming their reputation and causing them millions of dollars in damages. The private island that's just south of Miami Beach is home to multiple billionaires and high-profile celebrities. The Fisher Island Club denies the lawsuit's allegations as baseless and believes the complaint \"is nothing more than disgruntled former members.\" 2. Jeff Bezos has an opinion on the opinion page. The Washington Post owner announced sweeping changes to the paper's opinion section in a note to staff and shared on X. The paper's op-eds must support \"free markets\" and \"personal liberties,\" he said. As part of the overhaul, the opinions editor, David Shipley, has stepped down. While newspaper ownership often sets the tone for op-eds, the note is Bezos' latest controversial move after over a year of internal turmoil. 3. There will be winners and losers as the new Trump administration rewrites how business is regulated. Crypto firms including Coinbase and Robinhood have already benefited. Meanwhile, some legal experts predict an uptick in traditional securities cases and a continuation of the Biden DOJ's aggressive antitrust enforcement in cases against Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Ticketmaster.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. Technology company Nvidia will report fourth-quarter earnings today after the closing bell. (Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images) Nvidia, the chipmaker that fueled 22% of the S&P 500\u2019s total returns in 2024 with a 171.25% stock surge, continues to ride the AI wave into 2025. Its latest quarterly earnings, released after market close Wednesday, showcase a company still firing on all cylinders\u2014yet the market\u2019s response hints at a maturing narrative. With the stock down 2.24% year-to-date entering earnings, investors are wrestling with whether Nvidia\u2019s meteoric rise can sustain its momentum amid economic uncertainty and shifting tech priorities. Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, covering the period ending January 26, 2025, smashed expectations. The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion, a 78% leap from $22.1 billion a year ago and a 12% increase from the prior quarter\u2019s $35.1 billion, according to a press release issued by Nvidia. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share hit $0.89, up 82% year-over-year, while non-GAAP earnings per share matched at $0.89, a 71% annual gain. The data center segment, Nvidia\u2019s AI powerhouse, soared to $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year, driven by booming demand for its Blackwell and Hopper GPU platforms. CEO Jensen Huang touted the results on the Q4 earnings call, saying, \u201cDemand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law\u2014increasing compute makes models smarter.\u201d The Blackwell platform, ramping up to \u201cmassive-scale production,\u201d contributed billions in sales this quarter alone, per Huang\u2019s remarks. Since November 2024, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple have traded sideways, with all three posting negative year-to-date returns. The S&P 500, tethered to these giants, has stalled alongside them as the U.S. economy faces turbulence with incoming policy shifts\u2014tariffs, tax changes, and deregulation\u2014under a new administration. NVDA, AAPL, MSFT 12-Month Returns The two-year rally in Big Tech, propelled by artificial intelligence hype, could be hitting a ceiling as firms pivot from raw compute power to efficiency. Innovations like DeepSeek\u2019s compute-light AI models suggest a future where Nvidia\u2019s dominance might face pressure. Competitors such as AMD and Intel are developing alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s AI offerings. AMD\u2019s Instinct MI300 series has secured adoption in cloud computing environments. However, Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem, supported by its CUDA software platform and established partnerships with major hyperscalers, continues to hold a leading position in the AI chip market. Optimists eyeing AI\u2019s secular growth might see Nvidia\u2019s dip as a buy signal, but broader exposure could be wiser. The Nasdaq and S&P 500\u2014down 3.1% and 1.8% year-to-date, respectively, per today\u2019s close, are laden with AI-adjacent firms, offering upside with less single-stock risk. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings cement its AI supremacy\u2014$130.5 billion in fiscal-year revenue, up 114%, speaks for itself. But as the market digests its maturity and braces for economic twists, the era of unchecked gains may be cooling. Investors should weigh diversification and patience in this volatile new chapter.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"     In the market for a microcurrent device? After two months of testing popular brands like ZIIP, FOREO, NuFACE and Therabody, this is the one I recommend.    I don't yet have mature skin, but over the years, I've noticed changes in my skin as it ages: mostly a loss of firmness and increased puffiness, especially around my jaw and cheekbones. As a result, I've found myself increasingly curious about microcurrent devices, which are said to provide a lifting effect, increase lymphatic drainage and reduce puffiness, depending on your age, health and lifestyle choices.  Over the past two months, I tested multiple devices to find the best one based on price, modes, accessories, features, FDA clearance, cleaning instructions, app compatibility and the required conductive gel. Below, you can see photos of my face before using each device, after one use and after the recommended five uses per week. Overall, I found the NuFACE TRINITY+ to be the best microcurrent device because it's easy to use, clean and charge. However, I did prefer the ZIIP Electric Complex Gel over any of the other conductive gels because it lasted for the entire treatment. The same goes for ZIIP's Silver Gel, which is specifically for hydration.  I chose the NuFACE TRINITY+ as the best microcurrent device overall because it is just as good as the ZIIP HALO, but offers more manual customization with three levels and a boost button. Storage and charging were effortless thanks to its charging stand and direct-connect cable. While the TRINITY+ feels bulkier in hand, it\u2019s still easy to use, and its rounded globes contour the face smoothly. The TRINITY+ beeps every five seconds to help you keep track of time. You can also use it with the app, which has tutorials with easy-to-follow instructions. While doing the tutorials, you can adjust the intensity, but since some of them are longer, I tended to stick with the lowest intensity to avoid sensitivity issues. I appreciated that the tutorials on the app have you turn your device off and on between steps, giving you time to reapply the gel activator. The app also allows you to take selfies to track progress and offers custom reminders. While the ZIIP Electric Complex Gel is my favorite because it lasts the entire treatment, I did appreciate the design of the NuFACE Aqua Gel Activator. It comes in an airless pump jar that makes it easy to grab the gel with a finger and apply it in the middle of a treatment. However, it does not last throughout the entire treatment -- hence the pauses during tutorials for application.  Cleaning is also a breeze. After each treatment, I simply used a reusable cotton round and rubbing alcohol to clean the globes.  I used this device after dealing with the stress of the Los Angeles fires, so I really put it to the test. As you can see from my \"before\" photo below (which I forgot to take in my bathroom), my face was much puffier prior to using the device. After five days, my cheekbones were more contoured, my eyebrows were more level and there was less redness on my face. My face felt tighter and more lifted. I loved using the ZIIP HALO because it fits nicely in the hand and features vibrations and beeps to help time your treatment. It also glows to indicate when a treatment has started upon contact with your skin. There\u2019s no need to tinker with different modes, and its app --created by founder and leading electrical esthetician Melanie Simon -- offers thorough, helpful tutorials. It also combines microcurrent with nanocurrent, which mimics the electric impulses sent from the brain to your skin cells, stimulating collagen, elastin and ATP production. If you choose not to use the app, the HALO comes programmed with a four-minute nanocurrent and microccurent facial called The Lift.  The included Electric Complex Gel lasts for the whole treatment and doesn't need to be reapplied, unlike the other conductive gels I tried. The same goes for the Silver Gel for hydration, which I was also sent and loved. Of all the devices I tested, I found the ZIIP Halo to be the easiest one to use, so I think it would be perfect for beginners or people who want a more straightforward microcurrent device that still gets the job done. The globes were nicely spaced and I enjoyed their flatter surface, which made it easy to move around on the skin. To clean it, simply wipe it down with isopropyl alcohol and a soft cloth.  Regarding improvement, it would be great if the ZIIP HALO came with its own stand. Plus, to charge it, you need a wall adapter with a maximum 5V output, so if you don't have that on hand (Apple ones won't work), you'll need to purchase one. When it needs to be charged, the band around the device's center will glow orange.  I also enjoyed using the FOREO BEAR 2 and noticed a difference in both the feel and appearance of my face -- more contoured cheekbones, less puffiness and a slimmer jawline. I especially enjoyed the device's T-Sonic pulsations, of which there are five types that provide massages with different benefits. Because of this feature, I felt extra relaxed when using the device.  It also has four different types of microcurrent: Advanced Microcurrent, Lifting Microcurrent, Tapping Microcurrent and Sculpting Microcurrent, which are easy to customize on the device's app. BEAR 2\u2019s default setting is in Beginner Mode (intensity levels 1-5), but you can access Pro Mode (intensity levels 6-10) on the app. I stuck with beginner mode since I found it intense enough for me. When I used it on my forehead, I often had to lower the intensity anyway because it felt extra tingly. As recommended by FOREO, you should not use the device for over three minutes on one area of the face.  In terms of the design, I like how it fits nicely in the hand and would be easy to travel with. It also has a one-button interface, which makes it simple to use without the app. Since BEAR 2 is waterproof, you can wash it with soap and water, which made it easier because I didn't have to use an alcohol wipe or prepare one with a reuseable cotton swab.  As for the app, I thought the treatments were fun and easy to follow. I also like that the app provides even more personalization and Pro Mode. However, there were too many ads that took away from my experience.  While the FOREO SUPERCHARGED Serum 2.0 has a luxurious, lightweight feel, it absorbs fast, making it difficult to keep up with tutorials while reapplying. Since the tutorials don't pause for you to reapply like the NuFace ones, you'll have to do this manually.  The device came with a USB charging cable, which plugged directly into the BEAR 2 and made it easy to charge. I also like that it came with a small stand and pouch for travel. If you're looking for a device that combines multiple treatments in one, the TheraFace PRO is a great option. Like the FOREO BEAR 2, it provides massage but has three different attachments for minor facial muscle pain in the head, face, jaw and neck. It also comes with a cleansing ring and LED light therapy ring with red, blue and infrared light. For the microcurrent, there are three intensity levels. Though the TheraFace feels slightly heavier than the other devices I tested, it was still easy to use and maneuver across the face. The globes were also larger but not as large as the NuFACE. It beeps every 15 seconds for all treatments, but I wish it were customized to beep when the device needs to move on for microcurrent. However, I understand that the 15 seconds makes it more universal, since it's used for all the different attachments.  Though I tried the app, I preferred doing my own thing. I wish the tutorials included more voice instructions to provide additional context on the treatments and guidance on what to do. This would also improve accessibility. I also found some treatments to be a bit long, like the 17-minute Ultimate Face Lift, which is microcurrent-specific. For the longer treatments, even though high intensity was recommended, I switched to low because I felt that the high setting was uncomfortable -- especially when you have to hold the device on certain parts of the face.  Though I like the TheraFace stand, I wish it had a built-in charging port like the NuFACE. Cleaning it was easy with a damp cloth, and I allowed it to dry completely in its stand on my bathroom countertop.  Similar to some of the other gels I tested, the TheraOne Conductive Gel absorbed fast and had to be reapplied throughout the treatment.  After finishing the microcurrent testing, I tried the LED light therapy and massage features. I enjoyed them both, and it was great having all these different treatment modalities in one device. On the app, some tutorials combine the different treatments, which will help create a more complete routine. You can also sort by the specific treatment you want, which I did for microcurrent.  Skin Gym Microcurrent Wand: Unfortunately, this device is not FDA-approved, so I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending it. If you do purchase it, I would be careful about the intensity and around the eyes, since it made spots appear across my vision briefly during use. The instructions for this device do not say anything about using it on the sides of the neck, so I avoided that area. It also requires batteries and cannot be recharged, which I personally don't find to be ideal. The device itself felt lighter and cheaper than the other devices, which makes sense, as it costs $99. As for the gel, like many of the others I tested, it did not last throughout the entire treatment. I tested each of the microcurrent devices once a day for five days as part of my morning skincare routine, after cleansing my face and before I applied moisturizer and sunscreen. I tested each for five days because that's the frequency recommended in the instructions. I also tested each along with the brand's recommended conductive gel. I took photos of my face before using each device, after one use and after five days of use to see if any differences could be noted. I did nothing extra to my skin during the testing process and followed my normal skincare routine with no new products. I simply used a cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen and eye cream. I left at least two days of downtime in between testing each device. While testing, I paid attention to the device's design, included accessories, added features, intensity levels, the app and its tutorials, FDA approval, cleaning and charging.  For background info, I have sensitive, rosacea-prone skin and get hormonal breakouts on my chin. I did not experience any sensitivity or redness issues when using these devices.   Cost: At-home microcurrent devices are on the more expensive side. If you want to purchase a microcurrent device, be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars or wait for a sale. However, an at-home microcurrent device is less expensive than several professional treatments but may not offer results that are as fast or noticeable. FDA approval: The FDA protects the public's health by regulating human drugs, food, medical devices and more. According to the agency, a manufacturer must demonstrate with \"sufficient, valid scientific evidence that there is a reasonable assurance that the devices are safe and effective for their intended uses.\" By ensuring that your microcurrent device is FDA-approved, you can be assured that it is safe to use.  Features: Do you want your microcurrent device to have three intensity levels or more? Do you want it to also be able to massage your face, like the FOREO BEAR 2 or TheraFace Pro? Are you interested in LED light therapy, which the TheraFace Pro also has? What about nanocurrent, which the ZIIP HALO has? Before purchasing a microcurrent device, consider what you want it to be able to do for you. Included accessories: After my testing, I found that I preferred devices that come with a stand -- especially if it has a built-in charging port, like the NuFACE. However, if you don't have the bathroom countertop space for a stand, perhaps a device without a stand, like the ZIIP HALO, is better. Something else you will want to consider is if the conductive gel is included or must be purchased separately.  App: If you want helpful tutorials to follow, you will want to make sure you like the app that comes with the microcurrent device. Of all the ones I tested, my favorites were the NuFACE and ZIIP apps.  Always follow manufacturer instructions when using a microcurrent device. Generally speaking, you should start by cleansing and drying your skin. Next, apply a conductive gel, which will help the device transmit current into the skin and allow you to easily maneuver it across the face. After selecting the desired intensity level (if you're a beginner, start low), use light pressure to glide the device upward and outward on the face and neck. Avoid the center of the neck, which is where your thyroid is. Instead, focus on the jaw, forehead, cheekbones and side of your neck. Wash the gel off your face and repeat based on manufacturer instructions.  To clean your microcurrent device, follow manufacturer instructions. These can vary from having you use a damp cloth, dry soft cloth, alcohol wipe or soap and water to clean the device. Make sure it dries completely before next use.  Also follow the brand's instructions for charging the device. Some require charging before first use.   Though less powerful than professional treatments, microcurrent devices can provide noticeable differences if you use them consistently and according to manufacturer instructions. During my testing, I noticed and felt my skin tighten and lift, giving me more contoured cheekbones and a more defined jawline. However, the effects can also depend on your age, health status and lifestyle choices. You may want to consult a professional if you're looking for a more immediate, intense treatment. However, this can require multiple treatments, which will add up in cost over time. When used as directed, microcurrent devices are safe. However, if you have certain medical conditions like epilepsy or implanted electric devices like a pacemaker, you should avoid using a microcurrent device. Unless your doctor says it's okay, you should also avoid using a microcurrent device during pregnancy.  To ensure the safety of a microcurrent device, make sure it is FDA-approved. All recommended devices on this list have been FDA-approved. Microcurrent devices emit low electric current levels into the skin. This can improve muscle tone, fine lines and wrinkles, tighten the skin and aid in lymphatic drainage.  Depending on your aim, a microcurrent device can be worth it. For me, personally, I want something easy and safe for at-home use and don't want to pay for multiple professional treatments. Since a microcurent device does not require multiple payments across treatments and can be FDA-approved for safety, I found it to be worth it.  No, it is not okay to use microcurrent every day. This can cause muscle fatigue, skin irritation and swelling. In my experience, most manufacturers recommend using a microcurrent device once a day for five days a week. Make sure to follow the specific instructions for your device.  When you see results depends on your age, health and lifestyle choices, and whether you use the device consistently according to manufacturer instructions. For me, I felt results immediately but noticed them after a few days of use.  Microcurrent devices are safe when used as directed. However, some people may experience temporary redness or tingling during use. I personally noticed mild tingling, which was my signal to lower the intensity or apply more conductive gel.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":" The handheld gaming PC market is becoming a little more exciting with the involvement of top PC vendors. The Lenovo Legion Go, for example, introduced removable controllers similar to Nintendo Switch Joy-cons, and now its Legion Go S successor is breaking Steam OS out of its Steam Deck cage. Even before the big names joined the bandwagon, there were already a few brands blazing the trail and innovating in this space, but one of them might have hit a major snag along the way. AYANEO is probably known to PC gamers and market watchers for its aggressive and fast-paced progress in the handheld gaming space. It recently revealed what is probably the world\u2019s first handheld PC with modular controls, a rather bold move for a relatively smaller brand. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not all sunshine and roses apparently, as the company just announced the abrupt cancellation of another one of its ambitious designs. Designer: AYANEO        It has almost been a year since the AYANEO Flip successfully ended its run on Indiegogo. The handheld device actually came in two designs, though both of them sported the same basic clamshell mechanism. The Flip KB had a small QWERTY keyboard flanked by Xbox-style controls, giving gamers the ability to quickly type out messages in chat or maybe even send emails on the go.        Perhaps more interesting is the AYANEO Flip DS, which swaps out that keyboard for a second screen. In other words, it is reminiscent of the Nintendo DS, except larger and chunkier, both of which might have used \u201cDS\u201d to mean \u201cdual-screen.\u201d The second and smaller display on the lower half of the device provided access to special tools, chat, and basically anything else you can cram into an extended monitor. Presuming, of course, things worked out properly.   Just like many crowdfunded products, the AYANEO Flip experienced no small amount of delays, which in itself could have already been signs of trouble brewing. This isn\u2019t the small company\u2019s first rodeo, after all, and it has proven itself more than capable of fulfilling orders. Indeed, some early adopters already received their units, so when AYANEO announced it was canceling orders and offering refunds, backers were understandably perplexed and disappointed.    Naturally, there are many theories as to the cancellation, including the threat of Nintendo\u2019s lawyers hounding AYANEO for the DS-like version. That, however, wouldn\u2019t explain why the KB version would be canceled as well. The lack of an official explanation didn\u2019t sit well with backers and fans of the brand, raising concerns about whether the company can\u2019t keep up with its own rapid pace and the hype that it had set for itself.

If you're in the market for a great deal on wireless earbuds, you might appreciate this one. Right now, you can get $70 off the Beats Powerbeats Pro, a last-gen earbud option that still boasts clear, crisp audio. Additionally, we liked them for their comfortable ear clips, which are perfect for fitness use, and a fair price tag with that brings them down to just $130. While Beats recently launched the Powerbeats Pro 2, which added a nice range of fitness features, the original Powerbeats still have that signature Beats audio quality, making them extra competitive with a few bucks knocked off the price tag. Beats Powerbeats Pro: $199.99 $129.99 at Best Buy The Beats Powerbeats Pro are just $130 at Best Buy right now, and a couple of other retailers are also running discounts\u2014though not to the same extent. Best Buy is even throwing in a three-month subscription to Apple Music at no additional cost.  The Powerbeats Pro earbuds were originally launched almost six years ago, but they still hold up as evidenced by their becoming the best-selling Beats ever. They come with a locked-in fit, a reasonable mid-range price, a charging case, and perhaps most importantly, strong audio. If you aren't the type to need the latest release, this might be a good time to pick up some new wireless buds. Price comparison: Amazon - $149.99 | Walmart - $189.00 \u2705Recommended if: you like wireless earbuds that include the sporty over-ear clips; you want true wireless earbuds that include a charging case; you want earbuds with around nine hours of battery life, or up to a full day with the intermittent use of a charging case. \u274cSkip this deal if: you don't like earbuds with over-ear clips or you wear glasses and worry they won't be a good fit together; you need earbuds that have an IPXX rating for water and dust protection, rather than general water resistance; you need earbuds with a physical headphone jack. Although it's been a while since the Beats Powerbeats Pros were released, they've remained the best-sellers for the brand up through the recent release of a next-gen version boasting added fitness features. But if you don't need all the bells and whistles of a new product, the original Powerbeats Pro earbuds are solid, especially when you can grab them at such a competitive price. The charging case includes a Lightning to USB-A charging cable with super quick charging. Per charge, the earbuds themselves get around nine hours of playback time, though Beats says you can get as much as a full days' worth when using the case. In addition to their over-ear clips, which make them a good option for runners or other fitness enthusiasts, they also come with four different-sized ear tips for optimal fit.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Chloe Webb was explaining how she recently sold a Pok\u00e9mon card in her shop for \u00a340,000 when a young boy and his dad politely interrupted to ask for her autograph. Ever since the 31-year-old quit her office job and opened Collector's Cardhouse in the picturesque Hertfordshire village of Chorleywood in April, it has become a destination for fans around the world. \"Every week we have an international visitor - Japan, America, United Arab Emirates - I've made so many friends all over the world, which is crazy to me because I never used to leave my little bubble when I had a normal job,\" she says. \"I live, breathe, and eat Pok\u00e9mon.\" \"I've travelled everywhere around the world, made lifelong friends,\" she adds.  \"It has completely transformed every part of my life and I've got a really successful business now because of it.\" The Japanese franchise started life in 1996 on the Nintendo Game Boy, with players having to catch, train and battle virtual monsters called Pok\u00e9mon.  When it arrived on UK shores in 1999, it had evolved.  There was an animated series and packets of trading cards were available at most newsagents across the country. That's when Mrs Webb, from Watford, became a fan. She began a business with her husband, Harry, selling the cards online just before the pandemic. During lockdown, it \"really blew up\". Mrs Webb started making YouTube videos under the name \"PokiChloe\" to reach new fans. The couple joined forces with another Youtuber, Dean Leander - AKA PokeDean - to open a physical business. Today her Youtube channel, which mostly shows daily life in her Chorleywood shop, has more than 118,000 subscribers. In recent years, Pok\u00e9mon cards have become valuable collectors' items and many shop visitors hope they too could be sitting on a gold mine. Last year, a Nottinghamshire man made \u00a355,000 when he sold a collection of cards from the 1990s and 2000s. But a collector from Suffolk failed to sell his fourth print Charizard card when it did not reach its reserve of \u00a38,000. Mrs Webb explained: \"It could be anything that makes a card collectable.  \"It could be that they're rare... It could be that it's a really popular Pok\u00e9mon. \"Sometimes overnight prices change on cards and I can't tell you why that card is now valuable.\" Sometimes cards worth up to \u00a3100,000 have been brought into the shop, although PokiChloe admits the big sums no longer surprise her.  \"It's going to sound really awful: I'm very used to it now,\" she says.  \"It is very surreal to think that this little bit of cardboard is worth that sort of money because to some people that's a deposit for a house - that could buy them two or three cars. \"But with what we do now we're exposed to it. Often it's just another day and another Pok\u00e9mon card.\" Many of the visitors who arrive at Collector's Cardhouse come with large binders tucked under their arms filled with cards they stashed away in their childhood.  Many of these collections are, unfortunately, not worth anything.  If, however, PokiChloe does deem a card valuable, it then has to be \"graded\". The process involves sending the card to a grading company who analyse it for signs of wear and then award it a graded score, usually out of 10, which denotes its quality and potential value. PokiChloe compared those cards that get a 10 to \"gold dust\". \"It has to be completely clean,\" she says.  \"There can't be scratches on the holographic part, there can't be any whitening or damage on the back, it can't be creased. It has to be perfect like it's never been touched before. \"We had a Charizard that was graded a 10. It was a special card that was given out to employees at Creatures, who own Pok\u00e9mon. I think there's only 300 of them and we had a 10 and we sold it for just under \u00a340,000.\" Mrs Webb said a common misunderstanding is that a card has to be old to be valuable. \"There are packs that you could open today from the shop that cost you about \u00a330,\" she says. \"If you got the best card in the set and it was graded a 10, you'd be looking at a couple of thousand. \"And they're cards that only came out a few years ago. So they're not even what we would call vintage. They're modern cards.\" A graded card, regardless of how damaged it is, is sealed in plastic to preserve its condition.  Mrs Webb said: \"We get people that send off cards that aren't in good condition. They just want to encapsulate it and keep it as a memory. So that's quite nice to see. \"I know the money is a big part of it and obviously people are blown away by the prices, but for some people it's about the memories, the nostalgia and just having some memories from when they were kids.\" Next year Pok\u00e9mon is celebrating its 30th anniversary. PokiChloe has ambitious plans for the future of Collector's Cardhouse. \"I want to keep this growing,\" she says. \"If you'd asked me about this five years ago I wouldn't have believed it. I used to work in an office, I had a very normal job before this, and now this is my life... So, as long as people enjoy it, I'm going to keep doing it.\" Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Alexa Plus is more conversational, smarter, and free for those with a Prime subscription.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Amazon seems to finally be getting on the AI train, so to speak, as it launched the new Alexa Plus this week. According to the company, this newly supercharged AI powered assistant is more intuitive, understanding the user's needs more effortlessly than the previous model. The company claims that Alexa Plus is trained to not only summarize complex topics but also manage and \"protect your home, make reservations, and help you track, discover, and enjoy new artists.\" Amazon seems to be bringing a multi-faceted approach to all of its products by integrating Alexa Plus within them. Users will be able to find or buy anything online with just a quick voice command to this AI-powered assistant. Amazon further stated that it had to practically rebuild the new assistant using tech that connects a variety of large language models (LLMs), which will help it interact with other services across the globe. \"To achieve this, we created a concept called 'experts' \u2014 groups of systems, capabilities, APIs, and instructions that accomplish specific types of tasks for customers,\" the release added.  This means that Alexa Plus can seamlessly connect to varied applications and services that are outside the Amazon universe as well. As a result, the company's assistant can cross-communicate with a wide range of apps, including streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu, and also home devices from companies like Philips Hue and Roborock. Additionally, Alexa Plus can also be directed to complete tasks on the user's behalf behind the scenes. For instance, if your oven needs fixing, Alexa Plus will be able to look for the service provider online and arrange the repair based on your schedule \u2014 all without the user's intervention. Like any other AI assistant on the market, Alexa Plus can answer questions like \"What is the lowest point in any ocean on earth?\u201d or just something vague like \u201cWhat\u2019s the song that Bradley Cooper sings at the start of that country music movie?\" However, users can go a step further and upload documents, emails, or photos \u2014 via a desktop browser or the mobile app \u2014 for the assistant to analyze and summarize for them if needed, a feature Gemini recently opened up to free users. Lastly, Amazon says that the user gets to control information that is shared with the AI assistant via a built-in Privacy dashboard on the app. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android This new and improved Alexa Plus comes for $19.99 per month for those not subscribed to Amazon Prime. However, if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, access to Alexa Plus is free, adding even more value to the subscription. It will roll out in the U.S. in the coming weeks for Echo Show owners, although you'll need to sign up for early access to get it. Everyone else will receive Alexa Plus over the coming months.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Reviews for the iPhone 16e have arrived, offering a lot of praise for the new device but also plenty of criticism about one omission in particular: the removal of MagSafe. But according to Apple representatives who spoke with John Gruber, the feature\u2019s absence won\u2019t actually be a problem for most users. MagSafe\u2019s removal is one of Apple\u2019s iPhone 16e choices that has seemed the most perplexing to many. But it sounds like Apple doesn\u2019t think it will matter to the product\u2019s target audience. John Gruber writes at Daring Fireball: One week into using the 16e as my main phone, and I still miss MagSafe as much as I did the first night.  But according to Apple representatives, most people in the 16e\u2019s target audience exclusively charge their phones by plugging them into a charging cable. They tend not to use inductive charging at all On one hand this makes sense. If Apple has market research proving that the vast majority of its target market won\u2019t use MagSafe, then removing it may not actually matter much. I wonder, though, who that market really is. For example, is Apple mainly targeting former iPhone SE customers with the iPhone 16e? If so, the fact that those users always charge with a cable could be for a very simple reason: they\u2019ve never had the option of MagSafe. It\u2019s one thing if charging with a cable is an intentional preference for iPhone 16e buyers. But if Apple thinks its customers won\u2019t care just because their current habit involves a cable, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a fair judgment. I'm glad this article points out that the behavior of customers may be due to the previous SE not having MagSafe, because that's a very solid explanation for why those user might not have used wireless charging. Apple essentially saying \"They didn't use the bad experience, so we assume they don't want the good experience\" is flawed logic.  Apple should also recognize that people can and do use MagSafe outside of charging situations. I have an iPhone 16 Pro and almost exclusively use wired charging because it's faster and more efficient, but I have a MagSafe mount in a vehicle that doesn't have CarPlay. I also have a MagSafe PopSocket wallet that simply...wouldn't work with this device.  It sounds like Apple is grasping for an explanation that sounds plausible at first glance...but quickly falls apart with any kind of critical thought. The previous iPhone SE supported wireless charging, but never MagSafe. So users would have encountered an inferior form of wireless charging, and potentially stuck with wired charging as a result. But maybe Apple knows that even for iPhone 12, 13, and 14 owners who might be upgrading, those users tend not to care about MagSafe. Or the vast ecosystem of MagSafe accessories that goes beyond charging. The iPhone 16e is almost in users\u2019 hands, so we should find out soon What do you think about Apple\u2019s MagSafe explanation? Let us know in the comments.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Investors are too complacent, AI is overhyped, and cryptocurrencies threaten the dollar's dominance, Paul Singer warned. Stock markets are \"just about as risky as I've ever seen,\" the Elliott Management founder told the \"In Good Company with Nicolai Tangen\" podcast this week. Several years without a major downturn have \"lulled people into thinking that they'll always be bailed out, that there'll never be another bear market,\" Singer said. The podcast is hosted by the CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees Norway's oil fund. The activist investor, who said his firm manages about $72 billion of assets, cautioned that leverage and risk-taking are rising in markets and among governments. Singer said it was \"absolutely astonishing\" that numerous central banks kept interest rates close or below zero for so long. \"We're talking about deep recession-type spending programs, spending deficits, support programs at a time when there was no real recession,\" the billionaire said about the stimulus bonanza that followed the pandemic. Singer said that AI is \"way over its skis\" in terms of valuation, and its utility is \"way exaggerated.\" Elliott's president, co-chief executive, and co-chief investor also flagged the wave of governments embracing crypto, suggesting it could cause countries' money supply to go \"hog wild.\" A broad shift from dollars to digital tokens threatens the buck's status on the world stage, Singer said. He highlighted the de-dollarization trend, where countries like Russia and China that aren't happy with the greenback's primacy are seeking out substitutes. \"If governments are supporting or endorsing cryptos, it's an alternative to the dollar as the reserve currency,\" Singer said. He questioned why American officials would back a rival to their own country's currency: \"It makes my head spin.\" Elliott has previously warned that AI company valuations are too high. The firm's bosses said in a letter to clients last year, obtained by The Financial Times, that Nvidia and its peers were in \"bubble land\" and the AI buzz was excessive. The firm's latest portfolio update shows it used bearish put options to bet against not just AI darling Nvidia but also exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Today\u2019s Apple deal highlights start off with prices dropping even lower on select MacBook configs. Firstly, the 15-inch M3 MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM is now $420 off the original price before the RAM upgrade alongside models from $899. Then it\u2019s the M4 Pro MacBook Pro \u2013 the 16-inch model with 48GB of RAM is now $308 off \u2013 alongside M4 iPad Pro Magic Keyboards at up to $114 off. Apple Pencil Pro, AirTags, and official Apple Watch bands also join the fray today alongside everything else you\u2019ll find below.\u00a0 We recently detailed the return of discounted stock at Amazon on the current-generation M3 MacBook Air lineup starting from $899. While much of those deals are still live, we wanted to touch down this morning after seeing the 15-inch model with 16GB of RAM and the upgraded 512GB storage fell down to $1,279 shipped. It has now dropped an additional $20 compared to our previous mention to slightly undercut the $200 price drops ($400 off the original price before the RAM upgrade) across the rest of the lineup right now. Details below. We have detailed this previously more than a few times, but just as a quick reminder, you\u2019re looking at $220 off the current $1,499 list price on this configuration, but $420 off the price this exact same machine sold for back in October before Apple issued the official RAM upgrade without raising the price. We have seen some limited offers on this model and a few others for a slightly less, over the holidays and Black Friday last year, but with stock starting to get a little bit dicey on the M3 MacBook Air at Apple Stores and elsewhere, and the solid price drop we are looking at here today, it is worth a mention for folks not looking to spend the full list price on the new M4 Airs we are expecting this year. Prefer you the new M4 Mac mini instead? We are still tracking some rare deals across all three of the stock configurations starting from $549 shipped right now \u2013 all of the details you need are right here. Update: Amazon has dropped the price on the 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro 48GB\/512GB once again, now starting down at a $2,591 shipped all-time low \u2013 that\u2019s $308 off the regular price. While we are still tracking a solid $200 price drop on the most affordable entry-level M4 MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM, Amazon has now brought back all-time low for the first time on an elevated 16-inch configuration. You\u2019ll now find the 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 48GB of RAM and the 512GB SSD on sale for $2,599 shipped. This is a $2,899 configuration seeing a $300 price drop at Amazon to mark the return of all-time low pricing.       This morning Woot launched a new Apple sale, mostly filled with older gear in refurbished condition, but you will find the latest M4 iPad Pro Magic Keyboards in there starting from $279.99 Prime shipped (a $6 delivery fee will apply). There\u2019s up to $50 in savings here on \u201cnew (open-box)\u201d units with 90-day Woot warranties, but you might want to consider the \u201cexcellent condition\u201d Best Buy open-box listings with proper 1-year warranties from Apple instead \u2013 they go for even less than the Woot deals today. Details below. It\u2019s hard to say exactly what \u201cnew (open-box)\u201d means in the case on Woot. While it is certainly a reliable source for deals of all sorts, refurbs and open-box units included, the Best Buy prices are much lower. And in that case you\u2019re getting Geek Squad-verified units that are said to look and function like new, have been restored to factory settings, and include a 1-year Apple warranty. All of that said, the real difference here for us is the price \u2013 Woot\u2019s offers are up to $50 off but you can score as much as $114 at Best Buy right now. For the record, Amazon\u2019s listing for the latest M4 iPad Pro Magic Keyboard have been largely out of stock as of late, including both the 11-inch and 13-inch models. Here\u2019s how the discounted open-box listings shake out at Best Buy right now across all four models: FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"It is a common problem: I have a USB device on a computer out in the shop, and I want to use it from the comfort of my office. What to do? Well, you could remote desktop into the distant machine. But, honestly, I always find any remote desktop more than ssh clunky and somewhat undesirable. Fortunately, Linux can do virtually anything if you only know how to do it. So, this time, I\u2019ll show you how to transport a USB device over your network. Of course, I have a network that reaches out to the shop. It should be a simple matter to tell my desktop machine that one of its USB devices lives across the network. Well, it wasn\u2019t that simple, but it is doable. The whole thing involves a program called usbip. That should be the end of it, but of course, it isn\u2019t. In order for this to work, both machines on the network will need some kernel modules and a daemon on the server: the machine with the USB devices to share. You may be able to install usbip from your package manager. On Ubuntu, it is in the linux-tools-common package, so a simple apt-get might give you everything you need. I wasn\u2019t so lucky. I use a custom kernel (xanmod), so I had a problem. While I had the kernel modules, I didn\u2019t have the client tools and the ones in the standard repository are tied to your kernel version. Running the stock versions gave me an error message. So I had to find a way to make things myself. Here\u2019s what you need in the way of kernel modules on the server: usbip_core, usbip_host. You also need usbipd (the daemon). On both machines, you need the control program, usbip. On the client machine, you need the vhci_hcd module. If you can get all this working and with compatible versions, you are pretty much home-free. In my case, I had to download my kernel source and find the tools\/usb\/usbip directory. Normally, you can build everything with the Makefile in tools\/, but this seems to be a special case. You run the autogen.sh file to create the build setup. Then do a .\/configure and a make. A make install will finish things up. Just be sure that where it installs for you is where you run the tools in the next steps. Many people use a Raspberry Pi as a sort of USB server. In that case, the setup is pretty easy: That should get you everything you need. For that matter, if you run a pretty stock version of Ubuntu, you might try: For anything else, you\u2019ll need to do some homework. Assuming you have everything ready, you need to do several things. First, you must load the modules on both the server and the client. Then, you need to run the daemon on the server. You can bind one or more USB devices to the server using the command line tool. Notice that the USB device has to be free; once you bind it to the server, you can\u2019t use it directly anymore. You\u2019ll then connect with the client. Again, one client acquires the device, and that\u2019s it. It can\u2019t be shared. Sure, you can release it, and someone else can get it. Or the server can drop it, returning the device for local use. However, while the server has the device, only one client can use that device at any given time. Loading the modules is easy with modprobe, although over the long term, you probably want to add them to \/etc\/modules-load.d so they will load at boot time. For now, on the server, try: On the client: You\u2019ll also have to run usbipd on the server. You can do that in any way you usually run a daemon, including systemd, rc.local, or whatever. For now, just run it as root from the command line. You need to find at least one device to share, so from the server try: This will give you a list of devices. What you want is the \u201cbus id.\u201d Suppose it is 4-3.1. You\u2019ll bind that device to the server: Now, from the client, you should be able to see the device: You can then attach to it: A good first test is to share a USB drive over the network. There are other ways to do this, but it is easy to see that it works with standard software. Here\u2019s a transcript, assuming root prompts on both server and client, along with all the preliminary setup: Note that you have to detach by port number, even though everything else takes a bus ID, which is somewhat dynamic across reboots. Also, if the system suspends, you may have to reshare the device. To summarize, you can use variations of the list command to show local or remote devices. If you ask the server to show you remote devices on 127.0.0.1, you can easily see what devices are exported. On the client, the port command shows you what\u2019s connected. On the server, you bind or unbind devices. On the client, you attach and detach. Once the device attaches, it looks like any other USB port on your system. Pretty cool! If the command line isn\u2019t your thing, we noticed a Hackaday.io project aimed at creating a Qt GUI for the client work. It doesn\u2019t seem to be active, but it might be something to try or someplace to start. There are two clients for using USB devices on Windows. The newer one requires you to be in test signing mode and has several other warnings. It originally forked from an older version that some people prefer and may support the server part, too. I haven\u2019t tried it, so if you want to explore using Windows, you are on your own but do report what you find in the comments. Usually, we want our USB cables shorter, not longer. We wonder if a USB keyboard and monitor with a Pi server could make a good remote terminal. Thanks for the tip as I\u2019ve never heard of this.   May have to explore it a bit. I just use standard  NFS.  Mount an external USB drive (my drives are formatted ext4) to a folder, say \/mnt\/usbdrive and export the folder so every one on the network can access it (they have to mount it of course to use).  I don\u2019t have any Windoze machines in my home network however. Keep in mind I only use the USB drive because it was something easy to visualize. But really the value is using it for things like serial ports and specialized devices. So I use it to carry audio over the network for example. Thanks.  Now it makes a bit more sense on the how this can be used\u2026 Not just for File I\/O. Yeah, I\u2019ve mentioned USB-over-IP before in this series of articles and everyone\u2019s response is always like \u201cwhat are you talking about.\u201d I\u2019m amazed more people don\u2019t know about it. Digi actually makes networked USB hubs you just buy (using the same protocol) although there are some limitations on Linux. I use usbip  along with udev rules to automount devices across my lan.   One thing about usbip is that the data is not encrypted, so to secure the connection I use an ssh tunnel.  I create the tunnel from the host with the usb device to the remoteHost like this: \/usr\/bin\/ssh -i  -C -N -R localhost:3240:localhost:3240 @ Then on the remoteHost, you can usbip list -r localhost sudo \/usr\/bin\/usbip attach -r localhost -b  Hopefully this is useful for others. My replacement args seem to have been  sanitized out of the comment\u2026   Let me try using arg instead\u2026 \/usr\/bin\/ssh -i  ident -C -N -R localhost:3240:localhost:3240 user@remoteHost sudo \/usr\/bin\/usbip attach -r localhost -b addr I use a pi zero w as a hub and have a keyboard, mouse, spacemouse and streamdeck connected. The streamdeck runs scripts to switch between USB\/IP hosts using https:\/\/github.com\/timothycrosley\/streamdeck-ui I used usbip it to flash an usb barcode reader via a wan connection :D I regularly use usbip on Windows 11 to interact with serial devices from WSL. It\u2019s a very quick setup, all you need is a PowerShell (admin) one-liner to install the program and you\u2019re set, assuming you already have a WSL2 distro installed. Install with winget install --interactive --exact dorssel.usbipd-win and then bind and attach devices as in Al\u2019s examples. The only differences are that you call usbipd rather than usbip and that you specify --wsl [distro] rather than an IP address when attaching (I assume it works with remote hosts but haven\u2019t tried myself). Also, you don\u2019t need to attach on the client side in this case\u2013the devices just show up. There\u2019s not much more to it than this but the page to reference for more info is https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wsl\/connect-usb I have used it to access a oscilloscope mounted at the top of a mast. Just because the editor mentioned that they have found all tested remote tools to be clunky for them. I recommend moonlight and sunshine. I\u2019ve tried many tools as well and this one is just a far better experience than any of the ones I tried! I wonder how usable USBIP is on latency sensitive devices that are also relatively high bandwidth, like webcams, capture devices, multi-channel audio interfaces. I briefly tried to use it a while back with a printer, more as fun experoment than anything else. While i did get it to work,  something kept breaking, making unreliable for me (do not remember what). Anyway,  setting up a print server in a VM (PCI passthrough of a USB host controller for the printer connection) seemed like (and has proven to be) a more practical and more reliable option. You can also run USBIP on a DD-WRT (and probably OpenWRT) powered gateway router. Again, that worked for me at the time, when I tested it, but had reliability issues in my setup.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Following its reveal back in 2020, Sydney Fish Market is now almost complete. The building has been fitted with an ambitious timber roof that's designed to resemble fish scales and weighs 2,500 tons. The Sydney Fish Market is designed by Danish studio 3XN \u2013 in collaboration with BVN, GXN Innovation, and Aspect Studios \u2013 and is part of a larger scheme to revitalize the city's Blackwattle Bay. It's the roof which is its most impressive feature: with a length of 200 m (656 ft), its structure is composed of 594 glulam (glued laminated wood) roof beams \u2013 with the longest beams stretching up to 32 m (104 ft) \u2013 topped by aluminum panels, which are the parts designed to look like fish scales. The roof's installation took a couple of years and required three cranes, which would raise timber sections weighing the equivalent of roughly 17 passenger cars, and place them into position. In addition to all that timber and aluminum, the roof has integrated solar panels, which will help reduce its power draw on the grid, in addition to a rainwater collection system for irrigation. It also features skylights that allow indirect light to illuminate the interior's upper levels. It's certainly an impressive design and Multiplex says it's the largest of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. Though the fish market is now nearing completion, there's still a little work left to do. The roof requires some finishing touches including waterproofing, which will follow in the weeks ahead. Additionally, the interior needs to be finished too. This will feature lots of natural light thanks to the skylights already mentioned, plus a transparent facade made up of aluminum and glass, with glazed louvers. It also has an open and flexible layout and is flanked by public plazas. It's set to open in the coming months. \"This building will serve many functions when it is completed: a vibrant fish market, an attractive amenity for the city, a cultural destination, an urban connector, and an inspiring icon along the world-renowned Sydney Harbour,\" explains Kim Herforth Nielsen, Founding Partner and Creative Director, 3XN.

I guess the news isn\u2019t sensational enough for the reporters who wrote about DeepSeek the past month. pic.twitter.com\/lAInNpShNWFebruary 27, 2025 Meta's AI lead scientist Yann LeCun attributed DeepSeek's overnight success to it being an open-source model: \"They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people's work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.\" DeepSeek's launch led to a dramatic shift in the market, causing NVIDIA's stock price to plummet. This translated to a $500 billion loss in market valuation (arguably the biggest loss in history in a single day). The AI model raised investor concern after it was revealed that it gave proprietary models from sought-after companies, including Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5, a run for their money at a fraction of their development cost. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. DeepSeek researchers say the R1 model surpasses OpenAI's o1 reasoning model capabilities across math, science, and coding at 3% of the cost. However, a separate report suggested that there was more to the R1 model than the researchers were leading on. DeepSeek reportedly spent more than the highlighted $6 million and 2,048 AI GPUs to train its R1 model. The report details that the Chinese AI startup spent up to $1.6 billion in hardware, including 50,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. To that end, it's increasingly becoming difficult to pinpoint the cause of DeepSeek's downward trajectory, especially after its broad adoption during its launch. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touts DeepSeek's cost-effective model as impressive, he indicated that OpenAI is better positioned to develop models, potentially creating a clear path toward AGI. The world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. Look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. This happened after OpenAI had made its $500 billion commitment to its Stargate project, designed to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States for advanced AI projects. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's model as \"super impressive,\" urging stakeholders to monitor developments in China. DeepSeek faces several issues, including the stringent AI chip exportation rules imposed by the Biden-Harris administration, blocking the shipment of chips to China for AI advances. Former OpenAI board member Helen Toner indicated that DeepSeek is not leading the pack in the AI landscape, but if US President Donald J. Trump revokes the NVIDIA chip export ban, it might be a huge win for China. \"It doesn\u2019t make any sense to try to walk it back. We\u2019ve paid the price \u2026 putting China on high alert that chips are a strategic technology, and incentivizing the whole global supply chain to avoid using U.S. components so as not to be subject to extraterritorial controls.\"  Last year, a report suggested that AI might be a fad, further highlighting that users aren't incorporating advanced tools into the workflows for more efficiency and effectiveness. More recently, during Windows Central's weekend discussion on AI and its usefulness, it became apparent that more users are seemingly hopping onto the AI bandwagon. The vast majority of the audience indicated that they use Microsoft's Copilot and ChatGPT for a wide range of tasks. However, some users cited critical accuracy and consistency issues. Last year, a detailed study by Gartner predicted that 30% of AI-themed projects will be abandoned by investors by 2025 after proof of concept. Gartner attributed its findings to top executives struggling to identify a profitable path despite their hefty investment in the landscape: \"After last year's hype, executives are impatient to see returns on GenAI investments, yet organizations are struggling to prove and realize value. As the scope of initiatives widen, the financial burden of developing and deploying GenAI models is increasingly felt.\" Interestingly, a separate report suggested that an overreliance and dependence on these AI tools may lead to critical health issues, including the deterioration of cognitive faculties. The Microsoft study further indicated that AI 'atrophies' critical thinking. Aside from establishing a clear path to profitability, generative AI still faces a fair share of challenges as it rapidly advances, including high operation costs, high electricity and water consumption, and more. This happened after multiple reports indicated that top AI labs, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, had hit scaling laws, preventing them from developing advanced AI models. However, top executives, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, disputed the claims, indicating that there was no evidence that scaling laws have begun stunting AI progression. \"There's no wall,\" added Altman. To that end, it will be interesting to see how DeepSeek competes against the emerging AI models with reasoning capabilities or if it disappears into the horizon before hitting its prime time.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Papa John\u2019s is gaining ground in the competitive pizza market, outperforming Domino\u2019s as the latter struggles with a tough macroeconomic environment.  \u201cWe navigated a dynamic, operating and competitive environment while setting in motion near-term strategic priorities,\u201d Papa John\u2019s CEO Todd Penegor said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Feb. 27.  Papa John\u2019s delivered a stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit of 63 cents per share, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 50 cents, according to FactSet (FDS+0.16%). The Kentucky-based chain\u2019s revenue declined 7% to $531 million during the period, but it still beat analysts\u2019 forecast of $516.6 million. Sales were down across the vendor\u2019s North American and international markets.  Despite these mixed results, Penegor said the company is focused on taking market share from rivals and driving sales in the near term to increase profitability. He added that this involves allocating an additional $25 million in marketing investments.  Domino\u2019s is facing its own challenges, some of which its wildly popular \u201cEmergency Pizza\u201d hasn\u2019t been able to remedy. The company\u2019s CFO, Sandeep Reddy, acknowledged the \u201ctough macroeconomic environment\u201d during the firm\u2019s Feb. 24 earnings call, signaling growing volatility in the market.  Domino\u2019s CEO Russell Weiner added that competitors are offering similar deals, making it harder to stand out. \u201cThere are a lot of folks doing similar promotions that we do,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have a strong slate of initiatives primed and ready to go,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cYou can expect a similar cadence of promotions as we believe it\u2019s going to be another challenging year ahead in the industry.\u201d But even so, Weiner noted that Domino\u2019s remains bullish about its delivery partnership with Uber (UBER-2.36%), calling it a \u201c$1 billion opportunity.\u201d  Meanwhile, Domino\u2019s is also preparing for the potential impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs. CEO Weiner stated that the company\u2019s U.S. supply chain is largely insulated from the tariffs, as most food products are sourced domestically. However, he noted that the food basket is still expected to rise, with prices likely to increase in the first half of the year, particularly due to higher cheese prices. \u201cAny metrics we are providing exclude any impacts from the proposed tariffs,\u201d he added.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Our wellness advice is expert-vetted. Our top picks are based on our editors\u2019 independent research, analysis, and hands-on testing. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      Are you getting enough omega-3s? Here are the best omega-3 supplements to add to your diet.    Omega-3s have several health benefits. They play essential roles in the body, like\u00a0decreasing inflammation,\u00a0keeping our brain\u00a0healthy and immune system functioning. And don't forget about the role they play in\u00a0heart health and fetal development. Unlike other nutrients, our bodies can't naturally produce omega-3s.\u00a0 If you're an avid fish eater, you likely get enough omega-3s from your diet. But if you don't eat fish, have a history of heart attacks or have elevated levels of triglycerides, a supplement can be a good addition to your daily routine. We pulled together a list of the top brands on the market so it's easy to find the best omega-3 supplement for your needs. Before taking an omega-3 supplement, talk to your doctor about the dosage, especially if you take an anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.\u00a0 Omega-3 supplements commonly have fairly large pills, generally measuring from half an inch to an inch. For some, that poses a problem. GNC offers an alternative with its mini fish oil softgels. The GNC Triple Strength Fish Oil Mini wins the best overall omega-3 supplement for its size and concentration of omega-3s.\u00a0 The small softgels are enteric-coated, which means there's a polymer applied to the outside of the softgel to keep it from dissolving in the stomach. The softgels then move to the small intestine, where they are digested and released. It also means there isn't a fishy aftertaste. GNC Triple Strength Fish Oil Mini has a good concentration of omega-3s EPA (734 mg) and DHA (266 mg). Cost: $35.59 for 240 mini softgels Omega-3 content per serving: 1,065 mg of omega-3 per two softgels Best features: Things to consider: For bulk buyers, consider the Kirkland Signature Natural Fish Oil supplement. It's inexpensive at $18 for 400 capsules. This omega-3 supplement doesn't have all the bells and whistles other brands have -- it's a basic, no-fuss option for people who don't need a high dose of fish oil. Kirkland Signature fish oil supplement only includes 300mg of EPA and DHA per softgel. That's significantly less than other brands; however, taking one capsule twice daily puts it closer to the rest in terms of dosage.\u00a0 The softgel capsules are long and narrow to make them easier to swallow. Still, the pills are large; some reviewers suggest they are hard to swallow.\u00a0 Cost: $18 for 400 capsules\u00a0 Omega-3 content per serving: 300mg omega-3 per softgel Best features: Things to consider: When it comes to fish oil and omega-3 supplements, taste matters, Barlean's Ideal Omega-3 Softgels are great for those who want to avoid the fishy taste that some omega-3 supplements have. It features an orange flavor that covers the smell and taste of fish oil so that you can get the benefits without the unpleasant side effects -- fishy burps and aftertaste. User reviews say these orange omega-3 supplements don't leave a fishy aftertaste in their mouth.\u00a0 The dosage for this omega-3 supplement is one softgel, which users point out is rather large. However, the softgel form makes them easy to swallow. You get 750mg of EPA and 250mg of DHA omega-3s with one softgel.\u00a0 Cost: $35.09 for 60 softgels Omega-3 content per serving: 1,000mg of omega-3 per softgel Best features: Things to consider: There's a gummy supplement for everything -- omega-3s included. Nature Made Fish Oil Gummies are a great option for people looking for a yummy way to intake a low dose of omega-3s. The two-serving dose only includes 47.5mg of DHA and 9.5mg of EPA omega-3s. Because of the low dose, it's not the best choice if you're deficient in omega-3s; it's better suited for people who already get most of it from their diet but are looking for a little boost.\u00a0 Nature Made Fish Oil Gummies are free of any synthetic flavors or colors. The fish sources are wild, deep ocean water fish, not from raised farms. These fish oil gummies are also USP certified for quality and purity.\u00a0 Cost: $14.30 for 90 gummies Omega-3 content per serving: 57mg of omega-3s per two gummies. Best features: Things to consider: For those looking to add an omega-3 supplement for heart health, consider the Life Extension Super Omega-3 Supplement. It features a formula of DHA, EPA, olive extract and sesame lignans for an antioxidant and antimicrobial supplement. Research shows that olive leaf extract and sesame can help prevent heart disease.\u00a0 Life Extension's omega-3 supplement carries a five-star certification from IFOS. It's also gluten-free and non-GMO. This omega-3 supplement delivers a solid dose of both DHA (500mg) and EPA (700mg). However, that is a trade-off of serving size. Instead of the standard one or two capsules a day, Life Extension requires two capsules twice a day with food.\u00a0 Cost: $25.51 for 240 softgels Omega-3 content per serving: 1,200mg of Omega-3sper four softgels Best features: Things to consider: Omega-3 supplements are typically derived from fish sources. However, there are vegan plant-based omega-3 supplements available, too. The best of these is Truvani Plant-Based Omega, an algae omega-3 dietary supplement.\u00a0 With a two-capsule serving size, you get 500mg of DHA omega-3s. This vegan omega-3 supplement is minimally processed and doesn't impact ocean life. Truvani offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee if you're not pleased with this vegan supplement.\u00a0 Cost: $31.49 for 60 veggie capsules Omega-3 content per serving: 500mg of DHA omega-3s Best features: Things to consider: Most fish oil supplement pills are large, significantly larger than other capsules. This poses a problem for people who have a hard time swallowing pills. Liquid omega-3 offers a way to boost your intake without having to worry about large capsules. Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega Liquid omega-3 supplement is free from artificial additives and fillers.\u00a0 Nordic Natural is a well-known brand that offers the best liquid fish oil supplement. The serving size is one teaspoon, with the highest concentration of omega-3s on the list. Each serving contains 1,470mg of EPA and 1,010mg of DHA in triglyceride form. Research suggests that the triglyceride form may be better absorbed in the body.\u00a0 Cost: $33.88 for a 4 fl. oz. bottle Omega-3 content per serving: 2,470mg of omega-3 per one teaspoon\u00a0 Best features: Things to consider: When choosing the best omega-3 supplements, we considered factors like cost, dosage, form and quality. We also researched each product's customer reviews to compare the capsules' texture, taste and size. We didn't test these products in-house. We relied on third-party certifications to determine the quality and purity of the products.\u00a0 The market is flooded with brands offering omega-3 supplements. Knowing which is the best fit for you can be difficult. When shopping, keep these things in mind: Omega-3s are polyunsaturated fatty acids in the body that offer several benefits, including lowering triglyceride levels and preventing coronary heart disease. However, research is mixed on how effective omega-3s prevent cardiovascular diseases.\u00a0 Omega-3s have anti-inflammatory properties that can help chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. They are also associated with eye and brain health.\u00a0 When reading labels and comparing the best omega-3 supplements, you may notice there are several types of omega-3s out there. That can make things seem a little confusing, but it's actually as simple as where the omega-3s are sourced from.\u00a0 There are three types of omega-3s that you'll find on a supplement label: As with any supplement, there are side effects to be aware of. Side effects associated with omega-3s are upset stomach, nausea and diarrhea. A fishy taste or breath is also commonly reported after taking fish oil supplements.\u00a0 More severely, taking too many omega-3s in conjunction with certain medications can increase your risk of bleeding and decrease clotting. You must speak with your doctor before taking any fish oil supplements if you are taking any medication that affects your blood.\u00a0 According to the National Institutes of Health, it's recommended that adults intake at least 250mg of omega-3s -- including DHA and EPA combined. Higher dosages can benefit medication conditions. If you're someone who doesn't eat fish or omega-3-rich\u00a0foods, you can regularly take an omega-3 supplement each day. However, you must consult your doctor to determine the right dosage for your needs.\u00a0","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Streetwear is getting loud again. Some of the biggest names in the streetwear biz are reviving large logos and giant graphics in statement-heavy collections that scream whereas, only a few seasons ago, they might've whispered This turn of tide has manifested through the latest drops from streetwear giants such as Supreme and St\u00fcssy that brashly affirm that bigger (branding) is better. (Maximalists, we up) Supreme, a label synonymous with streetwear itself, bet it all on statement prints with its Spring\/Summer 2025 collection.  The piece of the season may be a SpongeBob racing jacket but the seasonal drops also kicked off with oversized Damien Hirst art prints, as unsubtle as anything Hirst\u2019s ever done. And compare the offering to Supreme's Spring\/Summer 2024 collection, which was hardly bereft of branding but handled them in a far more understated manner. Sure, there were plenty of plaids and high-contrast color-blocked anoraks but nothing nearly as out-there as a SpongeBob or reversible leopard-printed hoodie. And Denim Tears, whose signature Cotton Wreath all-over print was recently upgraded with Swarovski crystals, is leaning into in-your-face retro graphics with its heavily branded varsity jacket. The old English font provides a nice additional splash of nostalgia. The allure of throwback graphics is even present at Nike, where a new Cactus Plant Flea Market collaboration debuted by famous friends like Lil Yachty turns things up a notch with unmissable logos aplenty.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Awake NY is whipping up oversized Bugle Boy-style plaid shirts printed with \"New York\" monogram rings and St\u00fcssy is going seriously old school with its \"STU sweaters, are clear homage to the large lettering of GAP's classic pullovers (truly a timely homage). This embracement of wild prints and bold logos is a real turnaround from the minimalist feel that\u2019s held heavy sway over the streetwear space as of late. Now, bold branding is replacing the small script lettering and nondescript logos made most famous by labels like Aim\u00e9 Leon Dore and Fear of God's Essentials sub-label. To be sure, there was never a time where streetwear entirely abandoned statement graphics and there will never be a time where low-key stuff isn't desirable. But the period of purely tasteful stuff is waning as wacky prints and exaggerated logos return in force. And while labels like Cactus Plant Flea Market have always embodied this approach, they now feel especially prescient \u2014 last year's gargantuan Nike Air Flea suddenly looks entirely ahead of the curve. This renewed interest in extra-retro vibes must come from somewhere. On apps like TikTok, young shoppers demonstrate huge demand for thrifted statement pieces from the '00s, heavy on the exuberant prints and very much the antithesis of streetwear\u2019s post-YEEZY beige-ification. Labels like giant jeanmaker JNCO and Ed Hardy have come full-circle: They were once red-hot, then extremely uncool, then reclaimed by a new generation of shoppers too young for their heyday. Now, their loud wares are being revived for the modern day. And big players like St\u00fcssy and Supreme, whose founders were around long before any of those upstarts, are answering the call.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Briefcases are form follows function. The briefcase came into existence in the 19th century, following the explosion of the mass production of paper in standard sizes. As commerce and legal affairs began to dominate the economy, businesspeople had a need to transport documents around. Soft-sided bags, which we humans have been fashioning since caveman times, don't do a good job of protecting rectangular sheets of paper. Thus the hard-sided rectilinear briefcase was born, sometime in the 1850s (original inventor unknown\/disputed).   Briefcases remained a robust product category for the next 130 years or so. But as laptops went mass-market in the 1990s, they became the most important thing to carry. You'd think briefcases would have simply slipped into this new role, as briefcases and laptops are both the same shape. But laptops were heavy, and an awareness of ergonomics was growing. People found it more convenient to carry laptops in bags. The briefcase went into decline, and never really bounced back. Ignoring that trend Toyo Steel, a Japanese manufacturer of steel toolboxes used by industry and the trades, is gambling that they can transition to the office market.      They've released this Konstella Briefcase, designed to carry documents, a laptop and odds and ends.        Rather than going with their signature material, the company has opted for aluminum alloy, presumably because no office worker wants to lug a steel box around. The Konstella weighs in at 1,430g (3.2 lbs), which is within the range of a standard laptop backpack.  Toyo's designers have zhuzhed it up with a leather handle and accents. Aside from the Karim-Rashid-like symbol stamped into the lid for structure, there are no other adornments.       The minimalist Konstella sits in the premium market, ringing in at about USD $550 a pop. It's a strange foray for Toyo Steel to take, but a reminder that as traditional industries struggle, they'll seek out new markets in an effort to apply their manufacturing expertise for new customers.  In Mexico, in 1970s and 1980s, there were no backpacks and we all carried briefcases with our school supplies and books. Great weapons of mass destruction when swinging; you can sit on them like a horse and race each other, or run and slide on them like a sled.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Posted on February 26, 2025  by T. Moudiki  in R bloggers | 0 Comments I\u2019ll be presenting my (preprint) paper, \u201cOnline Probabilistic Estimation of Carbon Beta and Carbon Shapley Values for Financial and Climate Risk,\u201d at the 18th FINANCIAL RISKS INTERNATIONAL FORUM, hosted by Institut Louis Bachelier (link to the preprint at the end of the post). As climate change becomes a key financial risk factor, investors seek reliable ways to measure the exposure of stocks to climate transition risks. This paper introduces methods to estimate Carbon Beta and Carbon Shapley values dynamically and probabilistically. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe, 1964) introduced Beta as a measure of stock risk relative to the market. Over time, more sophisticated approaches\u2014machine learning (ML), neural networks, and game-theoretic Shapley values\u2014have emerged. Carbon Beta extends this concept, capturing climate risk by analyzing how a stock\u2019s returns move with a BMG portfolio. A high Carbon Beta means a stock is highly exposed to the risks of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Unlike traditional methods that assume a fixed, linear relationship between stock and market returns, the approach is described in the paper in **nonlinear**, **adaptive, nonparametric, and uncertainty-aware**. My study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based, online estimation of Carbon Beta and Carbon Shapley values. Key innovations include: Link to the preprint: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/387577137_Online_probabilistic_estimation_of_carbon_beta_and_carbon_Shapley_values_for_financial_and_climate_risk  Copyright \u00a9 2025 | MH Corporate basic by MH Themes","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail The cost of ad space on streaming platforms has been dragged down in the last year, as early movers Netflix and Disney+ raced to keep up with Amazon\u2019s aggressive pricing. Now, the cost-per-thousand viewers (CPM) across those three streamers hovers between $38 to $40 (down from Netflix\u2019s 2022 price of $60), low enough that small to medium business (SMB) advertisers can begin to consider them a viable alternative to local cable or regional linear TV. Consider the example of Naturepedic, a premium mattress and sleepwear brand based in Cleveland, Ohio. Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told Digiday he had \u201clittle faith\u201d in CTV prior to a campaign the brand ran in the latter half of 2024, targeting consumers in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. (He didn\u2019t give exact performance metrics of this campaign). But the ads, booked through ad buying platform MNTN, performed \u201cvery well\u201d in driving customers into its stores on a media budget of just under $500,000. A shorter follow-up campaign starring former NFL quarterback Bernie Kosar, for which the brand has earmarked up to $10,000, is set to run on a similar spread of CTV ads on channels like HGTV and the Food Network.\u00a0 Schultz told Digiday he expected Naturepedic to include Amazon Prime Video in that spread, in a further campaign penciled for later this year. Naturepedic\u2019s embrace of CTV mirrors a path taken by small and medium business brands toward streaming ads. \u201cStreaming prices in general, not just at Amazon, have lowered enough that smaller advertisers are more comfortable with it,\u201d said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at eMarketer. Drawn by lower costs and the chance to pursue target audiences more precisely than on linear, SMB clients are shifting spend from linear TV into CTV. In some cases they\u2019re trying out TV advertising for the first time via streaming. Leah Lam, associate director of brand media at agency Collective Measures, estimated that five of her agency\u2019s clients had recently shifted budget from linear into CTV, while 10 clients have used lower CTV costs as a means of running TV ads for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good intro [for] them,\u201d she added. Lam declined to name clients or provide financials.\u00a0 Skyler McGill, head of programmatic and video at Wpromote, estimated that SMBs are spending between 15 to 20% of their overall budgets in CTV. \u201c[Amazon Prime Video] is only becoming more accessible for small and mid market brands to be able to enter the market and now compete against larger competitors that have historically had very large TV budgets,\u201d McGill said. \u201cIt gives them a fighting chance to punch up a bit above their weight class.\u201d\u00a0 The SMB advertisers taking advantage of that shift include retail brands like Naturepedic and auto dealerships, as well as legal and healthcare. Madhive, a middleman connecting broadcasters and local advertisers to the CTV marketplace, just struck an audience and data partnership with Polk Automotive Solutions from S&P Global Mobility to create a local CTV marketplace for the U.S. auto industry. The move essentially guarantees more local auto dealerships will increase their spend across the CTV space. Christiana Cacciapuoti, svp of GTM strategy at Madhive, said U.S. automotive ad spend was projected to reach $12.3 billion in 2024, citing Broadcast Investment Analysis (BIA) data. \u201cWhat Amazon is doing\u2026 and what we\u2019re working to do is taking friction out of that buying,\u201d said Cacciapuoti. \u201cIf you are a local business\u2026 you want to make sure that your dollars are impacting outcomes, usually sales. [That\u2019s] helping local businesses all over the country\u2026 have this omnichannel approach to advertising that used to be reserved for Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\u201d Blue-chip brand advertisers may throw the best parties at Cannes Lions, but it\u2019s small businesses that form the bedrock of the ad industry\u2019s most powerful players. The vast majority of Google and Facebook\u2019s revenues come from companies that trade far below the glow of the S&P 500.\u00a0 Amazon is happy to have them. Its overall ad revenue reached $17.3 billion in 2024, a 17% year-on-year rise. The tech company\u2019s ad business has become a standard tool in the brand advertiser arsenal, owing in part to the Amazon Demand-Side Platform (DSP), the means via which most advertisers buy Prime Video ads. At media agency Tinuiti, for example, client investment on Prime Video ads rose eightfold between the first quarter of 2024 and the same period this year. Several other platforms and media companies have been attempting to make louder overtures to SMB brands. This time last year Roku overhauled its self-service ad platform to better cater to small businesses. NBCU made ads against its Olympic coverage available to buy programmatically, making it available to a far greater number of brands. Comcast launched Universal Ads, a product designed to give SMB and DTC advertisers better access to its subsidiaries\u2019 ad inventory, in January. Meanwhile Snapchat has pivoted to focus on smaller advertisers in a bid to diversify its customer base. But it\u2019s Amazon that\u2019s pulled down CPMs in the market, and Amazon that already has the biggest \u201cin\u201d with small-business advertisers that might already be investing in sponsored listings or search ads using its DSP, shifting stock via its core e-commerce platform, or else drawn in by its performance-oriented TV inventory, including shoppable ads.\u00a0 Crucially, the same audience targeting data used in its search and sponsored listings is available in Prime, a bridge that McGill said is helping to \u201cunlock budgets.\u201d Vaughn Ericson, svp of activation strategy at agency True Media, told Digiday he expected the shop to emphasize the lower-cost CTV opportunity to its small business clients. \u201cThat video experience is very powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cSight, sound and motion \u2014 that\u2019s critical and it\u2019s something clients want to see.\u201d The DSP wants to contrast itself and Big Tech, but class action lawsuits swarm as it looks forward to a 2025 stock price recovery.\u00a0 The ad industry attempts to underline the economic contribution to regulators as growth rates start to plateau.

Discovery (WBD+5.81%) stock jumped about 10% after the entertainment conglomerate made upbeat predictions about its streaming business in an otherwise downbeat fourth-quarter earnings report.

Direct-to-consumer Ebitda revenue may rise to about $1.3 billion in 2025 from almost $700 million in 2024.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Bringing the party from Down Under, Australian audio company BlueAnt today has unveiled the X5i party speaker, a new portable that delivers 120 watts of sound, built-in light show, and even includes two wireless microphones for karaoke. Priced at $270 and boasting up to 30 hours of battery life, the Aussies are betting that the combination of sound, lighting, and karaoke functionality will make the X5i a hit. Built for those looking for volume in a compact size (weighing under 10 pounds), the X5i\u2019s dual 2.3-inch tweeters and single 6.5-inch mid\/bass driver, combine with BlueAnt\u2019s \u201cpsycho-acoustic\u201d bass tech, that BlueAnt says \u201censures a powerful and immersive sound experience.\u201d And if you want to dial up the low-end, a dedicated bass boost button offers an extra punch. The X5i isn\u2019t BlueAnt\u2019s first foray into the party speaker market, though. It joins the lineup as a smaller sibling to the more powerful, 160-watt BlueAnt X6, which goes for $479 in Australia (U.S. $303). While the more premium X6 aims for bigger power, the X5i looks to capture a wider audience with its more accessible price and shoulder-able form factor (if the marketing images are to be believed). The X5i isn\u2019t just about raw power, though, it\u2019s got a light show, too. Just like many party speakers on the market form competitors such as JBL and Soundcore, the X5i features seven vibrant lighting modes that sync to your music from the LEDs that are wrapped around the speaker\u2019s frame. Whether you want a subtle glow or a full-on strobe show, the X5i\u2019s lighting effects will turn any room into, well, a disco. Speaking of the competition, this is where BlueAnt might have a leg up on some of them \u2014 they\u2019ve decided to throw in two wireless microphones. Karaoke fiends will for sure like not having to fork over extra cash to singalong to their favorite Sabrina Carpenter tunes. They charge directly from the speaker, so no scrambling for batteries when your rendition of Espresso demands an encore, and they boast 50 hours of playtime. BlueAnt says that their range will \u201creach around corners,\u201d great for wandering around and working the crowd. Despite its power, the BlueAnt X5i is designed for portability. Its built-in phone and tablet holder puts DJ controls in convenient reach, while the IP54 splashproof rating means you don\u2019t have to worry about a little rain or spilled drinks. Plus, with a built-in power bank, you can keep your devices charged while streaming tunes from your favorite music services. For its small package and accessible price point, the X5i is impressively connection-adept. Bluetooth 5.4, USB, and an AUX input are there for no matter how you like to play your music. You can even pair two X5i units together for stereo sound or even more, if you have deeper pockets, to broaden the volume in, say, a bigger party room. The BlueAnt X5i party speaker is available now on Amazon for $270.  You shouldn\u2019t have to remortgage your home when it\u2019s time to upgrade your living room TV. Fortunately, most TV manufacturers produce one or two budget-friendly models, and earlier today, we came across a Samsung promo worth writing home about: Right now, when you purchase the Samsung 98-inch DU6900 Series 4K LED at Best Buy, B&H Photo-Video, Crutchfield, and a handful of other retailers, you\u2019ll only pay $2,500.

If you're thinking about upgrading your home theater setup but you don't want to get too crazy with your budget, you should check out Amazon's offer for the 65-inch Sony Bravia 7 Mini-LED QLED 4K TV. A 40% discount brings its price down to $1,198 from $2,000 for savings of $802, and you might as well take advantage of it while you can because you'll be getting a high-quality display for a lower price than usual. There's always high demand for Sony TV deals though, so you need to act fast because this one may be gone as soon as tomorrow. Why you should buy the 65-inch Sony Bravia 7 Mini-LED QLED 4K TV The Sony Bravia 7 is a tier below the flagship Sony Bravia 9, but it's making a splash with rating of 4 stars out of 5 stars in our review. We've even tagged it as the best for videophiles on a budget in our list of the best QLED TVs, and the best midrange Sony TV in our list of the best TVs. Suffice to say, we're pretty impressed by how bright and vivid its 65-inch screen gets, with 4K Ultra HD resolution, extremely accurate HDR and color, and top-tier motion and upscaling all giving you a cinematic viewing experience in the comfort of your living room. Is your home theater setup due for an upgrade? If you're willing to splurge on your new screen, you may want to take advantage of LG's eye-catching offer for the 65-inch LG G4 OLED 4K TV. From its original price of $3,399, it's down to $2,400 for huge savings of $999. You won't always get the chance to buy a premium display from OLED TV deals with a discount of nearly $1,000, so you better act fast if you're interested and proceed with the purchase immediately, as tomorrow may already be too late. Why you should buy the\u00a065-inch LG G4 OLED 4K TV We think very highly of the LG G4 OLED 4K TV -- we gave it a score of 4.5 stars out of 5 stars in our review, and we've placed it at the top of our list of the best OLED TVs. With OLED TV technology enabling perfect black levels, deep contrast, wide viewing angles, and excellent response times, watching your favorite shows and movies on the LG G4 OLED 4K TV is a truly cinematic experience. Gamers will also love the display as it offers a 144Hz refresh rate, support for Nvidia's G-Sync and AMD's FreeSync Premium, and a 0.1ms response time. The TV also runs on LG's webOS platform for access to all of the popular streaming services, and you'll also be able to enjoy free content through LG Channels.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"About a decade ago, I moved from California to London. Since living in the UK, I've been fortunate to visit other European countries a handful of times each year. I've since visited 20 different countries across the continent, including Spain, Croatia, and many others. Though I've seen a lot of great places, there are a few that really stand out. Here are the five European cities and regions I can't wait to return to. Santorini, part of Greece's Cyclades Islands, is known for its blue-domed white buildings, striking azure waters, and impressive volcanic caldera \u2014 but under the surface, there's so much more to this charming town.\u00a0 When I visited Santorini, I was blown away by the genuinely kind and generous nature of everyone we met, from our jovial taxi driver to the shopkeeper serving us delicious gyros. We truly felt like the people we met treated guests like family. Upon arriving at the Perivolas Hotel, the concierge even greeted us with a warm hug.\u00a0 I loved spending the day relaxing in the pool overlooking the dramatic landscape and watching the picturesque sunsets in Oia, a small village in the north of the island. Walking through the brightly lit, winding cobblestone alleys, I fell in love with Santorini's soft charm. Dubrovnik, known as one of the filming locations for \"Game of Thrones,\" is a hidden gem for anyone with a sense of adventure and a love for glittering-blue waters.\u00a0 Walking the Walls of Dubrovnik surrounding the historic Old Town is a must-do for first-time visitors. Climbing the stone steps will definitely raise your heart rate, but it's completely worth the view of the distinctive red roofs just beyond the horizon line. For the absolute best views, take the cable car up to the Panorama Restaurant and Bar. From the top, you can see the entire city, plus the marina and nearby islands. During my visit, I also loved taking a boat tour to the nearby Elaphiti Islands to swim in the stunning lagoons and explore the Blue Cave, a cavern filled with beautiful colors on Kolocep Island.\u00a0 If you've ever seen Lake Como on your Instagram feed, you'll be happy to know that it's even better in reality. I've visited twice, staying in Tremezzo and Bellagio, both situated near the fork of the iconic Y-shaped Italian lake. In my opinion, it's simply impossible to have anything but a spectacular time in Lake Como.\u00a0Highlights for me included the magnificent views of the villas along the lake (best seen on a boat tour) and jumping off a platform into the water. I also enjoyed pasta and wine while soaking in the majestic mountain views at sunset, and romantic strolls along the stony paths through the area's manicured gardens.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I always thought Saint-Tropez was only for the ultra-rich and fancy, so I was surprised at how approachable and welcoming I found the city. Don't get me wrong \u2014 the small beach town oozes luxury. I saw designer shops and supercars on nearly every small street, as well as a Dior store where patrons can browse the merchandise and eat in a caf\u00e9. However, if shopping isn't on your agenda, there's still plenty to do in Saint-Tropez. Spending the day at the pool or beach, followed by cocktails at Jardin Tropezina (a Mediterranean restaurant right on the sand), was my favorite way to enjoy the warm weather. A visit to Saint-Tropez is a special way to dip your toes into the iconic French Riviera. Granada, Spain, holds a special place in my heart as one of the first European destinations I visited on my own. I was charmed by the city's unique blend of old and new attractions. I experienced the modern, buzzy vibes at the bars and restaurants along Calle Reyes Cat\u00f3licos, and soaked in the history of the stunning Alhambra, a palace and fortress built under the Nasrid dynasty. Each time I've visited, I've been amazed at the intricate detail of the Islamic architecture on the walls and ceilings and in the courtyards. In my experience, Granada's city center was also more walkable and affordable than I expected it to be. The Moroccan shops in Alcaicer\u00eda, a market street, were full of hidden treasures I haven't found in most Spanish cities. Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Tariffs on Canada and Mexico may raise prices at the grocery store and gas pump. Economists say the uncertainty from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats and mass layoffs of government workers are starting to have a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on the U.S. economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult business environment, because they can\u2019t plan for what their cost structure is going to be,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cIt\u2019s adding to investment uncertainty, and some people are holding back on investments.\u201d Trump has so far imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and says he\u2019ll impose additional 10%, plus 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on March 4. Trump also says he will impose \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that match the duties other countries levy on the U.S. That comes on top of tariff plans on cars, semiconductors, steel and aluminum. Even if Trump doesn\u2019t ultimately move forward with all his tariff threats, the mere uncertainty has a chilling effect. \u201cIf one of the inputs of your factory goes up by 25%, you might cut your production and say maybe we\u2019ll have to fire some people,\u201d Ziemba added. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s slashing of the federal workforce across the country \u201calso impacts consumption, because people are losing their jobs or are afraid of losing their jobs, so that might cause them to save more money,\u201c Ziemba said. This week, The Conference Board\u2019s consumer sentiment survey found that it registered the largest monthly decline since August 2021. \u201cViews of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a 10-month high,\u201d said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist for global indicators at The Conference Board. \u201cAverage 12-month inflation expectations surged from 5.2% to 6% in February. This increase likely reflected a mix of factors, including sticky inflation but also the recent jump in prices of key household staples like eggs and the expected impact of tariffs,\u201d Guichard said. The Canada and Mexico tariffs would have a sweeping effect, since those are America\u2019s two biggest trading partners. It could raise prices at the grocery store and the gas pump. Ziemba also noted that the cost of cars could increase by several thousand dollars. \u201cEvery time a car part crosses the border, 25% tariffs could be very onerous,\u201d Ziemba said. \u201cWe could see the cost of building a house go up quite substantially.\u201d 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"A California Democrat plans to introduce the MEME Act on Thursday. While President Donald Trump\u2019s proudest supporters on Capitol Hill shower him with legislation proposing putting his portrait on a $250 bill, declaring his birthday a national holiday or adding his likeness to Mount Rushmore -- a new effort across the aisle isn\u2019t as flattering -- as House Democrats take aim at the president\u2019s $TRUMP meme coin. Since launching a little over a month ago, the $TRUMP coin has tanked in value after early investors dumped the cryptocurrency. Members of Congress have noticed as hundreds of thousands of investors have taken hard hits and billions in value have quickly vanished. California freshman Democrat Rep. Sam Liccardo told ABC News on Thursday he will introduce legislation to prohibit the country\u2019s top officials and their families -- from Congress to the White House -- from capitalizing on personal meme coins. The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials and their spouses and dependent children from issuing, sponsoring or endorsing a security, future, commodity or digital asset. Liccardo said he believes that the president and first lady Melania Trump cashed in on their meme coins and enriched investors around the world who initially supported the cryptocurrency. Trump launched the coin in January, days before he took office. A similar Melania coin had been issued a week earlier. Trump in July said he wanted to turn the U.S. into the \"crypto capital of the planet.\" While Liccardo\u2019s legislation is not expected to become law over the next two years under Republican majorities in the House and Senate, the freshman Democrat said that the president and first lady made a windfall on their respective meme coins and is working to build support that culminates behind a Democrat majority. \u201cLet\u2019s make corruption criminal again,\u201d Liccardo, a former federal and local criminal prosecutor, said. \u201cOur public offices belong to the public, not the officeholders, nor should they leverage their political authority for financial gain. The Trumps\u2019 issuance of meme coins financially exploits the public for personal gain, and raises the specter of insider trading and foreign influence over the Executive Branch.\u201d The proposal would forbid federal officials from promoting a range of financial assets or from participating in any conduct likely to financially benefit themselves, according to Liccardo. The legislation would impose criminal and civil penalties and includes a prohibition that applies to any financial asset, such as the stock of Truth Social. Liccardo wants to subject violators to criminal and civil penalties while stopping them from profiting from an asset issued before the bill's enactment -- giving it retroactive element intended to address the launch of $TRUMP. Liccardo said he has a dozen Democratic cosponsors as he prepares to introduce the legislation on Thursday.

Liam McNeeley and the UConn Huskies (18-8) head to the Garden to play RJ Luis Jr. and the No. 10 St. John's Red Storm (23-4). These two rivals squared off a few weeks ago at Gampel Pavilion. Luis scored 21 points, and his running mate, Kadary Richmond, scored 13 in St. John's impressive 68-62 victory. UConn is the two-time defending national champions, but they haven't played up to that level all season. McNeely is one of the most talented freshmen in the country.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Iran appears poised to impose new levels of control and oversight into crypto amid deteriorating economic conditions. Tehran, Iran \u2013\u00a0Iranian authorities have again been cracking down on cryptocurrencies and online exchanges as the value of the national currency plummets in an economy in turmoil. Last month, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) suddenly stopped rial payments in all cryptocurrency exchanges, leaving more than 10 million crypto users unable to spend rials on Bitcoin and other global online currencies. A main goal was to counter further depreciation of the embattled national currency by stopping it from changing hands for foreign currencies. The crypto market grew significantly last year and leans towards a bullish 2025 as countless young Iranians turn to a growing global market to make money in a largely isolated economy straining under harsh Western sanctions. The move had been tried before at limited junctures, but never for so long and at such a scale, seeming to be part of a larger governance effort by an establishment that wants stringent levels of control and oversight on the burgeoning crypto community. The economy has been plagued by inflation rates of more than 40 percent for years, and remains disconnected from the global payments system.      After imposing the block, the central bank mostly maintained radio silence, not offering clarifications to the public. The CBI also did not respond to an Al Jazeera request for comment. In a public statement, it merely noted that CBI governor Mohammad Reza Farzin participated in a meeting of the heads of government, judiciary and parliament last month and that CBI was given \u201cfull authority to monitor and manage the cryptocurrency market\u201d during that meeting. President Masoud Pezeshkian also sent a letter, published in the media, to Farzin last week, emphasising that CBI is the \u201csole trustee to manage\u201d the crypto market. The meeting last month also concluded that the government wants to see more export trade bringing cryptocurrencies into the Iranian market, but did not indicate how this was to be accomplished. The new restrictions appear to be part of strict measures to prevent currency depreciation, coming as CBI pumps more foreign currency into the volatile local market and police periodically announce the arrest of illegal currency traders in the streets of Tehran and other major cities. The Iranian rial continued its slide this week, hitting a new all-time low of more than 940,000 per US dollar. A dollar fetched less than 600,000 rials in October last year, and less than 40,000 in early 2018. The national currency has been experiencing a sharp decline in recent weeks amid escalating regional conflicts, blows to the Tehran-led \u201caxis of resistance\u201d, and Donald Trump\u2019s insistence on a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign. Days after its sudden decision to ban rial purchases of cryptocurrencies, CBI imposed conditions on online exchanges and started negotiations with them. Many smaller exchanges were forced to accept at least some of the conditions, including providing proof of reserves. Some have had their rial gateways restored at limited capacities, while others are still negotiating. Some of the \u201cproposed measures\u201d by CBI comprised top levels of access to customer information, including real-time access, constant updates, and an ability to block users whenever deemed necessary, according to documents reviewed by Al Jazeera. Similar to the artificial limits regulators have set for trading on Iran\u2019s stock markets, CBI envisions imposing daily caps on how much the rial-price of cryptocurrencies can change.      If the currencies move beyond defined limits, their rial trade would be suspended for a short time. The central bank is especially eyeing the dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether (USDT), which many Iranians have been buying as a hedge. It wants to ensure that if USDT prices surge by more than 4 percent in a day, Iranian traders would be temporarily blocked from buying it. As a result of the abrupt block of rial gateways, some crypto exchanges were forced to start looking for temporary alternatives, such as using different bank accounts to facilitate rial payments. Incoming and outgoing crypto transactions were unaffected, and users could still take rials out of their accounts if they chose. The central bank is facing criticism for currency instability and Economy Minister Abdolnaser Hemmati, a former central bank\u00a0chief\u00a0and presidential candidate, is now being targeted for impeachment by hardline lawmakers. The government maintains the impeachment effort is politically driven as lawmakers want to remove the minister mere months after he started. Rather than addressing its own imbalances in a rocky economy, CBI has adopted a strategy of deflecting attention and trying to make money through online exchanges, said the director of a local exchange. \u201cRepeated warnings about the adverse political, social and economic impacts of such moves, provided by stakeholders and the media, have not been heeded. The central bank closed the payment gateways with a businesslike, unethical and biased approach,\u201d Ubitex CEO Eisa Keshavarz told Al Jazeera. He said the establishment is, on the one hand, blocking foreign services like social media platforms to force Iranians towards local platforms, while on the other hand, it pushes people towards foreign exchanges with its restrictive moves against local counterparts. \u201cThese double policies show that rationality, clear thinking and empathising with the people are not on the agenda, which widens the gap between the people and the government.\u201d Keshavarz said people will turn to unofficial, underground activities as a result of the restrictions. \u201cI believe it is the people\u2019s inalienable right anywhere to turn their hard-earned money into gold, greenbacks, crypto, housing or anything to preserve their purchasing power,\u201d he said. CBI and others have made past attempts at regulating the burgeoning crypto industry \u2013 almost all were measures that perplexed or frustrated stakeholders. The government made crypto mining \u2013 the process of generating new coins using computational power \u2013 legal in 2019 under strict conditions.      Many miners were driven out, especially due to repeated cutoffs of mining rigs because of electricity shortages. But a variety of other state bodies have also impacted the local crypto community. Earlier this week, the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance declared that it is forbidden for all local media, including legacy and digital outlets, to use cryptocurrencies in public advertisements. It said the aim was to \u201csafeguard the public\u2019s rights\u201d due to high risks involved. Observers and experts now believe that regulators, faced with a widening government budget deficit, will move towards taxing crypto transactions. The Supreme Council of Cyberspace, Iran\u2019s top internet governance body, released a regulatory roadmap last month that observers say does not bode well for the crypto community. It discusses \u201cfacilitating international trade\u201d through crypto, which, according to crypto and blockchain researcher Saeed Khoshbakht, could be interpreted as attempts to circumvent sanctions on Iran. \u201cEspecially after Mr Trump\u2019s election, this could expose crypto users to risks of being blacklisted or having their transactions flagged on international exchanges,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. The expert said using international transactions as a keyword in the document could also leave major domestic crypto transactions unaudited because they may be deemed confidential, decreasing transparency. At the same time, the regulatory document adopts a policy of \u201cactive control and countermeasures\u201d in dealing with global cryptocurrencies, purporting to \u201cminimise risks\u201d, but does not say exactly how or for whom. \u201cIf they said minimising risks for citizens, at least some level of support could be envisioned. But without this word, \u2018minimising risk\u2019 appears focused on the state rather than the people, and this means a host of new restrictions masked as control and management,\u201d Khoshbakht said.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has been quick to attack climate initiatives and the green energy transition. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University has identified more than 50 actions made by the administration to scale back or wholly eliminate federal climate mitigation and adaptation measures since the end of January.\u00a0 Among the biggest targets was the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a multi-billion dollar investment into climate and clean energy, which the Trump administration quickly paused funding on.\u00a0 The move has brought uncertainty to the clean energy industry. \u201cThe biggest effects of the Trump administration on clean energy\u2026has been to introduce massive chaos,\u201d says David Victor, professor of innovation and public policy at UC San Diego.\u00a0 The IRA was passed by Congress in 2022, and aimed to reduce the country\u2019s budget deficit while investing in domestic energy production and manufacturing. It was considered the largest investment in climate action in American history, earmarking $369 billion to clean energy and climate projects with the goal of getting the U.S. to net zero emissions by 2030 and boosting American industrial production in the process.\u00a0 While some of the money was allocated to building up established clean technologies, like solar and wind, some funding went to new technologies that might not have been financially feasible without government subsidies, like carbon capture and storage.\u00a0 \u201cAcross the board, it was a huge spending bill that basically made clean energy cheaper, and then put on steroids the adoption of clean energy technologies in the United States.\u201d says Victor. It also brought in a boost of private funding into clean energy. \u201cThe risk was reduced by that upfront capital provided by the government,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cIt made large infrastructure projects more possible, and this in turn, crowded in a lot of private investment.\u201d The IRA was also established to make the United States more globally competitive in clean energy industries. \u201cIt would have allowed the United States to try to catch up with China in key industries, particularly in batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles,\u201d says Joanna Lewis, associate professor of energy and environment at Georgetown University. \u201cIf these investments aren't made in the next few years, then we will essentially be ceding these industries to China and others.\u201d On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order called the \u201cUnleashing American Energy,\u201d which called for the revocation and revision of several Biden-era climate actions. The order froze distribution of IRA funds for clean energy and bipartisan infrastructure law\u2014both of which invested hundreds of billions of dollars in energy technologies like wind and solar projects and electric vehicles. In late January, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore paused payments, though they were later found to have continued to freeze funds despite the court order.\u00a0 Areas of the IRA the Trump administration is expected to target next include energy efficiency standards on appliances and a methane emission fee, says Ewing.\u00a0 But despite the pause, much of the funding, which was allocated through tax credits, just might emerge unscathed given that it largely benefits Republican districts. \u201cMost people's expectation is that a lot of the IRA is going to survive ultimately, because it's giving subsidies to technologies that are being deployed in places that that the Trump administration cares about,\u201d says Victor.\u00a0 Of the $289 billion invested in the construction and installation of clean tech manufacturing facilities since late 2022, districts currently represented by Republicans received $223 billion of that total\u2014almost 80%.\u00a0 How much the Trump Administration is able to roll back remains to be seen. \u201cWhat they're able to do is partly an open question, but what they're attempting to do is fairly clear,\u201d says Jackson Ewing, Director of Energy and Climate Policy at the Duke University Nicholas Institute. \u201cIt's an attempt to deprioritize the energy transition in favor of scaling up oil and gas production in the United States, both for domestic use and for exports.\u201d Scaling up fossil fuel production has been another goal of the administration\u2014on Feb. 14, Trump signed an executive order to create a new \u201cNational Energy Dominance Council,\u201d aimed at increasing the country\u2019s oil and gas production\u2014 already at an all-time high under the Biden Administration. Given that the funding was congressionally allocated, freezing it will not be an easy task, says Ewing. \u201cThere's no doubt that if existing grant monies are attempted to be clawed back by the Trump administration, that a number of those project developers will sue.\u201d\u00a0 But even if they do survive, the government pullback means that clean energy initiatives might falter in the coming years as private investors get skittish.\u00a0 \u201cThe overall message behind the executive orders does have immediate market effects,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cThere's going to be more reticence to invest in some of these energy transition and climate focused sectors, because the political environment is clearly less appealing for those investments now compared to what it was a year ago or six months ago during the Biden administration.\u201d Write to Simmone Shah at simmone.shah@time.com","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"Tentatively hopeful.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  I don't know why I expect anything different from Nvidia's quarterly earnings calls. Every time, I get hopeful for some attention on the gaming division, and every time, I am reminded that Nvidia is an AI company now, not a gaming one. Still, amidst the talk of \"AI factories\" and astronomical data center compute numbers, there was a glimmer of gaming goodness in the earnings call discussing Nvidia's Q4 and fiscal 2025 results\u2014just a few sentences, mind. In a brief interlude that surely must have had the AI-rabid investors' eyes glazing over, Nvidia EVP and CFO Colette Kress explains that gaming revenue dropped a little in Q4 2024 (ending January 26, 2025), but the company is expecting a bounce-back: \"Gaming revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 22% sequentially and 11% year-on-year. Full year revenue of $11.4 billion increased 9% year-on-year, and demand remains strong throughout the holiday. \"However, Q4 shipments were impacted by supply constraints. We expect strong sequential growth in Q1 as supply increases.\" In other words, there was less gaming revenue in Q4 2024 than in Q3 2024 and Q4 2023, but revenue from 2024 overall was higher than 2023 revenue. \"Supply constraints\" there definitely were, as we saw RTX 40-series GPU stocks drying up towards the end of last year. By the time we got to January the market was somewhat of a wasteland, especially at the high end, where the most powerful RTX 40-series cards were either sold out or overpriced due to low supply. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This was somewhat expected though, because Nvidia had reportedly killed production for almost all RTX 40-series GPUs in Q4 in the lead-up to the RTX 50-series. This makes sense from a sales standpoint because it would increase demand for the new 50-series cards when they launch. We've certainly seen that demand for the new RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 Ti over the past month, which in combination with low supply resulted in low (or no) stocks and high prices. And this is despite none of these cards offering spectacular improvements in traditional render performance, and despite some black screen issues and missing ROPs. That's what happens when the stocks are minimal, though: they sell out and demand leaves room for both scalping and extortionate pricing well above MSRP. We've seen just as much of this so far in Q1 2025 as we did in Q4 2024. The good news is that Nvidia is forecasting increasing supply during the rest of Q1, which is, well, now. So the next couple of months should hopefully have us seeing more RTX 50-series cards in stock. Whether those will be the current 50-series cards on the market, the upcoming RTX 5070, or even a potentially soon-to-launch RTX 5060 Ti, I'm sure we're all looking forward to more GPU-filled virtual shelves. Not least because more stock should, in theory, mean lower prices. Perhaps we could even see some of the fabled MSRPs gracing the price tags\u2014I won't hold my breath, though.

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"At 16, Isaiah Taylor dropped out of high school. He had ambitions beyond cramming for the SATs and competing with his classmates to get into a top college. Instead, Taylor managed to land a six-figure job as a coder. He had taught himself coding years before and had built a body of work through freelance jobs and side projects. Eventually, one of his contacts recommended him for a gig building classified technology for the Defense Department. Yet Taylor, whose great-grandfather worked on the Manhattan Project, was always interested in nuclear power. Now 25, his biggest venture yet, Valar Atomics, emerged from stealth earlier last week. The company is backed by a team of 35 nuclear experts and $21 million in funding. Taylor says it aims to make nuclear energy more affordable \u2014 like SpaceX did for space travel. Valar aims to revamp the way nuclear reactors are deployed and, in turn, solve the problem of scaling them. Typical nuclear power plants can take five years or more to construct. In Valar's view, that's akin to building reactors like \"artisanal cheese.\" To solve that problem, the company plans to develop what it calls \"gigasites,\" creating and installing thousands of small, modular, high-temperature gas reactors over time. Small modular reactors, or SMRs, generally have a maximum output of 300 megawatts compared to large nuclear reactors, which can generate over 1,000 megawatts. Collectively, though, the SMRs at a gigasite could produce thousands of times the energy of a typical nuclear power plant, according to Valar. \"It allows you to produce very cheap energy because all of the complexity is already dealt with on the first couple of reactors,\" Taylor said. Instead of distributing power through the grid \u2014 the network that delivers electricity from power plants to homes and businesses \u2014Valar plans to directly supply power to customers that need a lot of it, like data centers, green steel plants, and hydrogen production facilities, by building the sites right next to them. \"\u200aThe grid is actually not a very good customer for nuclear energy,\" Taylor said. It \"needs your reactors to essentially be spread out.\" SMRs have gained momentum as a cheaper, greener, and faster alternative to traditional nuclear reactors. In recent years, a number of SMR companies have emerged with plans to bring their first reactors online in the coming years. Oklo, backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is developing small reactors that run on nuclear waste. Oklo aims to deploy its first one in 2027. X-Energy \u2014 in which Amazon invested $500 million \u2014 aims to bring over 5 gigawatts of power online through SMRs by 2039. Kairos Power also signed an agreement with Google to provide energy from its SMRs, with plans to bring its first reactor online by 2030. However, critics of SMRs argue that they should not be seen as a silver bullet for the problems that plague traditional reactors. A 2024 report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that SMRs are still \"too expensive, too slow to build, and too risky\" to meaningfully transition us from fossil fuels in the coming 10 to 15 years. Researchers have raised concerns about the radioactive waste produced by these reactors. A 2022 study from Stanford and the University of British Columbia found that SMRs generated more radioactive waste by \"factors of 2 to 30\" than large-scale reactors. Valar argues that its gigasite model tackles the challenges of cost and speed by enabling it to deploy reactors to achieve economies of scale rapidly. With regard to safety, the company points to its use of tri-structural isotropic particle fuel, a heat-resistant nuclear fuel made from a combination of uranium, carbon, and oxygen. TRISO, as this fuel is more commonly known, generates more nuclear waste, but Valar claims it is \"good at encapsulating the nuclear waste,\" making it highly resistant to spreading, minimizing environmental impact, and preventing misuse by bad actors. TRISO is also being tested by Kairos Power and X-Energy, which is building a dedicated fuel fabrication facility. Despite being a young startup, Valar also has big plans to fuel the world with synthetic fuels that are cheaper than oil. The company said it has pioneered a process for developing alternative hydrocarbon fuels that can replace the traditional fuel used in aviation, vehicles, and military operations. It all begins with the company's reactors, which \u2014 once up and running \u2014 will generate heat at temperatures exceeding 900 degrees Celsius, or over 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit. Valar aims to use this heat to power a thermochemical process that splits water into its component atoms: hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen will then be combined with captured carbon dioxide through a collection of chemical reactions to create carbon-neutral synthetic fuels because no new carbon is extracted from the ground. \"\u200aYou can sell the hydrogen itself, right, which is a big market, but you can also create, synthetic fuel,\" Taylor said. \"\u200aWe can make jet fuel, diesel, gasoline. We can make all of our hydrocarbons that the world relies on today, and we can make them carbon neutral.\" Valar's first reactor will launch in the Philippines, where it has secured a research contract for an advanced reactor from the Philippines Nuclear Research Institute. This follows the signing of the 123 Agreement between the United States and the Philippines in 2023, which establishes a framework for enhanced nuclear cooperation between the countries, including technical exchanges, scientific research, and safeguards discussions. Using a prototype, Valar will simulate its first reactor, Ward One, to test and gather data on its efficacy. Taylor did not specify how long it will take to move through the licensing process and fully get the reactor running in the Philippines but said, \"We're going to move really fast.\" Eventually, Taylor wants to bring Valar's technology to the United States. Taylor believes this is an opportune moment for nuclear energy in the United States as public sentiment has shifted in the past several years. \"Public opinion about nuclear is actually very generational,\" he said. \"Young people and, and I really mean, honestly, anyone under 50 are very, very pro-nuclear.\" Now that they're in positions of authority, Taylor anticipates that we'll see \"rapid regulatory change.\" A 2024 poll of 430 first-generation voters conducted by America in One Room, organized in part by Stanford University, found that four in five supported \"new generation\" nuclear energy to supplement renewable power sources. Beyond support from Silicon Valley, which needs more energy for its AI revolution, nuclear energy has seen increased bipartisan support in recent years. In March, the House of Representatives passed the ADVANCE Act, which will expand the use of nuclear energy in the United States and abroad. Former President Joe Biden also signed a law in March that allocates $100 million to nuclear workforce training programs at universities, two-year colleges, and trade schools. President Donald Trump's newly appointed head of the Department of Energy, Chris Wright, said last month that \"to compete globally, we must expand energy production, including commercial nuclear and liquefied natural gas, and cut the cost of energy for Americans.\" While Taylor remembers discussing the Manhattan Project at the breakfast table with his great-grandmother and grandmother, he never believed his family history gave him carte blanche to enter the nuclear industry. \"I approached the industry as a complete outsider technically, but with the confidence of someone who knew the origins and history from my family's heritage with it,\" he told BI. After years of research, though, he came to one conclusion: \"I found that nuclear had the potential to be the cheapest form of energy on Earth if you build it this specific way: mass manufactured and deployed on gigasites, making highly transportable energy products.\" Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-27","content":"The U.S. economy is beginning to show signs of a slowdown \u2014 and the situation is further complicated by President Trump\u2019s back-to-back tariffs, which are increasing pressure on an already strained economy burdened by high inflation and interest rates.  On Thursday, three key economic reports were released, all pointing to a softening economic landscape, reinforcing concerns that more challenging times are ahead. The revised fourth-quarter GDP data, released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, has confirmed earlier projections, reflecting a deceleration in economic activity.  The second estimate for fourth-quarter GDP growth in 2024 shows an annualized rate of 2.3%, a slowdown from the 3.1% expansion recorded in the third quarter. This decline underscores a moderation in economic momentum, suggesting that the pace of growth has cooled as the economy faces ongoing challenges.  Additionally, initial jobless claims, a key indicator of the number of individuals filing for unemployment benefits for the first time, spiked more than anticipated last week, according to the U.S. Labor Department. For the week ending February 22, claims increased by 22,000, reaching a seasonally adjusted total of 242,000. This figure surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations, which had predicted a rise to 225,000. \u00a0 The data suggests a potential softening in the labor market and sets the stage for a broader set of employment figures to be released in the latter half of next week. These upcoming reports will offer a more detailed perspective on the labor market\u2019s overall health. The data will play a critical role in determining whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year and, if so, how many times. Soaring mortgage rates and steep home prices are taking a heavy toll on the housing market. Pending home sales \u2014 measured by signed contracts for existing homes \u2014 tumbled 4.6% from December, reaching their lowest level since the National Association of Realtors began tracking the data in 2001. Year over year sales fell 5.2% from January 2024. This downturn signals a broader slowdown in the housing sector, which is a key driver of the U.S. economy. High mortgage rates, which have been rising in response to efforts by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation, are making homeownership increasingly unaffordable for many potential buyers.  With Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum, home prices are poised to elevate further, creating a challenging environment for those looking to enter the market or trade up.

Last updated: February 27th, 2025 at 03:41 UTC+01:00  Samsung has retained its crown in India's tablet market. It was, once again, the biggest tablet brand in India in 2024. However, its sales shrank in the fourth quarter of the year compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Samsung was India's biggest tablet brand in 2024 According to the latest numbers from market analysis firm IDC, Samsung sold 321,000 tablets in India in Q4 2024. The South Korean firm captured a 35.5% share of the Indian tablet market. However, its sales shrank by 26.8% compared to Q4 2023 when the company sold close to half a million (439,000) tablets. \u00a0 The company launched the Galaxy Tab S10+ and the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra in Q4 2024.  Apple was the second-biggest tablet maker in India. It sold 164,000 iPads and captured an 18.1% market share in Q4 2024, a massive 44.4% increase compared to Q4 2023. Lenovo, Xiaomi, and Acer ranked third, fourth, and fifth, respectively. Lenovo's market share was 12.5% after its sales dropped by 21.5%. Xiaomi's sales grew by 2.3%, and its market share reached 10.5%. Acer captured an 8.9% share of the market, but its sales dropped by 35.5% compared to Q4 2023. When you look at the picture of the entire year, Samsung shines. It shipped close to 2.5 million (2,443,000) Galaxy Tab devices in 2024, a massive 54% jump compared to 2023. Its market share jumped from 39.5% in 2023 to 42.6% in 2024. The company had a 51.1% market share in the commercial tablet segment (education, industries, retail stores, etc.) and a 32.1% share in the consumer market.  Acer ranked second with over 1 million tablet sales in 2024, an explosive growth of 265.8% compared to 2023.
