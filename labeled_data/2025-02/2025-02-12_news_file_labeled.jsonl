Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Telos' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 7 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership  Insiders have bought recently  To get a sense of who is truly in control of Telos Corporation (NASDAQ:TLS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 61% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors would appreciate the 12% increase in share price last week, given their one-year losses have totalled a disappointing 9.0%. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Telos.  See our latest analysis for Telos  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Telos already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Telos, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Telos. Our data shows that The JRP Settlement is the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 13% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.3% by the third-largest shareholder. John Wood, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chairman of the Board. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Telos Corporation. Insiders own US$35m worth of shares in the US$245m company. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.  The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Telos. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It seems that Private Companies own 13%, of the Telos stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Telos better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 to start 2025, soaring 50% so far this year. But the software company\u2019s bright earnings prospects won\u2019t be enough to protect investors from short-term pain as its share price eventually returns to more normal levels, some analysts say. The stock, which dipped about 3.5% to close at $112.62 per share on Tuesday, has still surged about 35% since the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. And it\u2019s up a whopping 350% over the last 12 months. That\u2019s taken Palantir\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio to almost 600, and about 200 based on projected 12-month earnings. The overall current PE for the Nasdaq is about 42. \u201cThe stock\u2019s not made of teflon,\u201d said Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options. Palantir is trading at about 150% of the 200-day moving average, which Lang called an \u201cextraordinary\u201d level that can\u2019t last forever. \u201cEventually the rally will peter out as investors get exhausted,\u201d Lang said. The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, earlier this month reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter \u2014 a 36% jump year over year. Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45%. Palantir\u2019s projections for sales and profit in 2025 both topped analysts\u2019 estimates. Palantir may trigger a selloff if it opts to sell new shares to take advantage of its current, much higher market valuation, Lang said. The could quickly test the $84-$87 level. However, even at $90 per share, there would still be an uptrend. Lang remains optimistic about the company\u2019s earnings prospects. He said analysts\u2019 estimates of 25% growth in 2026 are far too low as Palantir secures new work, especially from governments. Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, shared both Lang\u2019s optimism about Palantir\u2019s potential work for the Trump administration \u2014 and his caution about the stock\u2019s immediate prospects. \u201cRevenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter \u2014 but not by the rate at which is stock is growing,\u201d Rechenthin said. He said he won\u2019t be adding to his position at this level. In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT) announced that they were deepening their partnership to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  The US housing market is still in hibernation mode as aspiring homebuyers continue to hold out for lower mortgage rates and property prices, though some markets are as popular as ever.          A seasonally quieter stretch in the real-estate market is off to a sleepy start. Home prices slid 2.2% in January from the year before, Realtor.com researchers noted late last month, in part because the 30-year fixed mortgage rate had topped 7% for the first time in over seven months. Borrowing costs are now at 6.9%, still higher than the 6.6% rate in early 2024.               Slightly cheaper property prices may help some buyers get their feet in the doors of new houses. But if mortgage rates remain this restrictive, many more may still be sidelined. That would mean falling home values are both a letdown for owners and not enough to help would-be owners.               \"Buyers are really facing a double-whammy on affordability at this point,\" said Hannah Jones, a senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, in a recent interview. On the national level, she said succinctly that \"the typical buyer cannot afford the typical home.\"               Surging home inventory is also weighing on prices. Housing construction has boomed, which contributes to the 24.6% annual jump in active listings that Realtor.com observed in January. Having more options makes buyers choosier, as they don't have to buy the first home they see.               However, there are signs that this frosty market is thawing \u2014 at least in certain regions.               Although higher mortgage rates are a headache, buyers have still flocked to a few dozen cities so far this year.               Realtor.com just published its updated list of the hottest US housing markets, which is based on how long home listings stay on the market and how in-demand they are, as measured by traffic on its website. The more unique property views, the higher a city's ranking is.               Home listings in the 20 most in-demand markets received about 2.6 times the demand of typical US homes last month, and sold three weeks earlier than the US median property. That strong demand drove prices up 1.5% from the year before in January.               What's fascinating is that all 20 of those hot cities were in either the Northeast or Midwest, which differs from Business Insider's research showing that eight of the 10 most-popular cities of 2024 were in the Southeast. However, Jones remarked that Northeast and Midwest markets have stood out since mid-2022, which is when mortgage rates first spiked.                  Here are the year's hottest housing markets so far, according to @realtordotcom.One takeaway immediately jumps out: all of the most in-demand markets are in either the Northeast or Midwest.Full story for @BusinessInsider coming soon: https:\/\/t.co\/OeELszqHuipic.twitter.com\/7zJPRxFX0Q           \u2014 James Faris (@JamesFaris_) February 11, 2025           \"The Midwest, and some of these Northeast markets, are just outright affordable, relative to the rest of the US,\" Jones said. \"Relative to local incomes, they're also relatively affordable. These are areas that just would appeal to anyone locally or elsewhere because homes are relatively low-priced.\"               While some of these hot markets are much more expensive than the US median price of $400,500, Jones noted that they're still a good deal compared to nearby cities. For example, the hottest location in January was Manchester, New Hampshire, which has a median home value of $578,975 that's far cheaper than nearby Boston's typical price tag of $799,450.               Buyers looking to leave major cities often look to nearby markets. When that happens in droves, it drives that town's relatively low prices far higher \u2014 creating a paradox of sorts.               \"In these more affordable markets, inventory is still really low relative to pre-pandemic,\" Jones said. \"Which means that a lot of buyer demand is coming into relatively few homes.\"               Notably absent from Realtor.com's list of hottest markets is the Sun Belt region, which boomed early in the pandemic but has since seen prices come back to earth as supply started to surge.               \"They got so hot and so popular that prices were able to rise to a point that buyers would no longer participate once mortgage rates came up,\" Jones said of properties in Sun Belt cities. \"Prices are still really high in a lot of those markets, but inventory levels are high.\"               Home supply in those 20 hot markets rose 12.7% to start the year, and while that's a substantial jump, it's nearly half the rate of the national median. Also, there are about half as many home listings in these popular cities as there were before the pandemic.               Business Insider examined Realtor.com's data further and found that the 31 most popular cities in January were all either in the Northeast or Midwest, and 22 are cheaper than the US median.               Below are those markets, along with the multiple of property viewership versus the US median, the median days on the market in early 2024 and 2025, and the median listing price as well as how it compares to the US median price of $400,500.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"I\u2019ve got some grim news for North American fans of Panasonic\u2019s TVs. After returning to these shores in 2024, the company is now mulling the sale of its entire TV division, according to a report from Nikkei. The potential move would be part of a group restructuring at Panasonic Holdings, intended to enable faster decision-making and focus on growth.\u00a0 \u201cWe are prepared to sell it if necessary,\u201d said President Yuki Kusumi said of the TV division on February 4 during an online press conference, \u201cbut we have not yet decided on a plan.\u201d Kusumi went on to say that it would be difficult to find a buyer. Despite producing some of the best-performing TVs on the market \u2014 Digital Trends\u2019 reviewer Caleb Denison said that the 2024 Panasonic Z95A OLED TV is \u201cone of the top 5 TVs ever made\u201d \u2014 Panasonic has struggled to increase its market share both at home in Japan, where it once commanded 20% of sales, and abroad. While a sale of the TV division wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean that Panasonic TVs would leave the U.S. immediately (or at all), it would at the very least mean that there would be a new management team overseeing the development of future Panasonic TVs. In one particular doomy scenario, we\u2019d end up with TVs that bear the Panasonic brand, but that don\u2019t offer the exciting performance of the company\u2019s current flagship, the Z95B OLED TV, which won one of Digital Trends\u2019 Top Tech of CES 2025 awards. The other possibility is that Panasonic won\u2019t be able to sell the TV business, in which case it may elect to simply shutter it. That would be sad for the world\u2019s TV enthusiasts. Panasonic has a legendary history of moving TV technology forward, from its original CRT tube TVs to the plasma models that effectively ushered in the age of high-quality flatscreen HDTVs, to its current class-leading 4K OLED TVs. We now have two new contenders in 2024 to take the top spot for the best Google TV device you can buy. (You Nvidia Shield folks pipe down over there -- that thing\u2019s almost as old as I am.) Google TV Streamer -- which replaces Chromecast with Google TV -- and the Walmart-exclusive Onn 4K Pro. These are very similar devices. Both run the Google TV operating system, which means they basically do the exact same thing in the exact same way. Apple TV+ may not be one of the oldest streaming services out there, but since its arrival in 2019, it's gone head-to-head with streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu since day one. It prioritizes exclusive content, so you won't find a library of shows and movies you already know and love. Instead this streamer has been pushing out amazing new shows like Ted Lasso, For All Mankind, Silo, and Foundation. There's even access to Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer for sports fans. With no ads, Apple TV+ has cemented itself as one of the best streaming services out there, and has amassed an estimated 25 million subscribers over the last five years. It's estimated, because the company has a penchant for offering free promotional subscriptions to those who buy a new Apple device like an iPhone or MacBook. Another year has come and gone, and that means we\u2019re getting new major versions of Apple\u2019s operating systems. Enter: tvOS 18. It\u2019s probably not what you\u2019d consider to be a huge update. I\u2019ve been using it in its various beta forms for a while now, and you\u2019re not going to see it and feel out of place or anything. But there are some new features. But that brings up a good question, which is something worth asking anytime there\u2019s a major update: Should up go ahead and update to tvOS 18? There are two camps on this sort of thing. The case against updating There are some folks who exercise a good deal of patience when it comes to updates. They hold off and see what other folks experience first. They\u2019re not in a hurry for the latest and greatest features. They don\u2019t see a software update and feel compelled by some invisible hand to click that install button just as quickly as possible.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"There\u2019s something scary in the water at Cape Fear. For years, chemicals giant DuPont and the company Chemours, which it spun off in 2015, manufactured long-lasting synthetic chemicals\u2014known as forever chemicals\u2014that made their way into the environment in this corner of North Carolina, ultimately ending up in the Cape Fear River. This is one of America\u2019s PFAS hot spots, though forever chemicals are also found in tap water in thousands of locations around the US. (DuPont has been involved in several class action lawsuits across the United States related to the chemicals since the early 2000s.) Specifically, DuPont and Chemours had used PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, for making Teflon, widely used in nonstick cookware. But, in the process, they contaminated the groundwater. Tests have shown that drinking water in this part of North Carolina can have levels of PFAS many times higher than the federal limit. The health effects of PFAS are frightening\u2014from increasing your risk of cancer and obesity to lowering fertility. \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s still dealing with that,\u201d says Jordan Poler, a chemistry professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge for the people here.\u201d Charlotte is more than 100 miles from the Cape Fear River, and the tap water there is fairly safe, says Poler. But hurricanes sometimes redistribute contaminated water in his direction. It\u2019s partly what inspired him to come up with a new PFAS filtration system\u2014and one with a key difference from existing systems. \u201cA lot of these media, you throw them in the landfill and they\u2019re just going to leach everything back out,\u201d he says of the short-lived filters people often use in pitcher devices or fitted to pipes under their kitchen sinks. Poler wanted to be able to suck PFAS back out of the filter and dispose of it safely instead. He has come up with a low-cost, reusable filter that he\u2019s racing to bring to market. \u201cI\u2019m working my butt off,\u201d he says. In less than a hundred years since their invention in 1934, humanity has bestrewn planet Earth with PFAS chemicals. Manufacturers have stuffed them into cleaning fluids, frying pans, and clothes, among other products. Now, practically anywhere you look, you\u2019ll find traces of PFAS littering the environment. From Mount Everest to Antarctic Penguins and, probably, your tap water. A recent newspaper investigation revealed that PFAS chemicals are in some drinking water supplies in England, while the authors of a separate 2023 study estimated that 45 percent of private and public US drinking water was contaminated by one PFAS chemical or more. The Environmental Protection Agency suggests that between 6 percent and 10 percent of US public drinking water systems are affected. The US banned a handful of particularly harmful PFAS chemicals from drinking water last year, but some water-watchers are already worried that the new Trump administration could roll back these protections. Plus, just last month, a major new research paper described how people living in parts of the US with high levels of PFAS in the drinking water were already more likely to have certain cancers, including oral, lung, and brain cancer. \u201cThese are compounds that don\u2019t break down in the environment, at least not on timescales that are relevant to humans,\u201d says Colin Cooke at the University of Alberta. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck with them.\u201d It\u2019s the ultra-strong carbon-fluorine bonds in PFAS molecules that make them so long-lived. These chemical bonds are among the strongest ever recorded. Cooke explains that PFAS chemicals effortlessly move around with the water cycle, which is how they end up all over the place: \u201cAnywhere that the wind blows and the rain falls, there is potential for these contaminants to be introduced to the environment.\u201d There are three main ways of removing PFAS from water\u2014reverse osmosis, activated carbon filtration, and ion exchange. Reverse osmosis involves forcing water through a semipermeable membrane, which encourages contaminants to separate out from the water. Activated carbon, meanwhile, adsorbs contaminants as water passes through the filter. Poler has opted for the third type with his filter\u2014ion exchange. In this version, the water passes through a fine sand-like material that chemically attracts and filters out certain contaminants. \u201cWe use sustainable materials,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural zeolite [mineral]. You can dig it out of the ground; you don\u2019t have to spend energy making it.\u201d On a microscopic level, Poler says this material has a complex shape. He describes it as a pile of tiny sticks, between which water molecules may pass. That means there\u2019s a high surface area for attracting and pulling out the nasty stuff. Once the filter is full of PFAS and other unwanted materials, Poler says he can regenerate it by using a special fluid to chemically attract those contaminants out. \u201cI\u2019ve done hundreds of cycles; there\u2019s no performance degradation,\u201d he says. He and some colleagues published a study describing the principles of their approach in 2023. The recovered PFAS would ideally then be sent for processing, to once and for all break those carbon-fluorine bonds and dispose of the material safely. Poler has identified companies in North Carolina that he says could do this. The process would require energy to heat and pressurize the PFAS. The alternative, Poler says, is to risk those compounds returning to the environment again\u2014perpetuating the toxic cycle. He adds that he hopes to see his filter on the market as early as later this year. Some other companies advocate instead for long-term containment or storage of PFAS materials underground. In total, there are more than 10,000 PFAS chemicals out there, though some are considered especially harmful. Two in particular, PFOA and PFOS, are so dangerous that they have already been banned from products in a number of countries, including the US. Despite this, other harmful PFAS molecules still turn up in a shocking range of consumer goods, according to Tasha Stoiber, senior scientist at Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit. \u201cEven cosmetics,\u201d she says. Practically everyone now has PFAS in their body, adds Stoiber. But your risk of exposure varies depending on where you live. Military bases and their vicinities are notorious hot spots, generally because of the PFAS in foams used to put out jet fires. Stoiber and her colleagues at EWG keep an eye on the consumer-grade water filtration systems available in the US. The organization\u2019s tests have found that common pitcher filters from brands such as Brita and Berkey do not all remove PFAS equally well. But some do an excellent job, based on EWG\u2019s tests, including the pitcher filter system made by Epic Water Filters, a US-based firm. \u201cI would say PFAS is by far the number one contaminant that we\u2019re getting feedback for our customers being worried about,\u201d says Joel Stevens, cofounder of Epic Water Filters. The filters his company makes for its water pitchers include a carbon block. \u201cThousands upon thousands of layers of carbon fibers that are wrapped around a block,\u201d he explains. As the water trickles through those fibers, the carbon takes off PFAS and other contaminants, including chlorine and lead. In about three months\u2019 time, the company will launch a new pitcher filter that can also take out heavy metals and fluoride. Fluoride is added to water in some areas in order to improve dental health, though some people would prefer not to drink it because of a potential link between fluoride and adverse neurological effects. Scientific analysis suggests that the risk from tap water in countries such as the US, however, is extremely low. While there are some very effective water filter products on the market, says Stoiber, many people still throw spent filters in the trash, which means they ultimately end up at landfill sites where the PFAS can leach out into the environment again. Customers of Epic Water Filters can return their spent filters to the company. \u201cThe filters are then sent to a special recycling center where the plastic is recycled and the internal filters are incinerated,\u201d says Stevens in a follow-up email. Stoiber\u2019s research suggests that some forms of incineration of PFAS materials can release harmful compounds into the environment. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have good disposal recommendations for spent treatment media,\u201d she says. It is possible to break PFAS compounds down, though, at extremely high temperatures, even as high as 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F). Some researchers are currently exploring how chemical additives such as granular activated carbon could reduce the amount of heat required to break down PFAS compounds. There\u2019s another problem with current approaches to PFAS. \u201cCommunity-level drinking water treatment is what\u2019s needed at this point, because the costs shouldn\u2019t fall on the individual,\u201d says Stoiber. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be unfair, who has a filter, who doesn\u2019t, who gets exposed.\u201d While some US drinking water facilities are now installing large-scale PFAS filtration technology, such as in Tampa, Florida, the cost of doing this across the nation could spiral into the billions, according to some analyses. While Stoiber says the most effective strategy for avoiding PFAS contamination is not to use these chemicals in the first place, countless companies still do, and it could be a long time before they disappear entirely from consumer products, if that ever happens.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  The so-called Trump trade that boosted markets at the end of last year has floundered so far in 2025.          Investor bets for President Donald Trump's second term were rooted in assumptions that stocks would soar on lower taxes and regulation and that rates and inflation would creep up as tariffs led to higher costs for consumers. The dollar, meanwhile, would see continued gains on the back of higher-for-longer interest rates.               Investors are instead dealing with whiplash amid the president's back-and-forth approach to issues like trade policy, which has led to a weaker-than-expected stock market. Those traders have been stuck in a state of uncertainty, wondering whether the latest proposal could be rendered moot in a matter of minutes.               Even after a surprisingly hot January inflation report pushed yields and the dollar higher, they're still down to flat on the year, indicating a faltering Trump trade.               Detailed below are three popular Trump-linked bets that haven't panned out so far in 2025:       What was expected to happen: Optimistic forecasts called for a continued rally in the stock market, driven by lower tax rates, deregulation, and a focus on lowering energy costs.       What's actually happened: While the Samp;P 500 is up about 3% year to date, it's lagging behind international peers, with the MSCI All Country World Index ex USA up about 5% over the same period.               \"There is clearly a move towards a looser regulatory climate, but because the initial changes were implemented so quickly, the courts have put many on indefinite hold instead,\" Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider.               Additionally, individual stocks and other assets tied to the Trump trade are suffering. Shares of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group and Tesla were down 11% and 19%, respectively, year to date through Tuesday. Bitcoin, which surged to records above six figures weeks after the election, has seen its rally stall. The token is up just 3% year to date as policy announcements have mostly failed to provide a catalyst for more gains.       What was expected to happen: Bond yields were expected to rise on the prospect of mass deportations and aggressive tariffs, which were predicted to lead to a rebound in inflation. That was seen as hamstringing the Federal Reserve's ability to cut interest rates and even raised the prospect of further hikes from the central bank.       What's actually happened: The 10-year US Treasury yield has edged lower since the start of the year, falling from 4.57% to as low as 4.42% in recent days. Chances for up to two interest rate cuts from the Fed have moved higher since the start of the year. Yields did increase 11 basis points on Wednesday after a hotter-than-expected January inflation report.       What was expected to happen: The US dollar was seen as gaining versus its international counterparts on the prospect of higher interest rates and protectionist trade policies implemented by the Trump administration.       What's actually happened: The US dollar index \u2014 which weights the dollar against a basket of major currencies \u2014 had declined by about 0.4% since the start of the year through Tuesday. The index rose 0.3% on Wednesday after the inflation numbers were released.               \"Tariffs were thought to be a boon for the dollar, but the stop\/start nature of some of the key announcements has blunted that rally,\" Sosnick said.               Sosnick said the state of the Trump trade reflected a Wall Street adage: Buy the rumor; sell the news.               \"Markets are very good at anticipating, and thus pricing in, the potential benefits of any developments \u2014 governmental or corporate \u2014 that might come their way,\" Sosnick said. \"Yet some disappointment arises if the likely timeframe for receiving those benefits is longer than expected.               \"That is to some extent what we are seeing now. Even a government that seems to be operating at warp speed can't necessarily meet the loftiest expectations of impatient investors.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Despite the turmoil in the stock market caused by persistent inflation, shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+2.98%) rose Wednesday morning as the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report highlighted a positive outlook regarding its delayed annual report and announced an ambitious goal for 2026. The AI hardware company is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang is confident that it will be submitted on time. The company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period. However, the company lowered its fiscal 2025 revenue guidance, now expecting between $23.5 billion and $25 billion. This marks a decline from its previous forecast of $26 billion to $30 billion, while analysts had projected $24.9 billion. Moreover, the company reported net sales between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, reflecting a 54% year-over-year growth, although analysts had expected $5.89 billion. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Joes-based company went through many ups and downs. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA-1.05%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer\u2019s governance practices and board independence. Looking forward to a fresh start in 2025, SMCI stock has risen 37% year-to-date and is currently trading at $41 per share.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  In January, inflation unexpectedly accelerated.          The consumer price index rose 3% from a year ago, data published Wednesday showed. That's above December's rate and the consensus expectation, both of which were 2.9%.               The CPI increased 0.5% over the month in January from December, above the forecast of 0.3% and recent month-over-month increases.               Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 3.3% in January from a year ago, above the forecast of 3.1%. It also rose 0.4% over the month, greater than the forecast of 0.3%.               Egg prices soared 15.2% in January from just a month prior and 53% year over year.               Rising rents and home prices continue to be stubborn problems. Shelter prices were up 0.4% over the month \u2014 a tick up from the previous month's 0.3% increase \u2014 and 4.4% over the year. BLS noted that the increase in housing prices accounted for \"nearly 30 percent of the monthly all items increase.\"               Energy prices were up 1.1% over the month, largely powered by a 1.8% increase in gas prices.               The new data means inflation has heated up for four straight months.               \"We want to see inflation move down, not up,\" Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst, said in a statement to Business Insider before the new data was published.               Fed chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday in his regular semiannual testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that the economy is strong and the US isn't in a recession.               \"Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid,\" Powell said. \"Inflation has moved much closer to our 2% longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated.\"               CME FedWatch showed after the report a 97.5% chance of a hold in interest rates at the next scheduled Federal Open Market Committee meeting in March, up from 95.5% before the report. The FOMC held rates steady at its first scheduled 2025 meeting in January.               US 10-year treasury yields were up after the report, and stock futures slid.               The jobs report on Friday showed cooler job growth in January than expected, but unemployment cooled from 4.1% in December to 4%, and wage growth held steady.               \"We're seeing economic activity staying healthy, and as a result of that, it takes a little bit of the urgency off of the Federal Reserve,\" Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said after the jobs report was published on Friday.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"TIME has published its first annual list of the World's Best Companies of 2025 - Asia\/Pacific, in partnership with Statista, a leading international provider of market and consumer data and rankings. The result of this quantitative study: 500 companies shaping the Asia-Pacific region's role in global business. Here's how the winners were selected. The research project \"World's Best Companies of 2025 - Asia\/Pacific\" is a comprehensive analysis conducted to identify the top performing companies in the Asia-Pacific region. The study was based on three primary dimensions: Employee Satisfaction, Financial Performance, and Sustainability Transparency (ESG).  The first dimension, Employee Satisfaction, was evaluated using survey data from 2023 from employees worldwide with a main focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The surveys were conducted across the Asia-Pacific region with data collected from more than 50,000 participants. The evaluation encompassed evaluations of companies based on direct and indirect recommendations.  The second dimension, Financial Performance, was assessed using data from Statista\u2019s financial database and targeted research. The companies had to meet certain criteria to be considered for the evaluation, including generating a revenue of at least US $100 million in 2023. Companies also needed to either demonstrate positive revenue growth from 2021 to 2023 or generate a profit in 2023. Both relative and absolute financial performance were considered in the evaluation.  The third dimension, Sustainability Transparency, was evaluated based on ESG data from 2022 among standardized KPIs from Statista\u2019s ESG Database and targeted data research. To formulate a comprehensive ESG index, multiple data points were collected. For the environmental evaluation, this included the carbon emissions intensity and reduction rate, as well as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) rating. The social dimension assessed the share of women on the board of directors and the existence of a human rights policy. The governance dimension evaluated whether a company had a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report adhering to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and a compliance or anti-corruption guideline. Additional consideration was taken for recent disqualifying events. Once the data was collected and evaluated, it was consolidated and weighted within a scoring model. The scores of all three dimensions were added on an equal percentage basis to form the final ranking score of a maximum of 100 points. The 500 companies with the highest score were awarded as the World's Best Companies of 2025 - Asia\/Pacific by TIME and Statista. Contact us at letters@time.com","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  Property owners across California will likely pay higher insurance premiums to help cover the damages of the Los Angeles wildfires after the state's insurance plan of last resort said it doesn't have enough funds to pay out its claims.          State regulators on Tuesday approved a $1 billion bailout of California's insurer of last resort, the FAIR Plan, which covers those who can't find insurance on the private market. The bailout will be funded by private insurers licensed to operate in the state \u2014 and under a new rule enacted last year, they can pass up to half of the cost on to their customers.               The FAIR Plan said it was set to run out of money by the end of March as losses piled up from the Palisades and Eaton fires. It would be the first time in 30 years that it had been unable to pay its claims.               The bailout comes after California's largest home insurer, State Farm, this month asked state regulators for emergency permission to raise homeowners' rates by an average of 22%, starting May 1, to avert a \"dire situation\" for the company's finances. As of February 3, State Farm had paid out $1 billion and said it expected to spend far more.               It's all part of a worsening home insurance crisis in California that was already underway before the LA blazes destroyed more than 12,000 buildings. Back-to-back fires in 2017 and 2018 decimated insurers' profits, prompting companies including State Farm, Allstate, and Farmers Insurance to either stop writing new policies, pull back coverage, or, in some cases, drop tens of thousands of property owners in the state. Insurers cited growing losses from wildfires and other disasters coupled with inflation and more expensive home repairs.               Most recently, beginning in July, State Farm dropped nearly\u00a070% of its policyholders\u00a0in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood.               All of this has forced hundreds of thousands of homeowners into the FAIR plan, designed to be a backstop for those who can't find insurance on the traditional market. Participation more than doubled between 2020 and 2024 to nearly half a million homes \u2014 many of which were in areas devastated by the Palisades and Eaton fires.               The bill for the bailout will be divided among private insurers based on their market share in the state. As of 2023, State Farm, Farmers Insurance, and CSAA Insurance held the largest percentage of policies in California, according to S&P Global data. They have 30 days to pay the FAIR plan and \u2014 under a rule change made by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara last year \u2014 insurers can request approval to pass up to half those costs onto residential and commercial policyholders.               The change was part of Lara's broader strategy to lure private insurers back to California to help stabilize the market. The rules also should make it easier for companies to raise premiums and factor in the costs of reinsurance and risks of future disasters. In exchange, insurers will have to expand coverage in communities most at risk of wildfires.               Lara said he approved the FAIR Plan bailout to protect consumers and blamed 30 years of stagnant regulations for putting more people at risk.               \"The FAIR Plan must pay claims just like any other insurance company,\" he said in a statement. \"I reject those who are hoping for the failure of our insurance market by spreading fear and doubt. Wildfire survivors can't cash 'what ifs' to pay for food and rent, but they can cash FAIR Plan checks.\"               Some consumer advocates on Tuesday threatened legal action to stop private insurers from surcharging customers.               \"This gift to insurance companies rewards bad behavior and will only incentivize insurers to drop even more homeowners and force them onto the FAIR Plan in the future because there's no consequence for abandoning these families,\" said Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog in Los Angeles.

In a March 2024 interview with Bloomberg, David Westin got straight to the point, asking Fink for his take on the crisis: \"Give us your diagnosis of that problem.\" Fink clarified that millions of Americans aren't financially prepared for their later years. \"We have still 57 million Americans who don't have any savings or any retirement plan,\" he stated. And if those people think Social Security alone will carry them through, Fink had a blunt reality check: \"If that's all you have when you retire, you're going to be living in poverty, below the poverty line.\" Don't Miss: Many don\u2019t know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment \u2014 Here\u2019s how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big move Many are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula. Fink's wake-up call wasn't just theoretical. In his 2024 annual letter to shareholders, he reflected on his experience handling his parents' finances after his mother passed away. He was surprised at how much they had saved despite their modest income, a stark contrast to the dire state many retirees find themselves in today. According to Fink, the crux of the issue is that the entire retirement system is outdated. \"Most Americans retired between 60 and 62 then, but most Americans passed away at 67,\" he explained. \"Today, statistically, a couple 60 years old in good health \u2013 one of them is going to live over 90.\" With people living decades longer, retirement savings must stretch further, yet most aren't prepared. Advances in medicine compound this longevity crisis. \"The miracles of technology ... are extending life,\" Fink said, referencing breakthroughs in treatments for heart disease, kidney disease and even dementia. But while medicine is evolving, financial planning isn't keeping up. \"There is not a dialogue in America ... about can we afford that longevity?\" Trending: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. Fink believes fixing retirement requires two things: conversation and action. \"We solve problems through conversation,\" he said. But when it comes to retirement, \"we have no conversation.\" He stressed the need for a global \u2013 and national \u2013 dialogue to reevaluate retirement age, savings strategies and investment approaches. One potential fix? Using capital markets to boost retirement savings. Fink pointed to Japan, where a recent policy change doubled the amount of tax-deductible retirement contributions. The result? A 30% surge in the Japanese stock market, driven by long-term investment. \"Not only does it give financial returns for those who are retiring and saving for retirement, but it's a big foundation for domestic companies,\" he explained. With Social Security on shaky ground, Fink suggested a controversial idea: investing the Social Security trust fund in long-term assets. \"Right now in Congress, a number of senators and congressmen are talking about rehabilitating our Social Security pool and maybe contributing a big block of money into it,\" he noted. The U.S. system, he said, is a \"pay-as-you-go\" model, unlike countries such as Australia, where retirement funds are structured differently to ensure sustainability.

As a baby boomer himself, Fink acknowledged that his generation has benefited from economic prosperity, but he questioned whether they've done enough to secure a stable future for younger generations. \"We were born at a great economic moment,\" he said. \"We all have a responsibility to try to recreate that environment for our grandchildren.\" His message was clear: Americans need to save more, invest smarter and rethink their approach to retirement. Because as Fink put it, \"We need to have a conversation.\" That conversation shouldn't just be national \u2013 it should also be personal. With people living longer and the retirement landscape shifting, now is the time to consult a financial advisor to ensure you're on track. Whether adjusting your investment strategy, maximizing your savings or finding ways to generate income in retirement, getting professional guidance can help you retire on your terms \u2013 without relying solely on Social Security.

Yuka, Foodwatch and the League Against Cancer are launching a major European petition for the banning of aspartame, classified as a possible carcinogen for humans since 2023. (Photo Illustration by Gerard Bottino\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) recently published its Q4 earnings, surpassing market expectations for both revenue and earnings. The company reported revenue of $11.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.55 per share, exceeding the consensus estimates of $10.7 billion and $0.52, respectively. Stronger pricing helped drive results, and Coca-Cola\u2019s 2025 outlook met market expectations. These positive factors contributed to KO stock gaining 5% after the results were announced. Separately, CROX reports earnings tomorrow. Will the stock pop on the news? See How Might Crocs Stock React To Upcoming Earnings? Since the start of 2024, KO stock has risen 13%, underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 27% gain. A slowdown in volume growth has weighed on its stock price over the past year. However, if you're looking for a steadier investment alternative, consider the High-Quality Portfolio, which has delivered over 91% returns since its inception. Coca-Cola\u2019s revenue of $11.5 billion reflected a 6% year-over-year increase on a reported basis. However, on an organic basis, revenue grew by 14%, driven by a 9% increase in price\/mix and a 5% rise in concentrate sales. By segment, organic sales increased by 17% in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, 25% in Latin America, 15% in North America, 1% in Asia Pacific, and 3% in Global Ventures. Despite recent challenges in volume growth, Q4 volume increased by 2%, marking a positive development. Additionally, Coca-Cola saw a 90 basis point year-over-year increase in its operating margin, reaching 24% for the quarter. With higher revenues and expanded margins, net earnings rose by 12% to $0.55 per share. Looking ahead, the company expects organic sales growth between 5% and 6%, supported by both higher volume and pricing. Coca-Cola also projects its bottom line to grow between 2% and 3%, in line with market expectations of a 2.5% year-over-year increase. Although there were concerns over potential impacts from metal import tariffs, Coca-Cola\u2019s management reassured investors that packaging costs make up a small portion of expenses and that any tariff-related effects would be manageable. Following its earnings report, KO stock rose, reflecting the company's solid Q4 performance and guidance that aligned with market expectations. While its performance over the past four years has been uneven, the stock has been less volatile compared to the S&P 500, delivering annual returns of 11% in 2021, 11% in 2022, -4% in 2023, and 9% in 2024. The Trefis High-Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, has exhibited lower volatility and has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? Because its holdings generally offer higher returns with lower risk compared to the broader market, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given uncertainties surrounding interest rate cuts and global trade tensions, will KO underperform the S&P 500 over the next 12 months, or is a strong rally ahead? While we are updating our Coca-Cola model with the latest data, we believe there is still room for growth. At approximately $68 per share, KO trades at 23 times trailing earnings of $2.88 per share, which is below its five-year average P\/E ratio of 25x. With strong volume growth, improving margins, and limited impact from aluminum tariffs, KO stock appears to have upside potential. Despite its recent price appreciation, we believe Coca-Cola remains an attractive long-term investment. As an aside, see What\u2019s Happening With McDonald\u2019s Stock?

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"The company\u2019s fate will reveal how strong the foundation of Elon Musk\u2019s influence really is. Donald Trump may be pleased enough with Elon Musk, but even as the Tesla CEO is exercising his newfound power to essentially undo whole functions of the federal government, he still has to reassure his investors. Lately, Musk has delivered for them in one way: The value of the company\u2019s shares has skyrocketed since Trump was reelected to the presidency of the United States. But Musk had much to answer for on his recent fourth-quarter earnings call\u2014not least that in 2024, Tesla\u2019s car sales had sunk for the first time in a decade. Profits were down sharply too. Usually, when this happens at a car company, the CEO issues a mea culpa, vows to cut costs, and hypes vehicles coming to market soon.  Instead, Musk beamed about robotics, artificial intelligence, and Tesla\u2019s path to being \u201cworth more than the next top five companies combined.\u201d This is the vision he has been selling investors for years: Making cars\u2014a volatile, hypercompetitive business with infamously low profit margins\u2014was only the start for Tesla. Its future business will be making fleets of self-driving taxis and humanoid robots trained for thankless manual labor. Whether his vision has any connection to reality is hotly debated by many AI and robotics experts, but most Wall Street analysts put their faith in Musk. And he has, at times, delivered on wildly ambitious goals. Shares jumped again after the call. (Tesla did respond to a request for comment; a DOGE official did not respond to an email seeking comment.)  Musk gets the benefit of the doubt from investors because\u2014despite undelivered promises, half-baked ideas, and forgotten plans\u2014he has made Tesla worth, on paper at least, more than essentially the rest of the auto industry combined. His funders are asked to buy Musk\u2019s picture of the future, and the recent enthusiasm for Tesla stock suggests they believe that his political influence will help him get there.  Musk needs that belief to hold. Tesla\u2019s stock price is the largest source of his enormous wealth and, by extension, his influence; if his plans succeed, that stock is also his clearest shot at achieving trillionaire status. Right now, though, Tesla\u2019s primary business is still selling cars that people drive, and Musk himself may be the biggest reason that faith in Tesla could falter.  For all of Musk\u2019s ire for the former president, Tesla did very well in the Joe Biden years. The Model Y is the world\u2019s best-selling electric vehicle and its best-selling car, period. The company has comfortably been out of its \u201cmoney-losing start-up\u201d phase for years. Although the competition among EV makers is heating up, the only individual company close to eating into Tesla\u2019s market share is China\u2019s BYD, which for the first time last year produced more EVs than Tesla did.  Yet that competition can\u2019t entirely account for Tesla\u2019s latest, abysmal numbers. Last year, Tesla sales were down nearly 12 percent in the EV stronghold of California. And in Europe, where Musk is helping supercharge far-right politics, Tesla\u2019s sales were down 63 percent last month in France and 59 percent in Germany. This is happening even as the rest of the worldwide electric market is growing fast; nearly every car company that makes EVs saw sales gains in 2024, some of them huge.  Musk\u2019s activism does seem to be turning off the affluent or middle-income progressive crowd that was traditionally Tesla\u2019s bread and butter. Look no further than how the company\u2019s new, updated Model Y has been received. Musk\u2019s army of fanboys on X was as effusive as ever, but outside the hard-core Tesla bubble, the SUV was met with a flood of Nazi jokes following Musk\u2019s Sieg heil\u2013ish arm gesture at Trump\u2019s inauguration. This type of reaction goes beyond that one car; the Cybertruck has a unique penchant for being the target of vandalism, and people appear to be making a killing selling anti-Musk bumper stickers to disgusted Tesla owners. In covering the auto industry, I can\u2019t go a week without fielding emails from people asking for advice on the best EV alternatives to Tesla\u2014many from longtime Tesla owners who say they\u2019re ready to move on.  In theory, Musk\u2019s rightward turn could help him swap out traditionally liberal buyers for more conservative ones, who usually tend to be more skeptical of EVs. And it\u2019s likely that EVs will become less polarizing along partisan lines over time as electrification becomes more common on new cars. Right now, however, even the deep-red-coded Cybertruck doesn\u2019t seem to be changing many minds about the concept of battery-powered cars. Take a recent report from the EV Politics Project, a nonprofit group that studies the partisan divide over electric cars. Their study indicates that although Musk himself is now viewed much more favorably by Trump voters and Republicans, he\u2019s not leading some seismic shift in how they view EVs.  Nor is he obviously trying to get MAGA voters to buy the new Model Y. In fact, those who follow the auto industry closely wonder if Musk is still interested in running a car company at all. On that January earnings call, he offered only a boilerplate response about \u201cmore affordable\u201d new Teslas coming soon; the word Cybertruck was not uttered once. He is, however, clearly focused on the company\u2019s \u201cunsupervised\u201d robotaxi service. (Imagine Uber, except with Model Ys and Model 3 sedans, and with no humans behind the wheel.) He claims that Tesla will launch the taxis in Austin in June, the first step toward turning the company into the AI powerhouse that Musk thinks will make it so valuable. Right now, his AI ventures are separate, but he\u2019s started mingling them with his ambitions for Tesla. Ultimately, his thinking\u2014which he\u2019s articulated in earnings and public appearances over a number of years\u2014is that his roving network of autonomous vehicles can use their cameras to capture huge quantities of data, and those data can be used to train AI networks.  In the immediate future, Musk wants Tesla robotaxis everywhere, as soon as possible, and sleeping next door to the White House could help advance that part of his vision. Critics have expressed concerns that his newfound influence could also help stymie federal investigations into Tesla, which are probing the crash record of the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d technology and its claims about the technology\u2019s safety. And his current political position could help eliminate one of his oldest foes: regulations.  Tesla has long clashed with environmental rules (last year, a California judge ordered Tesla to pay $1.5 million over allegations that it mishandled hazardous waste), labor laws (employees at a Tesla plant have said that the company failed to pay overtime, among other alleged violations), and safety ordinances (the company was recently fined for violating California\u2019s workplace-heat-safety rules at one of their plants). But the greatest roadblock to Musk\u2019s vision of robotaxis everywhere is arguably America\u2019s current patchwork of state-by-state rules and regulations for autonomous vehicles, which may allow self-driving cars in some places but not others. No federal standards currently exist, but creating rules favorable to the industry would speed things up\u2014especially if those rules were tailored to especially benefit Tesla.  Musk\u2019s approach to Tesla\u2019s future has more than a few problems that the rest of the self-driving-car industry does not face. Tesla relies solely on cameras and AI for its automated-driving systems, rather than lidar and other more advanced sensors used by competitors. Plenty of experts think Tesla\u2019s strategy can never power true autonomous driving. And Tesla is already years behind robotaxi companies operating in many cities right now, most notably Google\u2019s Waymo. Musk\u2019s Tesla faces the rising threat of China\u2019s advancements in AI too: Investors are noticing BYD\u2019s autonomy-focused deal with tech upstart DeepSeek. And they\u2019re noticing where Musk\u2019s attention lies; as he holds court in the Oval Office, Tesla\u2019s stock has begun losing all those postelection gains.  The most daunting problem, though, may be the same problem Musk has always had: people. Even if he does succeed in tearing down the regulatory state for the sake of his own companies, who\u2019s to say anyone will buy what they\u2019re selling. Any power Musk has in the future depends on turning millions of people into Tesla customers. If he can\u2019t do that\u2014or at least keep convincing investors that he\u2019ll be able to\u2014he\u2019s just another guy screaming online.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"        Alina Selyukh                        Cocoa prices have surged over the past several years, recently reaching record levels and driving up the cost of chocolate.                                                           Scott Olson\/Getty                                       hide caption  Bonbons and truffles are even more of a luxury this Valentine's Day. For the third year, cocoa harvests are coming up short due to abnormal weather, which has led to cocoa beans being so expensive that chocolate makers have little choice but to raise their own prices. \"It's been a pretty dramatic change to our business model,\" says Alex Whitmore, who runs Taza Chocolate, a Boston-area manufacturer. His company makes mainly bars, but also Mexican-style chocolate, chocolate-covered nuts and bark. Taza's focus on darker, cocoa-dense chocolate means Whitmore has been paying a premium for cocoa beans. \"The cost of cocoa for us has almost tripled,\" he says. \"We did raise prices by almost 15% \u2026 and it's a possibility that we may have to increase again, but we're doing everything we can to kind of hold the line.\" Big chocolate brands such as Nestle, Hershey and Mondel\u0113z, which makes Cadbury and Milka, have all raised prices, too, and warn of further increases over this year. The world's supply of cocoa is having the worst shortage in 60 years, says David Branch, an agricultural industry analyst at Wells Fargo. That's because most of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa, particularly Ivory Coast and Ghana. Changing climate patterns have farmers there dealing with extreme weather and sick trees. \"Too much moisture followed by getting too hot and drying out too much,\" Branch says, explaining that shifting weather patterns stress older cocoa trees and make them more susceptible to disease. Globally, the latest crop data showed production down 13% from a year earlier, Branch says, marking the third year of declines. \"We're seeing improvement in deliveries,\" he says. \"But it's a pretty big hole to climb out of.\" Last Valentine's Day, the price of cocoa on the futures market broke a 47-year record. It has doubled since then. The financial rollercoaster has drawn many speculators trying to make a quick buck on big price jumps, which has only exacerbated the volatility. Shoppers, so far, don't seem too disheartened. Chocolate sales are still rising, despite higher prices. \"Consumers quote chocolate as one of their indulgences that they cannot live without,\" Mondel\u0113z CEO Dirk Van de Put told investors last week. And the good news is that the market is correcting itself \u2014 just slowly. Bakeries and other companies that don't absolutely have to use chocolate are focusing more on other flavors. Big manufacturers are pushing shoppers toward chewy, gummy or other less-chocolatey candy. KitKat, for example, has launched cinnamon-toast and Neapolitan flavors, without chocolate dip. Countries outside West Africa have stepped up their cocoa production. Branch says farmers in Ecuador, for example, have planted new trees that will produce a lot more cocoa a few years down the road. \"We're going to see this ease,\" he says. \"It's just not a very quick fix.\" And fundamentally, pricier cocoa means more money for cocoa farmers in West Africa and elsewhere to invest in their farms \u2014 to grow younger trees, fortify older ones and make the cocoa bean supply more sustainable. \"The price of cocoa is really responding to a long-term underinvestment in the cocoa sector,\" says Whitmore at Taza Chocolate. \"It's a true correction for ... so much underinvestment because the price has been so low for so long. We're paying for that now.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

Ltd. has filed its application for a jumbo listing in Hong Kong that could be the city\u2019s biggest stock offering in four years. Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Arabia\u2019s Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data Center Why American Mobility Ground to a Halt Cutting Arena Subsidies Can Help Cover Tax Cuts, Think Tank Says SpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in May The Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt Marseille The long-awaited filing by CATL, as the world\u2019s top electric-vehicle battery maker is known, comes amid a rally in Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. The company could raise more than $5 billion, Bloomberg News reported earlier. That would be the largest since Kuaishou Technology\u2019s $6.2 billion listing in early 2021. CATL is expected to drive much of this year\u2019s share-sale recovery in Hong Kong, with other mainland China-listed companies also seeking a second float in the city. The chief executive officer of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. last month said about 100 companies were in the initial public offering pipeline. Hong Kong\u2019s IPO proceeds nearly doubled in 2024 to about $10 billion, but that\u2019s still below the annual average of about $30 billion for the 10 years preceding the pandemic, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CATL has appointed Bank of America Corp., China International Capital Corp., CSC Financial Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. as joint sponsors for the listing, according to the company\u2019s filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG are also among the arrangers for the share sale. The Ningde, Fujian-based EV battery giant said the funds raised will be used to fund its European expansion, namely in Hungary. Of the 4.9 billion euro ($5.1 billion) needed for the 100 gigawatt-hours factory, CATL said in its prospectus it has spent 700 million euro so far, with the secondary listing raising the rest of the funds. The blockbuster listing comes amid rising geopolitical tensions which may endanger the battery-maker\u2019s global expansion. Last month, CATL was added to a US Defense Department list of firms with alleged links to the Chinese military. While inclusion doesn\u2019t carry specific sanctions, US businesses could be discouraged from dealing with the companies on the list. Earnings by CATL, a major supplier to Tesla Inc., last year rose as much as 20% as the company tightened its grip on the EV battery market. CATL is on track to post a new peak in annual net income, though its sales are set to drop for the first time since it began disclosing results in 2015. CATL accounted for over one-third of global battery shipments in the third quarter of 2024, according to Seoul-based SNE Research, more than double that of runner-up BYD Co. The company supplies not just Tesla but also many of the world\u2019s biggest automakers, from Stellantis NV to Volkswagen AG. CATL, based in southeast China\u2019s Fujian province, currently trades on the Shenzhen stock exchange. It has a market value of about $152 billion. The Hang Seng Index has climbed 6% in 2025, extending last year\u2019s 18% advance. The gauge fell in each of the previous four years. --With assistance from Danny Lee.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Lone Star State is on track to become a business hub, rivaling the likes of Silicon Valley and Wall Street.          The New York Stock Exchange announced Wednesday that it would be relocating its Chicago headquarters to Dallas. The fully electronic exchange will serve as a platform for companies to list and trade securities.               \"As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere,\" NYSE Group president Lynn Martin said in a statement.                The NYSE did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.               Over the past decade, hundreds of businesses, including Charles Schwab, Oracle, and HPE, have established a base in Texas, their leaders citing business-friendly taxes and regulations.               Billionaire Elon Musk has added momentum to the migration. He moved Tesla's headquarters to Austin in 2021.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  As Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others rush to build a more powerful search engine, smaller tech rivals are trying a well-worn strategy to spur growth: using college students to help convert people into faithful users.          In the past year, startups like Perplexity, You.com, and Liner, which is South Korea's search equivalent, have recruited hundreds of students to promote and endorse their services. These \"campus ambassadors\" post flyers, throw hackathons and speaker events, and give away fast food and merch in exchange for signing up.               Perplexity's downloads have been helped by guerilla marketing tactics that specifically target students. Greg Feingold, the company's head of community, says a successful back-to-school campaign pulled in over 50,000 sign-ups for a free month of Perplexity Pro. By December, the three-year-old search and chatbot developer saw usage surge among American students, with millions of queries sent each week.               \"They're a substantial part of our user base,\" Feingold said, \"and also they come back to the product a lot. It's so tied to what they are using the internet for, which is research, studying, this kind of knowledge work that Perplexity is built for.\"               As of March 2024, Perplexity had around 15 million monthly active users; it declined to give a more recent user total. The company was last valued at around $9 billion in a funding round led by IVP.               Building a viral app all but requires buy-in from teens, tweens, and twenty-somethings. By now, most of them have heard of ChatGPT. It's been over two years since the chatbot's public launch dazzled the tech world. And the use of ChatGPT is ticking up, particularly among younger people. About a quarter of American teens say they've used ChatGPT for schoolwork, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the fall.               Enlisting students allows ChatGPT's rivals to reach trendsetters who have access to thousands of other students through their dorms, mailing lists, private WhatsApp groups, and classes. This strategy mirrors the tactics used by iconic apps like Facebook, Snapchat, and Tinder.               \"This is the generation that has grown up with tech in their lives,\" said Emma Yee Yick, global community lead at startup Notion, where she's run a campus ambassador program these past three years. \"And so now they're in college, and they are the ones who are going to decide what tools we use in the future.\"               Liner is one of the most popular search engines you've never heard of. With over 10 million users globally, Andreessen Horowitz recognized it as the fourth-most widely used generative AI web product last year. The app works similarly to Perplexity but instead of combing large swaths of the internet, it narrows its search to credible sources like academic papers and government databases.               But as a South Korean startup, Liner's name barely registers outside some higher education circles. The company's campus ambassador program aims to change that.               Every week, Kristine Zhou, a sophomore and Liner ambassador at the University of California, Berkeley, hangs outside the student center with a laptop and a party tray of Chick-fil-A. She offers demos to students passing by, reeling them in with free chicken sandwiches. But the real hook, said Zhou, is Liner's focus on providing users with reliable content.               The program kicked off last semester at four California universities, which the company picked for their proximity to Liner employees in San Francisco, said Alex Yoon, head of US operations.               With Perplexity, student evangelists focus on practical applications when tabling on the quad or speaking to a club. Arthita Ghosh, a graduate student at Chicago Booth in London on an exchange term, engages students by asking about their travel plans. She uses the app to swiftly generate a two-day itinerary with must-see attractions, travel times, and costs.               Isis Decrem, a computer science major at the University of Chicago, emphasizes the versatility of Perplexity. She demonstrates the ability to switch between models within the app to vary the outcome.               You.com is also in the business of search but doesn't call itself a search engine. Founded by two former Stanford machine learning researchers, the company makes a digital workspace for conducting research, creating content, and building custom agents to perform tasks on their own. To help grow its foothold, You.com leverages campus ambassadors at 18 universities, including Stanford, New York University, and Georgia Tech.               Vishal Makhijani, You.com's chief operating officer, notes that if the program works as it should, the company should see benefits for years to come.               \"You.com is trying to be the leading productivity platform for knowledge workers, and college students are just knowledge workers in a year or two,\" said Makhijani, who was the longtime chief executive of online education company Udacity.               Those loyal users might continue using You.com in their first jobs, streamlining the company's efforts to sell into organizations and shortening sales cycles, said Makhijani.               To be sure, the unspoken goal of competitors in this market is to secure a second-place finish. Google is the dominant search engine, with a 90% share of the global search market.               While these startups may not dethrone Google as the go-to search engine, their efforts are far from futile, especially for the student ambassadors involved.               Though the position is usually unpaid (Liner pays students $20 an hour), the student ambassador\u00a0will likely benefit from free subscriptions, logo apparel, virtual events with company leaders, and the opportunity to link their name with a buzzy startup. In today's frozen job market, many students believe working as a campus ambassador helps bridge the gap to their ideal employers.               Perplexity saw an over 600% increase in applications for its spring semester program compared to the fall, according to Feingold, Perplexity's community lead. The program now boasts \"hundreds\" of ambassadors across the globe, from Egypt to France to South Africa.               The ambassador program's reach is reflected not just in numbers but also in daily student life. At the MIT Sloan School of Management, Honey Pamnani knew she'd made an impact during class when her professor answered a student's question with a simple directive.               \"Just Perplexity it.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Following on the success of its IP-friendly Firefly Image model, Adobe announced on Wednesday the beta release of a new Firefly Video model, as well as two subscription packages with which to access its audio and video generating abilities. Generate Video, according to the announcement post, \u201cempowers creative professionals with tools to generate video clips from a text prompt or image, use camera angles to control shots, create professional quality images from 3D sketches, craft atmospheric elements and develop custom motion design elements.\u201d The model will initially be able to generate video in 1080p resolution to start, though the company plans to release a 4k model for professional production work in the near future. Like the image generator, Firefly Video is trained exclusively on Adobe stock, licensed, and public domain content, making its outputs usable in commercial applications without fear of them running afoul of copyright or intellectual property protections. And, unlike Grok 2, there\u2019s minimal chance of it outputting racist, offensive, or illegal content. Firefly Video will be accessible both through Adobe Premiere Pro (as the Generative Extend tool) and through a new web application\u202f, Firefly.Adobe.com. Users will be able to generate video clips from both text prompts and reference images, as well as add atmospheric effects and custom motion design elements. They\u2019ll even be able to lock in the first and last frames of a clip, \u201cto preserve visual continuity, keep colors and character details consistent.\u201d The new Scene to Image feature allows users to \u201cseamlessly render production-ready assets\u201d using a 3D sketching tool, converting a creator\u2019s concept art into high resolution images and structure references that can then be used to iterate a generated video clip. Firefly Video can also generate audio to translate spoken dialog into any of 20 languages. Adobe is rolling out a pair of subscription plans alongside Firefly Video, either of which will grant you full access to the new model. The $10 per month Firefly Standard\u202fplan offers 2,000 video\/audio credits per month worth as many as 20 5-second video generations at 1080p. The $30 per month Firefly Pro\u202fplan, on the other hand, provides 7,000 video\/audio credits per month which will get you up to 70 5-second clips at 1080p. Adobe also revealed that a \u201cFirefly Premium\u201d\u202fplan is in the works, geared towards professionals looking to generate high volumes of video and audio, though there\u2019s no word yet on what it might cost or when it will be released. Adobe first teased the Firefly video model in April of last year before providing a preview of its capabilities in September. It enters an increasingly crowded market with competition from both premium and free-to use models alike, such as Kling AI, Meta\u2019s Movie Gen, and OpenAI\u2019s Sora. OpenAI kicked off its inaugural \"12 Days of OpenAI\" media blitz on December 5, each day unveiling new features, models, subscription tiers, and capabilities for its growing ChatGPT product ecosystem during a series of live-stream events. Here's a quick rundown of everything the company announced. Day 1: OpenAI unleashes its o1 reasoning model and introduces ChatGPT Pro OpenAI o1 and o1 pro mode in ChatGPT \u2014 12 Days of OpenAI: Day 1 For the finale of its 12 Days of OpenAI livestream event, CEO Sam Altman revealed its next foundation model, and successor to the recently announced o1 family of reasoning AIs, dubbed o3 and 03-mini. And no, you aren't going crazy -- OpenAI skipped right over o2, apparently to avoid infringing on the copyright of British telecom provider O2. Editing your Instagram videos will soon be as simple as typing out a text prompt, thanks to a new generative AI tool the company hopes to release in 2025, CEO Adam Mosseri announced Thursday. The upcoming tool, which leverages Meta's Movie Gen model, will enable users to \"change nearly any aspect of your videos,\" Mosseri said during his preview demonstration. Those changes range from subtle modifications, like adding a gold chain to his existing outfit or a hippo in the background, to wholesale alterations including swapping his wardrobe or giving himself a felt, Muppet-like appearance.

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST), a cloud-based artificial intelligence lending platform in the U.S., recently announced its Q4 earnings, which significantly exceeded market expectations. The company reported revenue of $219 million and earnings of $0.26 per share, surpassing the consensus estimates of $181 million in revenue and a loss of $0.04 per share. Additionally, its forward guidance also exceeded expectations. Following the strong quarterly results, UPST stock surged by more than 20% in after-hours trading. Separately, CROX reports earnings tomorrow. Will the stock pop on the news? See How Might Crocs Stock React To Upcoming Earnings? Since the start of 2024, UPST stock has gained 65%, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which has risen 27% over the same period. The company\u2019s stock price has been driven higher by newly established partnerships to fund consumer loans. If you are looking for an alternative with steadier growth than an individual stock, you might consider the High-Quality Portfolio, which has delivered over 91% returns since inception and has outperformed the S&P 500. Upstart\u2019s revenue for Q4 reached $219 million, reflecting a 56% year-over-year increase, driven by strong loan origination growth. The company facilitated the sale of 246,000 loans totaling $2.1 billion, marking a 68% increase from the previous year\u2019s quarter. The loan conversion rate also improved significantly, rising to 19.3% from 11.6% in Q4 2023. Upstart\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin surged to 17.7% in Q4 2024, a significant improvement from 0.4% in the same quarter of the previous year. The combination of higher revenue and improved margins helped the company achieve earnings of $0.26 per share, compared to a loss of $0.11 per share in Q4 2023. Looking ahead, Upstart projects Q1 revenue of approximately $200 million and earnings of $16 million, with full-year 2025 revenue expected to reach $1 billion\u2014substantially above the consensus estimate of $0.8 billion. UPST stock has seen significant gains recently, though it has also experienced notable volatility. Over the past few years, its returns have been highly inconsistent compared to the S&P 500. The stock delivered a return of 271% in 2021, dropped by 91% in 2022, rebounded with a 209% gain in 2023, and is up 51% so far in 2024. In comparison, the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has demonstrated significantly lower volatility. It has also outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why? The portfolio consists of stocks that offer higher returns with lower risk, making for a less volatile investment, as evident in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, including potential interest rate cuts and ongoing trade tensions, it remains to be seen whether UPST will outperform the S&P 500 over the next year or face challenges similar to those in 2022. At its current price of $67, UPST trades at 9.5 times trailing revenue, slightly above its four-year average of 8.4 times. Considering Upstart\u2019s recent strong performance, a higher valuation multiple may be justified. However, if the stock rises to $80, as indicated in after-hours trading, this would push its price-to-sales ratio to around 11.3 times, reflecting positive expectations. Investors may find better value by waiting for a price dip before entering at $80. As an aside, see What\u2019s Happening With McDonald\u2019s Stock?

The company reported $261 million in revenue and adjusted earnings of $0.09 per share, slightly above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates of $257 million and $0.06 per share. The positive results were driven by new customer acquisitions. Additionally, Confluent\u2019s forward-looking guidance exceeded market expectations, further boosting investor confidence. Separately, CROX reports earnings tomorrow. Will the stock pop on the news? See How Might Crocs Stock React To Upcoming Earnings? Since the start of 2024, CFLT stock has risen by 34%, slightly outperforming the S&P 500 index, which has gained 27%. The AI-driven demand for real-time data streaming has significantly benefited Confluent. However, for investors seeking growth with less volatility than an individual stock, the High-Quality portfolio has consistently outperformed the S&P 500, achieving over 91% returns since its inception. Confluent reported $261 million in Q4 revenue, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase. Subscription revenue grew by 24% to reach $251 million. The company\u2019s cloud offerings were a key growth driver, posting a 38% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Confluent\u2019s customer base with annual revenues of $0.1 million or more expanded by 12%. The company also announced a strategic partnership with Jio Platforms to serve as the primary data streaming provider for Jio Cloud Services in India, along with an expanded collaboration with Databricks. Despite strong revenue growth, the company\u2019s operating margin declined slightly by 10 basis points to 5.2% in Q4. The bottom-line earnings remained stable at $0.09 per share, consistent with the previous year. Looking ahead, Confluent forecasts revenue between $1.117 billion and $1.121 billion, with earnings of $0.35 per share in 2025. Following its Q4 earnings beat, Confluent\u2019s stock surged by 12% in after-hours trading, driven in part by its newly announced partnerships. However, CFLT stock has experienced considerable volatility in recent years, with annual returns fluctuating significantly compared to the broader S&P 500 index. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has shown more stability while outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. What makes it stand out? The HQ Portfolio stocks have historically provided higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment\u2014marked by potential interest rate cuts and ongoing trade tensions\u2014could CFLT follow the same trajectory as in 2022, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next year, or will it stage a recovery? We believe there is still room for growth. At its current price of $30, CFLT trades at 10x trailing revenue, aligning with its three-year average price-to-sales ratio. Strong revenue growth and strategic partnerships could further drive future sales, supporting a higher valuation multiple. As an aside, see What\u2019s Happening With McDonald\u2019s Stock?

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Palantir Technologies (PLTR+3.61%) is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 to start 2025, soaring 50% so far this year. But the software company\u2019s bright earnings prospects won\u2019t be enough to protect investors from short-term pain as its share price eventually returns to more normal levels, some analysts say.  The stock, which dipped about 3.5% to close at $112.62 per share on Tuesday, has still surged about 35% since the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. And it\u2019s up a whopping 350% over the last 12 months. That\u2019s taken Palantir\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio to almost 600, and about 200 based on projected 12-month earnings. The overall current PE for the Nasdaq is about 42. \u201cThe stock\u2019s not made of teflon,\u201d said Bob Lang, founder and chief options analyst at Explosive Options. Palantir is trading at about 150% of the 200-day moving average, which Lang called an \u201cextraordinary\u201d level that can\u2019t last forever.  \u201cEventually the rally will peter out as investors get exhausted,\u201d Lang said. The company, which builds software for big data analytics companies, earlier this month reported revenue of $828 million for the fourth quarter \u2014 a 36% jump year over year. Revenue from the U.S. government grew 45%. Palantir\u2019s projections for sales and profit in 2025 both topped analysts\u2019 estimates. Palantir may trigger a selloff if it opts to sell new shares to take advantage of its current, much higher market valuation, Lang said. The could quickly test the $84-$87 level. However, even at $90 per share, there would still be an uptrend. Lang remains optimistic about the company\u2019s earnings prospects. He said analysts\u2019 estimates of 25% growth in 2026 are far too low as Palantir secures new work, especially from governments.  Michael Rechenthin, head of R&D at tastylive, a streaming platform geared toward options traders, shared both Lang\u2019s optimism about Palantir\u2019s potential work for the Trump administration \u2014 and his caution about the stock\u2019s immediate prospects. \u201cRevenues and net income have been increasing quarter after quarter \u2014 but not by the rate at which is stock is growing,\u201d Rechenthin said. He said he won\u2019t be adding to his position at this level. In August, Palantir and Microsoft (MSFT-0.70%)  announced that they were deepening their partnership to provide secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Through the partnership, agencies will have access to Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud compute and large language models, or LLMs, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, through its Azure OpenAI Service that will be integrated with Palantir\u2019s AI Platforms (AIP).

Comparatively, CMG\u2019s competitor Starbucks stock (NASDAQ: SBUX) has risen approximately 20% in the same timeframe. See What\u2019s Next For Starbucks\u2019 Stock After An Upbeat Q1? Separately, CROX reports earnings tomorrow. Will the stock pop on the news? See How Might Crocs Stock React To Upcoming Earnings? But what\u2019s driving CMG stock? The rise in CMG stock is largely due to the company\u2019s robust revenue growth in FY 2024, fueled by menu innovation, strategic price increases, and the effective expansion of digital channels. The company\u2019s strong store performance is evident, with average restaurant sales climbing 7% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $3.2 million in FY 2024. Of the 304 new locations added in 2024, 257 included a Chipotlane, a drive-thru lane dedicated to digital orders, which played a significant role in margin improvements. By the end of 2024, Chipotle had expanded to more than 3,700 restaurants. If you're looking for a diversified portfolio with lower risk than individual stocks, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 with returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Chipotle\u2019s revenue rose 15% y-o-y to $11.3 billion in FY 2024, supported by a 7.4% increase in comparable-restaurant sales. This growth was fueled by a 5.3% rise in customer transactions and a 2.1% increase in average check size. Digital sales remained strong, contributing 35% to the core food and beverage business. Operating profit saw a 23% y-o-y increase, surpassing revenue growth due to margin expansion. The company\u2019s operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 16.9% in FY 2024, leading to a 25% y-o-y jump in diluted earnings per share (EPS) to $1.11. Additionally, Chipotle\u2019s global expansion is still in its infancy, with fewer than 50 locations across the U.K., France, and Germany, and a recent entry into Kuwait. The international success of brands like McDonald\u2019s, which has over 40,000 locations worldwide, highlights the growth potential for Chipotle. However, Chipotle experienced inconsistent sales in 2025, partially due to weather disruptions such as the Los Angeles wildfire. Despite solid underlying transaction trends and a strong business model, the company expects comparable sales growth to be in the low to mid-single digits for 2025. Plans for 315-345 new locations this year are in place, with over 80% expected to feature a Chipotlane. Going forward, competition from established fast-food players like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE: MCD) and Domino\u2019s may intensify, particularly in the drive-thru space. The performance of CMG stock over the past four years has been volatile, with returns of 26% in 2021, -21% in 2022, 65% in 2023, and 32% in 2024. In contrast, the High Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has shown significantly lower volatility while outperforming the S&P 500. Why? The HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with less risk than the benchmark index, resulting in a more stable investment experience, as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. We project Chipotle\u2019s Revenues to reach $12.8 billion in FY 2025, representing a 12% y-o-y increase. As for earnings, we anticipate EPS to reach $1.32. Consequently, we have revised our valuation estimate for Chipotle\u2019s Valuation to $60 per share, based on an expected EPS of $1.32 and a 45.7x price-to-earnings multiple for FY 2025, which is about 5% above the current market price as of January 10. Chipotle has successfully expanded into smaller markets with populations under 40,000, supporting its long-term goal of reaching 7,000 locations in North America, up from approximately 3,500 today. Its European expansion is just beginning, with only 27 locations across the UK, France, and Germany, and a recent launch in Kuwait.

(Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) Boston Scientific stock (NYSE: BSX) has gained 3% in the five days since its Q4 earnings report last week. Although the company exceeded expectations with both its results and guidance, the modest stock increase may be due to the significant price appreciation ahead of the earnings announcement. So far, BSX stock has risen 19% year-to-date. Separately, CROX reports earnings tomorrow. Will the stock pop on the news? See How Might Crocs Stock React To Upcoming Earnings? Looking at a longer period, BSX has been a strong performer, surging 129% since early January 2023\u2014rising from $46 to approximately $106\u2014compared to a 58% increase in the S&P 500 during the same time. This growth is primarily due to: We explore these factors in more detail below. However, if you're looking for investment options with lower volatility than individual stocks, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500, delivering over 91% returns since its inception. Boston Scientific\u2019s revenue climbed 32%, rising from $12.7 billion in 2022 to $16.7 billion in 2024, driven by an increase in total procedures and the introduction of new products such as POLARx and Vercise. The Watchman FLX, a key product within the cardiovascular segment, has been a significant driver of sales growth. Additionally, the company's adjusted operating margin expanded from 25.6% in 2022 to 27.0% in 2024. The combination of higher revenue and improved margins led to a 47% rise in net earnings, from $1.71 to $2.51 per share. In its most recent results, Boston Scientific posted an 18% year-over-year revenue increase in 2024, with its cardiovascular segment rising 22% and its MedSurg segment\u2014which includes endoscopy, urology, and neuromodulation\u2014growing 10.5%. The company's operating margin expanded by 75 basis points to 27% for the full year, helping push earnings per share to $2.51, an increase of 22%. Looking ahead, Boston Scientific expects 13.5% revenue growth and projects adjusted earnings to reach approximately $2.84 at the mid-point of its guidance range. Both metrics slightly exceeded analyst expectations. With strong sales growth and expanding margins, BSX stock has been rewarded by investors, reflected in its valuation multiple, which has surged 56% since early 2023. The stock has increased in value each of the past four years, but that hasn't always translated into consistent outperformance against the market. BSX returned 18% in 2021, 9% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 55% in 2024. Similarly, the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio, a collection of 30 stocks, has demonstrated lower volatility while consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? These stocks have delivered better risk-adjusted returns compared to the broader market, offering a smoother investment ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current economic uncertainty, including rate cut expectations and ongoing trade tensions, can BSX continue its strong performance? We believe the stock now has limited upside. At its current price of $106, BSX trades at 42x trailing earnings of $2.51 per share\u2014well above its five-year average P\/E ratio of 31x. While Boston Scientific\u2019s solid revenue and earnings growth may justify a higher valuation, its current price seems to have already factored in these positives. Investors might find better opportunities by waiting for a pullback. As an aside, see What\u2019s Happening With McDonald\u2019s Stock?

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  Has it ever been more expensive to hire a hedge fund portfolio manager?          Amid the war for talent among multimanager investment firms, sign-on bonuses have grabbed headlines as they've stretched into the tens of millions of dollars. Deals north of $10 million are now commonplace, according to hedge fund recruiters, and the superstars can land contracts that are many multiples larger, with bidding wars engorging deal prices.               In late January, it was Marshall Wace long-short equities PM Kevin Liu securing a $50 million bag to join Point72, Bloomberg reported. Peter Goodwin started his own equities unit at Balyasny in September, and his haul was said to be closer to $80 million. Other examples now abound.               But if the image conjured in your mind is people laying on a giant stack of bills in a storage unit  la \"Breaking Bad,\" the reality is often quite different. The mechanics of an eight-figure PM deal are more complex than the headline figures may suggest, and a PM could pocket many millions less \u2014 or significantly more \u2014 depending on how the deal is structured.               Necessity is the mother of invention, and amid the competition for top PMs, funds have come up with more creative and nuanced deal structures to lure employees \u2014 richer performance incentives for limited periods, relocation to tax-friendly countries, ownership of intellectual property, or money to hire a team.               As compensation expenses soar, funds are also taking measures to protect themselves and their investors from the risks of a bad hire. Some have ramped up efforts to vet PMs, sometimes taking aggressive and legally murky measures to ensure the deals they're offering are justified, as Business Insider recently reported. Others are implementing compensation clawbacks and break-up fees into contracts to help keep a lid on rising costs.               BI spoke with recruiters, hedge fund business development leaders, and PMs about the ins and outs of PM deals at multimanager hedge funds, as well as how they've evolved in recent years as head count has doubled and assets have grown by $200 billion. Many asked for anonymity to discuss a topic that's sensitive to clients or employers.               There are common components to any contract. Sign-on bonuses are coveted and important for getting some deals done, but they're only one aspect of the mosaic and typically a small portion of the overall deal value. The profit percentage, the primary form of compensation at these funds, remains the most crucial for many people, according to John Pierson, a longtime hedge-fund recruiter and the founder of search firm P2 Investments.               \"A lot of these people are alphas. They believe in their IP and their performance,\" Pierson added. \"They want that ongoing percentage.\"               In general, sources said large deals are more nuanced and the guarantees smaller than is often appreciated, and that while PM deals share common features, they're not one-size-fits-all.               It's become more \"rare that one deal is the same as the other,\" one headhunter said. \"Everything is negotiable.\"               The best hedge-fund traders are often the hardest to extract. They're already highly compensated and typically in stable work situations. They usually have lengthy noncompete agreements, sometimes requiring them to sit out 12 months or more. Dislodging them and smoothing away those frictions can take patience, creativity, and, yes, large piles of cash.               While deals are increasingly tailored to the PM and contingent on a dizzying array of variables, there are common features to most contracts. Goldman Sachs highlighted several of these components in a recent report on multimanager hedge funds, based on interviews with hedge fund business development professionals:       a percentage cut of the trading profitsupfront guaranteesbuyout of deferred compensationaccelerator incentives           Additionally, PMs earn a base salary that's often around $200,000, sources told BI. While very good money to most Americans, that's not worth getting out of bed for most of these professionals \u2014 a sum that won't cover their cost of living. Moreover, it is often treated as a draw or an advance on the future profits a PM will earn, according to recruiters and fund regulatory filings.               The profit payout percentage is the primary lever at these eat-what-you-kill hedge funds. At top firms, PMs commonly receive at least 20% of the profits from their trading strategy, according to Goldman. But your mileage will vary \u2014 unproven PMs may command 12% to 17%, and some superstars have gotten 30%, headhunters said. So, for example:       If a long-short equities PM is on a 20% deal and makes $100 million trading tech stocks like Nvidia and Meta, they get $20 million. If a PM makes $1 billion betting on the rebalancing of the Nasdaq or Russell indices, well, you can do the math. A portion is paid in cash and a portion is deferred and vests over time, the length varying by firm.           Then there's the upfront guaranteed bonus or sign-on bonus,the aspect that people ogle and drool over. Switching employers comes with an opportunity cost. A PM will have to sit out their noncompete, and then they have to build out their trading operation on a new platform \u2014 time they could've spent earning more money at their existing employer. The fund may provide a sign-on bonus to compensate for that lost earning potential, though how much and with what strings attached varies significantly.               \"That is really the lure to get people out of their firms,\" one headhunter said.       The buyout or \"make-whole\" is related and factors into the overall guaranteed amount. Traders are often paid a portion of their annual comp in cash and a portion in deferred compensation that vests over time, and an early departure means sacrificing unvested comp from their prior shop. Additionally, they may have generated trading profits that won't be paid out if they leave mid-year.               For instance:       A talented PM may receive a $20 million upfront sign-on bonus, in part to compensate for their lost deferred comp, in part for their time sitting idle, and in part because they're in high demand. Deals covering more than two years are rare but not unprecedented, recruiters and BD professionals said, and these \"guarantees\" increasingly come with catches and caveats (more on that below).   An \"accelerator\" is connected to the profit cut, essentially supercharging that payout for a determined amount of time or up to a fixed amount of money.       Instead of just forking over more hard cash to entice a PM, the fund may offer to increase the percentage payout from 20% to 30% on the first $20 million in profits, as an example.           \"Then everyone's got skin in the game,\" one headhunter said.               Accelerators can also be structured as a performance trigger:       The payout level increases if a threshold or milestone is reached. For example, trading profits eclipse $100 million or the Sharpe ratio \u2014 the return relative to the risk taken \u2014 exceeds 1.5.           The accelerator \"has seen the greatest increase in prevalence over the last one to two years,\" according to Goldman's interviews with BD teams.               \"Every firm wants to do accelerators before giving over hard cash,\" another headhunter said.               But as previously mentioned, some strategies \u2014 especially systematic trades heavily dependent on market data and technology \u2014 can take longer than others to set up and become profitable, making this provision \"hollow\" if the time period is too short, according to one recruiter.               \"If they have their IP that helps a lot,\" he said.               Intellectual property ownership, especially for quantitative strategies, is one of the myriad factors that also play into a hire and can significantly affect the total value, especially as \"bespoke structures for each PM are increasingly normal,\" Goldman noted.               Millennium, the largest multimanager by assets and head count, is known for its creativity in getting deals over the line. Yes, it can back up a Brinks truck to hire a PM, but it is also known to allow PMs to leave with the IP they've built at the hedge fund \u2014 though Millennium retains a license as well and can continue to make money off of it, according to three recruiters familiar with the firm. It's not a bargaining chip offered by every firm or to every PM, but it's an important consideration to some traders.               Millennium has also opened new locations to help win over candidates, as it did with Pratik Madhvani in Dubai, industry insiders previously told BI. Relocation to a more tax-friendly location \u2014 Milan, Zurich, or Puerto Rico, for instance \u2014 has generally become a more popular inducement, three headhunters said. (Millennium declined to comment for this story).               Cost-sharing is also a key consideration. Investment teams incur a variety of expenses, such as market data, hardware, software, legal fees, and connections to trading venues and brokers. Some strategies are pricier to run than others, and these costs can erode the PM's annual profit cut, depending on how they're split.               Building out a team is also expensive. For the right PM, the fund may cover the guarantees and recruiting fees to hire a staff, which amounts to millions. Goodwin's deal at Balyasny, for instance, included money to hire a team, according to a person familiar with the matter.               A non-exhaustive list of factors affecting a PM's contract value:               Other key parameters in negotiations include risk limits and the amount of capital a PM has access to trade with \u2014 key factors affecting how much money they can generate. While a fund offering a generous 30% payout may seem like a no-brainer, it's usually less attractive than a firm offering 20% but with world-class risk and trading technology and twice as much money to trade.               Pierson said the smaller or second-tier funds can't offer the gaudy guaranteed cash a top-tier fund can, but they can compete by offering a higher percentage payout and a longer leash for drawdowns.               \"What they can do to compete is guarantee a longer runway,\" Pierson said.               Another factor complicating compensation packages is the caveats funds now add to contracts. When people see an 8-figure PM deal, what some don't realize is that often just a portion of the reported figure is fully guaranteed, several industry sources said.               In many contracts, part of the upfront sign-on bonus is a draw, meaning the payment is earned back through future performance. They may also be subject to clawback provisions, requiring employees to repay a portion of their comp if they leave or are fired before a certain period of time.               One contract template seen by BI describes an accelerator provision \u2014 increasing the percentage payout from 20% to 30% \u2014 until a certain threshold. But it also notes that this additional comp must be repaid within 30 days if the employee leaves or is fired within two years.               \"The clawbacks have become a big part of these big deals,\" said one of the recruiters. \"It's becoming more prevalent as a way for clients to keep people out of the market to some extent.\"               Breakup fees are more commonly associated with multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions, but they now apply to portfolio manager hires as well. Recruiting is costly and time-consuming, and because of noncompete clauses, it can be months or even years from when a PM signs a contract to when they actually join. Some PMs get sweeter offers during their sit-out and renege, opting to join a different firm or to return to their old one.               Over the past two years, funds, including\u00a0Millennium and Brevan Howard,\u00a0have started including break clauses in employment contracts that impose penalties if a PM doesn't end up joining, according to recruiters and BD professionals. These clauses can work both ways \u2014 if the fund terminates the contract before a PM starts, it pays the fee \u2014 and penalties can run into the millions, with one recruiter citing one contract with a $2 million \"liquidation damages\" provision.               \"These are becoming more normal for bigger-ticket PMs,\" another headhunter said.               Hiring a PM has likely never been costlier, but it has also never been more complicated.               Deals are more intricate and bespoke, with contracts running dozens of pages and hard math required to evaluate them. BD teams need to model and project each year of a PM's P&L and weigh that against the various guarantees and incentives to assess when they'll break even \u2014 and ultimately, whether a deal makes sense.               \"We're doing high-stakes math behind the scenes to make sure the hire is worth it,\" one BD head said.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"What helped keep human ancestry alive often hinders the investing decisions of today.  The fight-or-flight response to stress \u201c. . . evolved as a survival mechanism, enabling people and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening situations,\u201d according to Harvard Medical School. Unfortunately, the very thing that helped keep human ancestry alive often hinders the investing decisions of today. Once an investor\u2019s hackles are up, it can be difficult to make calm, objective retirement planning decisions. Behavior is perhaps the most prominent variable and determinant of investor success. Benjamin Graham, author of The Intelligent Investor and the man many see as the father of value investing, wrote, \u201cThe investor's chief problem\u2014and even his worst enemy\u2014is likely to be himself.\u201d Yet, it is possible and vital to control fear enough to avoid impulsive or irrational decisions. A study of nearly 2,000 American retirees conducted by the Retire Sooner Team for What The Happiest Retirees Know revealed several core investment habits that separate the happiest retirees from the unhappiest. Stock dividends have consistently outpaced inflation throughout much of market history. Stock Dividends vs. Bond Interest Though it\u2019s commonly believed that bonds are the conservative counterpart to stocks, the chart above compares how an investment in equities for dividend income fared relative to one in bonds between 1980 and 2024. Some find the results surprising. The study examined a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 vs. the Lehman\/Barclays Aggregate Bond Index (AGG) beginning in 1980. In each case, the investor parked the principal while retrieving (not reinvesting) the annual income produced. In 1980, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 paid a yearly dividend of about $529 \u2014 5.29% of the initial investment. Forty-five years later, it had climbed to $6,837 \u2014 a 68.4% annual yield on the original investment. And the original investment itself grew as well. A $10,000 holding in the S&P 500 in 1980 would have blossomed to nearly $544,898 without reinvesting the annual dividend income. On the other hand, the Aggregate Bond Index only grew from $10,000 to $13,902 and would now pay out just $646 per year, or 6.46% on the original investment. Stock dividend income clearly outpaced bond interest. Annual stock dividend payouts increased almost 13 times, while the remaining price-only return grew 54 times. A forty or fifty-year-old still has potentially three to four decades of investing and spending ... [+] remaining. Future retirees often lament failing to start planning and saving early enough. But keep in mind that a 40- or 50-year-old still has potentially three to four decades of investing and spending remaining. Taking the time to create a future vision and then having the long-term patience to allow consistent dividend-growing stocks to pay out can make a huge difference, even later in life. Furthermore, dividend investing can serve as a calming effect amidst choppy stock market waters. When eyes are set on the horizon, folks are less likely to panic with every move up and down for the stock market. Dozens of companies have a record of paying 10, 20, 30, or even 50 years or more of steady dividends. This dynamic translates to recurring cash flow that is typically reliable enough for retirees to depend upon. In simpler terms, dividend investing can be seen as an apple tree. When nourished adequately over time, a retiree has the potential to live off the apples without overconsumption, allowing the tree to bear fruit for years to come. A bigger tree means more apples, just as a bigger investment means more income paid out. However, regardless of size, the cultivation regimen remains the same: time and care. The hidden variable for protecting purchasing power is accounting for inflation. Investing is often conceived as a means to grow one\u2019s overall nest egg, liquid assets, and net worth. But the actual purpose is to protect purchasing power. If an investor lived on $75,000 per year during primary working years, they want to be able to live off a similar amount for the next 20 to 30 years. The hidden variable for protecting purchasing power is accounting for inflation. The target doesn\u2019t just stay at $75,000; it\u2019s $75,000 plus inflation because, in subsequent years, it could require more money to afford the same lifestyle. Market history has shown stocks to protect purchasing power more consistently than nearly any other long-term asset. When the market is soaring, people with more money in cash or bonds often experience FOMO. They fear missing out but are unsure when to invest. Should they wait until the market drops? It\u2019s natural to feel that good timing is imperative for investment success, but that instinct can often do more harm than good. The amount of time invested typically impacts the results far more than the specific moment chosen to enter the market. Since no one can predict the future, the more productive answer lies in the data. The numbers are apparent when comparing the difference in growth between investing $10,000 in the S&P 500 at the \u201cperfect\u201d time and the \u201cworst\u201d time. Participation vs. Perfection Note that the data points show what an investor would have as of July 31, 2023, if they had chosen to invest the $10,000 during each unique starting point rather than keeping money in cash. Understanding this market history can help investors focus on what really matters: success is less about perfection and more about participation. In every scenario outlined above, investing at the \u201cworst\u201d time bested holding cash by a long shot. Losing money seems to feel twice as bad as making money feels good. Unhappy retirees exhibit a heightened sense of emotion around their investment portfolios. They confuse clickbait headlines and market volatility for permanent threats rather than temporary upsets. This is partly because losing money feels twice as bad as making money feels good. Loss aversion is a key concept in Prospect Theory, which won a Nobel Prize for Daniel Kahneman and was developed jointly with Amos Tversky. Specifically, it posits that fear of psychological pain leads people to make decisions that prioritize avoiding losses over achieving gains, even when the potential rewards outweigh the risks. This scenario occurs quite often in investing. An account that rises from $1 million to $1.5 million and then falls to $1.3 million is viewed as a loss of $200,000 rather than a gain of $300,000. It\u2019s also prevalent in sports. Suppose a basketball team is winning by 30 points at halftime but ends up squeaking out a two-point victory. In that case, people criticize its performance rather than complimenting the original lead despite its surplus being ultimately responsible for the win. Rather than relying on emotion, happy retirees tend to trust reason and rationality.  Happy retirees are not immune from the same instincts. What distinguishes them from their unhappy counterparts is their discipline to resist the urge. Rather than relying on emotion, they trust reason and rationality. They look at the data or trust someone else to do so and realize that remaining stoically invested over a long period provides the highest probability of success. Happy retirees are tomorrow investors, not today investors. They understand that within the U.S. stock market sits a significant number of companies that have typically shown growth over time. They know that if they invest patiently in that growth, they stand a chance of sharing the gains, and have the potential to be on a \u201cretire sooner\u201d path. There are many productive strategies for managing money. The crucial step is to pick one and then stick to it. Happy retirees set out with the baseline goal of protecting their purchasing power, creating a portfolio designed to provide a steady income to keep up with or outpace inflation. They let go of the distractions and market forces beyond their control. Many rely on stock dividends to generate their retirement income so they don\u2019t have to pilfer the principal. Happy retirees know that by investing for tomorrow, today doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. They are proactive but not reactive. An investment means trusting that the army of American productivity will continue to march forward over time. Having this faith can potentially give happy retirees the hope and conviction it takes to live happy, healthy lives \u2014for themselves, their children, and their grandchildren. Happy retirees strive for the hope and conviction it takes to live happy, healthy lives \u2014for ... [+] themselves, their children, and their grandchildren.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"As Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person and President Donald Trump\u2019s top campaign donor, rampages through the federal government shutting down agencies and firing workers seemingly without any regard for his own conflicts of interest, the danger of concentrated private interests capturing our political system has never been more apparent. While the corrupting influence of big money over our government is not new, the specifics of this danger are different today than perhaps at any other time in our nation\u2019s history. Tech billionaires, who already had enormous power, helped underwrite a winning presidential campaign in ways that would have been illegal just a few elections ago. And there are now fewer restraints than ever before on their ability, or the president they helped elect, to break through the checks and balances of our political system. This system, President Joseph Biden recently warned, can best be described as an \u201coligarchy.\u201d Or, as others have dubbed, a \u201cbroligarchy.\u201d None of this means the situation is hopeless. Musk\u2019s depredations are already encountering legal and political resistance, and it\u2019s likely that the political pendulum will eventually swing back. When it does, those who care about the security of American democracy will need to be ready with fresh, bold solutions that meet the political moment, to ensure that our political system can actually respond to the needs of regular Americans. Still, the question remains: How did we get to the point of having a tech billionaire campaign donor openly running huge parts of the federal government? And where do we go from here? Three key changes have contributed to this singular moment. First, is the collapse of legal safeguards designed to curb the outsized influence of money in elections. As a result of Supreme Court decisions, most notably the notorious Citizens United decision from roughly 15 years ago, the wealthiest donors can play a more direct role in funding and running political campaigns than we have seen since the Gilded Age. In 2024, just 10 individual donors were able to supply nearly half of the money raised to support Trump\u2019s candidacy. The total amount of money in the presidential race coming from people who gave at least $5 million more than doubled relative to 2020. While the super PACs these individuals funded and ran were supposed to be separate from the president\u2019s actual campaign, that was a legal fiction. Musk spent at least $288 million to help elect Trump and became the president\u2019s leading surrogate. His PAC took on core functions of the campaign, such as door-to-door canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts, and he also used his ownership of X (formerly Twitter) to boost pro-Trump content. Before the Citizens United ruling, none of this would have been legal. Second, the presidency itself has been transformed. Recent decades have seen presidents from both parties erode laws and norms meant to restrain their power, increasingly without the sort of pushback from members of their own party that restrained their predecessors (including FDR). In his first weeks in office, Trump has accelerated this process, issuing unconstitutional executive orders and directives purporting to repeal birthright citizenship and directing OMB to freeze funding for thousands of federal programs in violation of an act of Congress. Trump also\u00a0 fired at least seventeen agency inspectors general (internal federal government watchdogs who investigate waste, fraud, and abuse) without providing the necessary notice to Congress. Plus, Trump has reportedly allowed Musk and his private sector employees to access sensitive government computer systems, including the Treasury Department\u2019s payment processing system, through which trillions of dollars in taxpayer funds flow each year. Courts have temporarily blocked some of these actions. But ultimate review will be in the hands of the Supreme Court, which has itself taken a chainsaw to legal constraints on the president\u2019s power over the executive branch, gutting the independence of key federal agencies and holding that former presidents are immune from prosecution even for certain blatantly illegal abuses of power.\u00a0 The combination of unregulated money in politics and expanded presidential power with fewer checks from Congress would be a recipe for more corruption under any president, but there are special dangers when they combine with Trump\u2019s explicitly transactional approach to wielding power. The president campaigned openly on the promise to reward friends and punish enemies. He has once again (as in his first term) refused to meaningfully separate from his private business empire. There are plenty of indications that corporate leaders have gotten the message. Media companies that offended him are rushing to settle even seemingly meritless private lawsuits. And before Trump was even inaugurated, a Chinese billionaire who is fighting a fraud lawsuit from the Securities Exchange Commission poured $30 million into a new crypto venture started by the president and his family. Campaign finance rules and checks on presidential power are collapsing just as leading technology corporations have gained massive power over our political system. This third development is in part a story of even greater concentration of wealth. The seven largest tech companies in the United States represent approximately one-third of the value of the S&P 500 and have a market cap greater than any non-US stock market in the world. Many commentators have noted that President Trump seated the leaders of three of these companies\u2014Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg\u2014ahead of cabinet members and other world leaders at his inauguration. Collectively, those three men have a net worth of nearly $1 trillion, a value that is approximately 200 times all the money spent in support of the presidential candidates in 2024. But their power is not just in their massive wealth. As the journalist Ezra Klein has noted, the billionaires given front row inaugural seats were more than just the wealthiest men alive \u2014they were among the biggest players in the so-called \u201cattention economy.\u201d\u00a0 This is the \u201ctech-industrial complex\u201d that President Biden warned of in his farewell address which has increasingly replaced traditional media as the source of political information for Americans (often tailored based on their personal data that these very companies collect) and which is largely unaccountable to the general public for how it can manipulate our understanding of reality. In particular, the combination of legal protections (such as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act), opaque algorithms, and lack of regulatory oversight (including over the mining of personal data of users) means that the public often has little sense of how tech companies collect and use information about users or what information is fed to them.\u00a0 Any of these changes by themselves would pose a challenge to the American political system. Taken together, they represent a looming crisis. But as dire as all of this is, the situation is not hopeless. The United States is still a democracy, however imperfect, with a decentralized electoral system that is not easy to fully subvert. Eventually, as we\u2019ve seen in previous eras of political corruption from the Gilded Age to Watergate, those in power are likely to overreach and prompt a backlash that will open the door to reform. Indeed, just a few weeks into Trump\u2019s first term, Americans\u00a0 already express unhappiness with the role Musk and other billionaires are playing. This is on top of poll after poll showing that the overwhelming majority of voters are deeply unhappy with the role of money in our political system. The challenge to resisting a new American oligarchy is not to convince the public that there is a problem, but to offer compelling solutions. In that regard, reformers have a lot of work to do. The typical solutions we and others resort to when discussing the outsized political role of billionaires and corporations include ethics reforms, closing campaign finance loopholes, and public financing for elections. All of these actions remain necessary but nowhere near sufficient. Indeed, the need to overturn Citizens United and other harmful Supreme Court decisions on campaign finance has never been clearer. So long as these decisions stand, unlimited money from a handful of donors can continue to pour into our campaigns, further reinforcing the ability of those with the most money to extract profits from our political system. We must also re-establish the bedrock principle that nobody\u2014including the president\u2014is above the law. As long as that is in doubt, too many avenues for corruption will remain.\u00a0 Finally, the next wave of reform must also address the concentrated power of a few tech oligarchs as a core anti-democratic threat. In recent years, tech policy advocates in the United States have suggested many ways to check this power, from stronger antitrust rules, to Section 230 revisions, to mandating algorithmic transparency from social media platforms and AI developers. There are many reasons to explore such policies, but few are more important than ensuring this private power does not come to exceed the strength of our democracy.\u00a0 Cycles of corruption and excess followed by waves of reform are an enduring feature of American history, from the Progressive Era reforms that followed the Gilded Age to the passage of major ethics and campaign finance legislation after Watergate. But whenever the pendulum does swing back, will we be ready? If there is any silver lining to the excesses we are now seeing, it\u2019s that the stakes are now much harder to ignore. After Trump\u2019s first term, Congress tried to pass democracy reform legislation that included some popular campaign finance reforms. Despite coming close, it didn\u2019t pass. It is now up to elected leaders and civil society to push back against the abuses of power we are seeing and lay the groundwork to fix our political system and make it work for everyone. Above all, Congress must do more to fully reassert its authority as the \u201cfirst branch\u201d of our government. That means not only restraining the worst impulses of the Trump Administration, but ultimately passing bold campaign finance, ethics, and rule of law reforms that restore meaningful guardrails against self-dealing by those in power, undo as much as possible the damage done by Citizens United and other Supreme Court decisions (and ultimately lay the groundwork for reversing them), and finally place meaningful checks on both presidential power and the emerging tech oligarchy. There is still much we do not know about how the next four years will unfold. But one thing is clear: failing to address Americans\u2019  concerns and restore their sense of ownership over their own government could be a mistake from which our democracy might not recover.

As of Wednesday morning, markets were pricing just one interest rate cut after pricing two for most of the year. At the same time, markets are on alert for more policy surprises from Trump, who is expected to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries before the end of the week. Meanwhile, investors combed through a fresh batch of earnings for clues to Corporate America's resilience.

The CPI increased 3% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase was above the 2.9% economists had expected. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, ahead of the 0.3% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Read more here. The S&P 500's (^GSPC)' record run could face a setback, according to JPMorgan Market Intelligence. The team estimates the index may drop up to 2% if consumer prices (CPI) rise 0.4% or more in January from the previous month. With CPI data due at 8:30 a.m. New York time, markets are on edge. A slightly hotter print could challenge the bullish outlook on US equities. The consensus estimate is for a 0.3% rise in month-on-month CPI. Stocks in Europe trod water on Wednesday, mirroring the muted tone in markets as investors prepared for a fresh reading on US consumer inflation.

Shares of the Elon Musk-led EV maker dropped another 2% to $321 each in pre-market trading on Wednesday, continuing an eye-opening slide from their recent 52-week high. At its current pre-market price, Tesla's stock is down 33% since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for President Donald Trump \u2014 who was heavily backed by Musk. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched \"Magnificent Seven\" group of tech megacaps: Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL). Musk's net worth \u2014 which is closely connected to the fortunes of Tesla \u2014 has plunged $54 billion year to date, according to Bloomberg data. He is still the richest person in the world with a net worth of $378 billion \"The bears are owning the narrative,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me. And the bears have a lot to feast on regarding Tesla at the moment. For starters, numbers on Tesla sales in important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to data released this week by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. \"We're cautious on what's happening for the EV maker,\" Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers. On Monday, the president signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either \u2014 a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. \"Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape,\" Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And last, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year alongside price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. Podcast: how Musk delivers on his biggest promises \"There's a bit of a disconnect, in our view, between what's happening fundamentally and what's happening from a sentiment perspective,\" Rusch said. The Oppenheimer analyst is also concerned that even with the sell-off in the stock, Tesla remains overvalued. Yahoo Finance data shows Tesla shares are valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 111 times. The forward PE ratio for the S&P 500 is about 22 times. Auto rivals Ford (F) and GM (GM) are valued at PE multiples of 6 times and 4 times, respectively. Rusch thinks Tesla's valuation will be \"a little bit challenged\" in the coming years, unless the company can \"deliver on a number of promises\" it has made to investors such as robotaxis and humanoids.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery? When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away. Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school. \"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry. \"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\" Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role. Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs. It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show. All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast. The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large. \"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it. Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\" Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution. With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines. However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated. And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market. \"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz. \"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\" While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive. Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole. For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA. The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power. The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz. And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs. \"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\" It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt. \"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\" What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut. Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades. Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\". Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector. In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies. Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country. Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere. One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand. But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market. \"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition. All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings. Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars. According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field. German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat. \"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz. Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says. \"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with. \"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\" So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole. \"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\". He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says. Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month. \"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says. \"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?' For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\" He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\" For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"The king of video game psychedelia has been digging in the crates again by  Oli Welsh Jeff Minter, the legendary, iconoclastic arcade game designer, is back with another Atari remake. Once again, the author of the classic Tempest 2000 and its sequels has dug deep into Atari\u2019s back catalog and unearthed a truly deep cut to apply his intense, psychedelic spin to. Last time, it was the notoriously difficult, unreleased curio Akka Arrh; this time it\u2019s I, Robot, a historic but failed game from one of Atari\u2019s great minds. I, Robot is a 1984 arcade game designed by Dave Theurer, creator of Missile Command and the original Tempest. Theurer loved to push the technological boundaries of early gaming and I, Robot holds the distinction of being the first commercial video game rendered with real-time, flat-shaded (as opposed to wireframe) 3D polygon graphics \u2014 eight years before Sega\u2019s Virtua Racing and a decade before PlayStation made this kind of 3D gaming a mass-market proposition. But I, Robot was a flop, and less than 1,000 cabinets of the game were produced. Its unusual design has the player controlling a robot, hopping around mazes and flipping the color of tiles while shooting at enemies and avoiding the gaze of Big Brother\u2019s giant eye. Going by the trailer, Minter\u2019s take on I, Robot is typically distinctive, upping the pace, taking liberties with the design, and incorporating elements of his own games like Gridrunner and the Tempest remakes, as well as his trademark procedural techno music and bleary psychedelic visuals. Naturally, the robot hero has been given the head of an ox, too. (Minter, whose company is called Llamasoft, has a long-standing obsession with animals of the ungulate family.) In between levels, players will dip into a trippy tube shooter for some Tempest-style action, while the release also includes what Minter is calling the Ungame, a visualizer that allows the player to play around with the game\u2019s sights and sounds without worrying about enemies. (The original I, Robot also included a chill secondary mode, a drawing tool called Doodle City.) Minter\u2019s I, Robot will be released in spring 2025 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, and Atari\u2019s own VCS system. According to the trailer, there\u2019ll be a PlayStation VR2 version, too. The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved","label":0}

Some staff working on the future of Crysis has shifted to work on Hunt: Showdown 1896, a multiplayer shooter released in 2019 that remains quite popular \u2014 and, even, grown exponentially since its release, hitting its all-time peak concurrent players (more than 60,000), in August. Despite the success of Hunt: Showdown 1896, Crytek said it can\u2019t \u201ccontinue as before\u201d and \u201cremain financially sustainable.\u201d \u201cLike so many of our peers, we aren\u2019t immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years,\u201d a Crytek representative wrote in a post on social media. \u201cThe layoffs affect development teams and shared services.\u201d The German developer attempted to \u201creduce costs and cut operating expenses,\u201d but called the layoffs \u201cinevitable,\u201d its Wednesday post said. The studio will offer severance packages to laid-off employees. Crysis 4 was announced in 2022 as being in early development. Crytek released a short teaser in which the company called Crysis 4 a \u201ctruly next-gen shooter.\u201d Alongside the video, Crytek also put out a call for new hires: It was looking for \u201cpeople who will truly shape the future of the franchise.\u201d The company has shared very few details on the game since then. Crysis 3 was released in 2013, the last new game the franchise gotten since then. Electronic Arts published each of these three games. Crytek, however, did release remastered versions of the first three games, released in 2020 and 2021. Despite the success of the franchise and Hunt: Showdown 1896, Crytek has, indeed, faced financial issues in the past: In 2016, Crytek employees told Polygon some employees hadn\u2019t been paid in months \u2014 something that echoed complaints from 2014 in which then-CEO Cevat Yerli said the missed payments were designed to keep the company out of bankruptcy. As Crytek alluded, the video game industry continues to struggle after years of financial woes and layoffs. Tens of thousands of workers were laid off over the past three years; nearly 1,000 of which were laid off in the first two months of 2025, per unofficially collected data.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Dokiwatch skins are coming to steal your heart (and your Overwatch Coins) by  Michael McWhertor A new season of Overwatch 2 means new skins \u2014 some of which you might be able to earn from the return of loot boxes. During Wednesday\u2019s Overwatch 2 Spotlight presentation, Blizzard showed off which cosmetics are coming in season 15 and beyond. Overwatch fans got a look at a long list of new Mythic skins, and a fun new theme based on the mahou shoujo (or magical girl) genre. Hell, Blizzard even showed off a new legendary skin for Venture, so far an incredibly rare sighting. Season 15 of Overwatch 2 will give Zenyatta a new Mythic skin based on the Chinese pixiu, a mythical creature that\u2019s part lion, part dragon. Other members of Overwatch cast will also get Chinese-inspired skins, including new looks for Hanzo, Kiriko, Moira, Orisa, Reinhardt, and Sigma. Not coincidentally, Overwatch 2 will once again be available in China starting next month, after more than two years of down time. Blizzard and Chinese publisher NetEase had a falling out in 2022 that led to games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 being pulled from the market. Anyway, you didn\u2019t come here for boring international business dealings, you came here for skins. So here\u2019s a look at some of season 15\u2019s Overwatch 2 skins \u2014 a mix of shop skins and those available through the battle pass, including a new Toxic Venture look. Season 15 will also include a series of Rainy Day-themed cosmetics for characters like Mei, Mercy, Kiriko, Orisa (a recolored version of her Rubber Ducky skin), and Tracer (a recolored version of her Graffiti skin). Players can earn some of those Rainy Day skins through gameplay to be prepared for April showers. Widowmaker will be the recipient of season 15\u2019s Mythic weapon skin, a sharp-looking weapon variation that, if I\u2019m being honest, looks pretty uncomfortable to hold and has far too many spider eyes on it. Blizzard offered a look at cosmetics to come in season 16 and beyond, showing off a new Mythic weapon skin concept for Reaper that reflects his dual nature, with two differently designed shotguns. Those guys are appropriately edgy. Finally, Blizzard gave Overwatch fans ample warning to start saving up their coins or their cash for a series of magical girl skins for Juno, Kiriko, Brigitte, Mercy, Widowmaker, D.Va, and newcomer Freja. These heavily Sailor Moon-inspired skins are called Dokiwatch, and they\u2019ll give the women of Overwatch 2 some frilly, fancy, and downright adorable cosmetic options. Here\u2019s an early look: Fortunately, Overwatch 2 players will have plenty of gameplay changes to keep them occupied while they wait for Dokiwatch to drop in a future season, with new perks and a Stadium game mode coming soon.

Flock Safety made its first inroads with the private market, selling plate readers to gated communities and HOAs so busybodies could keep track of everyone driving in and out of their cul-de-sacs. Having captured that market, Flock moved on, targeting US law enforcement agencies with the promise of cheap ALPRs that could be tied into existing ALPR cameras deployed by private citizens.  It\u2019s pretty much the Ring playbook \u2014 aggressive market growth that gives cops cheap buy-in so long as they sign long-term contracts to access images and footage. And it\u2019s the same scheme: the implication that using consumer-oriented products will give cops instant access to a further network of privately-owned cameras.  The Flock that became a swarm scored a small win in court before this lawsuit was filed. A state judge ruled three hits from a private company\u2019s plate reader wasn\u2019t quite enough to trigger a Fourth Amendment violation. The IJ and its clients disagree.

Police chief Mark Talbot also said \u201cIt would be difficult to drive anywhere of any distance without running into a camera.\u201d That certainly sounds like a dragnet.  On top of that, records obtained from the Norfolk PD showed there was no direct or indirect oversight of officers\u2019 access to ALPR data, which not only included plate\/location data but also descriptive information about vehicles that investigators could use as search terms, rather than just the plate number itself. And that\u2019s how the city found itself getting sued by residents represented by the Institute for Justice. Less than five months after filing this suit, a federal judge has ruled this case can move forward.  As the decision [PDF] points out, there\u2019s no denying this carpeting (fabric again!) of the city with cameras creates an inescapable network of government surveillance. And that sort of thing has been addressed by the Supreme Court, as well as courts at the appellate level. Controlling precedent has deemed certain law enforcement surveillance methods as tantamount to a drag-net, finding that these technologies violate individuals\u2019 subjective and reasonable objective expectations of privacy and therefore constitute a Fourth Amendment search. For example, the Supreme Court held that gathering all of an individual\u2019s cell-site location information little of seven days was a search, for it over a period of as revealed the whole of an individual\u2019s physical movements during that period. Carpenter, 585 U.S. at 311. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit held that aerial surveillance by plane. which captured second by second images of broad swaths of the City of Baltimore for close to 12 hours a day. sufficiently tracked the whole of one\u2019s movements and was therefore a search. That makes it clear the government can\u2019t simply claim public movements have no expectation of privacy. They likely don\u2019t in the singular, but the aggregate is what\u2019s problematic in terms of constitutionality.  This court says the long-term tracking of people\u2019s movements (via plate\/location data from a network of cameras that are, as the police chief stated, inescapable) is the sort of thing the Carpenter decision addressed, even if it dealt with a different form of long-term tracking.  Relying on Carpenter, when this Court accepts Plaintiffs\u2019 well-pled version of the facts and draws all reasonable inferences in their favor, as is required at this stage of the proceedings, the Court concludes that it is plausible that Plaintiffs subjectively believe they have a reasonable expectation of privacy that is being violated because the Flock camera system is creating a drag-net system of surveillance that effectively tracks the whole of Plaintiffs\u2019 physical movements. Given this, it\u2019s unlikely the government can successfully argue that if Norfolk residents don\u2019t want to be tracked by ALPRs, they can simply choose to walk or use public transportation. That argument hasn\u2019t worked in multiple Supreme Court decisions where the government has claimed that if people don\u2019t want their phone location data accessed without a warrant by investigators, they should just leave their phones at home. In this day and age, going without a phone is about as impractical as going without a car. These are essentials of everyday life, even in cities with marvelous public transportation systems. And I doubt Norfolk places highly on the list of \u201cBest Public Transportation Systems.\u201d  As one plaintiff notes, he can\u2019t even leave his own neighborhood without being photographed by up to four Flock ALPR cameras. That\u2019s ridiculous. And, as this court has ruled at this point, it\u2019s also possibly unconstitutional.  When construed in Plaintiff\u2019s favor, as required at this stage of the case. the complaint alleges facts notably similar to those in Carpenter that the Supreme Court found to clearly violate society\u2019s expectation of privacy: law enforcement secretly monitoring and cataloguing the whole of tens of thousands of individual\u2019s movements over an extended period. In short, the Court finds that considering existing precedent, the well-pled facts plausibly allege a violation of an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. Now, of course, this doesn\u2019t mean the plaintiffs have won. But the important thing at this point in the litigation is that the government hasn\u2019t won. The suit has not been dismissed. The fight continues. And, given the tone of this decision, it appears the government will need to bring some new arguments to its defense of its ALPR dragnet because the usual stuff is foreclosed by precedent. With any luck, the Institute for Justice and its clients will, at the very least, generate a warrant requirement for access to ALPR databases \u2014 something that would be the first of its kind in this nation.    \tFiled Under: 4th amendment, alpr, carpenter, license plate readers, norfolk, surveillance, virginia   \tCompanies: flock safety  That with the NEW hacks on  cars coming out, that the Police will find a way to get Everyone a NEW CAR..

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"The tech industry was built in partnership with government, and it once pursued innovation as part of a shared national project. The rise of the American software industry in the 20th century was made possible by a partnership between emerging technology companies and the U.S. government. Silicon Valley\u2019s earliest innovations were driven not by technical minds chasing trivial consumer products but by scientists and engineers who aspired to address challenges of industrial and national significance using the most powerful technology of the age. Their pursuit of breakthroughs was intended not to satisfy the passing needs of the moment but rather to drive forward a much grander project, channeling the collective purpose and ambition of a nation. This early dependence of Silicon Valley on the nation-\u00adstate and indeed the U.S. military has, for the most part, been forgotten, written out of the region\u2019s history as an inconvenient and dissonant fact\u2014\u00adone that clashes with the Valley\u2019s conception of itself as indebted only to its capacity to innovate. The United States since its founding has always been a technological republic, one whose place in the world has been made possible and advanced by its capacity for innovation. But there is also another essential element of American success. It was a culture, one that cohered around a shared objective, that won the last world war. And it will be a culture that wins, or prevents, the next one. At present, however, the principal shared features of American society are not civic or political but rather cohere around entertainment, sports, celebrity, and fashion. This is not the result of some unbridgeable political division. The interpersonal tether that makes possible a form of imagined intimacy among strangers within groups of a significant size was severed and banished from the public sphere. The old means of manufacturing a nation\u2014the civic rituals of an educational system, mandatory service in national defense, religion, a common language, and a free and thriving press\u2014have all but been dismantled or withered from neglect and abuse. This distaste for collective experience and endeavor made America, and American culture, vulnerable. The establishment left has failed its cause and thoroughly eroded its potential. The frenetic pursuit of a shallow egalitarianism in the end hollowed out its broader and more compelling political project. What we need is more cultural specificity \u00adin education, technology, and politics\u2014\u00adnot less. The vacant neutrality of the current moment risks allowing our instinct for discernment to atrophy. Only the resurrection of a shared culture, not its abandonment, will make possible our continued survival and cohesion. And only by combining the pursuit of innovation with the shared objectives of the nation can we both advance our welfare and safeguard the legitimacy of the democratic project itself. Silicon Valley once stood at the center of American military production and national security. Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation, whose semiconductor division was founded in Mountain View, California, and made possible the first primitive personal computers, built reconnaissance equipment for spy satellites used by the CIA beginning in the late 1950s. For a time after World War II, all of the U.S. Navy\u2019s ballistic missiles were produced in Santa Clara County, California. Companies such as Lockheed Missiles and Space, Westinghouse, Ford Aerospace, and United Technologies had thousands of employees working in Silicon Valley on weapons production through the 1980s and into the 1990s. This union of science and the state in the middle part of the 20th century began in earnest during World War II. In November 1944, as Soviet forces closed in on Germany from the east, President Franklin D. Roo\u00adse\u00advelt was in Washington, D.C., already contemplating an American victory and the end of the conflict that had remade the world. Roo\u00adsevelt sent a letter to Vannevar Bush, a pastor\u2019s son who had become the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, where he helped lead the Manhattan Project. In the letter, Roo\u00adse\u00advelt described \u201cthe unique experiment\u201d that the United States had undertaken during the war to leverage science in service of military ends. Roo\u00adsevelt anticipated the next era\u2014\u00adand partnership between national government and private industry\u2014\u00adwith precision. He wrote that there was \u201cno reason why the lessons to be found in this experiment\u201d\u2014\u00adthat is, directing the resources of an emerging scientific establishment to help wage the most significant and violent war that the world had ever known\u2014\u00ad\u201ccannot be profitably employed in times of peace.\u201d Roosevelt\u2019s ambition was clear. He intended to see the machinery of the state\u2014its power and prestige, as well as the financial resources of the newly victorious nation and emerging hegemon\u2014spur the scientific community forward in service of, among other things, the advancement of public health and national welfare. The challenge was to ensure that the engineers and researchers who had directed their attention to the industry of war\u2014and particularly the physicists, who, as Bush noted, had \u201cbeen thrown most violently off stride\u201d\u2014\u00adcould shift their efforts back to civilian advances in an era of relative peace. The entanglement of the state and scientific research both before and after the war was itself built on an even longer history of connection between innovation and politics. Many of the earliest leaders of the American republic were inventors, including Thomas Jefferson, who designed sundials and studied writing machines, and Benjamin Franklin, who experimented with and constructed objects as varied as lightning rods and eyeglasses. Unlike the legions of lawyers who have come to dominate American politics in the modern era, many early American leaders, even if not practitioners of science themselves, were nonetheless remarkably fluent in matters of engineering and technology. John Adams, the second president of the United States, was, by one historian\u2019s account, focused on steering the early republic away from \u201cunprofitable science, identifiable in its focus on objects of vain curiosity,\u201d and toward more practical forms of inquiry, including \u201capplying science to the promotion of agriculture.\u201d Many of the innovators of the 18th and 19th centuries were polymaths whose interests diverged wildly from the contemporary expectation that depth, as opposed to breadth, is the most effective means of contributing to a field. The frontiers and edges of science were still in that earliest stage of expansion that made possible and encouraged an interdisciplinary approach, one that would be almost certain to stall an academic career today. That cross-\u00adpollination, as well as the absence of a rigid adherence to the boundaries between disciplines, was vital to a willingness to experiment, and to the confidence of political leaders to opine on engineering and technical questions that implicated matters of government. The rise of J. Robert Oppenheimer and dozens of his colleagues in the late 1930s further situated scientists and engineers at the heart of American life and the defense of the democratic experiment. Joseph Licklider, a psychologist whose work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology anticipated the rise of early forms of AI, was hired in 1962 by the organization that would become the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014\u00adan institution whose innovations would include the precursors to the modern internet as well as the global positioning system. His research for his now classic paper \u201cMan-\u00adComputer Symbiosis,\u201d which was published in March 1960 and sketched a vision of the interplay between computing intelligence and our own, was supported by the U.S. Air Force. There was a closeness, and significant degree of trust, in the relationships between political leaders and the scientists on whom they relied for guidance and direction. Shortly after the launch by the Soviet Union of the satellite Sputnik in October 1957, Hans Bethe, the German-\u00adborn theoretical physicist and adviser to President Dwight Eisenhower, was called to the White House. Within an hour, there was agreement on a path forward to reinvigorate the American space program. \u201cYou see that this is done,\u201d Eisenhower told an aide. The pace of change and action in that era was swift. NASA was founded the following year. By the end of World War II, the blending of science and public life\u2014\u00adof technical innovation and affairs of state\u2014\u00adwas essentially complete and unremarkable. Many of these engineers and innovators would labor in obscurity. Others, however, were celebrities in a way that might be difficult to imagine today. In 1942, as war spread across Europe and the Pacific, an article in Collier\u2019s introduced Vannevar Bush, who was at the time a little-\u00adknown engineer and government bureaucrat, to the magazine\u2019s readership of nearly 3 million, describing Bush as \u201cthe man who may win the war.\u201d (Three years later, Bush published \u201cAs We May Think\u201d in The Atlantic, praising scientists for working together in a \u201ccommon cause,\u201d and anticipating many aspects of the information age that lay ahead.) Albert Einstein was not only one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest scientific minds but also one of its most prominent celebrities\u2014a popular figure whose image and breakthrough discoveries, which so thoroughly defied our intuitive understanding of the nature of space and time, routinely made front-\u00adpage news. And it was often the science itself that was the focus of coverage. From the February 1949 issue: J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s \u2018The Open Mind\u2019 This was the American century, and engineers were at the heart of the era\u2019s ascendant mythology. The pursuit of public interest through science and engineering was considered a natural extension of the national project, which entailed both protecting U.S. interests and moving society\u2014indeed, civilization\u2014up the hill. And while the scientific community required funding and extensive support from the government, the modern state was equally reliant on the advances that those investments in science and engineering produced. The technical outperformance of the United States in the 20th century\u2014\u00adthat is, the country\u2019s ability to reliably deliver economic and scientific advances for the public, whether medical breakthroughs or military capabilities\u2014\u00adwas essential to its credibility. As the philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas has suggested, a failure by leaders to deliver on implied or explicit promises to the public has the potential to provoke a crisis of legitimacy for a government. When emerging technologies that give rise to wealth do not advance the broader public interest, trouble often follows. Put differently, the decadence of a culture or civilization, and indeed its ruling class, will be forgiven only if that culture is capable of delivering economic growth and security for the public. In this way, the willingness of the engineering and scientific communities to come to the aid of the nation has been vital not only to the legitimacy of the private sector but to the durability of political institutions across the West. The modern incarnation of Silicon Valley has strayed significantly from this tradition of collaboration with the U.S. government, focusing instead on the consumer market, including the online advertising and social-media platforms that have come to dominate\u2014\u00adand limit\u2014our sense of the potential of technology. A generation of founders cloaked themselves in the rhetoric of lofty and ambitious purpose\u2014their rallying cry that they intend \u201cto change the world\u201d has grown lifeless from overuse\u2014\u00adbut many of them raised enormous amounts of capital and hired legions of talented engineers merely to build photo-\u00adsharing apps and chat interfaces for the modern consumer. A skepticism of government work and national ambition took hold in the Valley. The grand, collectivist experiments of the middle of the 20th century were discarded in favor of a narrow attentiveness to the desires and needs of the individual. The market rewarded shallow engagement with the potential of technology, as start-up after start-up catered to the whims of late-capitalist culture without any interest in constructing the technical infrastructure that would address our most significant challenges as a nation. The age of social-media platforms and food-delivery apps had arrived. Medical breakthroughs, education reform, and military advances would have to wait. Read: The divide between Silicon Valley and Washington is a national-security threat For decades, the U.S. government was viewed in Silicon Valley as an impediment to innovation and a magnet for controversy\u2014more an obstacle to progress than its logical partner. The technology giants of the current era long avoided government work. The level of internal dysfunction within many state and federal agencies created seemingly insurmountable barriers to entry for outsiders, including the insurgent start-ups of the new economy. In time, the tech industry lost interest in politics and broader collaborations. It viewed the American national project, if it could even be called that, with a mix of skepticism and indifference. As a result, many of the Valley\u2019s best minds, and their flocks of engineering disciples, turned to the consumer for sustenance. The interests and political instincts of the American elite diverged from those of the rest of the country following the end of World War II. The economic struggles of the country and geopolitical threats of the 20th century today feel distant to most software engineers. The most capable generation of coders has never experienced a war or genuine social upheaval. Why court controversy with your friends or risk their disapproval by working for the U.S. military when you can retreat into the perceived safety of building another app? As Silicon Valley turned inward and \u00adtoward the consumer, the U.S. government and the governments of many of its allies scaled back involvement and innovation across numerous domains, including space travel, military software, and medical research. The state\u2019s retreat left a widening innovation gap. Many cheered this divergence: Skeptics of the private sector argued that it could not be trusted to operate in public domains while those in the Valley remained wary of government control and the misuse or abuse of their inventions. For the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world to remain as dominant in this century as they were in the previous one, however, they will require a union of the state and the software industry\u2014\u00adnot their separation and disentanglement. Read: The crumbling foundation of America\u2019s military Indeed, the legitimacy of the American government and democratic regimes around the world will require an increase in economic and technical output that can be achieved only through the more efficient adoption of technology and software. The public will forgive many failures and sins of the political class. But the electorate will not overlook a systemic inability to harness technology for the purpose of effectively delivering the goods and services that are essential to our lives. In late 1906, Francis Galton, a British anthropologist, traveled to Plymouth, En\u00adgland, in the country\u2019s southwest, where he attended a livestock fair. His interest was not in purchasing the poultry or cattle that were available for sale at the market but in studying the ability of large groups of individuals to correctly make estimates. Nearly 800 visitors at the market had written down estimates of the weight of a particular ox that was for sale. Each person had to pay six pennies for a chance to submit their guess and win a prize, which deterred, in Galton\u2019s words, \u201cpractical joking\u201d that might muddy the results of the experiment. The median estimate of the 787 guesses that Galton received was 1,207 pounds, which turned out to be within 0.8 percent of the correct answer of 1,198 pounds. It was a striking result that would prompt more than a century of research and debate about the wisdom of crowds and their ability to more accurately make estimates, and predictions, than a chosen few. For Galton, the experiment pointed to \u201cthe trustworthiness of a democratic judgment.\u201d But why must we always defer to the wisdom of the crowd when it comes to allocating scarce capital in a market economy? We seem to have unintentionally deprived ourselves of the opportunity to engage in a critical discussion about the businesses and endeavors that ought to exist, not merely the ventures that could. The wisdom of the crowd at the height of the rise of Zynga and Groupon in 2011 made its verdict clear: These were winners that merited further investment. Tens of billions of dollars were wagered on their continued ascent. But there was no forum or platform or meaningful opportunity for anyone to question whether our society\u2019s scarce resources ought to be diverted to the construction of online games or a more effective aggregator of coupons and discounts. The market had spoken, so it must be so. Americans have, as Michael Sandel of Harvard has argued, been so eager \u201cto banish notions of the good life from public discourse,\u201d to require that \u201ccitizens leave their moral and spiritual convictions behind when they enter the public square,\u201d that the resulting void has been filled in large part by the logic of the market\u2014\u00adwhat Sandel has described as \u201cmarket triumphalism.\u201d And the leaders of Silicon Valley have for the most part been content to submit to this wisdom of the market, allowing its logic and values to supplant their own. It is our own temerity and unwillingness to risk the scorn of the crowd that have deprived us of the opportunity to discuss in any meaningful way what the world we inhabit should be and what companies should exist. The prevailing agnosticism of the modern era, the reluctance to advance a substantive view about cultural value, or lack thereof, for fear of alienating anyone, has paved the way for the market to fill the gap. The drift of the technological world to the concerns of the consumer both reflected and helped reinforce a certain technological escapism\u2014\u00adthe instinct by Silicon Valley to steer away from the most important problems we face as a society and toward what are essentially the minor and trivial yet solvable inconveniences of everyday consumer life: such as online shopping and food delivery. An entire swath of arenas, including national defense, violent crime, education reform, and medical research, appeared too intractable, too thorny, and too politically fraught to address in any real way. (This was the challenge we have aimed to address at Palantir\u2014to build technology that serves our most significant and vital needs, including those of U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, instead of merely catering to the consumer.) Most were content to set the hard problems aside. Consumer apps and trinkets did not talk back, hold press conferences, or fund pressure groups. The tragedy is that serving the consumer rather than the public has often been far easier and more lucrative for Silicon Valley, and certainly less risky. The path forward will involve a reconciliation of a commitment to the free market, and its atomization and isolation of individual wants and needs, with the insatiable human desire for some form of collective experience and endeavor. Silicon Valley offered a version of this combination. The Sunnyvales, Palo Altos, and Mountain Views of the world were company towns and city-\u00adstates, walled off from society and offering something that the national project could no longer provide. Technology companies formed internally coherent communities whose corporate campuses attempted to provide for all of the wants and needs of daily life. They were at their core collectivist endeavors, populated by intensely individualistic and freethinking minds, and built around a set of ideals that many young people craved: freedom to build, ownership of their success, and a commitment above all to results. Other nations, including many of our geopolitical adversaries, understand the power of affirming shared cultural traditions, mythologies, and values in organizing the efforts of a people. They are far less shy than we are about acknowledging the human need for communal experience. The cultivation of an overly muscular and unthoughtful nationalism has risks. But the rejection of any form of life in common does as well. The reconstruction of a technological republic, in the United States and elsewhere, will require a re-embrace of collective experience, of shared purpose and identity, of civic rituals that are capable of binding us together. The technologies we are building, including the novel forms of AI that may challenge our present monopoly on creative control in this world, are themselves the product of a culture whose maintenance and development we now, more than ever, cannot afford to abandon. It might have been just and necessary to dismantle the old order. We should now build something together in its place. This essay has been excerpted from Alexander C. Karp and Nicholas W.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Don't shirk cheap Android phones just yet.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.   Join Namerah Saud Fatmi as she explores the cool, quirky, and sometimes downright odd world of smartphone accessories, gadgets, and other nerdy toys every week. A $100 Android phone might sound too good to be true, but that's exactly what the NUU N10 is. This impossibly cheap phone comes with Android 14 and Gemini baked in, plus it has zero bloatware. I was offered the opportunity to test the device, and I thought, how bad could it possibly be? Only one way to find out \u2014 by using it. Thus, use it I did. I was fully prepared for an entirely abhorrent experience with the NUU N10. When a company refuses to disclose the name of the phone's processor, one can only assume they are ashamed of it. But the spec sheet isn't all trash, and even a no-name 1.6GHz octa-core processor can perform well enough. Throughout my testing, I felt the need to periodically remind myself that this phone costs just $100. It mitigated a lot of my harsh judgment because, really, how much can (or should) you expect for that amount of money? Put the price tag aside for a few seconds, and hear me out. The NUU N10 comes with some generous screen real estate, boasting a large 6.6-inch IPS LCD screen with an HD+ resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. A higher screen refresh rate really helps improve the snappiness of the phone, even if it's not the sharpest tool in the shed. The body of the phone has a nice weightiness to it and the soft matte back paired with the silver metal frame looks modern and attractive. Unfortunately, the rear is very obviously made of plastic and feels uncomfortably flimsy. There's no in-screen fingerprint reader, but that's fine because the side-mounted one inside the power button works wonderfully well. Accompanying the N10's mammoth 5,000mAh battery supports 18W USB-C fast charging, with a Type-A-to-C cable and a 10W power brick in the box. The 3.5mm headphone jack,\u00a0microSD card\u00a0slot for expanding the 128GB onboard storage, and dual SIM slots are a nice touch, seeing as most flagship phones ditched this golden trio several generations ago. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android NUU tied it all together by providing everything a user could need in the box, starting from basics like a cable and SIM card removal tool to extras like a phone case and power adapter.  Unlike past NUU models, the N10 favors the full-fledged Android 14 over the lighter Android Go version of the OS, probably because it has 4GB of RAM, which can be extended to 8GB by using local storage via virtual RAM. It's not much, but NUU promises one year of software updates for all of its phones. As mentioned earlier, the phone comes with absolutely no bloatware pre-installed, nor does it have ads. Overall, the stock Android 14 experience is very neat and clean. Frills such as water or dust resistance IP ratings and support for CDMA carriers are missing here. You can still use the NUU N10 on GSM carriers like T-Mobile and MVNOs like Mint Mobile or Tello. Let's be real; it's practically impossible for something this affordable to be an all-rounder. NUU would have to lose money for that to happen. So, while there are many winning characteristics of the N10, there's a lot to feel icky about as well. Plastic body aside, the display just doesn't get bright enough. You'll really struggle with outdoor usage, especially in the daytime with the sun shining mightily. Then there's the speaker setup, which defies common sense. The NUU N10 has bottom-firing speakers that sound awful, with warbled audio that is almost completely muffled by the user's hand when in landscape orientation. The mic doesn't yield any better results either, failing to capture the full range of vocals but somehow picking up background noises and occasional echoes. I could have forgiven all these crimes to a certain extent, but it's crazy that the NUU N10 only comes with one 13MP primary camera and a useless 2MP macro lens. The main lens is godawful at its job. The so-called \"AI\" camera does nothing for picture quality, which is lacking in detail, depth, and color balance. Forget about capturing shots in the spur of the moment because the N10's camera gives you blurry shots even if you blink too aggressively. The 5MP front camera isn't any better either, with a poorly functional face unlock.  NUU incorporated extensive parental controls into the N10, making this phone ideal for tweens or teenagers. Since the phone doesn't cost much, the appeal is much higher for younger audiences who can't afford more expensive devices or aren't allowed to have premium phones. Considering the price and build quality, the NUU N10 is an ideal starter phone for kids. If it breaks, it won't hurt their guardians much as the investment is so low to begin with. The parental controls add a layer of reassurance. And with no heavy-duty bloatware installed, the device runs well enough for children to use on the daily without getting stuck or hanging. For the longest time, I couldn't imagine any brand other than Xiaomi when considering such a tight budget. And let's be honest, the only reason why Xiaomi is able to sell you a decked-out cheap phone is because it comes chock-full of clunky bloatware and ads. It's a marvel how little this phone costs despite having none of those things. The long and the short of it is that this is an inexpensive Android phone with no creature comforts. It doesn't immediately look cheap, but it certainly feels like it to a certain extent. The lackluster audio gear exhibits cost-effective traits as well. Nevertheless, the NUU N10 is one of the few $100 Android phones that can be used without ripping all the hair off your head. If you're in a pinch, it'll do.   Not half bad For the price, the NUU N10 isn't so bad after all. You get a very clean, stock Android experience with Material You goodies, Gemini, and features like a headphone jack and expandable storage.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Business Insider Edition  Palmer Luckey just clinched a big personal win \u2014 his defense startup, Anduril, is set to take over Microsoft's $22 billion contract to make high-tech goggles for the US Army.          Both firms announced the transition on Tuesday, saying Anduril would spearhead \"oversight of production, future development of hardware and software, and delivery timelines\" for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System program.               The IVAS is meant to give soldiers a headset that uses augmented and visual reality to feed them information on the battlefield in real time. One of its most important functions is to help the wearer identify drones quickly and clearly.               For Luckey, the contract transition is his own watershed moment. In his\u00a0blog\u00a0on Tuesday, he wrote that the announcement is \"deeply personal.\"               \"Everything I've done in my career \u2014 building Oculus out of a camper trailer, shipping VR to millions of consumers, getting run out of Silicon Valley by backstabbing snakes, betting that Anduril could tear people out of the bigtech megacorp matrix and put them to work on our nation's most important problems \u2014 has led to this moment,\" he wrote.               The move calls back to Luckey's original foray into the tech industry, when he founded Oculus VR and sold it to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion. After being ousted from Facebook, he started Anduril in 2017, and his defense startup has since delved into drones, AI, and counter-electronic warfare systems for the US military.               In September, Microsoft and Anduril said they were collaborating on the IVAS program, with Luckey's firm providing its Lattice software for the headsets.               Now, the entire program is set to be under Anduril's control.               Luckey wrote in his blog that he'd recognized the combat potential for high-tech goggles since he was a teenager, and that providing them to the US military was part of Anduril's original pitch deck eight years ago.               Yet Anduril's size at the time, which he estimated was a team of about a dozen people, hurt its chances at scoring the contract.               \"I do believe our crazy pitch could have won this from the start \u2014 as things stand, though, there is no time like the present,\" Luckey wrote.               The handover still needs to be approved by the US government. The US Army awarded Microsoft the 10-year contract in 2021, when the deal was valued at up to $22 billion.               The IVAS program has since faced a tough road in development and testing. Microsoft converted its HoloLens 2 headsets for military use, but soldiers criticized the devices, complaining of software glitches and side effects like headaches, nausea, and neck strain.               The feedback prompted the US Army to delay the IVAS program in October 2021, and the systems have been repeatedly retweaked for the battlefield in the years after.               Within Microsoft, the entire HoloLens project appeared to be ailing. Business Insider's Ashley Stewart reported in 2022 that plans for a third version of the headset were scrapped, and that the company had lost billions on its mixed-reality program.               In October 2024, Microsoft confirmed plans to halt production of the HoloLens 2 and cut support for the device, throwing the IVAS program into question. Microsoft's move tracked with a shift in the entire industry, as tech giants stepped back from developing mixed-reality headsets to instead focus on the AI race.               After Microsoft's decision, the US Army hinted in late January that it was surveying the market for a new contender for its 10-year contract, releasing a request for information related to the IVAS program.               With Anduril now in the driver's seat, it's not immediately clear what hardware it will use for the IVAS. There was no mention of the discontinued HoloLens 2 in its joint statement with Microsoft.               Instead, the joint statement said that part of Anduril's deal is to make Microsoft's Azure cloud service its \"preferred hyperscale cloud\" for the IVAS.               As Anduril takes over IVAS, Luckey projected confidence in his blog, writing that he wanted to \"turn warfighters into technomancers\" through his heads-up displays.               \"We have a shot to prove that this long-standing dream is no windmill,\" he wrote.               Microsoft confirmed to Business Insider that its agreement with Anduril is now pending DoD approval. Anduril did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

Review of the Year About Contact Brand Partnerships Insights Newsletters Careers at It\u2019s Nice That Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Jenny Brewer Lucy Bourton Elizabeth Goodspeed Liz Gorny Olivia Hingley Ellis Tree Extra Search Account Not all borrowing is the same. From public domain illustrations on book covers to AI\u2019s data hoarding, who really owns culture \u2013\u00a0and who gets away with taking it? Share Given that I\u2019m a graphic designer, most people would be surprised by just how much time I spend thinking about the law. Maybe that\u2019s an inevitable side effect of working with so much found material. Or maybe it\u2019s because I grew up with a lawyer for a dad, which meant hearing more about the law as a pre-teen than most people will in a lifetime. He talked about all kinds of legal oddities (tree law is still a personal favorite), but copyright seemed to come up a lot in his anecdotes \u2013\u00a0like whether a middle school could legally put on Aladdin or if a branded can of soup could appear on The View. I\u2019ve always relied on his expertise for my own progressively labyrinthine questions. Can I make a collage with a photo that\u2019s technically not public domain but from a defunct company? How much do I have to change something for it to be considered fair use? What the hell is Creative Commons? After years of my badgering, he finally got ahead of the problem and wrote me a nine-page memo breaking down copyright law \u2013\u00a0what it covers, what it doesn\u2019t, and how to avoid getting sued. But, while I hate to admit it, I mostly ignored it (sorry, Dad). Not because it wasn\u2019t useful, but because the law has never been the driving factor in what archival imagery I choose to borrow from. I don\u2019t let legality solely dictate my source material because copyright law is a mess \u2013 arbitrary, restrictive, and designed to protect corporations over artists. If you ask most people what copyright is for, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s about protecting artists. But it wasn\u2019t created to ensure artists got paid, it was only meant to incentivise creative work by granting a temporary monopoly to its creator. By limiting control to a set period, the system was supposed to encourage production while guaranteeing that works would eventually enter the public domain for collective use. Case in point: when the US first implemented copyright in 1790 (inspired by similar laws in Britain), protection lasted just 14 years, with a one-time renewal for another 14. It was never meant to be indefinite. Early lawmakers saw copyright as a tradeoff \u2013 short-term exclusivity in exchange for long-term public access. As a federal appeals court put it in Authors Guild v. Google Inc. (2015), \u201cwhile authors are undoubtedly important intended beneficiaries of copyright, the ultimate, intended beneficiary is the public.\u201d What was meant to serve both creators and the public has been undone. For nearly two centuries, copyright terms remained limited. But in 1976, Congress extended them to 75 years or the life of the author plus 50. In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act \u2013\u00a0dubbed the \u2018Mickey Mouse Protection Act\u2019 for keeping early Disney works out of the public domain \u2013\u00a0pushed it further: 95 years after publication or the life of the author plus 70. A temporary incentive has turned into near-permanent control. Vintage Valentine AF94 artwork, 2023 AF94 artwork, 2023 \u201cPublic domain imagery often gets reduced to a stylistic shortcut.\u201d While there hasn\u2019t been another major term extension since the 1998 Sonny Bono Act, corporate influence over copyright enforcement has deepened in other ways, through aggressive litigation, digital restrictions, and the expansion of corporate control over creative work. Publishing houses, record labels, and film studios continue to lobby for longer copyright terms \u2013\u00a0not to ensure artists get paid, but to guarantee indefinite ownership. Meanwhile, independent creators rarely have the resources to defend their work. Take Alex Norris, creator of Webcomic Name, who has spent years in a legal battle after signing a contract to develop a board game based on their comic. The publisher later claimed ownership of Webcomic Name itself, leading Norris to sue. Despite multiple rulings in their favour, the fight has dragged on, draining time, energy, and money \u2013\u00a0forcing Norris to crowdfund legal fees just to protect their own work. Or look to the Internet Archive, which was sued by Hachette Publishers for expanding its digital lending system during Covid, letting readers borrow digitised copies of books that libraries already owned. A study later showed the lending program had no measurable impact on book sales, but Hachette pressed forward anyway; they cared about loss of control, not loss of revenue. Instead of safeguarding creators, copyright now favours whoever has the resources to outlast their opponent in a legal battle. With heritage aesthetics trending and copyright laws as restrictive as ever, designers are increasingly looking to the public domain (works that are not copyrighted and are free to use, remix, and sell) as the perfect way to reference the past without worrying about legal red tape. Some work enters the public domain because it was never protected in the first place, like anything created by the US government, which is automatically free to use. Other work becomes public domain when its copyright expires (which does happen eventually, even under today\u2019s restrictive terms). In 2025, that means works from 1929 became fair game, including A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway, the song Singin' in the Rain, Wassily Kandinsky's painting Upward, M. C. Escher\u2019s Strada di Scanno, and the first design of the Barcelona chair. Owen Jones: Grammar of Ornament, 1856 Gohar World, 2022 Gohar World, 2022 Unfortunately, the accessibility of public domain material is also its downfall. The ease of use means it often gets reduced to a stylistic shortcut rather than something engaged with in full, chosen for its current associations rather than its original meaning. A medieval painting once represented a stoic act of religious devotion; now, it evokes arcane mysticism and dark ennui. A Victorian botanical print was once a cutting-edge tool of scientific discovery, cataloguing newly identified species; now, it\u2019s a decorative flourish that signals elegance and refinement. These images carry built-in meaning, allowing designers to wield their associations without engaging with their history. And because they already look polished, they eliminate the time, effort, and expense of creating something new from scratch \u2013\u00a0not to mention the time spent building its associative meaning from the ground up. So why commission an illustrator when you can pull something free from an archive? Book covers in particular have recently become a hotbed for recycled archival imagery. Rather than commissioning illustrators, publishers are increasingly relying on public domain Audubon prints, zoological sketches, and Renaissance etchings to populate cover art \u2013\u00a0not out of an embrace of history, but because it\u2019s cheaper and faster than hiring an artist. Of course, the same styles they love from these old images would be especially difficult (and expensive) to replicate today, given that fewer illustrators still specialise in etching, engraving, or lithography. Of course, it\u2019s those neglecting to commission work that have created a vacuum for these kinds of technical skills. Much of this is functional. Traditional media is inherently harder to revise; once an etching is done, it\u2019s done. Unlike digital artwork, where changes can be made at any stage, historic techniques require early sign-off and a degree of trust in the artist\u2019s vision. If a last-minute marketing push calls for a brighter flower or a rearranged composition, swapping one public domain print for another is far easier than waiting for an artist to redraw it. As a result, more and more, graphic design has begun to resemble collage: a patchwork of AI-generated textures, pre-made renderings, repurposed signage, and public domain imagery. Rather than referencing the past, designers are stripping it for parts to be mixed and matched \u2013\u00a0treating design history like a visual junkyard (or maybe a reanimated corpse). Aubrey Beardsley: The Murders in the Rue Morgue, 1895 Elizabeth Goodspeed: New Antiquarians, 2023 Elizabeth Goodspeed: New Antiquarians, 2023 \u201cRather than referencing the past, designers are stripping it for parts.\u201d In a design landscape where public domain materials are endlessly repurposed, a new business model has emerged around their distribution: companies that don\u2019t sell historic materials themselves, but interfaces for finding them. These platforms claim to help users discover, collect, and organise imagery from across the internet, usually alongside overwrought manifestos about \u201ca new way of mapping information\u201d or making \u201cfree expression possible for every curator\u201d. Some go a step further, offering public domain search tools that pull from institutions like the Met and the New York Public Library \u2013\u00a0but when you click an image, it redirects you to their platform rather than the original source, a deliberate friction point that traps users in their ecosystem instead of directing them to the non-profits that actually house the work. One such platform reached out to me directly this year, offering to build a \u201cpersonalised\u201d space by pulling images from my Instagram and Are.na boards (a user-funded image collection site that\u2019s been around for over a decade). The fact that their onboarding pitch involved locking freely shared content behind a walled garden was telling \u2013\u00a0there was nothing new on offer, just open resources rebranded as premium products. Stock image sites do much of the same, without even bothering with the lofty rhetoric of a manifesto. They\u2019ve always been about outsourcing creative labour, so naturally, they\u2019ve turned to the public domain to sidestep even more artists. I found a single page of Byzantine ornament listed for $33 on one site, conveniently omitting any mention of The Grammar of Ornament, the book it came from \u2013\u00a0available for free, in full, on The Internet Archive. But archival material doesn\u2019t appear online by accident. The vast digital landscape of vintage scans, lost media, and ephemeral design exists because people \u2013both professional and amateur \u2013 dedicate their time to collecting, cataloguing, and preserving it. Hobbyist archivists are responsible for a massive amount of the media we consume online; if you\u2019ve ever watched a YouTube video about lost childhood media or referenced an obscure candy wrapper in a design project, you likely owe that discovery to someone like Jason Liebig \u2013\u00a0self-described as \u201cThe Indiana Jones of Snacks\u201d and America\u2019s foremost candy historian \u2013\u00a0who has spent years meticulously scanning and documenting packaging design (if you get one thing out of this column, it\u2019s that you should be using Flickr, where most of the best ephemera is being shared by people like Jason.) Meanwhile, professional archivists and librarians \u2013\u00a0the ones who digitise and tag public domain materials for institutions \u2013\u00a0are also being erased from the equation. Their work, often underpaid and underfunded, is what makes public domain content accessible in the first place, yet some of the aforementioned platforms extract from these resources while contributing nothing back (unlike non-profit organisations like the People\u2019s Graphic Design Archive or the Public Domain Image Archive). John Audubon: Canis Familiaris, 1848 Dog Symphony: Joan Wong, 2018 Dog Symphony: Joan Wong, 2018 \u201cWorking with archival content takes precision, intention, and care.\u201d The same system that lets companies profit off the public domain and decades of creative theft also enables AI firms to scrape public domain material without credit, compensation, or regard for its original context. Meta, for example, illegally downloaded over 80 terabytes of books from LibGen, Anna\u2019s Archive, and Z-Library to train its AI \u2013\u00a0an act of mass-scale data extraction that will go unpunished. Meanwhile, in 2010, activist and programmer Aaron Swartz downloaded just 70 gigabytes of academic articles from JSTOR to share with the public \u2013\u00a0less than 0.1% of Meta\u2019s dataset \u2013\u00a0and faced wire fraud charges, 35 years in prison, and a million-dollar fine. He took his own life in 2013. Meanwhile in the UK, the government is currently proposing a data mining exemption be given to AI companies \u2013\u00a0meaning they would be able to use all artists\u2019 work to train their AIs without permission or paying royalties (unless right holders have \u2018expressly reserved their rights\u2019). Campaigners and critics of the proposal include Paul McCartney and film director Beeban Kidron, who told The Guardian it would lead to a \u201cwholesale\u201d transfer of wealth from the creative industries to the tech sector. This logic doesn\u2019t just shape corporate extraction. It also trickles down to everyday artists and consumers, reinforcing the assumption that historical materials are free for the taking. When musician Clairo\u2019s Herd Tee was revealed to have borrowed a design from an old Latvian film, fans rushed to defend it, not by arguing fair use or reinterpretation, but by insisting authorship no longer mattered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? It\u2019s a cute design and it\u2019s from an old movie,\u201d one comment read. Another argued, \u201cIt\u2019s from the 1950s, the OG artist is dead now so what\u2019s the problem\u2026 she never claimed it as her own, she just never stated that it was someone else\u2019s work.\u201d The problem, of course, was that the artist wasn\u2019t dead \u2013\u00a0she\u2019s 82, still working, and still very much alive to see her work resurface without credit. The assumption wasn\u2019t that her work had entered the public domain \u2013 it was that age alone erased ownership, and that credit only matters if an artist is still around to demand it. Still from Kabata\/In My Pocket, directed by Roze Stiebra Clairo\u2019s Herd Tee Clairo\u2019s Herd Tee Not all borrowing is the same. The logic that \u201cif it\u2019s old, it\u2019s fair game\u201d gets applied indiscriminately, as if the passage of time alone erases authorship. But copying is often more about power than propriety. When working with archival material myself, I like to think in terms of the stand-up comedy rule: punching up vs. punching down. Picking up visual motifs from a billion-dollar corporation that\u2019s built its empire on copyright hoarding? That\u2019s punching up. Repackaging the work of a living artist from a marginalised background without credit or compensation? Likewise, using found material for an indie zine is a far cry from pulling from the same source for a corporate client that could easily afford to commission something new. I don\u2019t mean to dissuade anyone from using archival material. Quite the opposite \u2013 I\u2019ve built most of my career around it! A lot of my work involves a mix of historical references, from my work with Pentagram on Minx, a TV show about a 70s porn magazine that leaned heavily on my collection of vintage erotica (don\u2019t ask), to The New Antiquarians, a book about young collectors I designed for Monacelli and Phaidon that included a myriad of archivally derived touches. If I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that working with archival content \u2013\u00a0public domain or not \u2013\u00a0takes precision, intention, and care. In the case of The New Antiquarians, since the book was about people who curate their homes from the past, it made sense to treat the book itself as a kind of collection \u2013\u00a0an assemblage of historical fragments, brought together in a way that felt personal rather than derivative. The challenge was making it feel archival without turning into pastiche, ensuring historical material added dimension rather than swallowing the design whole. A New Orleans-based collector\u2019s chapter featured a border inspired by the wrought-iron porch fences of historically Black neighborhoods in Trem\u00e9. A couple with roots in both India and New England received a border that nodded to both Punjabi textiles and colonial-era quilting. Some elements were used as found, others were completely reworked \u2013\u00a0but in all cases, the reference points were chosen not just for their aesthetics, but for their relevance. People ask me about copyright all the time, and will probably keep asking (especially after this article). I still don\u2019t have a clear answer. A lot of it comes down to following your nose \u2013 deciding whether your borrowing is thoughtful or just convenient. I\u2019ll keep trying to get it right for myself, and in the meantime, please don\u2019t sue me.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"OpenAI CEO rebuffs Elon Musk's ridiculous $97.4 billion bid, asserting that the ChatGPT maker's mission isn't up for grabs.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  In an unexpected move, Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI. Musk's bid was backed by multiple investors, including Baron Capital Group Inc., Valor Management LLC, Atreides Management, LP, Vy Fund III L.P., Emmanuel Capital Management LLC, and Eight Partners VC LLC. However, the offer was quickly shot down by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who jokingly counter-offered to buy X (formerly Twitter) for $9.74 billion, which seemingly enraged Musk, prompting the billionaire to call the AI executive a \"swindler.\" While details regarding the potential acquisition remain slim, Altman recently revealed to Bloomberg TV during an interview at the Paris AI Action Summit that Musk's constant antics aimed are OpenAI are designed to slow the AI firm down as xAI plays catchup. According to Altman: \u201cElon tries all sorts of things for a long time. This is the latest \u2014 you know, this week\u2019s episode.\u201d  As you may know, Elon Musk helped co-found OpenAI but later left the company, brewing a long-standing rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the billionaire. Musk has filed two lawsuits against the ChatGPT maker and Altman, citing a stark betrayal of its founding mission and alleged involvement in racketeering activities. While delving deeper into Musk's offer, Altman indicated: \u201cI wish he would just compete by building a better product, but I think there\u2019s been a lot of tactics. Many, many lawsuits, all sorts of other crazy stuff, now this. And we\u2019ll try to just put our head down and keep working.\u201d When asked whether he felt the endless jabs at OpenAI and its structures depict insecurity on Musk's part, Altman seemingly agreed. \u201cProbably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,\u201d the OpenAI CEO indicated. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s, like, a happy person. I do feel for him.\u201d  In a separate interview with Sky News, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that \"the company is not for sale, neither is the mission.\" According to Altman: \"The board will decide what to do there... the mission is really important and we're totally focused on making sure we preserve that.\" This comes after OpenAI is under immense pressure from investors to evolve into a for-profit entity. The ChatGPT maker was on the verge of bankruptcy with projections of making a $5 billion loss within one year. However, key investors, including Microsoft, NVIDIA, SoftBank, and Thrive Capital rallied up, raising $6.6 billion, saving the firm from bankruptcy and pushing its market valuation over $157 billion. In comparison, Musk's $97.4 billion offer is a nail in the haystack and well below OpenAI's market value. As it happens, OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise $40 billion through another round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $340 billion. This would dethrone Microsoft as OpenAI's largest backer, as SoftBank will reportedly raise $25 billion in the anticipated funding round.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Do people buying a property ever think about the people selling it? Probably only if a compelling narrative exists. One such occurred in Spain in 2020, when an act of personal endeavor emerged as a story of heroic proportions. The story was not universally reported, and few beyond Madrid are aware of it today. Nor is this because the protagonist is a shrinking violet, he is a leading European industrialist. The veil around the event occurs because it concerns something we\u2019d all prefer to forget. The ruination that the Covid-19 pandemic wrought across the globe is still reverberating as its aftershocks persist. But while governmental inquiries calculate lessons learned, what most people wish to do, if circumstances permit, is move on. Which is how stories can vanish. On the morning of Friday March 20, 2020, Clemente Gonz\u00e1lez Soler and his wife were breakfasting in their home near Madrid. Like millions of others, they watched as the television news showed hospitals collapse under the pressure of mounting Covid admissions, corridor floors commandeered as overflow emergency wards. Gonz\u00e1lez Soler is the founder and executive president of the Alib\u00e9rico Group, which comprises 17 industrial and technology companies. The list of prestigious professional and honorary civic roles he holds would require a scroll of inordinate length, added to which are several of Spain\u2019s highest national awards. As the founder and executive president of Spain's Alib\u00e9rico Group, Clemente Gonz\u00e1lez Soler\u2019s ... [+] decorated career includes industry triumphs alongside public impact. A masterclass in civic duty, blending business acumen with a steadfast commitment to service. On that Friday morning, he received a phone call from the regional prime minister. Within an hour he was leading the creation of a hospital from scratch\u2014absolute point zero\u2014that, 36 hours later, was a functioning unit with 1,500 beds, saving people\u2019s lives. Gonz\u00e1lez Soler\u2019s team of architects and engineers, aided by a network of commercial and infrastructure support, worked without cessation, and at 6pm on Saturday March 21, the first 500 patients were admitted for treatment. The two-pavilion hospital, named Noah\u2019s Ark, went on to save nearly 4,000 lives in six weeks. Patients were successfully discharged in half the time of other hospitals. Of the 1,000 health professionals who worked there, none was reported to have been infected. If this is a story about a community forced by extreme exigency to subvert its civic protocols and procedures in order to achieve immediate levels of positive public good, it\u2019s also about the capabilities of one extraordinary individual. To make the Noah\u2019s Ark project happen, Gonz\u00e1lez Soler needed his personal network of influential corporate leaders and decision-makers to align and work as one. That in itself required momentum from a single charismatic source. Suburban calm and urban flair strike a graceful accord in peaceful, private Las Rozas de Madrid.  Twenty years earlier, singularity of vision was also what inspired Gonz\u00e1lez Soler to commission the family home he created in the village of Las Rozas, 20 minutes northwest of Madrid. In 2000, or Y2K, as denizens of the World Wide Web liked to term it then, a global concern was whether contemporary IT could handle the shift of the clock from one millennium to the next. Since then, other factors have become signal for high-profile property purchasers of a certain echelon. Starting with priorities, the gated community of Las Rozas is rated highly for its levels of security. It is a supremely private enclave favored for its international schools and high-quality lifestyle amenities. Its proximity to the center of Madrid (19 kilometers by motorway) affords quick and easy access to the city\u2019s business and entertainment resources. The journey to Madrid Barajas airport is just 24 kilometers (15 miles). With the choice of any neighborhood in the capital to call home, Gonz\u00e1lez Soler has chosen to own three properties in Las Rozas over the years. Now that his family are making their own generational futures, the sanctuary he built in 2000 is for sale. Generous bedrooms mingle under the protection of privacy, tailor-made for multi-generational ... [+] families. The three-story villa is set on over 2,000 square meters (21,500 sq ft) of lush lawns, planted gardens, shady trees and landscape views of mountain peaks and trails. Seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, massage suite and a cornucopia of light, bright living areas make this a place for welcoming friends, family and colleagues with comfort and ease. There is on-site staff accommodation and garaging for six cars. Also on the property stand three cypress trees that carry the special meaning of another story not widely known. Tradition has it that if one cypress is planted, a welcome awaits inside. Two means you will dine there. Three\u2014as nurtured by Clemente Gonz\u00e1lez Soler and his family\u2014and you will find yourself staying the night. Or, perhaps, in future, staying much longer than that. The property is for sale at \u20ac3.7 million ($3.85 million) exclusively through Rimontg\u00f3.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":" Adobe today launched its competitor to OpenAI\u2019s Sora, a text-to-video AI generator that Adobe is positioning as a possible alternative to licensing stock footage. It costs at least $10 per month with the \u201cbest value\u201d option at $30 per month, but it\u2019s nowhere near good enough to warrant either price.  Powered by Adobe\u2019s Firefly video model, the generative video feature is currently in beta but is still being monetized. Current Creative Cloud subscribers can test it out with two free generations but after that, Adobe requires a Firefly subscription.  The $10 per month option grants 2,000 generative credits, which is enough for 20 generated videos, while the $30 per month option grants 7,000 credits, which is enough for 70 video generations. Videos are always five seconds long (no longer) and max out at 1080p resolution. It is important to note that these are \u201cintroductory\u201d prices that will change on March 15. Adobe has not been clear what it will change to.  When a customer attempts to subscribe, a notice informs them that the pricing \u201cwill automatically renew monthly until you cancel. Price subject to change at renewal.\u201d Change to what? Adobe does not say. This language only appears during the purchase process and is not explained in Adobe\u2019s public FAQ.  Additionally, Adobe doesn\u2019t offer other tiers above these, such as an unlimited tier, so the only option for those who exhaust their pool of credits is just to buy another subscription to Firefly and stack them on top of each other. At least the annual subscription option does provide a discount over the month-to-month option, which isn\u2019t always the case for Adobe software.  Keeping that pricing structure in the back of mind, let\u2019s examine what Adobe believes this tool is going to be useful for.  \u201cToday, we are expanding this vision with the launch of the Adobe Firefly Video Model, the only generative AI model that is IP-friendly and commercially safe, and the expansion of creative control in the Firefly web app which empowers anyone, at any skill level, to explore, ideate and bring their creative vision to life,\u201d Adobe says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just another video tool \u2014\u2013 we\u2019ve revolutionized the creative workflow and watching our community generate custom b-roll that exactly matches their vision, crafting dynamic visual effects, and designing motion elements, all while maintaining complete creative control. And there\u2019s more \u2014 whether you need to bridge content gaps in your timeline or enhance existing footage with new elements, Firefly Video Model empowers you to achieve your creative vision with efficiency and precision.\u201d So there are two proposed use cases: one is stock footage that is more specifically tailored to something that might not exist and the other is for what boils down to moving storyboards.  To be frank, the idea that Firefly is good enough to replace stock footage in any circumstance is laughable. PetaPixel generated four videos with varying prompts to see how it handled them. Actually, we only generated three since the first one required a re-do since we wanted to see a variation of it. That burned both of our test generations on one account.  The first was created using the prompt: \u201can asian-american camera reviewer on youtube in the snow talking about camera equipment while holding a camera.\u201d  https:\/\/petapixel.com\/assets\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Firefly-an-asian-american-camera-reviewer-on-youtube-in-the-snow-talking-about-camera-equipment-whil.mp4 \u00a0 When that produced a female host, we changed the prompt to: \u201can asian-american male camera reviewer on youtube in the snow talking about camera equipment while holding a camera\u201d to see its attempt at a man. https:\/\/petapixel.com\/assets\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Firefly-a-male-asian-american-camera-reviewer-on-youtube-in-the-snow-talking-about-camera-equipment-.mp4 \u00a0 Using our second Creative Cloud account, we prompted it with two more, the first being: \u201can aerial view of the san francisco skyline at sunset. the camera moves in a straight line from one side of the city to the other as the sun slowly sets.\u201d https:\/\/petapixel.com\/assets\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Firefly-an-aerial-view-of-the-san-francisco-skyline-at-sunset.-the-camera-moves-in-a-straight-line-f.mp4 \u00a0 The last was generated with the prompt: \u201ca wolf running through a verdant green field, morning light, with mountains and a forest in the background. the camera follows the wolf as it runs.\u201d https:\/\/petapixel.com\/assets\/uploads\/2025\/02\/Firefly-a-wolf-running-through-a-verdant-green-field-morning-light-with-mountains-and-a-forest-in-.mp4 \u00a0 None of these are usable in exchange for stock footage. The first two which use a supposed human are ghastly. In no world would these even remotely pass as real. These are, without a doubt, garbage. Even Coca-Cola\u2019s trash-tier AI-generated slop ad from last year is better, and that was a low bar.  The last two are better, but they still don\u2019t look believable. The San Francisco skyline might pass for usable at first glance for anyone who had not seen it before but compared to reality, the perspective is wrong. The main issue is that the buildings are not the right height in relation to one another (let alone most of the less iconic ones are just incorrect).  Adobe has a lovely stock video that is, basically, exactly what I asked Firefly to create and serves as an example of what the AI should be aiming for: https:\/\/petapixel.com\/assets\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AdobeStock_907085881_Video_HD_Preview.mp4 \u00a0 Yes, the AI-generated video is technically cheaper but it\u2019s also unusable for anyone with better than legally blind vision. Beyond that, the real video clip is available beyond 1080p resolution, which is something Firefly can\u2019t yet match.  The wolf is, I think, the best generation. Additionally, real stock footage of wolves is scant and often pretty bad. That said, what Firefly created looks like a moving painting, not like a video clip that would be usable for anything an editor would purchase stock footage for. And, again, Adobe Stock has a good option that basically fulfills the demand of the prompt and does so significantly better than Firefly did.  https:\/\/petapixel.com\/assets\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AdobeStock_297065129_Video_HD_Preview.mp4 \u00a0 The secondary use case is using these tools to \u201cideate\u201d ahead of an actual shoot. In that case, sure \u2014 you could argue these get the general vibe. However, if I wanted to give an idea of a sweeping shot of San Francisco to a team, I could just use that watermarked stock footage video. Same for the wolf. Maybe it could be argued the \u201ccamera reviewer in the snow\u201d is more specific than what is available on Adobe Stock, but at the same time, the clip below gets the job done pretty well, in my opinion.  https:\/\/petapixel.com\/assets\/uploads\/2025\/02\/AdobeStock_736809767_Video_HD_Preview.mp4 \u00a0 It\u2019s also \u2014 and this is important \u2014 free. Why would anyone pay for a worse, eldritch horror version of the above when the preview Adobe allows anyone to download is free to access? I can see the argument that I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on Adobe Firefly Text-to-Video here because it\u2019s a beta and it\u2019s not nearly the \u201cfinal form\u201d that it will eventually reach. Even so (and I am not convinced it will get to the point where it can ever replace real footage), why then is Adobe charging for it? Charging for a beta that produces low-resolution, inaccurate, unusable, and extremely short clips feels like something thought up in a board room by bureaucrats who have never once even spoken to an artist.  Firefly\u2019s text-to-video tool is not good enough to be used for what Adobe says it\u2019s there to be used for and I\u2019d have this opinion even if it was free. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s expensive, especially considering videos are difficult to get right on the first go-around and multiple attempts will often be required. In no world is this worth $10 a month, let alone $30 or more. And that\u2019s an important note: starting in one month, it will cost more \u2014 that is for certain. Adobe already says that the $30 tier isn\u2019t going to be the top-end option.  \u201cAdditionally, a new Firefly Premium plan designed for professionals looking to generate video content on a regular basis will be coming soon to provide even more audio and video capacity for high-volume creators and teams,\u201d the company said in a press release. When it\u2019s not worth using for free, I\u2019m not sure it matters how much it will cost.  Become a PetaPixel Member and access our content ad-free. \u00a9 2025 PetaPixel Inc.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Romain Pison, CEO of NoviCarbon - an entrepreneur and decarbonization expert known for his work in ESG and green infrastructure.   The voluntary carbon market (VCM) has grown into a cornerstone of global climate action, channeling billions of dollars into projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, as its significance has expanded, so have doubts about its reliability. Criticisms of greenwashing, concerns about low-quality carbon credits and a lack of transparency threaten to undermine its potential. For the VCM to play a credible role in decarbonization for corporates and businesses, trust must be its foundation. Drawing on my experience in sustainable infrastructure, decarbonization strategies and ESG leadership, I'll be highlighting key challenges facing the VCM and how businesses and corporations can take practical measures to invest in the VCM and the future of their companies. At its best, the VCM enables corporations to offset unavoidable emissions while supporting critical projects like reforestation, renewable energy deployment and biodiversity conservation. However, the market\u2019s rapid growth has brought scrutiny. Some companies use carbon credits as a license to continue unsustainable practices, undermining genuine efforts to reduce emissions. Additionally, not all carbon credits represent tangible, verifiable benefits. Weak methodologies and inadequate oversight have allowed questionable credits to persist. And stakeholders often struggle to trace how their investments translate into measurable environmental outcomes. The result is a market caught in a tug-of-war between its promise and its pitfalls, and businesses are often left with more questions and concerns than clear answers and solutions. For the VCM to scale as a credible decarbonization mechanism, I believe that we must actively build trust through transparency, accountability and demonstrated impact. Standards like the Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) provide a foundation for credibility by emphasizing key attributes such as: \u2022 Additionality: Ensuring projects would not occur without carbon credit funding. \u2022 Permanence: Guaranteeing long-term carbon storage. \u2022 Third-Party Verification: Relying on independent assessments to validate impact. For instance, the Gold Standard and Verra frameworks require projects to meet stringent criteria. Yet inconsistent adoption of these principles can undermine market confidence. Companies can take actionable steps by prioritizing carbon credits certified by recognized, high-quality standards; incorporating third-party verification into their procurement processes to ensure reliability; and regularly auditing their carbon credit portfolios to align with evolving benchmarks. From my experience managing infrastructure portfolios across 40+ markets at the World Bank, I\u2019ve seen that governance frameworks are more than technical necessities\u2014they are trust-building tools. When businesses integrate robust standards into their operations, they can not only mitigate risk but also inspire confidence among stakeholders. Emerging technologies can revolutionize how the VCM operates. For instance, by creating an immutable ledger, blockchain can help ensure that every transaction\u2014from issuance to retirement\u2014is traceable. Buyers can confirm that credits are unique and effective. AI monitoring is another technology to consider, as machine-learning algorithms can analyze real-time data from carbon projects, identifying inconsistencies or underperformance early. Organizations like Toucan and KlimaDAO are already leveraging blockchain to track the lifecycle of carbon credits. A 2023 report by the World Economic Forum highlights how blockchain solutions are improving transparency in carbon markets. Business leaders can support these innovations by: \u2022 Investing in and using platforms that integrate blockchain for real-time credit tracking. \u2022 Partnering with technology providers to develop custom solutions that enhance project monitoring. \u2022 Advocating for industry-wide adoption of transparent digital tools to set a new standard for accountability. The VCM does not exist in isolation; it intersects with corporations, governments, investors and NGOs. Corporations can help facilitate effective collaboration by embedding voluntary offsets within their broader emissions reduction strategies rather than using them as substitutes for meaningful change. Here are a few ways you can amplify impact: \u2022 Align offsets with broader strategies. Carbon credits should complement emissions reduction efforts, not replace them. Integrating offsets into comprehensive ESG frameworks can help you ensure meaningful decarbonization. \u2022 Engage in collaborative initiatives. For example, programs like the LEAF Coalition mobilize corporate funding for large-scale conservation projects. A Reuters report highlighted LEAF\u2019s success in protecting millions of acres of tropical forests, showcasing the power of collective action. \u2022 Demonstrating climate leadership. Microsoft has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030, pairing high-quality carbon credits with deep operational emissions cuts. This approach sets a benchmark for others in the market. \u2022 Leverage innovative financing. Mechanisms like green bonds and performance-linked loans are unlocking new capital for carbon projects. In emerging markets, where traditional funding is scarce, these instruments could provide scalable solutions for financing high-impact initiatives. The voluntary carbon market stands at a critical juncture. I believe that now is the time for business leaders to act decisively and shape the future of their companies. Here are a few steps you can take to help build a sustainable and trustworthy VCM: \u2022 Adopt Standards: Ensure your company\u2019s carbon credit investments meet rigorous benchmarks like the Core Carbon Principles. \u2022 Leverage Technology: Integrate blockchain and AI tools to enhance transparency and accountability across your operations. \u2022 Collaborate: Partner with governments, NGOs and other corporations to align offsets with comprehensive climate strategies. As someone deeply committed to advancing sustainable infrastructure and combating climate change, I believe the VCM, through the businesses that are carbon credit buyers, must evolve beyond a transactional marketplace. It should become a collaborative ecosystem\u2014one where financial investments from businesses translate into measurable, lasting climate benefits for our ecosystems and our economies.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Bath towels are a daily necessity\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t double as a daily luxury. We rigorously tested the most popular styles over the course of several weeks, and the winners were clear: In 2025, our pick for the best bath towel overall is Frontgate\u2019s Resort Collection Bath Towel, a soft, absorbent and durable option with a blanket-like feel. Meanwhile, an extra-plush option from Brooklinen is our \u201cbest heavyweight towel\u201d winner, and Matouk\u2019s Milagro Bath Towel is the clear standout in the luxury category. Our top tested picks for the best towels on the market in 2025 include heavyweight, plush towels, ... [+] quick-dry towels and more. Illustration: Before testing even began, we carefully selected contenders that represented a diverse range of sizes, weaves and price points. With our list finalized, we put each towel to the test, assessing its plushness, absorbency, drying efficiency and overall quality\u2014and then reevaluated following a laundering routine. The following is a list of the best bath towel winners from our testing process: Frontgate Material: Long-staple Turkish cotton | Construction: Terry | Size: 30 x 58 inches | Weight: 700 GSM | Colors: 28 |\u00a0Certifications: Oeko-Tex Best for: Skip if: This Frontgate option is akin to a towel you\u2019d find in a 5-star hotel. Soft, fluffy and luxurious to the touch, it\u2019s more substantial than your average towel, but manages to toe the line perfectly between the \u201ctoo thick\u201d and \u201ctoo thin\u201d outliers. Its long-staple Turkish cotton material and overall design gives it a luxurious feel; in fact, it was one of the softest and plushest of the options we tried. Our tester loved how well-made each towel was, noting that they held up well after many rounds of laundering. \u201cWhat surprised me is that after multiple washes, they look and feel exactly the same as when I first touched them,\u201d one tester raves. \u201cI almost feel like they got fluffier after being washed. I\u2019m used to towels losing their plushness and becoming flatter after multiple washes.\u201d The Frontgate Resort Collection Towel is thick, plush and luxurious.  That said, these towels aren\u2019t for everyone: Some may not find them as quick-drying as others on our list. One tester noted that there were still some damp spots remaining on the towel a full five hours after showering. (If you\u2019re looking for a towel that dries effortlessly and quickly, you might prefer the lighter-weight Onsen towel below.) In addition, the level of thickness here might not be suitable for some users who prefer a thinner towel. Overall, though, this was an across-the-board favorite, and it comes with a delightful added bonus: 27 colorways to choose from. Amazon Material: Cotton | Construction: Terry | Size: 30 x 54 inches | Weight: 430 GSM | Colors: 4 |\u00a0Certifications: Oeko-Tex Best for: Skip if: For a value play, it\u2019s hard to beat the wallet-friendly price of these towels\u2014$19 for a pack of two makes Amazon\u2019s towels an easy win in this category. But price isn\u2019t the only draw to these basic towels: Our tester was equally impressed with their overall quality. \u201cThe first thing I noticed about these bath towels was their texture and softness,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the price, it\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d The towel itself is on the thinner side, but the cotton material gives it a more plush feel. \u201cWhen wet, the towel does get softer, which makes it perfect as a wash cloth,\u201d our tester continues. \u201cThe rougher side provides a great exfoliant without being too harsh on the skin, while the other side of the wash cloth is soft enough to use on gentler areas, like your face.\u201d The Amazon Basics 100% Cotton Soft Quick-Dry Bath Towel Set is a great find for the price point.  Of course, it likely comes as no surprise that these towels did not blow us out of the water in the durability department. After the first wash, the towel was unaffected, our tester claims\u2014it was \u201cjust as soft and fluffy\u201d as it was out of the box. But after a third wash, the difference was apparent: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit rougher and definitely not as soft as before.\u201d That said, some change in feel is to be expected from nearly all of the towels on our list\u2014and overall, this remains a a great choice for those in need of a basic, straightforward bath towel, whether for their own bathroom, a guest room or even an extra set to use at the gym. Amazon Material: 60% microfiber, 40% cotton | Construction: Z-twist, jacquard weave | Size: 30 x 56 inches | Weight: 500 GSM | Colors: 9 |\u00a0Certifications: None Best for: Skip if:\u00a0 The Everplush Diamond Jacquard Bath Towels are a great, mid-weight pick that may not be the fluffiest on our list, but are still incredibly soft, thanks to the towels\u2019 patented cotton and microfiber loops. Our tester was pleasantly surprised by and impressed with how absorbent these towels turned out to be: \u201cI was not expecting them to dry me after showers as quickly and efficiently as they did, but the Everplush worked better than my old, thicker bath towels,\u201d she says. \u201cThe towel feels soft and comfy like cotton, but seems to have an underlying microfiber structure that\u2019s really good at wicking away water.\u201d These towels come in nine colors, including khaki and dusk, both with lovely-looking, contrasting hems. These have a diamond-shaped jacquard weave that adds a unique design element (and allows them to dry faster). The Everplush Diamond Jacquard towels heated up quickly in our tester's towel warmer. \u201cAn unexpected pleasure I get from the Everplush is that since they\u2019re so much lighter in weight and thickness than my usual towels, they heat much faster in my bathroom towel warmer,\u201d our tester adds. \u201cI can throw one in the warming bucket as I\u2019m stepping into the shower and it\u2019s toasty warm by the time I step out. My older set of towels needed to heat up for a while, given their bulk.\u201d Brooklinen Material: Long-staple Turkish cotton | Construction: Z-twist | Size: 30 x 58 inches | Weight: 820 GSM | Colors: 13 |\u00a0Certifications: Oeko-Tex Best for: Skip if: The Brooklinen Super-Plush Turkish Cotton Bath Towel is one of those luxuries that you\u2019ve just got to try to believe. Several Forbes Vetted editors count these extra-plush towels among their favorite Brooklinen products\u2014and if \u201creally, really fluffy\u201d is on your towel nonnegotiable list, you\u2019ll be delighted with them, too. While they\u2019re certainly not for everyone\u2014these do offer a far thicker texture than other towels on our list\u2014they\u2019re an incredible option for those who are looking for a little extra fluff in their lives. That thickness translates into a heaviness, to be sure, so just make sure you\u2019re ready to use a little arm strength each time you reach for one fresh out of the shower. Our testers found these towels to be incredibly durable, with each wash leaving them somehow softer. The Brooklinen Super-Plush Turkish Cotton Bath Towels are thick and fluffy.  Brooklinen Material: Long-staple Turkish cotton | Construction: Terry | Size: 30 x 58 inches | Weight: 550 GSM | Colors: 9 |\u00a0Certifications: Oeko-Tex Best for: Skip if:\u00a0 If you\u2019re seeking a mid-weight towel with high-quality construction, Brooklinen\u2019s Classic Turkish Cotton Bath Towel fits the bill\u2014and it\u2019ll dry quickly, too. While you can certainly find plusher, more premium options, these towels check a few of the most important boxes: They\u2019re made from soft, 100% long-staple Turkish cotton and come in a handful of colors\u2014and they\u2019re incredibly absorbent while still drying fast. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that if you\u2019re someone who likes heavy linens that envelop you, these are not going to be your jam. \u201cWhen I first opened the box, I wished the towels were a touch fluffier,\u201d admits one staff tester. \u201cBut they\u2019re still nice and soft to the touch. And considering their lighter weight, they\u2019re very good at absorbing water.\u201d We named Brooklinen's Classic Turkish Cotton Bath Towels the best quick-dry bath towel.  Compared to other towels, Brooklinen\u2019s Classic Turkish Cotton Bath Towels have been consistently quick-drying\u2014even in the wettest circumstances. \u201cBecause these aren\u2019t heavyweight towels, they do dry so, so quickly,\u201d our tester adds. \u201cI really appreciate this, as my bathroom doesn\u2019t have the best air ventilation\u2014and the longer your towels stay damp, the longer bacteria can grow.\u201d The towels are available in nine different hues, including Brooklinen\u2019s rotating \u201climited edition\u201d colorways that arrive seasonally. After several weeks of use, our tester found no major signs of wear or loose fibers. Matouk Material: Long-staple cotton | Construction: Z-twist | Size: 30 x 60 inches | Weight: 550 GSM \u00a0| Colors: 23 |\u00a0Certifications: Oeko-Tex Best for: Skip if: These towels were the most expensive towels we tested (by a landslide), and yet they proved to be well worth their heftier price tag. They arrive in beautifully wrapped packaging, but they\u2019re soft and luxurious to the touch\u2014and, most importantly, they\u2019ve stayed that way stayed after multiple rounds of washing and drying. Our tester consistently reaches for these towels when she steps out of the shower now, and, post-testing, she continues to be impressed by their luxurious feel: \u201cI typically prefer an overly thick and fluffy towel\u2014hence why I love the Brooklinen Super-Plush Turkish Cotton Bath Towel\u2014but I appreciate and have come to enjoy the midrange pile of this towel,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly just beautiful. I love to display this towel on my towel rack; it looks great draped over the rack with its rich color and detailed edges.\u201d While we do recommend the Frontgate towel as the best overall pick for most people, the midrange pile on the Matouk is a great choice for that in-between plushness range. Matouk's Milagro Towel is our choice for the best luxury towel on the market. Onsen Material: Long-staple American Supima cotton | Construction: Waffle weave | Size: 31 x 57 inches | Weight: 470 GSM | Colors: 12 |\u00a0Certifications: Oeko-Tex Best for: Skip if: Waffle towels are incredibly breathable and ultra-lightweight, making them an increasingly popular option for anyone who appreciates an airier feel. Unlike a terry weave towel, which features tight loops, these towels are woven with raised threads that form small squares or rectangles. The Onsen towel is emblematic of all of the above: It\u2019s impressively lightweight with a GSM of just 470, meaning it absorbs moisture quickly, dries fast and\u2014because of its weight\u2014takes up less space in a closet or on a towel rack than most other towels (a great choice for those with small storage spaces). The waffle-weave texture adds a unique design element for those looking for something different than a traditional terry towel. \u201cI\u2019ve only used waffle towels at hotels in the past, but these are really nice ones,\u201d says one of our staff testers. \u201cThey are softer and more stretchy, so to speak, than others I\u2019ve used\u2014in a good way.\u201d Our tester also notes the impressive absorbency factor. \u201cI can dry off quickly with them, or stay wrapped up in them for awhile comfortably.\u201d Although they are inherently thinner and less plush than other towels we tested, they are still soft and feel nice on the skin. Added bonus: The tag on these towels can double as a hook. Boll & Branch Material: Long-staple Turkish cotton | Construction: Terry | Size: 36 x 70 inches | Weight: 820 GSM | Colors: 9 | Certifications: Oeko-Tex, GOTS Best for: Skip if:\u00a0 Bath sheets are typically about 860 square inches larger than standard bath towels, so they provide more of a cuddly, blanket-like feel than a traditionally-sized towel. These gorgeous Boll & Branch bath sheets are made of high-quality cotton and are unbelievably soft, which comes as no surprise given the brand\u2019s reputation for luxury. Bonus points go to the packaging\u2014each towel arrived individually wrapped with a white ribbon, making them feel like a special present (this also makes them perfect for gifting). \u201cRight out of the box, the towels felt incredibly luxurious, soft and fluffy,\u201d says our tester. \u201cI\u2019d describe them as having a medium plushness, medium thickness and medium softness\u2014comfortable and absorbent, but not quite as plush as I expected given their \u2018plush bath sheet\u2019 name.\u201d Boll & Branch towels come individually wrapped with a white ribbon, making them great for gifting.  In terms of soaking up moisture, though they get the job done\u2014and then some. \u201cEven setting the size aside, I found them to be highly effective at absorbing moisture,\u201d our tester noted. \u201cAfter the first wash, they lost a bit of their initial plushness, but that actually made them more absorbent. Slight reduction in softness added a bit of friction, which helps the towel do its job better.\u201d (A slight loss of plushness after a first wash is also just to be expected, generally speaking.) To make sure our methodology was as streamlined and objective as possible, we adhered to the following criteria: Each winning towel needed to be plush but absorbent, not \u201cpaper thin\u201d but not overly thick, able to dry relatively quickly and capable of withstanding frequent laundering. Before testing, we took note of each towel\u2019s basic specs including material, construction, size and weight (in the standard GSM (grams per square meter). Next, we began testing, looking specifically for the following criteria: GSM is the main indicator of plushness, but the actual real-life feel of the towel is a great indicator, too. We made note of how each of these ranked in terms of softness and fluffiness as we took them out of the box, and after a few turns in the washing machine (three full wash-and-dry cycles, to be exact). Then, we analyzed how the manufacturer\u2019s claims stacked up against our in-person experiences. First, we hung each of our tested towels on a hook after a shower, then noted how long it took them to feel fully dry again. Second, we purposefully crumpled them up and placed them in a dirty laundry pile after a second shower to see how quickly they dried in a \u201ccompromised\u201d position. We washed each set of towels a minimum of three times according to the manufacturer\u2019s care instructions. After each wash cycle, we ran the towel through the hottest dryer cycle before repeating the process. We noted which of the towel\u2019s fibers had come loose, if any, and how full the dryer vent was after washing. We also marked if there was any change in stiffness or softness after washing, or loss to color vibrancy. Based on our firsthand testing experiences and after speaking to a group of experts, we recommend considering the following qualifications while shopping for a new set of towels: Nearly all of the towels we tested were made of 100% cotton. It\u2019s important to note that there are three types of cotton: short staple, long staple and extra-long staple. When it comes to towels, long-staple cotton (such as Turkish cotton) or extra-long\u2013staple cotton (such as Pima, Supima or Egyptian cotton) are preferable. \u201cEgyptian's softness is better than Turkish towels, so we prefer Egyptian due to its absorbance and overall feel,\u201d says Alexis Vitale of Hermosa Beach-based interior design firm Vitale Design Group. Sean Cormier, chair of the textile development and marketing department at New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology, notes that fiber content is one of the most important elements. \u201cCotton is hydrophilic, which means that it easily absorbs water,\u201d he explains, which is why it makes for such a great choice here. Construction in this case refers to the type of weave showcased by each towel; of course, we exclusively tested waffle weave and terry options. \u201cThe most important thing to consider here is fiber content,\u201d says Cormier. The key to a great towel is the weight of a towel, says Vitale. \u201cTowels are weighted in grams or \u2018GSM.\u2019 We prefer to have a GSM of 500 to 900, as this will feel soft and sumptuous.\u201d If you\u2019re after a towel that\u2019s exceptionally plush, look for one with a higher GSM; just note that it may take longer to dry. When it comes to sourcing towels for clients, Vitale says she first considers who will be using the towels (a young child, a teenager or an adult) in order to choose the proper size. \u201cRemember the four F\u2019s,\u201d she advises. \u201c\u2019Fit,\u2019 \u2018feel,\u2019 \u2018function,\u2019 and, of course, \u2018fashion.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s important for your purchase to stand the test of time, especially if you\u2019re investing in one of the more expensive brands. Durability is key, and towels should be able to avoid showing signs of wear and tear even with regular laundering, considering these are a daily-use home product. (None of our winners showed extreme signs of wear and tear after our laundering tests: They all held onto their color and did not have frayed threads or excessive shrinkage.) We\u2019re invested in firsthand tested reporting here at Forbes Vetted, and this towel story features exactly that. The author of this piece, Kim Peiffer, also happens to have an enormous amount of experience testing lifestyle-focused products; she\u2019s the features director at Forbes Vetted and has worked as an editor for two decades, professionally reviewing products for over 10 years. As part of our research for this story, we interviewed two experts about bath towels, including: The brand that makes the best bath towel depends on personal preference, but during our in-depth testing we determined that the Frontgate Resort Collection scored the highest across the board in terms of thickness and softness, drying time and quality after laundering.\u00a0 The key to a great towel is the cotton and the weight of a towel, says Alexis Vitale of Hermosa Beach-based interior design firm Vitale Design Group. \u201cTowels are weighted in grams or \u2018GSM.\u2019\u00a0We prefer to have a GSM of 500-900 as this will feel soft and sumptuous.\u00a0Supima, Turkish and Egyptian cottons are recommended only if they are 100% of the product.\u201d When it comes to bath towels, the material is a vital component, says Alexis Vitale of Hermosa Beach-based interior design firm Vitale Design Group. \u201cA staple material is zero-twist Egyptian Cotton. This not only feels nice, but is luxurious,\u201d she says. \u201cAdditionally, it\u2019s important that towels feel plush, absorbent and dry quickly as well as stay soft after a few hundred washes.\u00a0Your towel should feel soft and cozy to the touch\u2014a true treat.\u201d ","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Shares of Fastly (FSLY) are down 2% at $9.85 at last check, trading at multi-week lows ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings release. Due out after the close today, Feb. 12, analysts are anticipating a breakeven result. FSLY is sitting just above its year-to-date breakeven level and struggling longer term, down 57% in the past 12 months. The equity has pulled back to a historically bullish signal, however, per historic data from Schaeffer\u2019s Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. Per White, FSLY has recently come within one standard deviation of its 50-day moving average, after spending a notable time above the trendline (defined as at least 80% of the time over the past two months and eight of the last 10 trading days). This signal has flashed four times in the past three years, with the stock averaging a one-month return of 17.8%, positive 75% of the time. From the equity\u2019s current perch, a jump of this magnitude would put shares above $11.50 for the first time since December. Daily Chart of FSLY Since October 2024 with 50-Day Moving Average FSLY hosts a mediocre earnings history, finishing four of its past eight post-earnings sessions lower, averaging an 18% swing, regardless of direction. This time around, options traders are expecting a much larger 28.9% move. There is ample room for upgrades, with 10 of the 11 covering brokerage firms sporting a tepid \"hold\" or worse recommendation. The security is also ripe for a short squeeze, with short interest accounting for 7.1% of its total available float. Options traders are in luck as the stock\u2019s Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) ranks at 91 out of a possible 100. This suggests Fastly stock has tended to exceed options traders' volatility expectations over the past 12 months -- a boon for premium players.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Prior to the release of the Samsung Galaxy S25, a lot of speculation focused on whether it would run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 3. Now Qualcomm has revealed another chip that could bring a major upgrade to mid-range phones: the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4. This chip could bring upgraded performance, AI, and connectivity to more budget-friendly devices. Let\u2019s start with its performance. The Qualcomm Kryo CPU brings a 10% improvement in general performance, while the Adreno GPU bumps graphical performance by 30%. Those might not seem like huge gains, but even a small amount of performance increase can yield dividends down the line. The biggest change comes from the improved gaming performance, however. The Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 is a more battery-efficient chip, so playing\u00a0Genshin Impact won\u2019t drain your phone quite as fast. More importantly, though, games will just look better thanks to the new Game Super Resolution feature. This scales graphics up to 4K, while the Adreno Frame Motion Engine can improve framerates without killing the battery. Yes, that means you can play\u00a0Infinity Nikki without the screen stuttering. Another big selling point is the AI support. This is the first Snapdragon 6 chip that supports Generative AI, so any phone that uses it will be able to handle things like text creation and content summaries. From a purely technical perspective, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 has 2.4GHz clock speed, a peak download speed of around 2.9Gbps, and support for 140 MHz bandwidth and 200MHz mmWave bandwidth. This chip brings a lot to the table, but evaluating its performance in real-world scenarios will have to wait till after launch. According to Qualcomm, Realme, Oppo, and Honor will all release phones over the next few months powered by this chip. More companies will likely also adapt this chip, which means the western market could see big upgrades to more affordable handsets over the next year. Following a summer filled with new phones from Samsung and Google, it's almost time for Apple fans to get their time in the spotlight. According to a new report, Apple's next iPhone event will be held on September 10. Rumors of the September 10 date aren't new, though the latest report comes from a pretty trustworthy source: Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. According to \"people familiar with the situation,\" September 10 is the day we'll see the iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10, and more. Qualcomm is capitalizing on the increased interest around AI with its latest smartphone chip announcement. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor supports generative AI capabilities and several large language models (LLMs) to help midrange devices compete with their flagship counterparts, which have seen AI increasingly used as a major selling point. Qualcomm\u2019s general manager of mobile handsets, Chris Patrick, confirmed the company\u2019s intention with the chip in the press release, saying: Just days after announcing its fourth-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, Google is set to change the Google Home app.\u00a0As first noted by Android Police, this will revamp how users interact with their compatible devices. The updated app, part of the Google Home Public Preview version 3.20.1.8, has been revised, including the thermostat controls and the general UI. The refresh also relocates the Nest app and Energy Dashboard icons underneath the main thermostat controls; they now look like pills. Meanwhile, the settings cog and overflow menu remain at the app\u2019s top.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Steve Rigby, Co-CEO of Rigby Group.   U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. \u201cwill invest more deeply than ever in this transatlantic bond with our American friends in the years to come.\u201d The U.S.-U.K. relationship spans centuries and has had many ups and downs, but could it be stronger, especially for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic? A report from The Entrepreneurs Network, a British think tank for entrepreneurship policy, believes the answer is yes. (Full disclosure: I am a patron of TEN and contributed to the report.) \u201cTowards a More Special Relationship\u201d suggested the business bond between the U.K. and the U.S. is underdeveloped and shared policy recommendations for the U.K. government to close the gap and build stronger ties between the British and American economies. I believe there are also steps business leaders can take to strengthen ties with America. In doing so, entrepreneurs can position themselves for success when looking to expand Stateside. The U.S. is the U.K.'s top export market and accounted for 21.7% of export trade in 2023, but there remains a disconnect when British entrepreneurs look to expand their businesses into the U.S. It might sound obvious, but the U.S. is not homogeneous. The vast regional differences\u2014and how this affects business strategies\u2014are often overlooked when British (and European) businesses try to expand in the States. Understanding competitive landscapes and industry concentrations is vital if you want to be on the front foot when entering a new market. For instance, starting in San Francisco might be the trendy thing to do, but is it truly the right decision? Then there is also striking the balance of company culture overseas. Brits and Americans have different employment expectations, which can be difficult to navigate for those unfamiliar with the U.S. terrain. Regardless of one's political stance, I believe we must recognize the growth opportunities the U.S. has to offer. After President Donald Trump's re-election, U.S. bank stocks soared. Also, America has a gross domestic product about 8.2 times the size of the U.K.'s, and its GDP per capita is approximately 1.7 times larger. Not only is it a more populated and wealthier country, but also many British businesses are interested in international trade. The Santander Trade Barometer said that more than a quarter (28%) of British businesses are considering international expansion in the next three years. I believe ignoring these facts would be detrimental to the U.K.\u2019s economy and plans for growth, especially in the post-Brexit era and following the political collapse in France and Germany. It has been a difficult few years for British businesses. I wrote previously about how it's often difficult to keep larger businesses on British soil. A steady stream of news around decisions not to list or delist from the London Stock Exchange has led to questions about the future of Britain\u2019s public markets, especially because many choose to list in the U.S. or are bought by American acquirers. This was the case with Darktrace, which delisted from the LSE and was sold to a U.S. private equity firm for $5.3 billion. From my perspective, a well-facilitated relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. would put founders at ease about how to access the U.S. market without having to list stateside. Personally, I\u2019ve grown weary of headlines questioning whether the U.K. is an \u201cattractive place\u201d to list. Of course it is. The sheer level of talent, the number of medium- and large-sized private businesses and our geographical position and track record of entrepreneurial success are but a few reasons why listing in the U.K. can be a wise business decision. Greater access to the extensive U.S. market could be another one. What could help British entrepreneurs thrive in the U.S.? The TEN report listed a number of actions the government could take, including working to establish a free trade agreement (or sector- and state-specific agreements) and developing a reciprocal \"explorer visa.\" Developments like these could help unlock doors for founders and CEOs, creating further innovation, investment and job opportunities. This could also help facilitate rapid technological advancement. We\u2019re currently seeing the power of AI and have only begun to scratch the surface of quantum computing. A closer relationship between the U.K. and U.S. could increase the exchange of ideas and competitiveness so we could innovate faster to resolve global challenges. When trying to expand to the States, I encourage U.K. business leaders to take a few important steps as well. Start by conducting sufficient research. The age-old adage of \"failing to prepare is preparing to fail\" rings true. Expansion requires an understanding of the new market, which is why entrepreneurs must do their due diligence and have clear proof points before they take this next step. Ask yourself: Why have I chosen this particular state? Who are my competitors? Who are my customers? How will I reach them? Have there been any notable successes and failures in my industry in this region? Learning from the mistakes of others is a good way to keep from repeating them, as is having an existing network. This might not be possible for some, but having a group of informed connections will make expansion an easier process.  To build your network, I recommend attending U.S.-focused events and following and interacting with such entrepreneurs on LinkedIn. These are simple but effective methods for British businesspeople to develop relationships in the U.S. Be careful not to waste people\u2019s time, and be prepared for rejection, but if budgets allow, visit the U.S. and try to set up meetings with investors or innovators so you can hear their experience firsthand. Failing that, an email or video call can often work wonders. While I can hold up my hands and say the U.K. stands to gain much more from the U.S.\u2014a larger economy, population (and consequent customer base), investment and an ingrained startup culture\u2014the U.K. certainly has lots to offer. Our unique entrepreneurial ability and rate of innovation are a few reasons why both parties would benefit from a stronger bond. History is a great unifier, and we can use this to become closer and propel ourselves into the future.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 U.S. stocks are slipping Wednesday after a report said inflation is unexpectedly getting worse for Americans. The S&P 500 was 0.4% lower in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 256 points, or 0.6%, as of 10:40 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower. All three indexes had been down much more at the start of the trading, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% at one point. Treasury yields also climbed in the bond market, cranking up the pressure on financial markets after a report said U.S. consumers had to pay prices for eggs, gasoline and other costs of living that were 3% higher overall in January than a year earlier. That was worse than the 2.9% inflation rate of December, which is what economists expected to see again. The inflation report suggests not only that pressure on U.S. households\u2019 budgets is amplifying but also that traders on Wall Street were correct to forecast the Federal Reserve will deliver less relief for Americans through lower interest rates this year. The Fed had cut its main interest rate sharply from September through the end of last year, moves that try to make borrowing cheaper, help the economy and boost prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. But the Fed warned at the end of 2024 it may not cut rates by as much in 2025 as earlier expected because of worries about inflation staying stubbornly high. Its goal is to keep inflation at 2%, and lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Some investors were betting on the Fed not cutting rates at all in 2025, even before Wednesday\u2019s report on the consumer price index, or CPI. \u201cThe hotter than expected CPI confirms investors\u2019 anxiety regarding too-hot inflation that will keep the Fed on the sidelines,\u201d said Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. And January\u2019s reading doesn\u2019t account for any of the tariffs that President Donald Trump \u2019 has recently announced, which economists expect will raise prices for imports further. Tariffs \u201cwill make their impact felt later in the year,\u201d Samana said. Following January\u2019s discouraging inflation data, traders are betting on a nearly 29% chance that the Fed will not cut rates at all this year, according to data from CME Group. That\u2019s up from a less than 20% chance seen the day before. Such expectations sent the yield on the two-year Treasury up to 4.36% from 4.29% late Tuesday. The 10-year Treasury yield, which also takes longer-term economic growth and other factors into consideration, jumped even more sharply. It rose to 4.65% from 4.54%. When a 10-year Treasury, which is seen as one of the safest investments possible, is paying that much in interest, investors are less likely to pay high prices for stocks, which carry a higher risk of seeing their prices go to zero. That puts downward pressure on U.S. stock prices that critics say already look too expensive after running to repeated records last year, with the latest for the S&P 500 coming last month. Smaller companies took some of the worst hits, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks fell a market-leading 0.9%. They can feel the harshest pain from higher interest rates, in part because of the need for many to borrow to grow, along with their stocks often being seen as riskier than others. One of the few ways companies have to counteract such downward pressure on their stock prices is to deliver stronger profits. CVS Health did just that, and its stock jumped 16% after easily topping Wall Street\u2019s revenue and profit expectations for the latest quarter. But even doing that isn\u2019t always enough. Ride-hailing app Lyft tumbled to a 7% loss despite reporting stronger profit than Wall Street expected. Lyft\u2019s revenue for the final three months of 2024 fell just short of analysts' forecasts. Shares of Frontier Group Holdings, the parent company of Frontier Airlines, lost 2.3% after Spirit Airlines rejected a third takeover bid from the budget rival. Spirit said that it would focus on its own plan to emerge from the protection of a U.S. bankruptcy court and stabilize its finances. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after finishing mostly higher in Asia. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Yuri Kageyama contributed.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"The OnePlus Watch 3's five-day battery won't live up to real-time usage, but it'll push \"Ultra\" watches to do much better.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.   My new weekly column focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments and updates to the latest apps and features we want to highlight. The upcoming OnePlus Watch 3 is tapped to last five days per charge, and while we don't know its price yet, you can bet it'll cost much less than the Apple or Galaxy Watch Ultra while lasting much longer. It's time for OnePlus to light a fire under some big-name toes. The OnePlus Watch 3 will officially launch on February 18 with some significant changes over the OnePlus Watch 2: a new titanium bezel, a rotating crown that's functional instead of decorative, a faster and more efficient coprocessor, and an \"optimized\" GPS antenna. What matters most is that OnePlus squeezed another day of battery life for standard use (120 vs. 100 hours) and heavy use (72 vs. 48 hours) from the same Snapdragon W5 processor within a year. Pretty impressive! Its 631mAh capacity \u2014 a 131mAh generational boost \u2014 isn't that different from the Mobvoi TicWatch Enduro and Atlas (628mAh), but those are both rated for 90 hours and use a very limited Essential mode to achieve extended battery life. The Galaxy Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra 2 aren't that far behind at 590mAh and 564mAh, respectively, but they only last 60 or 36 hours with typical use. What trick did OnePlus use to pull off this gap? Most of the credit goes to the new battery tech that it recycled from the OnePlus 13, but I think we should pay just as much attention to its new \"BES2800\" coprocessor \u2014 because it'll make or break the OnePlus Watch 3 experience. And I wonder if other brands will try to emulate OnePlus's method of success.  Any Wear OS watch will use the Wear OS Hybrid Interface; it relegates low-power, background tasks like heart rate and notifications to the mobile coprocessing unit (MCU) to save battery life and leave the main, power-hungry cores dormant until they're needed for apps. But it was OnePlus that really harnessed that power on the OnePlus Watch 2 with its RTOS-running BES2700. As effective as this system was for longevity, our reviewer found last year that this 12nm chipset seemed too slow to properly handle messages and sensor data with the same speed and reliability we're used to with Wear OS watches. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android With the Watch 3, the main SoC is unchanged for Wear OS tasks, but now we have a 6nm BES2800 that OnePlus says will \"ensure an optimal balance between long battery life and intelligent functionality.\" With great power, paradoxically, comes greater efficiency. We saw with last year's Snapdragon 8 Elite how it didn't need efficiency cores because higher-clocked chips can hit the same benchmarks with significantly less power. Our OnePlus Watch 3 review will be the real test, but we can assume these background RTOS tasks will now run with better efficiency on a 6nm chip than on a 12nm one. The question is, will other brands follow suit? Most current Wear OS watches have 22nm MCUs, which feels well short of the mark. But hardware aside, I wonder if relying on RTOS for certain tasks is something other watch brands should emulate. Smartwatches can only fit so much battery capacity before the design becomes too bulky for anyone to wear. That's why we've heard so much chatter recently about Samsung and Apple using solid-state batteries: They can't increase capacity without turning off fans of skinny, pretty watches, so they're biding their time for a denser battery with a higher Wh\/L. While they twiddle thumbs and wait for this unproven tech, OnePlus has stuck its mobile Silicon NanoStack Battery into its watch. A silicon-carbon or standard lithium-ion battery shares the same cathode, but the former mixes silicon and graphite for the anode, making these batteries more dense and resilient against extreme weather conditions. A 22% capacity boost is nothing to sneeze at, but even without a spec sheet, we can assume the OnePlus Watch 3 will be heavy. One of our Watch 2 complaints was the absence of a smaller, lighter model, and it doesn't seem like that's changed here. Wearing a Watch 3 won't be for the small-wristed, and it's fair to ask how far its battery would go with the halved capacity as the Pixel Watch 3 41mm (306mAh) or Galaxy Watch 7 40mm (300mAh).  It's also fair to point out that OnePlus's five-day estimate has some odd caveats. The laboratory conditions had the tester only getting 6.5 hours of sleep per day, streaming music to earbuds for 15 minutes, taking one five-minute call per day, and only using watch apps for about 20 minutes per day. And it assumes the phone-watch Bluetooth connection will be disabled for 10 hours a day, for some reason. Even the \"heavy use\" scenario keeps the GPS workouts, music streaming, phone calls, and other applications fairly short and limited. For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 2's official 36-hour estimate includes 8 hours of LTE connection, double the GPS and music streaming and more clock checks. It feels less like they were stretching the battery life for marketing purposes. Still, it doesn't really matter to me if the OnePlus Watch 3 perfectly hits five days or loses a day or two with real-world activity. What matters more is having that leeway built in, counterbalancing the inevitable loss of capacity you see on watches after a couple of years.  Last year was already a strong year for Wear OS because Wear OS 5 put a big emphasis on battery life efficiency with current hardware. But 2025 could be even more significant because it's the year we may finally get a new Snapdragon Wear chip. Qualcomm's VP of wearables said the company's objective is to aim for \"a week's worth of battery life\" using Snapdragon chips. He further suggested that a combination of custom cores and RISC-V software could help Android watches trend in that direction. But even before this paradigm shift, OnePlus is pushing the current Snapdragon hardware as far as it can go, and I think that other brands will take more notice than you might think. OnePlus doesn't really compete with most other Android smartwatch brands in North America and Europe; IDC's latest report shows a vast majority of OnePlus & OPPO watches were sold in China. But it still hit nearly 8 million sold in three months, only a few million short of Samsung. Apple Watches have a big Chinese market presence, but they've fallen short of Huawei and have Xiaomi and Oppo\/OnePlus chasing them from behind. Even if Apple has a complacent stranglehold on the U.S. market, it can't stand pat with its 18-hour battery life if its Chinese rivals start making this look totally inadequate. And if Apple makes a battery life push, Samsung (and its partner Google) will focus on keeping its lead and making Android watches sound superior on paper, even if they fall short in sales. That's why, even if the OnePlus Watch 3 \u2014 and the OPPO Watch X2, its sibling\/clone with near-identical specs \u2014 feel like niche products here, I predict that they'll kick off a smartwatch arms race (pun intended) and nudge the bigger brands out of their battery life complacency.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Treasury Department officials said the \"error\" was quickly corrected. A 25-year-old associate of Elon Musk and former Treasury Department employee was \"mistakenly\" given the ability to make changes to a sensitive federal payment system, officials with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service disclosed in a series of court filings late Tuesday. Treasury Department officials said the \"error\" was quickly corrected, and a forensic investigation into the actions of Marko Elez -- who resigned from his position last week after The Wall Street Journal unearthed a series of racist social media posts -- remains ongoing. \"To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Elez never knew of the fact that he briefly had read\/write permissions for the [Secure Payment System] database, and never took any action to exercise the 'write' privileges in order to modify anything within the SPS database -- indeed, he never logged in during the time that he had read\/write privileges, other than during the virtual walk-through -- and forensic analysis is currently underway to confirm this,\" wrote Joseph Gioeli III, a deputy commissioner at Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The high-profile mistake at BFS -- which effectively serves as the federal government's checkbook by disbursing more than $5 trillion annually -- comes as a federal judge in New York is weighing whether to continue to block individuals associated with Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records. Lawyers with the Department of Justice initially insisted that Elez was strictly given \"read-only\" access to sensitive records, but the affidavits submitted by BFS employees on Tuesday noted that the 25-year-old was inadvertently given the ability to \"read\/write\" the sensitive system that agencies use to send \"large dollar amount transactions\" to the Treasury Department. According to Gioeli, Treasury Department officials also provided Elez with copies of the \"source code\" for multiple payment systems that he could edit in a digital \"sandbox.\" \"Mr. Elez could review and make changes locally to copies of the source code in the cordoned-off code repository; however, he did not have the authority or capability to publish any code changes to the production system or underlying test environments,\" the filing said. Elez resigned from his role on Feb. 6, and Gioielli claimed that the 25-year-old former SpaceX and X employee was the \"only individual on the Treasury DOGE Team\" who was given direct access to payment systems or source code. A \"preliminary review\" of his digital activity suggests that Elez stayed within the permitted bounds of his role when accessing the payment systems. \"While forensic analysis is still ongoing, Bureau personnel have conducted preliminary reviews of logs of his activity both on his laptop and within the systems and at this time have found no indication of any unauthorized use, of any use outside the scope that was directed by Treasury leadership, or that Mr. Elez used his BFS laptop to share any BFS payment systems data outside the U.S. Government,\" the filing said. The filings also provided new insights into DOGE's ongoing mission with the Treasury Department, including to identify fraud, better understand how the payments are fulfilled and to enforce Trump's day-one executive order that significantly cut foreign aid. According to Thomas Krause -- a tech CEO and DOGE volunteer who is leading the cost-cutting effort at the Treasury Department -- DOGE is engaged in 4-to-6-week assessment of the Treasury Department's payment systems. He was placed at Treasury not only to identify potential fraud but also understand how to use the Department's payment systems to potentially cut funding to other parts of the government, the filing said. \"BFS is well positioned to help agencies and the federal government holistically understand and take stock of the problems [Government Accountability Office] has reported on,\" Krause wrote. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Big Tech\u2019s 2025 is off to a rough start. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations on cloud revenue in their latest quarters; Apple (AAPL) fell short on iPhone sales; and Tesla (TSLA) disappointed on the top and bottom lines. And that's weighing on the companies\u2019 stock prices. Google and Microsoft are down 2.7% and $3.3% year-to-date, respectively, while Tesla is off 17%. Apple's stock has declined 6%. Amazon is up 4.4% during the same period, but, as of Wednesday, is off 1.4% since it reported its earnings on Feb. 7. But one company is thriving: Meta (META). The social media giant\u2019s stock is up 22% since the start of the year and, as of Wednesday, is riding a 17-session winning streak on Wall Street. Why is Meta performing so well when other hyperscalers are falling? It\u2019s certainly not because its rivals are plowing money into AI investments. Sure, Amazon said it plans on capital expenditures north of $100 billion in 2025, and Google and Microsoft will shell out $75 billion and $80 billion, respectively. But Meta also plans to splash huge sums on the technology, saying it\u2019ll pour between $60 billion and $65 billion into capital expenditures this year. It's simpler than that. While its Big Tech rivals are spending to draw outside customers, Meta's spending will power its own growth. \u201cI think Meta may actually be the most consequential company of our time right now, and I think it's because they are the ultimate customer zero,\u201d explained Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. \u201cNothing they are doing as a hyperscaler is merely for the sake of reselling to others.\u201d Part of the reason Meta\u2019s AI investments are paying off on Wall Street is because the spending directly benefits the company\u2019s ad sales and time users spend on its platforms. \u201cThey've used [their AI investments] largely to drive their business where \u2026 other companies have been trying to be a little bit more all things to all people,\u201d explained Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research. The benefit to Meta\u2019s approach is clear in its early results. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, AI is impacting virtually all of the company\u2019s work. \u201cImprovements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone,\u201d Zuckerberg explained during the company\u2019s Q3 earnings call in October. And during Meta\u2019s Q4 call, CFO Susan Li said 4 million advertisers are using the company\u2019s generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago. All of that makes AI an easier sell for investors. \u201cMeta is just so much more straightforward,\u201d explained Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. That\u2019s not to say that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft aren\u2019t seeing positive traction thanks to their AI investments. But rather, the path from laying out the capital to build data centers to customers signing up for their AI platforms isn\u2019t as clear-cut as Meta\u2019s. \u201c[Hyperscalers have] all talked about services leveraging AI that they're offering on their own,\u201d TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O\u2019Donnell explained. \u201cI just think that Meta doesn't have the distraction of selling their \u2026 [computing] services.\u201d The possibilities of Meta\u2019s open-source Llama AI models are also attracting Wall Street as the company seeks to build out a global AI standard. While Meta currently offers the software for free, there are a handful of limitations on how users can take advantage of it, including a limit of 700 million monthly users accessing a service using Llama. \u201cYou could definitely see how all these companies that are going to use Llama as a base model that could, through licensing, become a really big revenue stream in the future,\u201d Newman said. And Zuckerberg is keen on ensuring Llama 4, the company\u2019s next-generation open-source model, leads the industry. \u201cLlama 4 will be natively multimodal \u2014 it's an omni-model \u2014 and it will have agentic capabilities, so it's going to be novel and it\u2019s going to unlock a lot of new use cases,\u201d he said during the company\u2019s Q4 earnings call. \u201cI'm looking forward to sharing more of our plan for the year on that over the next couple of months.\u201d How Meta ends up successfully monetizing Llama is still up in the air. And it\u2019s still incredibly early in the AI race to declare any winners just yet. But for now, investors are clearly impressed with what Zuckerberg and his company have put together so far.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Judy Moon is Digimarc's VP of Market Development and Strategic Sales. She is passionate about using technology to solve complex problems.   In many ways, 2024 was an inflection point for the digital landscape. Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken center stage with evident power to significantly impact the public and private sectors and most industries. In addition, AI enters the scene when public trust in media is incredibly low, 86% of Americans get their information from a digital device and the problem of misinformation and disinformation online is on the rise. Mis- and disinformation have been a growing problem since the dawn of the internet\u2014with the power to damage everything from trust in the public sector to media to brands and companies. Only recently, however, has this problem been exacerbated by AI\u2014a technology capable of creating vast amounts of misleading content in the blink of an eye, and which can have catastrophic impacts on reputation and even stock price. As we navigate a contentious future where misinformation is already rampant, we face a potential information crisis that threatens the integrity of our digital ecosystem itself and the economy that depends on it. The internet has always been a bit of a Wild West\u2014very few guardrails have been put in place over the years to manage the information circulating online. But now, with AI\u2019s ability to churn out false or misleading content in an instant, how do we know if we can trust what we see? How can companies, public figures and everyday folks like us protect ourselves from being manipulated by someone else\u2019s agenda? This new age of AI demands action. If we don\u2019t implement safeguards now, we risk losing trust in the digital world altogether. We need clear indicators\u2014digital road signs\u2014that help people discern whether the content they consume is indeed authentic or whether they should tread with caution. Digital watermarks and other content credentials offer a much-needed solution. These technologies can help media organizations, businesses or content owners identify and protect their work, enabling consumers to verify the authenticity of what they see online. Digital watermarks work by embedding a covert code tied to information about a digital asset within the asset itself, linking them to critical information like the original creator or publish date. Digital watermarks can be scanned and verified, much like a machine-readable \u201c\u00a9,\u201d signaling ownership and authenticity. Digital watermarks are already used worldwide across billions of items, validating everything from currency and driver\u2019s licenses to pharmaceuticals and automotive parts. Just as we don\u2019t expect counterfeiters to label forgeries of these items as \u201cfake,\u201d we must apply the same logic to digital content. Creating an online environment where authentic content is digitally watermarked allows consumers to learn to be suspicious of content without a digital watermark\u2014creating an ecosystem of informed consumers. In recent months, the urgency to secure online content has become a pressing issue for federal and state leaders. In October of last year, President Biden issued an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which called upon entities like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to explore the use of content credentials like digital watermarks to distinguish human-made content and that generated by AI. States have also taken up the mantel, with over 600 AI-related bills introduced in state legislatures across the country this last session. If content creators could apply credentials like digital watermarks to their work before publishing it, that would ensure key information, like provenance data, would always be tethered to that content. This would, in turn, help consumers decide whether to trust what they see or hear online. To make this a reality, several leading technology companies have founded or joined the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which seeks to address the \u201cprevalence of misleading information online through the development of technical standards for certifying the source and history (or provenance)\u201d of digital content. The newest generation of these standards, C2PA 2.1, supports content credentials that are strengthened with digital watermarks\u2014\"creating a durable link between a digital asset and its provenance information.\" This new generation of content credentials will help build much-needed transparency about the content that is consumed online. We live in an era of information overload, an ever-present cycle filled with news, marketing and information delivery. Brands, reputations and even the economy depend on the online landscape's integrity and transparency. Misinformation is a threat to business as well as public institutions. As GenAI becomes an increasingly significant part of our lives, safeguarding our digital ecosystem is more critical than ever, which is why we need transparent and trustworthy tools to help us put safeguards in place so we can understand what is real and what is not. Understanding the origin of the content we consume is essential\u2014not just for our peace of mind but because the internet shapes our work, economy and even our thinking. Transparency in our digital world isn\u2019t too much to ask for\u2014it is a necessity\u2014and we need business leaders to help light the way for a better-informed and more trustworthy digital landscape. Content credentialing is a foundational step in pursuit of that goal. Forbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives. Do I qualify? ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The January Barometer is one of the most well-known stock market indicators, based on the idea that the market\u2019s performance in January sets the tone for the rest of the year. Dating back to 1950, when the S&P 500 Index (SPX) gained in January \u2014 like this year\u2019s 2.7% rise \u2014 it averaged a 12% return for the rest of the year, with positive returns 87% of the time. Conversely, when January was negative, the index averaged just a 2% gain for the rest of the year, with 60% of returns positive. In this article, I\u2019ll further explore this concept by finding individual stocks that exhibit their own January Barometer. Perhaps this will give us additional insight into what to expect from those stocks for the rest of 2025. Using a decade\u2019s worth of data, I identified SPX stocks with January returns that predicted the rest of the year most often. That is, if January was positive, so was the rest of the year. If January was negative, then the rest of the year was also negative. The stocks listed below were positive in January and have a history of that return correctly predicting direction. The first two tickers on the table \u2013 D. R. Horton (DHI) and Cooper (COO) \u2013 had returns for rest of the year follow the same direction as their January return 90% of the time (as is indicated in the \u201cJanuary Barometer\u201d column). Based on this table, mega caps Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also have a high probability of moving higher for the rest of the year. The next table shows stocks likely to go down according to their own January Barometer. Notice the first ticker on the table, Digital Realty Trust (DLR), which is the only stock in the SPX with a January return that has correctly predicted the rest of the year in each of the past 10 years. With a 7.6% loss in January, this does not mean it\u2019s 100% certain to go lower rest of the year, but it\u2019s an interesting stat. Microsoft (MSFT) is a mega cap that made the list, but in the last 10 years, it\u2019s been lower in January three times, and after two it was higher the rest of the year. This means investors should take this information with grain of salt. Campbell\u2019s (CPB) might be more interesting. Over the past 10 years, it\u2019s been negative in January four times, and every time it\u2019s been down for the rest of the year, averaging a return of about -14%. Based on the January Barometer, the SPX has an increased probability of moving higher over the next 11 months. Hopefully, we\u2019ve gained insight into the direction of some individual stocks for the rest of the year, given their individual January Barometer performance.

Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly preparing to launch its newest iPhone SE sometime next week, and it looks like it\u2019s found its AI partner \u2014 Alibaba (BABA) \u2014 to help it roll out Apple Intelligence in China. Things appear to be looking up for the tech giant. And that\u2019s translated to a slight reprieve for the company\u2019s stock, which is up just more than 1% over the last five days compared to a decline of 6% year to date. But at least one analyst isn\u2019t holding his breath. Jefferies equity research analyst Edison Lee says the market optimism surrounding the latest developments out of Cupertino is misplaced. \u201cWe reiterate our cautious view of [Apple], despite imminent launch of [the iPhone SE] and a potential AI deal with [Alibaba],\u201d Lee wrote in a note to investors Wednesday. According to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will launch its latest iteration of the entry-level iPhone SE sometime next week. The phone is said to cost somewhere between $400 and $500 and feature a design similar to the iPhone 14, complete with Face ID facial recognition, a larger display, and a more powerful processor. Beyond its low price point, which is several hundred dollars less than the $799 iPhone 16, the iPhone SE\u2019s biggest feature will be the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s generative AI platform. The service provides a number of AI capabilities including notification summaries, writing tools, and photo editing functionality. It also has a more advanced version of Siri that works alongside OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. By offering Apple Intelligence on a lower-cost iPhone, the thinking goes, Apple will attract more users to the platform, driving greater interest among consumers. But whether that happens is difficult to know. Apple Intelligence is the main attraction of Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 lineup but hasn\u2019t been the smash hit Wall Street was hoping it would be. Apple CEO Tim Cook told investors during the company\u2019s latest earnings call that iPhone sales were higher in areas where Apple Intelligence is available. Morgan Stanley Research analyst Erik Woodring, however, wrote in an investor note on Tuesday that the software only provided a small tailwind to iPhone sales during the quarter. Instead, Woodring said, sales were probably driven by \u201cUS consumers accelerating purchases of the discounted 1-year old iPhone 15 Pro\/Pro Max.\u201d Those phones, along with the iPhone 16 line, are the only ones that can use Apple Intelligence at the moment. In his note, Lee wrote he remains cautious of the iPhone SE\u2019s potential because it will reportedly only include a single rear camera. He also doesn't see Apple Intelligence as a major selling point yet and says smartphone sales in China are already falling following the Lunar New Year. There\u2019s also the matter of whether Apple\u2019s reported AI partner in China will make a difference in sales. According to The Information, the iPhone maker is working with Alibaba to get Apple Intelligence up and running in the country. But Lee said Apple will have issues leveraging app data from its first-party apps to serve up helpful user data via Apple Intelligence since Chinese smartphone users tend to use third-party local apps. \u201cTherefore, Apple will likely find it hard to leverage app data to create differentiated services,\u201d he wrote. Apple's China sales have been stubbornly difficult to crack in recent quarters. Revenue in the region topped out at $18.5 billion in the latest quarter, below expectations and short of the $20.8 billion the company saw during Q1 2024. Full year 2024 revenue out of the region came in at $66.9 billion, down from $72.5 billion. Not everyone is down on Apple\u2019s AI opportunity in China, though. Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster said the Alibaba partnership should reduce the company\u2019s headwinds in the region, but Apple still has to execute on the basics to ensure Apple Intelligence is a success. \u201cApple\u2019s path forward in China will depend on how well it integrates AI into its devices, navigates growing nationalist sentiment, and adapts its pricing strategy to match shifting consumer behaviors,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. Apple Intelligence is still a way off from becoming the kind of must-have product Apple hopes it will become, but as it adds capabilities over time, it could work out to become a solid offering. The Apple Watch was panned when it was first released, as were the company\u2019s AirPods, but both have become key pieces of its empire. Now the company just has to figure out how to make using the platform as necessary to its users as its other successful products. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Energy giant Chevron will let go of up to a fifth of its more than 45,000 employees, the company confirmed in a statement Wednesday to Forbes, becoming the latest American giant to announce a significant reduction to its headcount. A Chevron gas station in Los Angeles. Chevron will reduce its workforce by 15% to 20%, according to a statement from the company\u2019s vice chairman Mark Nelson provided by a company spokesperson (Reuters first reported on the layoffs). The company had 45,511 employees as of October 2023, according to Chevron\u2019s most recent proxy statement, meaning the layoffs will impact roughly 6,830 to 9,100 jobs. \u201cChanges to the organizational structure will improve standardization, centralization, efficiency and results,\u201d explained Nelson. The layoffs will begin this year and be mostly complete by the end of 2026, according to Nelson. Chevron did not comment on the primary areas of the company affected by the layoffs. \u201cResponsible leadership requires taking these steps to improve the long-term competitiveness of our company for our people, our shareholders and our communities,\u201d Nelson concluded his statement. Chevron is the second-most valuable American energy company, trailing only Exxon Mobil, and its more than $270 billion market capitalization makes it the U.S.\u2019 28th-largest public company. In November, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth hinted to Bloomberg that the company\u2019s $3 billion of cost-cutting initiatives would be a \u201csmall part of the total\u201d savings. Chevron has employees across 51 countries, but 57% of Chevron\u2019s workforce are on U.S. payrolls as of October 2023. Chevron scored a record profit of $36.5 billion in 2022 as energy companies globally enjoyed as oil prices shot up after Russia invaded Ukraine, but its net income pulled back to $21.4 billion in 2023 and $17.7 billion last year as oil prices moderated. After returning 58% in 2022 amid a global stock market downturn, Chevron stock has been stuck in a rut, returning -2% over the last two years, underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 53% return. Job cut announcements declined 40% last month compared to January 2024, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, but Chevron joins a growing list of major corporations conducting layoffs this year. The U.S.\u2019 biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase, will lay off less than 1,000 workers this month, according to Barron\u2019s. Facebook parent Meta began its 5% reduction Monday, affecting about 3,600 employees. Cosmetics giants Est\u00e9e Lauder announced last week it will lay off about 10% of its workers, impacting up to 7,000 positions. Talent management platform Workday said last week it will cut 8.5% of its employees, affecting roughly 1,750 jobs.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":"Yves here. Wolf Richter explains that Treasury yields have clearly been saying that inflation is likely to get worse, particularly in the longer term. In-your-face reminders like egg shortages and Trump tariff actions and threats alone provide grist for these concerns. And recall the 25% tariffs against Mexico were not revoked but merely paused, so they could still go into effect, or be used again for more nerve-rattling Trump shows of force. Wolf depicts the market unhappiness as being with the Fed being too generous with rate cuts too soon, but it\u2019s not hard to see Trump measures as adding to nervousness. Wolf also points out that the Fed\u2019s mandate is to engineer longer-term yields so as to support groaf. But what does the central bank normally manage? Short term rates. What is its mechanism for managing the longer end of the curve? QE. But that\u2019s become a dirty word due to its use to lower longer term rates to rescue the housing market by reducing mortgage rates. That gave banks some relief and also helped consumers who could refi (and again the banks since they pull a lot of fees out of refis). By Wolf Richter, editor at Wolf Street. Originally published at Wolf Street Fed Chair Powell, at his testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs today, included his nearly standard line about longer-term inflation expectations being \u201cwell anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\u201d The first three are survey-based \u2013 what households, businesses, and forecasters see coming at them. The last is based on trading results in the Treasury market, what the Treasury market sees coming at it. It\u2019s the bond market talking here, and the bond market is getting worried again about inflation. The 5-year breakeven inflation rate rose to 2.64% today, the highest since March 2023, having shot up by 78 basis points since just before the Fed\u2019s September rate cut. This measure (5-year Treasury yield minus the 5-year Treasury Inflation Indexed Real Yield) shows what the bond market saw today as the average inflation rate over the next five years. The Fed has cut by 100 basis points, while this measure of market-based inflation expectations for average inflation over the next five years has shot up by 78 basis points. It has become \u201cunanchored,\u201d as one might say to needle Powell during the FOMC press conference:  A Fed that is lax about inflation scares the bond market once inflation starts rumbling. And the Fed has seen that reaction from the bond market too \u2013 including the surge of longer-term yields, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, since the beginning of the rate cuts \u2013 which is why it has walked back any talk of further rate cuts and instead has pivoted into wait-and-see mode to not unnerve the bond market further. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate (10-year Treasury yield minus the 10-year Treasury Inflation Indexed Real Yield) is a little more sanguine but is also coming unanchored. This measure of what the bond market saw today as the average inflation rate over the next 10 years rose to 2.46%, the highest since October 19, 2023, and before that day the highest since March 2023. It shot up by 44 basis points since just before the Fed\u2019s September rate cut.  The rate cuts unnerved the bond market. The bond market saw that inflation wasn\u2019t quite done with yet when the Fed was cutting rates just as inflation was starting to re-accelerate. This infused the bond market \u2013 and not just the bond market \u2013 with concerns that the Fed would be more tolerant about inflation going forward, along with signs of fear that inflation would on average be higher over the next five years in particular. This jump in inflation expectations by the markets, along with the surge of the 10-year yield following the rate cuts, likely triggered the energetic backpedaling by the Fed on further rate cuts. It is now in official wait-and-see mode. Powell and the other Fed governors now keep hammering home the point that they can be \u201cpatient\u201d with their rate cuts. The bias today is still for cuts, not hikes. Inflation would have to make larger and more sustained moves higher for the Fed to switch the bias to rate hikes. But a bond market freakout over accelerating inflation and a lax Fed \u2013 resulting in higher long-term yields that really matter for the economy \u2013 would nudge the Fed to switch its bias to rate hikes again. To keep long-term yields from rising too much, the Fed will need to show the bond market that it\u2019s serious about inflation, and that it will crack down again if inflation re-accelerates substantially. That\u2019s the irony: The Fed might have to hike short-term rates again to make sure long-term interest rates remain \u201cmoderate\u201d \u2013 paying attention to the third part of its mandate, to conduct monetary policy \u201cso as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\u201d The mandate is silent about the Fed\u2019s short-term policy rates. It\u2019s \u201clong-term interest rates\u201d that are in the mandate, and the way to get there is to keep inflation in check.","label":0}

The case raises questions about the use of force and police training. Pressure grows on the academy\u2019s new principal, Sanne Hammerby, while Internal Affairs investigates the case. The truth seems increasingly unclear, and both trainees and employees are confronted with the difficult choices and great responsibility that comes with wearing the uniform,\u201d the synopsis reads.  \tBose praised August and Giese for having penned an \u201cengaging and relevant story, will be wonderfully articulated under the direction of Janus Metz with his unique style and creative vision.\u201d Bose is producing the series with Sofie Bergstein and Jonas Allen at Miso Film.  \t           \tMetz, meanwhile, said \u201cThe Uniform\u201d \u201cworks with many of the same themes that I dealt with in \u2018Armadillo.'\u201d The latter is Metz\u2019s 2010 thriller about Danish soldiers who were sent to Afghanistan in 2009.  \t\u201cI am looking forward to bringing a series about the formation of the Danish police to life.

Viaplay, once the leading local streamer and commissioner of Nordic series, went nearly bankrupted and is now hardly doing any originals. But Bose says it wasn\u2019t just Viaplay going down, it was also \u201cHBO withdrawing from the market, and Disney scaling back on doing local stuff,\u201d he says.   \tBeing part of Fremantle helped Miso stay afloat and develop a raft of projects during the crisis.

That means that by the time streamers started buying again, Miso already had a few good titles up its sleeves.   \t\u201cAt that time, a lot of people were just running panically and Peter and I just sat together and decided to go back to projects we believed in, to the core of our business which is all about high-end dramas and great creative talent on board,\u201d Allen says, adding they\u2019re now \u201cmore diverse in terms of (their) clients, including public broadcasters, commercial networks and the streamers who are still in in the market.\u201d   \tThe silverlining of these tumultuous years is that Nordic broadcasters have stepped up to the plate, the duo says. Taking risks on original stories is also part of Miso Film\u2019s DNA and Allen says a big part of their jobs as producers is to find the right partners for each project, even those who require some \u201ccourage.\u201d   \t           \tBose says \u201cRoyal Blood\u201d also underscores Miso Film\u2019s ambition to tell stories that relevant to the Nordic region but can also resonate universally. \u201c\u2018Royal Blood\u2019 is Scandinavian in tone and in relevance and in substance,\u201d he says. The company has also dived into romantic comedies and dramedies in recent years. The company, which is one of Netflix\u2019s largest purveyors of Nordic series, recently produced \u201cA Copenhagen Love Story\u201d about a young couple on a mission to conceive a child and navigating fertility treatments, for the streamer.  \tUltimately, Miso\u2019s success lies in big part to its relationship with creative talent. \u201cHaving access to these talented filmmakers and actors is a huge part and also been a huge part of our strategy since the creation of our company 20 years ago. The producers are also keeping their slate at a manageable size of 10-15 projects to \u201censure that we can fully focus on realizing our vision for each one,\u201d says Bose.   \t\u201cPeter and Jonas have built a wonderful culture at Miso for pushing creative boundaries with an impeccable taste for finding flagship IP with great local talent that competes on a global stage and makes\u00a0a difference,\u201d says Christian Vesper, Fremantle\u2019s CEO Global Drama and Film. \u201cIn a challenging market facing considerable changes, they have shown tremendous leadership in delivering exceptional shows for streamers, and PSBs, to stabilise, and restructure the company for strong international growth in what is an historic moment as they celebrate 20 years of creating Miso magic,\u201d Vesper continued.        \t\t\tA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\t\t The Business of Entertainment","label":0}

Combine remarketing, in-market segments, and more to refine targeting and improve campaign results. In an increasingly data-driven advertising world, getting your ads in front of the right people can make all the difference. One powerful way to achieve that is through audience layering in Google Ads. By stacking multiple audience signals like remarketing lists, in-market segments, and more, you can deliver highly relevant ads and zero in on high-intent users. Audience layering can be complicated. Let\u2019s dive into what audience layering is, the key components, and an example demonstrating how you can start using it effectively in your campaigns. Layering audiences in Google Ads means combining different audience targeting methods within a single campaign or ad group. Instead of targeting just one broad group, you stack multiple criteria to create increasingly specific segments of users. By filtering out less-qualified traffic, layering helps you focus on the people most likely to be interested in your products or services. This approach allows you to refine your ad spend by reaching more qualified groups and speaking directly to their interests or behaviors. As a result, you can reduce wasted spend and improve overall ad performance. Let\u2019s look at the types of audiences we can choose from that are eligible for using together for advanced targeting. You can layer the following audience types (with exceptions noted below): By strategically layering these audience segments \u2013 and considering location targeting as a base layer \u2013 you can significantly improve the relevance of your ads, reaching the most qualified potential customers. The concepts of Targeting and Observation are directly related to audience layering strategies in Google Ads. They determine how your layered audiences interact with your broader targeting settings and influence who sees your ads and how much you bid for those impressions. Here\u2019s how they relate: When you use Targeting with multiple audiences, create an \u201cOR\u201d relationship where the searcher can be served ads if they belong to any of the audiences. If you use location as a base, you create a restrictive layering effect. Think of it as an \u201cAND\u201d relationship here. A user must belong to all targeted audiences to see your ad. By adding audiences in Observation, you are not directly targeting the observed audiences. The primary purposes of adding an audience to Observation are: This approach allows for a broader reach while still prioritizing high-value segments through bid adjustments. Effective audience layering strategies often involve a combination of Targeting and Observation. Here are a few common approaches: By understanding the interplay between Targeting and Observation, you can create sophisticated audience layering strategies that maximize reach and improve data gathering for optimal targeting. Audience layering, using both Targeting and Observation, is available across several Google Ads campaign types, but with some differences in functionality and availability of audience types. The campaign types below are all supported, but have slightly different use cases by campaign: Key Considerations: By understanding how audience layering works across different campaign types, you can adapt your targeting strategies to achieve your specific marketing objectives. It can be a bit confusing knowing how to set up audiences and layer them in Google Ads. The following steps will get you there: Let\u2019s look at an example of how we can layer audiences for a fictitious company selling kayaks in-store in the state of Oregon, USA. Layer 1: Location Targeting (Cities Near Kayaking) This layer focuses on users physically located near popular kayaking destinations in Oregon who are geographically more likely to be interested in kayaking activities in Oregon. This recommendation is standard for a business offering location-specific services or targeting local customers. It ensures your ads are shown to people who are geographically relevant and more likely to visit your physical store or participate in kayaking activities in the area. Layer 2: In-Market Audiences (Water Activities Equipment\/Outdoor Recreation) This layer targets users actively researching and considering purchases related to water sports gear and outdoor recreation. This signals a higher purchase intent compared to users who simply have a general interest in these categories. By layering this audience with the location targeting, you\u2019re reaching people near kayaking spots who are also actively looking to buy relevant products or services, making them highly qualified leads. Layer 3: Affinity Audiences (Outdoor\/Water Sports) This layer should be in its own Adgroup and then can broaden your reach beyond those actively researching purchases. It targets users with a general affinity for outdoor activities, travel, and adventure. While these users might not be immediately ready to purchase, they represent a larger pool of potential customers who could be interested in kayaking. This layer helps increase brand awareness and introduce your kayak company to a wider audience who share relevant lifestyle interests. Since this is a wider audience, it\u2019s possible that this ad group would receive more of the traffic than the other ad group. After collecting data, if you need to dial this audience back, you can make bid adjustments to optimize or create a separate campaign for budget control. By layering these audiences, the kayak store can reach a highly targeted audience (those interested in outdoor activities, located near kayaking spots, and actively researching related purchases) while also reaching a broader audience of potential kayakers through affinity targeting. The diagram below further illustrates how this targeting plays together. Segment \u201cA\u201d: Represents the audience reached where the location and the in-market audience overlap and both are targeted. Segment \u201cB\u201d: It is likely, but not guaranteed, that a small sample of people will be in all audiences \u2013 the in-market, affinity, and in the location targeted. This would be an ideal audience. Segment \u201cC\u201d: Represents the audience reached when both in the location and in the affinity audience list. Now that we\u2019ve explored an example layering plan, let\u2019s get ready to evaluate the success of layered audiences. Like most campaigns in Google Ads, focus on these key metrics: By analyzing these metrics for each layered audience, you can identify valuable segments, optimize your bids, and refine your targeting. Audience layering stands as a cornerstone strategy for PPC professionals looking to maximize their advertising impact in today\u2019s rapidly evolving digital landscape. By strategically combining audience signals, you create targeting precision that directly impacts your bottom line. Successful audience layering isn\u2019t set-and-forget. Your commitment to understanding and applying these strategies will directly impact your campaign\u2019s success. The power lies not just in the layering itself, but in your approach to selecting, measuring, and optimizing these combinations over time.

{"date":"2025-02-12","content":" The recently opened Nokia Design Archive revealed the depth of the brand\u2019s design culture. It showcased not only the various thought experiments they did, some of which ended up as weird designs, but also the process behind them. Some of these designs did feel like they were way too ahead of their time, given how some have returned to the market in one way or another. Although HMD is also retiring its run of Nokia-branded phones, that doesn\u2019t stop others from carrying the torch, at least unofficially. Like this gaming handheld coming out of China that almost looks like a slider phone, except it swaps out the small QWERTY keyboard for gaming controls. This unusual design makes it look like a cross between the Nokia N97 and the PSP Go, both of which were also ahead of their times. Designer: Super Cubes (via Liliputing, NITTRX)       Even back in 2009 when it launched, the Nokia N97 was hardly the first phone with a slider mechanism. It actually followed the design of the Nokia N series of that period, most of which shared that same form factor. What made it different, however, was how it raised the screen at an angle when sliding out to create a more ergonomic position, a design that inspired devices like the Planet Computers Astro Slide 5G phone and, more recently, the AYANEO Slide gaming handheld.        In the same vein, the Sugar Cubes N97 Elite adopts that sliding mechanism and angled screen and applies it to a gaming handheld, one powered by Android rather than Windows. The name doesn\u2019t seem to be too shy about hinting at inspiration, which is probably also a potential lawsuit waiting to happen. It\u2019s an interesting design, no doubt, especially given the saturation of designs inspired by the Nintendo Switch or even the older Game Boy. It\u2019s a fresh new look, relatively speaking, though it does come with its own flaws.   Given that it\u2019s still trying to stick to a small phone size, around 4.6 inches, to be precise, there isn\u2019t much space for controls as well. The button layout will undoubtedly feel cramped, and there\u2019s no chance of fitting an analog stick inside. It\u2019s practically the same situation with the PSP Go, so it\u2019s not entirely unusable. It just won\u2019t be that comfortable or efficient, especially for button-mashing games. Despite that small surface area, the phone slash gaming handheld is still a chunky beast.  The Sugar Cubes N97 Elite is supposed to be an actual product, but considering its origin, it\u2019s no surprise that there are already clones out there. The latter group seems to prefer more colorful finishes over plastic shells, in contrast to the block of aluminum that the brand teased. There\u2019s no word on an international release, but that might not be much of an issue as there will probably be very little interest in the global market for an Android gaming device with 2019 specs.
