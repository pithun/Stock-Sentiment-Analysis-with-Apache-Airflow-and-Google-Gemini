{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"There are controllers you can get for $60\u00e2\u0080\u0094your stock, no-frills Xbox and PS5 devices\u00e2\u0080\u0094or there are the \u00e2\u0080\u009cperformance\u00e2\u0080\u009d controllers that cost $200. SCUF is known as a company that does the latter. They make high-end devices for players who want to imagine themselves going pro. But what about a $100 controller, like SCUF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Valor Pro? Is there a market for people who just want a little bit more from their controller, even if it\u2019s wired only? The Valor Pro feels premium and not premium. The Hall-effect sticks with their swappable covers are grippy in just the right way. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first time SCUF has tried Hall effect, and while it may not have the same feel as traditional sticks, they should avoid stick drift over time. The triggers with their instant switch have a definitive depth, and the back paddles feel form-fitted to slot your middle finger between (the inner paddles are also removable). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all very SCUF, and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used one of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controllers before, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel at home here. The one issue is that this controller is wired only. There are only so many ways to make a high-end controller cheaper, and removing the battery and Bluetooth connectivity is one way to do it. Most people who want to replace their controller will look for the cheapest option. I still use the SCUF Envision for my PC gaming adventures, despite how annoying ICUE software is for remapping controls. I prefer PlayStation-style controls, so naturally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gravitate to the DualSense design. Still, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to say about that classic Xbox feel that has become so classic since the days of the Xbox 360. I played through several matches in Marvel Rivals with the Valor Pro, and without adjusting any profiles, remapping buttons, or adjusting stick sensitivity, I was already hitting some precise shots (there is some aim assist, yes, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not nearly as intense as the console version of Marvel Rivals). I do have one big issue with the controller: the D-pad. It feels small, and unlike the traditional $60 Xbox wireless controller, the direction ridges don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go all the way to the edge. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice and clicky, just like the rest of the controller, but it also felt rough on the thumb. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine many fighting game aficionados enjoying the calluses developing on their thumb over an extended session. So, with a few extras like the audio control dials for your headset connected to the 3.5 mm jack, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much else to say. SCUF promises that a future update will allow for a 1KHz polling rate for the joysticks on PC, but only the most avid gamer can tell the difference.\u00c2\u00a0And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a pro gamer or somebody who thinks they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro\u00e2\u0080\u009d level able to shout loudest at teammates in\u00c2\u00a0Call of Duty: Warzone, you would inevitably think of getting a more expensive, higher-end controller anyway, right? Price is really what the discussion relies on. The Valor Pro costs as much as the Razer Wolverine V3, a fellow wired Xbox controller (though there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wireless version, the Wolverine V3 Pro, for a whopping $200) with a similarly plastic feel and a squatter body. It was one of our favorite controllers from last year. The SCUF Valor Pro, by comparison, feels exactly like a typical Xbox controller, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a benefit for Xbox mainstays. It may not have all the bells and whistles like the dual swappable backpedals of the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, either. The extra benefit of the Valor design is that you can replace the front faceplate with several unique colorways. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create your color swatch like you can Xbox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customizer, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll first note that the cherry blossom version looks very nice, even better than the translucent \u00e2\u0080\u009csmoke\u00e2\u0080\u009d plastic on my review unit. It was only when SCUF sent me the Valor Pro for review I realized just how close these controllers resemble the $220 Instinct Pro. I have experience with those controllers through a special edition tie-in with Xbox and Netflix for Squid Game season 2. The Instinct Pro controllers also included swappable sticks and clicky adaptive triggers, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a distinct difference in how each controller feels. The RB and LB buttons on the Instinct have a more clicky sound than the Valor Pro. The Instinct\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-Hall effect sticks have more gentle movement to the Valor, and the d-pad is especially better designed and allows you to hit diagonals easily. The other difference is the outside back paddles require more effort on the Valor than the Instinct. It comes down to personal preference, but. In essence, the Valor Pro is a pared-down Instinct Pro. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a bad thing in itself. I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye if SCUF told me the controller was merely a wired-only Instinct with Hall effect sticks.  View this post on Instagram  And still, for the average gamer, the difference isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so stark that you could pick up the Valor Pro and not pick up on the difference between it and your baseline $70 default Xbox device. There may very well be a gamer out there who simply wants a little bit more oomph from a controller than what you get out of the box. SCUF seems to think so, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still not sure. Because you can tell the difference between the Valor Pro, Instinct Pro, or Envision Pro. To SCUF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit, the difference between its less- and more-expensive controller is minute. For a gamer who wants to go \u00e2\u0080\u009cpro,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Valor Pro is like the training wheels for many controllers costing $150 or more. Everybody else can feel safe sticking with the default controllers for less.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"One person has been killed and five police officers injured in a knife attack in the eastern French city of Mulhouse. A 37-year-old Algerian man was arrested at the scene and the prosecutor has opened a terrorist inquiry because the suspect reportedly shouted \"Allahu Akbar\", or \"God is great\".   The man injured two police officers seriously, one in the neck and one in the chest. A 69-year-old Portuguese man who tried to intervene was stabbed and killed. The suspect was subject to a deportation order because he was on a terrorism watch list, according to the local prosecutor. President Emmanuel Macron said there was \"no doubt it was an Islamist terrorist attack\". After expressing his condolences to the family of the victim, Macron added: \"I want to reiterate the determination of the government, and mine, to continue the work to eradicate terrorism on our soil.\" The attack took place at about 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Saturday near a busy market in Mulhouse, which is close to the borders with Germany and Switzerland. The police officers were on patrol at a demonstration taking place in support of the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"I have lived in France for 41 years and I have never experienced something like this,\" Cemalettin Canak, 55, told the Reuters news agency. \"It has shocked me a lot,\" he added. \"Now when I go to the market, I will be a little nervous.\" Of the two officers taken to hospital, the one injured to the chest was later discharged, prosecutors told the AFP news agency, while three others suffered minor injuries. \"Horror has seized our city,\" Mulhouse mayor Michele Lutz wrote on Facebook. French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou posted on X that \"fanaticism has struck again and we are in mourning\".  \"My thoughts naturally go to the victims and their families, with the firm hope that the injured will recover,\" he said. Visiting the scene on Saturday evening, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told broadcaster TF1 that the suspect had been found to have a \"schizophrenic profile\" following his arrest. He also said France had attempted to expel the suspect 10 times, and each time Algeria had refused to accept him. He called for the establishment of a new \"balance of power\" with Algeria, and told reporters \"we must change the rules\" on how detention centres operate. There was no immediate public comment from Algeria in response. Additional reporting by Tom Bennett and Rorey Bosotti Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"If somebody asked you to visualize a CNC router, you\u2019d probably think of some type of overhead gantry that moves a cutting tool over a stationary workpiece. It\u2019s a straightforward enough design, but it\u2019s not without some shortcomings. For one thing, the scale of such a machine can quickly become an issue if you want to work on large pieces. But what if you deleted the traditional motion system, and instead let the cutting tool roam freely? That\u2019s the idea behind the open source Compass Handheld CNC. Looking a bit more like a combat robot than a traditional woodworking tool, the Compass tracks its movement over the workpiece using a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and four PMW3360 optical flow sensors. With a pair of handles that look like a flight yoke and a display that shows the router\u2019s current position versus where it should be, the user can \u201cdrive\u201d the tool to cut or carve the desired design. Admittedly, the Compass doesn\u2019t pack quite the same punch as a more traditional setup. Rather than a beefy spindle motor or a full-sized consumer router clamped up in the gantry, the Compass uses a Dremel 3000. It\u2019s fine for routing out an engraving and other fine work, but you wouldn\u2019t want to use it for cutting thick stock. To help keep the work area clear and prevent dust and chips from jamming up the works, the 3D printed body for the tool includes a connection for a dust collection system. If this all seems familiar, you may be remembering a tool we first covered nearly a decade ago \u2014 the Shaper Origin. That router, which is still on the market incidentally, utilizes optical tracking and fiducial markers to keep track of its position. We\u2019d be interested in seeing how well the Compass compares over large distances without similar reference points. Looks interesting; For those interested, there is a more in depth article on: https:\/\/makezine.com\/projects\/get-your-bearings-with-compass-handheld-cnc-router\/ Video? https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ynNGwO7-uZ4 https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6kH4qsNE7Ls I find both the description here on hackaday, and on the \u201ccompass router\u201d website confusing (I\u2019m also allergic to scrolling banners, so I have to scroll though web pages to get those parts off screen. My initial thought was that it was a router with an open bottom, so you can put the thing on a bigger work piece, but the photographs excluded that. I think it\u2019s stepcraft that has a CNC router in which the bed can be removed for this purpose. But I did figure it out. They use 4 mouse sensors (the PWM3360 mentioned here on hackaday) to sense the position on your work piece and from that calculate and execute movements for the router. So it\u2019s an open sourced \/ DIY version of the \u201cShaper Origin\u201d (Which is quite expensive (Almost USD 3k), and uses \u201cdomino tape\u201d to sense the position). I am curious about drift from these mouse (mini camera) sensors, but I guess they have become quite good over the years. And as usual, I\u2019m a bit skeptical about the stiffness of constructions such as used here. Maybe it\u2019s adequate for a small dremel, but it can also be improved quite easily. First the unsupported round rails. Those are always a big cause for flex. And really, rails like MGN12 (or MGN15) are not much more expensive, especially when considering the time, effort and other materials used. Another improvement would be to print the plastic in hollow sections, and then glue in steel rebar. Epoxy would be great, but even with some relatively flexible hot glue stiffness would be improved because it only has to fill relatively small gaps. A similar method was used in a lathe: https:\/\/hackaday.com\/2025\/01\/20\/modulathe-is-cnc-ready-and-will-machine-what-you-want\/ Not sure how important stiffness is, as the dremel shaft of this model has it\u2019s bearings hanging in rubber and will flex anyhow, independent on how stiff the frame is. Well then, replacing the dremel with a standard hand router (65mm seems to be a common size) would be another upgrade :) But as of yet, it\u2019s still a quite neat idea, plenty good for a \u201cproof of concept\u201d and to further test and develop the software. I too wonder about the drift when using mouse sensors. The Make: article mentions that it was considered and would be a problem for \u201clong\u201d cuts but the redundancy of sensors mitigates this. The proof is in the cutting I guess. It seems the accuracy is improved significantly by determining the movement by committee rather than just agreeing with a single sensor. Pigeon guided missile springs to mind. I thought several sensors, all deviating in some directions but canceling each other out to some degree. These are all great suggestions, and since it\u2019s an open-source project, you could implement them and share them with the community. video here https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ynNGwO7-uZ4&t=2s It seems like it could be useful for producing PCBs and quick prototyping, feed it come copper clad board and have it route out the traces, make holes for through hole parts and mounting points, etc. I\u2019ve read that mouse sensors aren\u2019t accurate enough to be good position sensors. They occasionally skip and so the position, integrated from the Mickeys counted, can be in error. This coming from an attempt to use them to get position truth in a 3D printer. Has anyone looked at a 2D version of Lighthouse for this type of position determination? Sure you\u2019d then need a workspace\/table with known, fixed reference points but I don\u2019t see that as a big drawback. One things MCUs do very well is timing and turning the timing of lasers \u201chits\u201d into angles and then into position should be easy and accurate. Moving the the cutting endmill is the hard part. If all you wanted was cutting, vs 2.5D routing, then maybe a laser module would do ?? i guess that\u2019s why they use four of them, the video looks convincing and maybe this is just the start of this kind of approach and people will add improvements. I expect to see a better spindle motor instead of the dremel real soon, seems like a no-brainer improvement to me. I\u2019m wondering about patents. As this gradually improves it will eat Shaper Origin\u2019s lunch which is crazy expensive expensive. I mean the whole point of a patent is that you have to show how something works to patent it but if a third party starts posting howtos for cheap alternatives that will quickly be turned into \u201ckits\u201d and frames\u201d in China, I wonder if takedowns will follow. Not that it will have much impact but I always found the Shaper Origin, for what it is absurdly expensive. \u201cwegstr\u201d (No captital from me) is another crazy expensive router. It\u2019s a very simple router made from some slabs of MDF or other wood like material, and guide rails are simple bare aluminimum extrusions. But it does look nice, and it is probably good enough for it\u2019s intended task.  Based on the used materials, I would never pay more then EUR 500 for it, but it\u2019s selling price is over USD 3k. There really isn\u2019t much lunch to eat\u2026  Shaper Origin is not a raging success.  It is a very specialized market \u2013 think inlaid floors and such. If it was a big success, you would see at least one clone as there isn\u2019t a lot of rocket science in it. There was a kickstarter to clone it in 2017 \u2013 it went nowhere. And, a 3D printed version will never cut it in the kind of environments where SOs get used. As SMD components and their related assemblies get smaller (and smaller (and smaller)), I think there might be room for a \u201chobby\u201d micromanipulator on this scale to allow manual placing and experimentation of parts and assemblies as well as applying test probes.  Certainly some of we fat-fingered sorts would find a use for it. It also works with a Makita router, Cam already included that!

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist\u2019s weekly newsletter here. Just four West African countries are the foundation of an industry worth more than $100 billion. In the tropical nations of C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria, rows of cacao trees sprout pods bearing dozens of seeds. Once harvested, these humble beans are dried, roasted, and processed into something beloved worldwide. Chocolate has been coveted for millennia and, particularly on Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day, is an unmistakable token of love. But as increasingly erratic weather continues driving up the costs of confectionery, the sweet treat has become a symbol of something much less romantic: climate change. Two reports published Wednesday found that warming is pushing temperatures beyond the optimal range for cacao growth in the countries at the heart of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply, particularly during primary harvest seasons. The research reveals how burning oil, coal, and methane is roasting the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cocoa belt and skyrocketing chocolate prices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the foods that the world most loves is at risk because of climate change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at the nonprofit Climate Central, which wrote one of the two reports. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would hope that by hearing that human activity is making it harder to grow cocoa, it might cause people to stop and think about our priorities as a species, and whether we can and should be prioritizing actions to limit future climate change and future harms to this food that we love so much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d About 70 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cacao is grown in West Africa, with C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria the biggest producers. The bulk of the rest is grown in places with similar climates not far from the equator, such as Indonesia and Ecuador. The trees grow best in rainforest conditions with high humidity, abundant rain, nitrogen-rich soil, and natural wind buffers. Exposure to temperatures higher than 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit prompts water stress, hinders plant growth, and erodes the quality and quantity of seeds the trees yield. Last year, warming added at least six weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of days above that threshold in nearly two-thirds of cacao-producing areas across C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria, likely contributing to a disastrous harvest, according to the Climate Central report. The researchers examined temperature data for the region and estimates of what might have been experienced over the past decade in a world without human-induced warming. They found that between 2015 and 2024, climate change increased the number of days each country experiences temperature ranges above the ideal for cacao growth by an average of two to four weeks annually. Most of those hotter days came during the main crop cycle, when the plants bloom and produce beans. Warming is also altering rain patterns, accelerating droughts, facilitating the spread of devastating diseases like pod rot, and contributing to soil degradation. Another new study found low rates of pollination and higher-than-average temperatures in Ghana have combined to limit yields. But teasing out just how much of an impact climate change has had on production and consumer prices remains largely unchartered by scientists and economists. Dahl also said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unknown which weather phenomenon is behind the largest impact on production, nor is it clear what influence El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o had on last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harvests. Emmanuel Essah-Mensah, a cocoa grower in Ghana, described climate change as one of the most serious problems affecting production throughout West Africa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe drought means we are losing 60 percent of our cocoa plants. I have seen a drastic decline in income, as have all the farmers in my farming cooperative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Essah-Mensah told Grist. Droughts, floods, and plant diseases thrashing the region last year contributed to record cocoa prices, which in turn caused the cost of chocolate to jump, according to a report by the nonprofit Christian Aid, which works toward sustainable development and economic justice. Global cocoa production fell by about\u00c2\u00a014 percent in the 2023-24 season, and ahead of Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day last year, the soaring price of cocoa on the futures market\u00c2\u00a0shattered a 47-year record. Kat Kramer, co-author of the report and a climate policy consultant for the nonprofit, said the findings, and those of Climate Central, expose the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vulnerability to climate change. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChocolate lovers need to push companies and their governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kramer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cotherwise chocolate supplies will tragically be at increasing climate risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The implications of this go beyond what it means for this delectable delicacy. Cocoa also is used in other goods like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, which account for a significant piece of the global market. Yet chocolate remains king, with the U.S. importing around $2.8 billion worth of it every year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 over 10 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply. Federal Reserve data suggests that global cocoa prices rose 144 percent in December, more than doubling from the year before, said Alla Semenova, an economist at St. Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s College of Maryland. This is known as the producer price, or what global chocolate manufacturers pay those who process the raw beans. Still, that cost is often absorbed by confectionary customers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen producer prices rise, when the costs of production rise, consumer prices rise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Semenova. Yet even as prices go up, the farmers raising cacao don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always see any of that profit. Josephine George Francis, who produces the crop alongside coffee on her farm in Liberia, said farmers throughout West Africa actually lose money due to the rising cost of growing crops in a warming world. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need a different approach that puts sustainability and farmers at its heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George Francis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do not benefit from increased prices on world markets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, cocoa isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ingredient in confectioneries threatened by warming. Early last year, sugar, another essential ingredient, sold at some of the highest prices in over a decade after extreme weather constrained global sugarcane production. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not just the quantity of cocoa production that is affected by the acceleration of climate change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Semenova. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe type and the quality of the ingredients that go into the production of chocolate will change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All of this has led many chocolatiers to adapt. Some, like Mars and Hershey, have been quietly reducing the amount of cocoa or even introducing new treats that eliminate it entirely. As prices continue to rise, analysts expect to see demand wane, a trend even Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Bill Gates thinks people will be \"so much better off\" in the future \u2014 but that young people need to activate on certain challenges. Gates highlighted four risks, including unchecked AI, that are \"very scary things\" for younger generations.  On the agenda today:   But first: Low performer? Who says?       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here.           There are layoffs driven by cost cutting. Then there are job cuts based on performance. What if, in actuality, performance-based cuts are just ordinary layoffs in disguise?               That's essentially what some Meta employees felt this year after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a swath of cuts designed to \"raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.\" (On Friday we published details about which teams at Meta were hard hit by the cuts.)               Some of the people who were let go spoke with our Meta reporters. They said they had been under the impression their performance was solid, even exceeding expectations.               So what exactly was going on, and what did it mean for people caught in the quandary?               Our chief correspondent and careers writer extraordinaire Aki Ito dug in.               She had suspected people who felt mislabeled or blindsided would keep their frustrations quiet as they ventured back into the job market. In fact, many didn't. They took to LinkedIn to defend themselves against Meta's label.               \"This is something we haven't seen before in the professional world: Employees sticking up for themselves in public, and calling out their former employer for misrepresenting their work,\" Aki wrote.               Aki didn't just recognize the new trend. She did more reporting, asking: Even if venting via social media felt good, was it a smart tactic for job seekers?               For the answer to that question and more, please read Aki's tremendous piece. As always, I welcome your thoughts on our coverage, at eic@businessinsider.com.               As President Trump looks to slim down the federal workforce, many federal employees have expressed outrage over his job-cutting blitz. But what about the ones who voted for him?               Four federal workers who voted for Trump spoke with BI about their feelings. They said they supported Trump cutting governmental waste, but some had concerns over the administration's targeting of federal workers. One worker said it hadn't changed their support of the president.       \"It shouldn't have come to this.\"   Also read:           US companies had more than $1.43 trillion in deals last year, the highest since 2021. It's a good sign for Wall Street, signaling a rebound after the M&A freeze that started in 2022.               BI, with the help of MergerLinks, is back with its sixth annual edition of \"The Rainmakers.\" Our list ranks the highest-performing investment bankers by overall transaction volume in the US. This time around, JPMorgan's Anu Aiyengar became the first woman to secure the top spot.       Meet the 20 Rainmakers.           The rental market has been booming over the past two years. With so many high rises hitting the market, landlords are desperate to fill up the space \u2014 and renters have been reaping the rewards.               Enjoy it while you can. The new apartment supply is expected to dwindle as building costs increase and developers cut back on construction plans. It's laying the groundwork for another apartment squeeze that could cause rent to hike up.       Brace yourself.           In recent years, cost-cutting and layoffs have dulled some of Silicon Valley's shine. But now AI is fueling a new wave of tech dealmaking. BI put together a list of startups with impressive founding teams and investor dollars that are worth betting your career on.               The lineup covers a lot of ground, ranging from tools that sift through clinical notes to resources that make it easier to develop AI models.       The 43 startups you should want to work for.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Indian authorities have banned two highly-addictive opioids in response to a BBC investigation which found they were fuelling a public health crisis in parts of West Africa. In a letter seen by the BBC from India's Drugs Controller General, Dr Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi said permission to manufacture and export the drugs had been withdrawn BBC Eye found one pharmaceutical company, Aveo, had been illegally exporting a harmful mix of tapentadol and carisoprodol in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire. India's Food and Drug Administration said the company's factory in Mumbai had since been raided and its entire stock seized. The circular from Dr Raghuvanshi, dated to Friday, cited the BBC investigation in his decision to ban all combinations of tapentadol and carisoprodol, which was to be implemented with immediate effect. He said this also came after officials had looked into \"the potential of drug abuse and its harmful impact on population\". Tapentadol is a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant so addictive it is banned in Europe. Carisoprodol is approved for use in the US, but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia and hallucinations. The combination of the two drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world as they can cause breathing difficulties and seizures and an overdose can kill.  Despite the risks, these opioids are popular street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, has shipped millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. The BBC World Service also found packets of these pills with the Aveo logo for sale on the streets of Nigeria, and in Ivoirian towns and cities. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. As part of the investigation, the BBC also sent an undercover operative - posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria - inside one of Aveo's factories in India, where they filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\".  Sharma in response replies \"OK,\" before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\".  Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding that \"nowadays, this is business\". Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals did not respond to a request for comment when the BBC's initial investigation was published. India's Food and Drug Administration said a sting operation saw Aveo's entire stock seized and further production halted in a statement on Friday. Further legal action will be taken against the company, it added. The agency said it was \"fully prepared\" to take action against anyone involved in \"illegal activities that tarnish the reputation of the country\". The FDA has been instructed to carry out further inspections to prevent the supply of the drugs, it said. The two sides discussed ways to further strengthen the Indo-EU strategic partnership. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The arrival of 200 Indian nurses in Wales is welcomed - but a union warns of far greater shortages. The incident happened during a public event where the K-pop star hugged 1,000 fans. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

(Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images)  See more on Trefis.com Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Feb. 26, 2025, after the market closes. The semiconductor leader currently holds a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia reported revenue of $113 billion, with operating profits of $71 billion and a net income of $63 billion. The stock\u2019s reaction post-earnings will largely depend on how the results and future outlook align with investor expectations. Analyzing historical performance can be beneficial for event-driven traders: either by understanding past trends to position themselves before the earnings release or by examining the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings to make informed trades the day after the announcement. Specifically, past data suggests the maximum positive one-day movement post earnings, was a little over 20%. Full analysis below. Separately, see our counter scenario on \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s 50% Downside. Indeed, we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact, that Nvidia is a pretty volatile stock. Over the past five years, there have been 20 earnings reports, with 11 positive and 9 negative one-day returns, indicating positive 1D returns approximately 55% of the time.   This percentage increases to 58% when considering data from the last three years.   The median of the 11 positive returns is 4.9%, while the median of the 9 negative returns is -5.9%. Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D) and 30-days (30D) post-earnings are summarized in the table below. NVDA returns 1 day, 5 days, and 30-days post earnings A potentially less risky strategy (though its effectiveness depends on the strength of the correlation) involves understanding the relationship between short-term and medium-term returns post-earnings. Identifying pairs with the highest correlation can guide trading decisions. For instance, if 1D and 5D returns exhibit the highest correlation, a trader might consider a \"long\" position for the next five days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is correlation data based on five-year and three-year (more recent) histories. Note that \"1D_5D\" refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns At times, the performance of peer companies can influence a stock\u2019s post-earnings reaction, with market adjustments potentially beginning before the earnings announcement. The table below presents historical data comparing Nvidia post-earnings performance with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings 1D returns. Peer stocks post-earnings one day (1D) return Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock?

(Photo Illustration by Avishek Das\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Hims & Hers Health (NYSE:HIMS) is set to report its earnings on Monday, Feb 24 after market close. HIMS stock plunged over 25% on Friday, Feb 21, after the U.S. FDA announced semaglutide is no longer in shortage. Hims & Hers offers compounded semaglutide to patients struggling with supply barriers related to Novo Nordisk\u2019s popular drugs \u2013 Wegovy and Ozempic. Both medications contain semaglutide, a GLP-1 drug experiencing soaring demand. Hims & Hers\u2019 offerings will now be limited to personalized treatments, in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. However, the shortages during Q4 should translate into strong results for the company. Analysts expect earnings per share to reach $0.22, marking a significant increase from $0.05 reported in the same quarter last year. Revenue is projected to hit $470.5 million, representing a 91% growth compared to the year-ago period. The company has $11 Bil in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $1.2 Bil, and the company was operationally profitable with $43 Mil in operating profits and net income of $101 Mil. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might just turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader. There are two ways to do that - understand the historical odds and position yourself prior to the event, or look at the correlation between immediate return and medium-term return post earnings and position yourself accordingly post-event.Hims & Hers Health's Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return  Some observations on one-day (1D) post earnings returns: Additional data for observed returns 5-days (5D), and 30-days (30D) post earnings are summarized along with the statistics, in the table below. HIMS observed returns for one, five, and thirty-days post earnings Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 30D Historical Returns  A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has highest correlation and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves \"long\" for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. HIMS correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns Is There Any Correlation With Peer Earnings?  Sometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock-reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on past post-earnings performance of Hims & Hers Health stock compared with stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Hims & Hers Health.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"It's impractical and a bit goofy, but now I want more \"smart\" rings like the Casio CRW001-1, focused on design instead of data.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When Casio first announced its smart ring, I almost thought it was an early April Fool's joke. Never having owned the Casio GMW-B5000 that it's based on \u2014 or any Casio watch \u2014 the nostalgia factor never affected me. I never expected Casio to offer to send me one, nor did I expect to like it so much. But here we are!  In this weekly column, Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health, in his quest to get faster and more fit. The \"Casio ring watch\" isn't a traditional smart ring, which sets it up for easy ridicule. The stainless steel design is impressive, but all its heavy components are designed to tell the time and start\/stop a stopwatch with tiny buttons, on a screen too small to read easily. It's not breaking new ground. Compare that to an Oura Ring 4 or Ultrahuman Ring Air that tracks heart rate, stress, workouts, sleep, and a dozen other metrics while weighing significantly less (16g vs. 3-5g). Putting it in the same conversation with a novelty mini-watch isn't really fair to Casio, especially since both smart rings cost $230 more, but it's a natural comparison to make as smart rings grow in popularity.  Now that I'm seeing Casio's ring in person \u2014 instead of looking at press photos that emphasize the display \u2014 I have to admit that it's cute, even without the nostalgia factor. It's about the size of a high school class ring, only less garish (apologies to everyone I just offended), and the ridged steel look draws the eye. It only ships in one size, but it comes with a few translucent inserts to shrink it down; thankfully, it fits snugly on my right ring finger with one. It's on the noticeably heavy side, so I don't wear it while running. But Casio must have decided it was a necessary trade-off to get the steel, watch-like look and two-year battery life.  The grayscale screen only catches the eye at a direct visual angle; otherwise, it just looks like a flat, glossy layer above the metal, so it's not distracting. I assumed people would side-eye me for wearing a dorky mini-watch, but you don't notice that aesthetic unless you're quite close. Even then, the one or two comments I've received are more out of interest and curiosity than open derision. My recent smartwatch fashion contest proved that I don't really know what regular, non-techy people think is attractive in wearables; maybe people are silently judging my tastes. But this ring will certainly appeal to a niche crowd that loves the bulky Casio or Garmin Instinct look and already has heart rate tracking from another device. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Frankly, most smart rings besides Casio's look the same to me; their designs are in a race towards getting as skinny and low-key as possible, but they're all these 1-inch-wide metallic bands with a few gold or silver palette swaps. Even this $1,500 luxury smart ring looks fairly generic, aside from the 18K gold or PT950 platinum materials. I've also noticed how many smart rings are pushing to become medical-grade devices, with FDA-approved health sensors meant to target B2B sales and impress doctors instead of consumers. Basically, smart rings aren't fun; they're meant to be taken seriously and to blend in. Everything they give you is passive data that requires staring at your phone. In that context, the budget-priced Casio \"smart\" ring feels like a nice change of pace. I don't need a stopwatch timer very often; a countdown timer would be more useful. But I certainly don't mind having a way to check the time whenever I get smartwatch fatigue and take mine off for the day. It does one gimmick; otherwise, it's just there to look pretty, not sell health subscriptions.  I don't think it's worth getting too philosophical about a 50th-anniversary, limited-time device that's already sold out (though you can sign up for in-stock alerts at that link). We may not see anything like this again, and I'm sure most people would find it more dorky than cool. But I wouldn't mind if we started seeing more limited smart rings that emphasize unique designs over functionality. Look at Circular Ring, the rare smart ring with a haptic motor for silent wake-ups, notification buzzes, and even subtle guidance for meditation. We liked the concept, but Circular had to ditch haptics in the Ring 2 to add an FDA-approved ECG, until they find a way to fit both. That might be the right business decision, but the need to offer competitive health and wellness data above all else makes the field more monotonous. Everyone thinks of smart rings as mobile, 24\/7 doctor's offices. But we should shake off that impulse to judge any rings that don't offer health tracking as useless. After all, many people think smart rings are pointless because their smartwatch already tracks the same things. I don't know what these new, non-health smart rings would do, necessarily, besides this mini-stopwatch ring. Off the top of my head, we could see ones with phone-connected haptics for alarms and notifications, NFC-based contactless payments, UWB to unlock a specific digital car key or house smart lock, fall detection for seniors and the disabled, and so on. Because they'll focus on one or two key things instead of offering every health sensor and the kitchen sink, maybe smart rings can be (A) more affordable and (B) more aesthetically distinct, like the Casio ring. And these niche models won't be in such strict competition with fitness smartwatches. Michael is Android Central's resident expert on wearables and fitness.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  The stock split is making a comeback.          More companies split their shares last year than in any year since 2013, and Bank of America says this trend could continue in 2025.               That creates some opportunities for investors, the bank's research shows.               Companies usually split their stocks because their high prices create a more difficult entry point for some investors. They do this by increasing the number of shares outstanding and proportionally reducing the price per share. For example, Nvidia's 10-for-1 split last year granted each shareholder an additional nine shares, while its price went from about $1,210 apiece to about $121.               For a stock price to climb high in the first place, it usually has to have seen significant upside.               \"Stocks usually split after a consistent run of strong performance. Since 1980, companies that split have returned 28.4% annually for five years before their announcement with an average 67% return in the year before,\" the bank said in a client note authored by Jared Woodard, an investment & ETF strategist at BofA Securities.               That outperformance usually continues after the split, the bank said.               \"After a split is announced, stocks have notched 25% total returns in the subsequent 12 months, compared to 12% for the broad index,\" the note continued. \"Splits in 2024 are on track to outpace historical norms, with the average stock up 17% in the 6 months after their split.\"               Still, other factors are at play. If the macroeconomic picture is poor, stocks that split can still underperform. For example, as inflation soared in 2022, prompting Fed rate hikes and a bear market for the S&P 500, several stocks that split floundered.               \"Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked,\" the note said. \"More recently, Super Micro Computer is down about 50% since its split announcement in August 2024.\"               In the note, the bank identified a list of stocks with share prices above $500 \u2014 the most expensive 8% of stocks \u2014 making them prime candidates to split in 2025.

So, the next time you\u2019re being driven to a shoot or on a train to a location you\u2019re planning to capture, we thought we\u2019d give you some inspiration to play some games on your phone on your way. So put down your Canon and pick up your phone. In online game design, multiple elements have to fit together and amplify each other. Some players tend to focus on playability and fair chances to win, but they risk to ignore one of the most important pillars of great user experience \u2013 the visuals. Well-conceived and well-executed graphics mean more than just good looks, as they impact engagement and add to the game\u2019s identity. Since there are so many options to choose from, it makes no sense to settle for a game that is just ordinary in a visual sense. If you are one of the players who appreciate finding a beautifully designed slot game online, the following recommendations should be right up your alley. Gonzo\u2019s Quest This NetEnt game has proven to be very durable, as it was launched in 2011 but remains very popular to this day. The immersive graphic theme that takes the player through the ruins of the Mayan cities in search of the legendary El Dorado is certainly one of the primary reasons behind its incredible longevity. From backgrounds and reels to details that enrich the gameplay, everything in this game is flawless. Watching the reels made of stone spin is very satisfying, especially when coupled with audio. Of course, this slot has other qualities too, for example x 37,500 max win and lots of free spins and multipliers. Franksylvania Players who prefer darker themes will be thrilled to discover Franksylvania. This horror-themed slot game takes place in a world inhabited by vampires, with the appropriate aesthetic is consistently applied across all features. Despite depicting a scary narrative, the design is playful enough to keep things lighthearted. Animations are the aspect of visual design that pushes this game to the top of the list, as they tell the story in a stylistically very polished way. If you decide to give this game a chance, you can count on a solid 96% RTP and high volatility. Valley of the Gods Well-known game studio Yggdrasil did some amazing work on this slot game based on ancient Egypt. It has a well-rounded look and feel that uses both graphics and audio to deliver a strong thematic punch. The design is not flashy, but it draws from Egyptian history to deliver a consistent and slightly exotic visual thrill. All of the symbols are replicas of authentic elements from this historical culture including the scarab bug which has a special significance in the game. As a moderately volatile slot with RTP% of 96%, this is a solid choice for players who enjoy value propositions. Starburst This is another celebrated game from NetEnt famous for its classic look that never goes out of style. The main theme is outer space, but instead of trying to look super futuristic the game brings back memories of the arcade era. Its design is minimalistic to the core and the symbols are fairly simple depictions of jewels, which in combination with a bright grid and a dark background makes the action very easy to follow. This game has originally hit the market way back in 2012, but its interface has been redesigned since to keep up with the times. Pandastic Adventure Playing Pandastic Adventure by Play\u2019N GO is like stepping into a mystical world full of surprises. The overall graphic theme is inspired by Asian aesthetics, but it doesn\u2019t go overboard with this stylistic reference. The game uses beautiful fonts and skillfully designed symbols made out of bamboo, with idyllic scenes of nature providing the backdrop. This serenity is occasionally punctuated by animated sequences to keep things interesting. This slot has medium to high volatility, which suits players who have a tolerance for risk. Thunderstruck II Made as a sequel to the early hit from Microgaming, Thunderstruck II takes the player to the far North and lets him brush shoulders with powerful Norse gods. Its cinematic-level graphics represent one of the biggest reasons why this game has outshined the first installment and gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful and enjoyable slots ever. Animations and audio effects are perfectly integrated into the game and add to its unique atmosphere. The game has an above-average RTP of 96.5% and a wide array of bonus features, so it has just as much substance as style.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Henry David Thoreau, nineteenth century American philospher, essayist, and activist. These are uncertain times, and let\u2019s be clear, that\u2019s about as understated a way to say it as there is. More bluntly \u2013 and, journalistically, more truthfully, accurately, and appropriately \u2013 these are troubled times, chaotic times. turbulent times, dangerous times. Unprecedented times. Armed conflict and war proliferate, extremist anarchists are poised to take over and dismantle long-standing governments, heads of state are behaving like unfettered thugs, previously eliminated contagious diseases are reappearing as outbreaks, national education and healthcare systems are being undermined, startling mass layoffs are changing the makeup of the Employee Situation Survey all by themselves \u2013 and as fast as we\u2019ve ever seen, a corporate CEO is gunned down in the street and others are now threatened, humanitarian aid to the world\u2019s neediest people is being cut off, and the world\u2019s energy supply seems suddenly vulnerable. Seismic shocks are all around us daily, some predictable, some, well, shocking. Is it any wonder the stock market has taken significant hits of late? Wall Street doesn\u2019t like this. And when Wall Street ain\u2019t happy, ain\u2019t nobody happy. But what worries me more \u2013 there are other investment opportunities, after all \u2013 is the impending doom \u2013 the Sword of Damocles \u2013 hanging over the American job market, that masterpiece of a market that took only four years to become the strongest, highest performing, harmonious job market in American history. As an independent career coach and job market observer for 28 years, I\u2019ve coached thousands of clients through three recessions, one pandemic, and recoveries from each. Before that, I was a member of the workforce that weathered five recessions. I have an unusual perspective on this, and trust me, I know a recession or job market downturn when I see one coming. If things continue as they are, we must brace ourselves; this one has the makings of being no walk in the park \u2013 and it will be global. So what to do? Let\u2019s start with the premise that in times of uncertainty, the only thing of which you can be certain is yourself. There is a big implication here, namely, when the job market is so good that it almost defies logic as well as some basic laws of economics, it\u2019s a forgiving place and you can factor in a little good fortune along with your hard work and focus, but when it\u2019s headed for \u2013 or in \u2013 a recession, it\u2019s all on you. You can count on no one or nothing but yourself. That\u2019s cold and hard, but unassailably true. And that\u2019s where we are right now. As such, I turn, as I always do, to Henry David Thoreau\u2019s eternal wisdom: \u201cYou must live within yourself, and depend upon yourself always tucked up and ready for a start.\u201d Quite out of context but right on target, Thoreau would have made a great career coach, and what he\u2019d advise is to get your \u201cfive tools\u201d up to date and in prime operating condition: (1) resume or CV and online profiles, (2) interviewing strategies, (3) career planning, (4) job search strategies and plans, and (5) networking. He'd insist on two more points of readiness: (1) As anything can happen at any time, you\u2019re better off prepared than trying to catch up, and (2) Identify and hire a professional career coach; this is no time to be a solo hero, and this next job market chapter promises to be more than you\u2019d want to deal with on your own. \u201d Tucked up and ready for a start.\u201d Don\u2019t you just love that image?","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  In my family, I'm known as the one who knows how to really have fun and indulge in luxury when I travel. And this is especially true when it comes to birthdays: If I didn't see my name written on a plate in chocolate in some fabulous hotel, did I even have a birthday?          For her part, my sister is far less inclined to frivolities. But, as her 50th birthday drew closer on the calendar, I simply couldn't stand to let it go unacknowledged without the kind of blowout I'd want \u2014 indeed, expect! \u2014 for myself. So, I took over the planning and did it my way.               I gathered our group, including two of our mutual close girlfriends, for a girls' trip to Las Vegas \u2014 my favorite city for a party, hands down.               We four ladies all shacked up in a hotel room in the new Versailles Tower at Paris Las Vegas, where we had a high-floor balcony \u2014 a Strip rarity \u2014 with a knockout view directly over the Bellagio fountain. The famous fountain show, with its musical accompaniment, served as the appropriately festive backdrop while we primped and got ready to go out each evening.               Yes, of course, I brought along a \"50 and fabulous\" sash and tiara for my sister to wear on the Strip \u2014 a very not-her but totally-me demand for public attention for a milestone life moment that triggered tons of cheerful birthday wishes from passersby. (And it paired great with the matching heart-shaped sunglasses another friend brought for all of us to wear.)               First up, we headed to Lisa Vanderpump's new lounge, Pinky's \u2014 a gorgeous, gilded venue all about feminine energy and fun, with signature pink cocktails and dishes presented in opulent birdcages or frothing with dry ice.               From there, we hit the Dolby Live Theater with great seats for Mariah Carey's residency concert. It was the '90s nostalgic singalong that was perfectly on-theme for a 50th birthday bash and just what our group needed to get loose and grooving.               The following day, we started with mimosas and Dominick Ansel's famous (and famously rich) cronut pastries over brunch at March, setting the tone for a day entirely filled with bubbles until late at night.               Next, it was off to the spa \u2014 to me, this is an essential element of any girls' trip. We spent hours lounging in robes at Caesars' Palace's Qua Baths, an ancient Rome-inspired labyrinth of decadent pools and therapeutic spaces. Throughout, there were groups of women of all ages, chatting and laughing for more of a celebratory than a subdued atmosphere, and it was the perfect vibe.               That night, we hit the town again, first for an indulgent dinner at Bobby Flay's seafood restaurant Amalfi. There, we chose our fresh fish right off the ice in a market-style setup.               Afterward, we played blackjack over laughter and drinks in the casino before heading to a new nightspot dedicated entirely to caviar and live rock-and-roll music \u2014 Caspian's Rock and Roe \u2014 because nothing says \"I'm 50 and worth it\" like some fancy caviar on ice with a side of champers.               In just two days, we packed in so much laughter, pampering, partying, and fun. It was enough to fuel us all through months of routine drudgery that necessarily comes with adulting and parenting.               Overall, the trip was a whopping success and the highlight of the year \u2014 for both my sister and me. I like to think I showed my big sister that a little strategic indulgence can really ease the existential dread that invariably comes with a major birthday.               And beyond that, I know I showed her how good it feels not just to wear the birthday tiara and celebrate with epic pampering and partying \u2014 but to know there's someone who loves you enough to make it all happen in your honor, even if you don't think you really need all the fuss.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"(Photo by Daniel Zuchnik\/WireImage) Warren Buffett released his widely anticipated annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders yesterday. Investors hoped to find insights into operating performance, plans for Berkshire\u2019s cash stockpile, and major changes in portfolio composition. Here are the highlights. Berkshire Hathaway reported strong operating earnings of $47.44 billion in 2024, a 27% increase from $37.35 billion in 2023. Fourth-quarter operating earnings jumped 71% year-over-year to $14.53 billion, driven by significant gains in its insurance underwriting and investment income. Not all businesses are growing at the same pace. In his usual humble way, Buffett highlighted that \u201c53% of our 189 operating businesses reported a decline in earnings,\u201d but higher Treasury yields and strong insurance results offset these losses. Berkshire ended 2024 with a record $334.2 billion in cash, up from $325.2 billion in Q3 2024 and significantly higher than the previous year. Buffett addressed this massive cash pile, stating, \u201cWhile some analysts may see our cash position at Berkshire as extraordinary, the vast majority of your funds remain invested in equities.\u201d The growing cash pile, which rose primarily from sales of publicly traded stocks, is viewed as a defensive weapon in turbulent times. As he has done in previous letters, Buffett emphasized that this strategy ensures flexibility for future opportunities while maintaining a strong equity focus. Some investors were hoping that Berkshire would break tradition and distribute some of the excess cash as a dividend. Buffett poured cold water on that idea, reiterating Berkshire\u2019s preference for long-term compounding of capital rather than returning cash to shareholders. One of the most notable moves in 2024 was Berkshire\u2019s reduction in its Apple and Bank of America holdings. By year-end, the company trimmed its Apple stake from over 900 million shares to just 300 million, according to SEC filings. It sold another 117 million shares of Bank of America, retaining about 9% ownership. These sales contributed to the rise in cash reserves, but Buffett did not elaborate on the reasons for the sales in his note. Overall, Berkshire\u2019s holdings of marketable securities dropped from $354 billion in 2023 to $272 billion at the end of 2024. Buffett reiterated his long-term investment philosophy of preferring equities to other asset classes. \u201cBerkshire shareholders can be confident that a significant majority of their funds will always be allocated to equities\u2014primarily American stocks, although many will have substantial international operations,\u201d Buffett said in his letter. Buffett\u2019s letter emphasized his commitment to his five largest Japanese holdings: ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo. He respects that \u201cEach of the five companies increase dividends when appropriate, they repurchase their shares when it is sensible to do so, and their top managers are far less aggressive in their compensation programs than their U.S. counterparts.\u201d Berkshire\u2019s portfolio remains heavily tilted toward U.S.-based businesses, with limited exposure to international markets compared to other global conglomerates. This domestic focus positions Berkshire advantageously amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs. As of 2023, roughly 85% of Berkshire\u2019s revenue was generated domestically, reducing exposure to any potential disruptions in trade. The U.S.-centric approach has also shielded Berkshire from geopolitical uncertainties over the years. Buffett noted, \"Our preference for American businesses has historically shielded us from geopolitical disruptions.\u201d However, he acknowledged that some subsidiaries with international operations face challenges from fluctuating tariffs and foreign currency rates. Like previous iterations, this year\u2019s letter highlighted Berkshire\u2019s ability to adapt to changing economic conditions while sticking to its core principles of value investing and financial prudence. Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, CA, touts Berkshire Hathaway as its largest holding. Check has attended Berkshire meetings since 1996. When asked about his takeaways from the letter, he said, \u201cAs always, it is so refreshing to hear directly from Buffett. He is always teaching, with wisdom unmatched in today\u2019s business world. I advise everyone to read and learn from Buffett\u2019s letters.\u201d","label":0}

BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: \"An ingenious device to make your cat happy. My cat loves, loves, loves to have her head, face, and neck brushed. I do it regularly, but I liked the idea of her being able to get a scratch whenever she wanted. I put this up on the wooden side of her bed, where she likes to rub her head anyway. (I used little nails to avoid marring the painted surface.) She quickly began using it. I was a little worried that she might do it obsessively and rub all her hair off, but so far she just gives herself a few scratches. I highly recommend this if your cat likes to rub their head on things.\" \u2014Lynx Get it from Amazon for $5.53. BuzzFeed Shopping writer\u00a0Courtney Lynch\u00a0swears by this: \"Listen up, people. If your cat loves to take their scratching habit out on your furniture, you absolutely *need* one of these in your home. They're especially great for kitties who automatically take up residence in any cardboard box you bring into the house \ud83d\ude06 (iykyk). These last a really long time, so you only need to buy 'em every few months \u2014 maybe more often in a multi-cat household. It comes with a box, three scratching pad refills, and three small bags of catnip. The scratching pads are reversible, so you can flip it over once the first side is destroyed and get more use out of it. I keep one of these in the living room and one in my bedroom and my cat has no interest in scratching anything else now. Also, she loves these so much that she'll often end up taking a little snooze inside of the box!\" Promising review: \"I have a cat that only likes a few things, and she obsesses over those things. Cardboard scratchers are one of her favorite things. I\u00a0love\u00a0that this comes with three inserts that can be flipped over. Basically it's six scratchers. This will last her several months and we will be back for more when she goes through them all. Also, the price for this item was so much better than many others I see out there.\" \u2014Samantha Get the set with three refill pads from Amazon for $17.97. Promising review: \"You'd think that a piece of wire attached to half a dozen rolls of cardboard should sell for just a few cents, right? But this is worth the price. The wire has just the amount of bounce to imitate an insect's random flight, and that drives cats wild. Oh, and they love chewing on the cardboard, so alas, they don't last forever. But you'll get plenty of playtime out of it!\" \u2014Karl Kraus Get a pack of three from Amazon for $14.99. It's flavored with cat sugar, catnip, silvervine, and gall fruit, respectively.

You don't find customer service like this anymore, THE BEST!!!\" \u2014Pumphrey\u00a0 \"My elderly cat turns into a kitten around this! She has very bad arthritis (treating with pain meds) and is not very active, but rolls around kicking her feet and rubbing on the silver vine balls. It brings her happiness, and I am grateful.\" \u2014Kate Steenberg Get it from Amazon for $9.98\u00a0(also available as standalones without the board). If you have a single-cat home or have a cat who's grieving the loss of a companion, this toy can be a hypnotizing source of comfort. It's a good choice for kittens recently separated from their mother as well. Also, please watch this reviewer's video of their kitten [pictured above left] kneading and rubbing their face on the purring toy because \ud83d\ude2d it's so cute. Promising review: \"Works like a charm! I recently found myself a cat mama of an abandoned week-old kitten. I bought this knowing she needed just something to cuddle up to in her bed. Turns out it basically hypnotizes her to sleep. She crawls to it, kneads it, and eventually her meows turn to silence. I wish the purring lasted longer but for $10 it is a lifesaver. She's pooped on it a couple of times so I've had to throw it in the washer and dryer minus the battery pack. It's held up great.\" \u2014S Leytem Get it from Amazon for $10.99\u00a0(available in two styles, a blue sloth or purple kitty). I have this exact toy for my cats, and it's easily their favorite thing to play with \u2014 and they have a lot of toys. I first noticed they loved string because they tore apart a mouse toy that was basically string wrapped around a plastic mouse shape \u2014 they didn't care about the mouse, but they loved the torn apart string (aka literal trash at this point). I got this rainbow toy because I realized they really just wanted to chase long tail-like objects, and they sure do light up whenever they see me pick up this wand and know that it's play time. I love that it's long, so I can just sit on my couch and whisk it around it the area, and even my shy cat, who likes to sit further back and watch while his older brother plays (as seen in the gif above), can still bat at it. It's a super simple toy, but the amount of joy it'll probably bring your kitty is worth every penny. Promising review: \"All my cats love this! It is paws down their favorite toy, right up there with the laser pointer. I do recommend keeping it locked away when it's not in use as it is a choking\/bowel obstruction hazard if your cats are prone to chewing and\/or eating strings.\" \u2014Shields Get it from Amazon for $9.99. These lickable cat treats are such a crowdpleaser \u2014 even Chicho, who generally turns his nose up at crunchy treats, loves to get in on the action whenever I offer him one of these lil' tubes. And considering they've garnered over 34,000 5-star ratings on Amazon, it seems my kitties aren't alone in loving them. It's so easy to tear open a pack, and I love being able to feed the treat to them directly like Go-Gurt. They also came in clutch a while back when Sneaky (who was later diagnosed with a low-grade form of lymphoma) stopped eating and was throwing up from his stomach being so empty. The Churu lickable treats were the only thing I could coax him into eating \u2014 and while they're not a replacement for meals, they're high in moisture and were able to tide him over until his vet visit. And if you have to give your cats medications regularly, these can help disguise the flavor.\u00a0 And for mess-free dispensing, grab this cute spoon! I snagged it recently and it's made giving my cats Churu so much easier.\u00a0 Get a pack of 20 from Amazon for $11.99+\u00a0(available in many flavors). I owned this exact cat tree for a few years (before finally upgrading to my Mau one), and I have to say,\u00a0for the amount of use you (well, your cats) get out of it, it's a steal at this price. My cats were on this thing EVERY day.\u00a0There are sisal-covered posts along the entire height of it for your cats to scratch \u2014 by the end,\u00a0the rope was definitely starting to come apart from the amount of feverish scratching my younger cat, Chicho, did to it (which, for less than $100, I wasn't mad about). Now, there are some parts of this tree my adult cats simply weren't interested in using: the hammock on the first level, the cubby hole on the second, and the tunnel on the third. Those are absolutely designed for kittens, making this a great tree for cats of all ages.\u00a0My cats preferred the two top tiers of the tree and the side basket\u00a0\u2014 which my very thick older cat, Sneaky, curled up in for his afternoon naps every single day. I appreciated that this cat tree doesn't take up a *ton* of space either and fit very well in my NYC apartment. If you've got a couple of kitties and haven't gotten them a dedicated cat tree yet, take this as your sign that it's worth it!\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $111.83+ (available in three colors).\u00a0 I loved my Go Pet Club tree and consider it an excellent option with plenty of bang for your buck, but is it the most aesthetic option to have in your living room? Not exactly. I was ready to invest in a tree that was high quality, attractive, and a bit simpler, offering the main features my adult cats really care about: baskets for napping in and scratching posts they can claw up. After extensive market research, I realize Mau had everything I was looking for: the quality and durability, the chic modern look, and the option to replace parts that my cats will inevitably wear down with time. Also, you can purchase the cushions and pom-pom balls for your tower in different colors, with some really gorgeous shade options! (I've already purchased additional cushions in the Burgundy and Forest shades.) Most importantly, though, my cats ADORE this tree. They took to it instantly and are in it every single day. Chicho loves to scratch on the sisal rope and also climb all the way up the tree, sometimes playfully swatting at his brother napping in one of the baskets. It's been the best purchase and makes my cats so happy. So if you're looking for something a little nicer, I can't recommend this brand more! My exact tree, the Ivy 3, isn't on Amazon, but\u00a0many of their other trees are, including the\u00a0popular Cento tree\u00a0(pictured above on the right) that has two baskets, tree branch posts, and a cozy cat cave at the bottom. This tree actually has my favorite look of all of them, but since my cats don't really like hanging out in caves, I decided to opt for the style with three baskets instead. I'd recommend any of them, though, depending on what you're looking for! Get the Ivy 3 tree from Mau for $319 (available in two colors) and see more options on the Amazon storefront, including the Cento for $289 (available in three colors).\u00a0 Place it near a cat tree, and they'll be able to jump back and forth between them! Promising review: \"I recently just moved out of my parents' place, where there were screened-in porches and large windows with easily accessible views for my cat, into an apartment that has few windows he can look out of. I bought this hoping it would give him a place to look outside and enjoy an afternoon nap. He typically never uses any cool stuff I buy for him, but as soon as he figured this out he fell in love with it! I find him most days lounging in it and watching all the animals who fly or walk by. I personally decked it out with a cozy blanket and some fake eucalyptus vine to make him feel like he\u2019s in the wilderness. It\u2019s easy to put together and hang and also comes apart easily. Would definitely recommend for an apartment kitty!\" \u2014Sara P Get it from Amazon for $21.89+\u00a0(available in two colors). BuzzFeed Shopping writer Courtney Lynch\u00a0highly recommends this! She writes: \"I'll be honest, I didn't expect much when I bought this toy but I was pleasantly surprised when my cat took to it right away. She'll play with it when she's full of energy as well as when she wants some lazy playtime before bed. It comes with six balls \u2013 three solid colors and three with bells inside. I keep the three solid balls in the tower (she hasn't been able to knock any loose yet!) and the others on reserve for swatting around the house.\" Promising review: \"I recently rescued two domestic shorthair kittens and needed a variety of toys for them to play with and to keep them occupied. This toy is one of their favorites and they have endless amounts of fun with it, they\u2019re so engaged whenever they start playing with the balls. I never want to take it away from them. This is definitely a great product for any current or would-be cat owners.\" \u2014JayHawk Get it from Amazon for $9.99+\u00a0(available in 12 colors\/styles). Ava's Pet Place is a Black-owned, woman-owned small business founded by Ava, who begged her parents to let her start a business when she was just 6 years old. Today, Ava and her mom process hundreds of orders a month of their pet treats made from organic and all-natural ingredients. Promising review: \"My son's cat meows really loud. When we offer the salmon, you can hear that cat as far as next door. Keeps meowing until she is satisfied. Another big hit with us.\" \u2014Sharron B. Get it from Ava's Pet Palace for $9+ (available in three sizes) \u2014 you can also put them on subscription and save 10%! I've used this exact gate in the past and found it really easy to set up in my doorway, and it's *extremely* sturdy once you adjust the tension properly \u2014 I can't see any dogs being able to break through, and it's made of metal, which discourages chewing. I personally used it when I adopted my younger cat and needed to slowly introduce him to my older cat. The space between the bars were wide enough for them to see and sniff each other without any possibility of them fighting. I will say that once the younger cat got braver, he was able to leap over the top of it, but my older, bigger cat could not (which meant the younger cat always had a means of escape). So keep that in mind, depending on your use case. You can also install it a few inches above the ground to get some extra height. Promising review: \"I wish we bought this gate years ago since it was a constant game of figuring out how to keep the dog away from the cat's food and box. We even occasionally used a rollaway suitcase in a doorway as our makeshift solution. FINALLY \u2014 peace, cleanliness, and less money spent on extra cat food that our dog would devour every time she got a chance. Great gate!\" \u2014HillsideHaven Get it from Amazon for $39.99\u00a0(available in two colors). Promising review: \"We have a Boston Terrier who LOVES cat food but it makes him extremely sick. We needed something to keep him out but let the cats in so we tried this. It works so well, we bought a second one for our bedroom so the cats at night can come and go as they please but it keeps the dog in our room and out of their hair if they choose to wonder the house! I\u2019m not sure how I lived without it but I won\u2019t be without it now!\" \u2014Mickey Bergman Get it from Amazon for $16.94. The middle of the tube has a plush cat bed in it, so they can also take cat naps there if they prefer to use the tunnel for play. You could also lay a blanket in the tunnel for added comfort! Promising review: \"My cats absolutely love this thing! When I was putting it together, my 20-pound tabby immediately went inside the tube, and did not come out for over an hour! It was easy to put together (even with a 20-pound cat inside lol). But, this entire thing set up is about 3 feet long. It is HUGE. Make sure you have room!! The material is surprisingly soft, outside and inside the tunnel. And the light coloring allows light to filter through, which my cats like (I had a black tunnel that neither of them would go into). My smaller 10-pound tabby (black nose) LOVES to run around the house, and now he has added running a few laps inside this tunnel to his run lol. Both cats play in this ALL THE TIME. Both on the inside chasing each other, or one on the inside and one outside batting at each other. They use the tunnel as a good napping spot, and also a spot to hide from the vacuum or guests they aren't sure of.\u00a0This has gotten soooooo much use from both cats. I would highly recommend this!!\" \u2014Trebeca Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$28.21+\u00a0(available in four patterns). This non-sedating formula contains soothing scents to help create a feeling of safety and promote relaxation in stressful situations. It's not designed to be sprayed directly *on* your cat \u2014 spray it on their carrier before travel or on any areas where they spend time when stressed.\u00a0 Promising review:\u00a0\"My cat, like most, is a jerk. Seriously, she's a mean pain in the butt. However, I love her to pieces and will do a lot to make her\u00a0happy. We recently added a small rescue cat to our home, and this made my grown cat quite upset. She was charging, hissing, swatting and growling at the little cat all the time. When she escalated to pooping on the little cat's bed, I drew the line. I purchased this spray as well as a Feliway diffuser and am so impressed! Originally, I had just the diffuser, which cut the negative behavior by about 75%. Adding the spray has made all the difference. Day one, I probably went a little overboard but I sprayed it on their cat tree, beds, toy box, favorite pillows and the carpet in the room they play the most. It's virtually unscented, sprays easily, and is a generous bottle so I wasn't worried about running out. I was just careful not to spray any ON the cats, as that's a big no no. Both cats are calm and relaxed. The fighting has greatly diminished, and they can be in the same room at the same time now without supervision. It's great that I can spray this on virtually anything, and that I can reapply it as needed.\" \u2014L. Potter Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$8.89. It has a slide-in closing panel with a lock so you can restrict access when you don't want your cats going out, and the whole thing is easily removed thanks to its spring-loaded frame that lets you lift it right out of the sliding door track. Promising review:\u00a0\"Our\u00a0cats\u00a0took right to it! I figured it was going to be a nightmare training them. One of them jumped through it as I was installing it, AND I even had the main door wide open. It was hilarious! Anyway, I wanted to say that the retractable top makes it so easy to install and remove at will! It wasn\u2019t something I was looking for, but once I realized this awesome feature, I knew it was a bonus! So, I quit on installing it permanently with all the screws and went with it as is. Now, when we are going to be gone longer than a day, I can just simply pull the retractable top down a little and remove the door. I was a little bummed about the sealing, or lack thereof, where the door makes contact with the PetSafe insert. So, I just ran up to the store and grabbed a couple of different weather strip seals and put one on the PetSafe insert and one on our sliding glass door, overlapping them so they seal each other as the door closes shut. We bought the medium-size pet door because we have 15- and 20-pound beast\u00a0cats. Our biggest fits just fine. I also fashioned a bar to fit between the door to brace lock it when we are asleep or gone. Lastly, the weather stripping it came with for the back of the door is fantastic! Very simple, and the sticky stuff is great!\" \u2014Lookin4That1Thing Get it from Amazon for $161.96+ (available in three colors, five sizes, and two styles). Psst \u2014 the cat door above would work well as an entrance to this!\u00a0 It has a front door for humans to pass through for playing and cleaning and six large platforms cats can lounge on, and the roof is covered with asphalt for weather protection. Promising review: \"Once I rescued my fourth cat, I realized I had become a cat lady, so I figured I\u2019d just roll with it and buy the cats their own patio. They absolutely love their extra freedom to come and go. They watch the lizards sunbathe in the morning and spend hours out there during the night. We have the cat door in the window so just like my human kids, they are constantly in and out. Shipping was faster than anticipated. No issues with packaging, parts or assembly.\" \u2014Momma Get it from Amazon for $269.99+\u00a0(available in three colors). You can also fill it with their blankets, beds, and toys to really make it fun and cozy while they take in the fresh air. It comes with an attachable tunnel, as pictured on the right above. If your cat is an escape artist, you may want to weigh\u00a0down or stake the corners of the tent for extra security, and it's best not to leave them unattended in it either! Psst \u2014 this also works great for guinea pigs, bunnies, and also small pets. Get a closer look at it on TikTok! Promising review: \"My boys freaking LOVE this thing! Ended up getting a second tunnel so I could place the tent out into the yard more, but they took to it immediately. Construction seems excellent, and all the parts zip together to make it escape-proof.\" \u2014Brian B. Get it from Amazon for $84.95\u00a0(tent and tunnel also available separately). The sloped asphalt roof keeps water from pooling on top! Inside there's a removable divider, and the door has a PVC curtain to keep the cold air out.\u00a0 Promising review: \"This has been a great addition for our feral cat! She stays warmer inside of it with the hay I added to help close any open crevices along the edges and help with additional insulation (plus her fuzzy blankets are added as well so she has additional warmth). I also added battery-operated motion sensor lights to the opening space.\" \u2014Shannon Get it from Wayfair for $127.99 (originally $249.99). It comes with an adorable cat face mug, one soil disk, organic seeds for planting edible grass, and simple instructions.\u00a0Refill kits\u00a0are available on Amazon too! The Cat Ladies is a family-owned, southern California-based small business founded in 2015 by a mother-daughter duo who wanted to create unique, organic, nontoxic products for other passionate cat owners. Promising review: \"As far as the flavor goes, the kitties seem to find it top notch! Was tall enough after only five days; but we held off for day six to make sure 'little destroyer' didn't pull it out by the roots! The cup opening keeps the shoots tight together unlike some you buy in the pet store. We couldn't be more pleased. We ordered a refill at the same time and plan to order again just to have two cups so my kids don't fight for position. No mold problems if you follow watering directions.\" \u2014Kathleen M. Get it from Amazon for $19.94\u00a0(also available in two other styles). It can also help discourage them from hiding under furniture! Promising review: \"A must-have for ALL pet owners. This contraption is genius and will save cat (and dog) owners huge amounts of time and frustration retrieving toys. We used this beneath our oven and it works PERFECTLY. Cat can't destroy it (the way she shredded the foam insulation we had stuffed under there before) and we no longer have to get the yardstick out when literally all of her toys are 'gone.'\u00a0Yes, this is a challenge to install, but 100% worth it. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.\" \u2014Allison Goldstein Get it from Amazon for $11.98+ (available in eight sizes\/quantities). It can be charged via USB cable \u2014 it'll be fully charged in 2.5 hours, and that lasts for approximately two days of use.\u00a0 Promising review: \"My cats (kitten and adult) and my adult dogs all enjoy this toy. As long as it's on, they are playing hard. When I turn it off or it runs out of juice and I have to recharge it, they are sad and keep looking for the laser that is no longer there. When I pick it up to activate it, especially my kittens know what's coming and they follow me wherever I go with it, meaning they are waiting to play with it. Totally\u00a0worth\u00a0the money spent!\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99. It plugs into the wall, but it also accepts batteries in case of power outages. Also, you can record a 10-second clip of your voice saying something like, \"Maggie! It's time to eat!\" so they get a consistent verbal cue that they recognize. Promising review: \"We held off for\u00a0years\u00a0telling ourselves our cat would eventually accept his feeding time if we were consistent in ignoring him. Well, here we are. Wish we bought this sooner; best money I've ever spent. Plus, we can more easily leave our cat for a few days\u00a0without\u00a0worrying as much. The battery backup is a nice feature, and it's easy to program, and once you get it set up you basically don't need to do anything except monitor the amount of remaining food. My only slight complaint is that the bowl itself is a hollow plastic, so the food hitting the bowl was actually loud enough in the other room to wake us up. So we now just have it dispense onto the mat we have.\" \u2014Jen E. Get it from Amazon for $54.96+\u00a0(available in four colors, two sizes, and a Wi-Fi-enabled version). The wide design of the bowl will also help prevent whisker fatigue, which is when their whiskers get irritated from being touched or stimulated too much. Promising review: \"I have always had a problem with my one cat vomiting undigested food. My vet told me she was probably eating too fast. I stumbled upon an ad on Facebook stating the bowl position was the reason for cats vomiting; bowls resting on the floor put their neck at an odd angle and can cause acid reflux. I\u2019ve used them for about two weeks and my cat has not vomited once! It was almost a daily occurrence prior to purchasing these! I did have to rest their old bowls inside these to get them to eat. But after a few days I could put the food directly into these bowls and they did not complain.\" \u2014kindlefire09-8 Get it from Amazon for $23.99. I used to have an old fountain from this brand but upgraded to the stainless steel version this year since it's more hygienic.\u00a0Both of my cats took to it immediately \u2014 I do feel like they drink *way* more water with it around, and I love not having to stress about refilling their water bowl every single day. It's super quiet with only the lightest trickling sound (which is honestly kind of relaxing), and it gets louder when the water gets low inside, signaling to you that it's time to refill. I always do a quick clean with soap and water at that point, too \u2014 it takes no more than a few minutes. Just be sure to do a deep clean of the filter every so often, too. It pops open really easily for cleaning! Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$29.99\u00a0(available in two colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"This is the best purchase I\u2019ve ever made.

They make all kinds of adorable pet accessories and toys for cats AND dogs.  Promising review: \"The seller was super thoughtful and attentive, and most important of all our kitties are obsessed with these balls!

Highly recommend!\" \u2014Ketti Schulenberg Get a set from Simply B Vermont on Etsy for $16\u00a0(available in three styles; catnip refills also available). It's also very sturdy, so bigger cats won't have to worry about this wobbling around whenever they scratch it. The material here is sisal wood, not cheap cardboard, so it should last you a long time as well. Promising review: \"The average cat scratching post is a hideous blend of string and beige carpet that sucks the soul from any room in which it is placed. Not this one. This scratching post is sleek, well made and unassuming, blending easily into any room. It arrived well packaged and was easy to install with the hardware provided. Furthermore, it is robustly constructed and stands up to constant use by my cat.\" \u2014D James Get it from Amazon for $39.99\u00a0(available in two colors). If you have an area with a lot of plants in your home, this would look particularly cute near there! Promising review: \"It\u2019s sturdy, well-made, and my cats love it. I used some catnip spray on it when it arrived, and my cats have been using it consistently instead of scratching the furniture and rugs. It was really easy to put together. I did it by myself in less than five minutes. On top of that, it looks super cute in my living room!\" \u2014Kristin Woods Get it from Amazon for $24.99+\u00a0(available in three sizes and two base colors). This is THE cat bed, y'all. Neither of my cats have ever really taken to a cat bed and much preferred to doze on their cat tree or curl up on a regular blanket \u2014 until I finally caved in and bought the Aspen self-warming bed a while back. IMMEDIATELY upon placing it on my couch, one of my cats crawled into it and happily began napping. As soon as he moved away, my other cat jumped in to take it for a test run as well \u2014 and immediately curled up as well. After about a week of them taking turns using it (literally, the cat *not* in the bed would lay next to it waiting for the other to leave \u2014 my polite boys \ud83e\udd79), I realized I needed to buy a second one. They immediately took to that one as well, and now, they both have access to their favorite bed whenever they like!\u00a0 Whenever I put my hand underneath them, I can definitely feel how warm they are underneath, so the bed's self-warming feature seems to work well. I think what they love most about it is the shape and how unbelievably cushy it is. And the sides of the bed are supportive enough for them to put their heads on, but still flexible enough for them to stretch out however they like. While the listing recommends this bed for cats under 10 pounds, larger cats will be just fine, as Sneaky is quite large (his affectionate nickname is \"Chonky\"), and he adores this bed. Most of all, I love knowing they won't be cold at night, especially when I'm away from home. Knowing I'll never have to waste money on another cat bed that sits unused is just the cherry on top. Highly recommend!! Get it from Amazon for $21.11.\u00a0 If your cat isn't a fan of the hood on this bed, it zips off easily. Promising review: \"As a cat owner, especially the owner of an old cat, I was skeptical he wouldn't use this but OMG!! He loves this thing!!! And I love that I can keep it plugged in without it getting too hot. I have a big Maine Coon cat who's really hating the cold and he's just enamored with this. Definitely a winner! When I took it out of the box I plugged it in and put him in after 20 minutes. Once it was warm I think I had to deliberately put him in two or three times before he realized how cozy it was. It's now his #1 sleep spot. Couldn't be happier! Worth it!\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in two sizes and two colors).

My three cats have been playing with it almost non-stop, except for when I have to take it away to charge it. It took them a few minutes to realize that they had to touch it to get it to move when it stopped flopping, but once they understood it, they were off to the races. I can't speak to the durability of it, but since the cover can be removed for cleaning, I'm thinking it should last a long time.\" \u2014Amazongal Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$9.48+ (available in five styles). This set already includes two replacement butterflies, but you can also get a refill pack if your cat plays with this enough for added wear and tear. This also needs three AA batteries; not included.  Promising review: \"This butterfly toy is great and so far as I can tell, durable.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"If you take a look at the current landscape of charging accessories in 2025, it seems like everyone is doing the same thing. Every brand has its flagship 3 in 1 charger or a 140W wall charger, or a Magsafe charging brick. So what I wanted to do is highlight some products that have brought some unique twists to a product category that seems to have been stale. Let me know which is your favorite! Be sure to check out the hands-on video below to see all these accessories in action! I recently wrote an in-depth review of these, so I will just highlight the main feature that really sets these apart from any other Magsafe battery bank on the market. Below are the specs that each of these bring: The key difference between these two is that the Kuxiu K1 has a unique trick that twists open to reveal a 5W Apple Watch Charger and a kickstand. While the Kuxiu S1 has just one function, it also has a new solid-state battery tech. But the coolest feature (which both have) is that it integrates with the iOS battery widget. So when you connect it to your iPhone via MagSafe, you can see the battery level on your iPhone! The Kuxiu K1 is on sale for for $69 while the Kuxiu S1 is on sale for $79. Both available in black and a natural titanium.  Earlier this month,\u00a0Nomad released this Universal Cable. This one is super unique, and at first, I was skeptical. I didn\u2019t think I would use it as much as I did. But now it comes with me everywhere. Even though it\u2019s just a cable, it technically can charge two devices at once, and the Apple Watch charger doubles as a wireless charger for my AirPods Pro! These are the key specs to note:  The first thing I noticed was just how well-made this cable was. The kevlar really makes a difference in the overall feel and quality, and then the Apple Watch puck is the same. One cool trick is that you can charge from either side, and it will default to where the most power is coming from. For example, I can plug one end into my iPhone and then my iPhone can charge my Apple watch. But then, when I plug the other end into a MacBook or a wall charger, it switches the charge. So its still charging the Apple watch but will also charge the iPhone. Genius! The Universal Cable sells for $100, and right now, the 1.5m option is the only one in stock.  This product really blew me away because it has everything anyone would ever need. On the surface its about the size of an Apple wall brick that you would get with a MacBook Pro but can do so much more than just that.  Here is the spec list: So not only can you charge three devivces while wired in, but you can also fast wireless charge your iphone and there is even a battery bank built into it. It also has folding prongs so when you can plug it into any AC outlet and it will charge the battery bank as well as the plugged in devices.  This charger is on sale on Amazon for $74 and there is an addition 5% coupon that you can check off. This is great as an everyday carry type of charger.  This charger is great as a charging station. I use this to make sure my battery packs, my lighting equipment, my UltraHuman ring and other auxilary accessories are charged up.  The form factor and the LCD display are what really do it for me. I love being able to see that my lighting equipment is drawing 60W of power at all times, or that my ring is charging at 2W. The Nomas Charging Station is availble on Amazon for $119 but there is an additional 10% of code on the product page! This is one of those no-brainer accessories that you can throw in your bag, purse, backpack, or even your pocket. The form factor is small and portable. It charges up to three devices at once, has 35W output, and even has a little LCD screen that gives you those live diagnostic stats. Here is what you need to know: The Anker MagGo 35W comes in four different colors and sells on Amazon for $79 but there is a 15% coupon that you can apply on the product page! Now, if you need something that packs more power but is still portable, then the Ark Pro is worth considering. The form factor is perfect for traveling and what I love is that there is an included cable that attaches to the Ark Pro that acts as lanyard so it never gets lost and you always have a USB-C cable on the ready.  Here are the specs: The Ark Pro is available from Alogic\u2019s website for $129. Idea for those MacBook Pro users that are on the go!  As I stated at the beginning of the post, I love seeing companies innovate in this realm. It is cool to see how these have gone from just being a charger to now having multiple functions, form factors, displays, and so much more.  What do you think? Which one of these is something you would want? Is there a product that you use often that I should consider checking out? Let\u2019s discuss below!  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"This is the fourth entry in a multipart series. You may be interested to read about Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, and the start of Intel. At the end of 1974, Intel had announced plans for a reorganization following layoffs, and that was carried out between the time of the announcement and the first months of 1975. The company was starting the year with no debts, clear ownership of their buildings and equipment, a decent cash reserve, a large line of credit, and competent leadership. Robert Noyce was the chairman, Arthur Rock vice chairman, Gordon Moore president and CEO, and Andy Grove executive vice president. The man who had previously made Intel\u2019s microprocessors a success, Federico Faggin, had left to found a competing company who\u2019s primary focus was microprocessors, and these chips were intended to be compatible with the popular Intel 8080. 1974 also saw the company open up its design center in Haifa, Israel, and its assembly center in Manila, Philippines.  For 1975, the company increased its R&D spend by 39%, decreased its unit costs with higher production volumes, and they were barely able to sell enough to keep up revenues. The company also increased their marketing and administrative costs. The main driver of revenue increases came in the fourth quarter with 4K DRAM chips, and particularly the 2104. It shipped in a standard 16-in package, and had an access time of 350ns, and a cycle time of 500ns. Intel\u2019s location in Penang had many attributes that Andy Grove found favorable when he chose it as Intel\u2019s first international location in 1972. First, the geography played a role. The spot, a former rice field on an island in the Strait of Malacca, was easy to access, had a rather stable temperature all year, had a low earthquake risk (for that region anyway), and the biggest apparent risk was flooding during monsoons. Surely, the Malaysian government\u2019s openness to outside investment didn\u2019t hurt Grove\u2019s decision at all, but the island had plenty of people so Grove didn\u2019t foresee any staffing issues either. At about 09:00 on the 1st of May in 1975, a shorted lighting circuit started a fire in the assembly shop, within an hour the entire factory was conflagrant. Only the cafeteria remained, and of the rest, not even the steel that comprised the framing remained. Yet, God was merciful. The day of the fire, the plant was closed, and no one was physically harmed. The fire did, however, hurt Intel. The cost of the fire to the company was $2.5 million, and without the location operating Intel struggled to fulfill all of its obligations. The site manager, Ken Thompson (not the UNIX Ken Thompson), and the production director, Gene Flath, worked overtime to try and restore the location. According to Flath, work at the site during the rebuild was underway 22 hours every day. In an effort to keep Intel\u2019s overall production steady, five other locations began phasing in an overnight shift (as opposed to just day and evening shifts). To me, this is an absolutely amazing achievement. This sudden and massive logistics change would be incredibly difficult to manage for any company. The Penang location would resume normal operations in 1976 thanks to the dedication of the team there. With the success of the Intel 8080 continuing, the company wanted to produce something that would compete with mainframe systems of the time. This task was initially undertaken by Fred Pollack, but it had considerable support from John Doerr, Dave Best, and Casey Powell. Initially called the 8800, this new architecture was meant to support data abstraction, typing, and capability-based addressing in silicon with the idea being to unify the hardware and software of the system around a single set of concepts, objects, with a language similar to ALGOL replacing assembly languages with which we are more familiar today. From what I can tell, the development of the 8800 shifted to the management of Bill Lattin with Justin Rattner as the lead engineer before the project changed its name to Intel Advanced Performance Architecture 432, or iAPX 432. This was likely not long before the project moved from Santa Clara to Portland in March of 1977. If anyone has more clarifying information on this early part, please let me know. The physical structure of the 432 was realized in three separate chips: the 43201, 43202, and 43203. The 43201 handled fetch and decode while the 43202 handled execution, and the 43203 was the interface processor. These were all in 64-pin quad in-line packages, and they were manufactured with HMOS. Each managed to consume less than 2.5 watts from a single 5 volt supply. As the 32 in 432 would seem to suggest, these were 32bit parts. During these early days of development that goal was for 10MHz. Intel\u2019s revenues for 1975 stood at $136,788,000 for an increase of 1.7% but profits fell 17.7% to $16,275,000. Most the profits really came in the last two quarters. The year of 1976 was an interesting one at Intel. The company\u2019s memory products were continuing to do well in the market, with the 16K DRAM chip, 2116, being the the company\u2019s star at the time. For those needing speed over quantity, the 2147 SRAM of 4K was available offering access and cycle times of just 70ns. The company\u2019s various controllers, ROMs, and PROMs were also continuing to sell. While Intel didn\u2019t consider itself a processor company, the 8080 was an important product for them. Not only did it sell, but having the most popular CPU in their stable gave the company a certain prestige. Intel was aware of Faggin\u2019s new company, Zilog, and when the first Z80 samples came back on the 6th of March and the launch time was set for May, Intel realized they had a bit of a problem. The iAPX 432 wasn\u2019t ready. As the most complex of any CISC chip ever conceived, it was seeing significant delays and roadblocks. Intel needed something that was compatible with the 8080 but capable of higher performance than either the 8080 or the reportedly better performance of the Z80. This product was intended to keep Intel relevant in the CPU industry until such time as the 432 was ready. This new microprocessor was the 8086, and development began in May of 1976. When Steve Morse began the design, he had two primary goals. The first was to increase processing throughput, and the second was to maintain some compatibility with the 8080. For performance, the 8086 would be 16bit and support more memory (among other changes). To address that compatibility aim, he included the 8080\u2019s register set and instruction set as logical subsets of the 8086\u2019s registers and instructions. While a program would need to be translated and reassembled, this wasn\u2019t as rough as a complete rewrite. Today, many people do not view compatibility at this level to be all too important. Modern machines are powerful enough that dynamic recompilers and translators are often sufficient for compatibility, and much software is delivered in languages that aren\u2019t machine dependent. Even more, many of the programs relied upon today are web-based where the browser is more important than the underlying machine. In the 1970s, none of this was the case. Hardware and software were both expensive, and programmers\u2019 time was quite expensive as well. The 8080 had created a standard that allowed for an economy of scale, and this was an advantage that Intel didn\u2019t want to sacrifice. Even their primary competitor, Zilog, was capitalizing on that existing market, and their next major competitor, Motorola, wasn\u2019t yet a major threat. Despite the heavy focus on compatibility, the 8086 wasn\u2019t simply a 16bit version of the 8080. Conditional call and return instructions were removed and conditional jumps were expanded, and the RST from the 8008 was removed with interrupt vectors being added. The 8086 then added support for signed integers, base plus offset addressing, memory segmentation allowing up to 1MB of memory, and self-repeating operations. With the initial architecture design ready, Morse was assisted with revisions by Bruce Ravenel. The hardware and logic design were handled by Jim McKevitt and John Bayliss. Bill Pohlman was the engineering manager, and the product manager was Jeff Katz. Following on the Intellec series, Intel offered the industry\u2019s first SBC, the iSBC 80\/10 in 1976. The goal with this product was to offer the most cost-effective solution for OEMs possible. The board included an 8080A CPU, 1K RAM, sockets for 4K ROM or PROM, 48 programmable I\/O lines, an RS232 interface, and bus drivers for both memory and I\/O expansion. In March of 1976, Intel released the 8085. This was an 8bit microprocessor made of 6500 transistors on a 3 micron process using a single 5 volt supply. It was compatible with the 8080, ran at 3MHz, and came in a 40-pin DIP. It could address 64K RAM, and required just three ICs to make a complete system (8085 CPU, 8155 RAM, 8355 ROM) as it incorporated the clock generator and system controller. Late in the year, Intel announced the MCS-48 series of microcontrollers. The 8020 at the low end, and the 8749 at the high end. These were designed primarily by David Stamm and Henry Blume Jr with DTL and TTL components on a breadboard, and with pen and drafting paper. As a demo, the two used copper and zinc strips and some citrus fruits (lemon or orange) to create a battery to power an 8748 making the demonstration a bit more interesting than it would have been otherwise. The first three models were the 8035, 8048, and 8748. These chips provided 64 to 256 bytes of RAM, internal ROM (optional), and I\/O with its own address space. With those modest specifications, it will be no surprise that at the chips\u2019 maximum clock of 11MHz they achieved just 0.73 MIPS. That figure is also overly optimistic as about a third of the available instructions required two cycles, and common performance was thus closer to 500,000 instructions per second. Of the entire line, the 8048 (1K ROM, 64 bytes RAM, 27 lines I\/O) and 8748 (IK PROM, 64 bytes RAM, 27 lines I\/O) are the most famous with the 8048 showing up in the Odyssey2, Korg Trident, Korg Poly-61, Roland Jupiter-4, and Roland ProMars. The Sinclair QL made use of an 8049 (2K ROM, 128 bytes RAM, 27 lines I\/O) for keyboard, joystick, RS-232, and audio output. Many more machines would use an MCS-48 for various functions. Microcontrollers such as these weren\u2019t the most interesting products in the world, but they radically changed the world. These devices enabled automation in places that wouldn\u2019t have been economically viable in the past, and they also brought down the cost of computers and electronics more generally. Instead of bespoke circuits with large boards, a single chip with a program in ROM could be used. Design times were shorter, material costs lower, and reliability far greater. The Intel annual report for 1976 starts with an interesting note: Intel shipped individual devices that year that contained more transistors in each one than were in use globally for the twenty years before Intel\u2019s founding. That is, were one to count all transistors in use from 1948 to 1968 from all over the world, there were more transistors than that in a single product from Intel (such as the iSBC 80\/10). This is quite the flex for their production prowess. The importance of this year for the industry couldn\u2019t have been known at the time, but it was an amazing year for this particular Fairchild spin-off. The recession ended, the organization\u2019s head count grew to 7347, the company invested $32.1 million in buildings and equipment, and they still managed to increase their cash holdings. Revenues for the year were $225,979,000 (almost double their total assets) with profits of $25,214,000. Intel\u2019s 4K RAMs continued strong sales in 1977 though yields for their 16K RAMs couldn\u2019t meet demand. EPROMs saw expanded demand and sales that year, and Intel introduced a 16K EPROM (2716). A major advancement for industry came in the Intel 2910. This was a single chip codec that allowed for multiple simultaneous transmissions on a single phone line rather than a dedicated line for every call. On top of these products, the company invested even more money in their facilities and equipment at $45 million, and the company organized itself into five disctinct and self-contained divisions each of which had its own development, engineering, marketing, and specialized manufacturing capacities. Naturally, where common requirements existed (semiconductor fabrication, packaging) those were still shared at common fab and packaging sites. The company also expanded geographically once again. In its nine years of operation, manufacturing and sales were the only activities that didn\u2019t take place in the San Francisco Bay area (with the exception of R&D at Haifa). This changed with engineering and marketing at Portland. Intel closed the year with income of $31,716,000 on revenues of $282,549,000. The biggest event of 1978 at Intel was the launch of the 8086 microprocessor on the 8th of June. Just 18 months after work on the chip began, it made its way into the world. As noted previously, this was Intel\u2019s 16bit processor. Not mentioned previously, this was first of theirs to use microcode. Then, there\u2019s that 1MB of maximum RAM enabled by segmentation. To make this work efficiently, each memory access involved the addition of a segment register and offset register by a dedicated adder to keep the ALU free. The ALU didn\u2019t do hardware multiplication or division, but it did adds and subtracts, boolean logic, and shifts. The chip also introduced instruction prefetching where an instruction was grabbed from memory prior to its actually having been needed. This was implemented in the bus interface unit. The first 8086 CPUs were comprised of 29,000 transistors on a 3 micron HMOS process, and ran at 5MHz. The 8086 was 16bit, and shipped in a 40-pin DIP. While Intel certainly intended this product to be available as a standalone CPU, it was also intended to be used as an attached processor in the iAPX 432 as a part of the logical I\/O processor. Of course, releasing just a CPU wouldn\u2019t help anyone. A CPU needs to have support chips to allow it to be truly useful. This was one area where Intel delivered quite well. The 8086 could be paired with the 8237 DMA controller, 8251 USART, 8253 programmable interval timer, 8255 PPI, 8259 PIC, 8279 keyboard\/display controller, 8282 or 8283 8bit latch, 8284 clock generator, 8286 or 8287 bidirectional 8bit driver, 8288 bus controller, 8289 bus arbiter, and 8272A floppy controller. With the 8086 on the market, Intel began work on the 80286. The design was large enough and complicated enough that Intel had an employee tasked solely with maintaining an indexed box of cards that tracked which plans were on what database. Over in Haifa, Intel engineers were at work to make a cost reduced version of the 8086 and its support chips. Intel\u2019s 4K and 16K DRAMs continued to gain market share, static RAMs continued for those requiring high speed memory, and ROMs continued to sell. While overshadowed by the 8086, Intel released a 32K EPROM in 1978. Naturally, Intel released the iSBC 86\/12 with the 8086 as its processor, and the Intellec Series II which could be had with an 8086, 8085, 8080, 8048, or 8051. Intel closed 1978 with income of $44,314,000 on revenues of $400,620,000. 1979 saw Intel making still more investments in equipment and facilities, the Systems Division relocated to Phoenix, HMOS-II was rolled out yielding speed improvements of about 30% over the original HMOS, Intel Magnetics produced a million-bit bubble memory chip, and Intel\u2019s team in Haifa produced the 8088. The Intel 8088 was effectively identical to the 8086 but it used an 8bit data bus. This allowed the 8088 to be used with much cheaper 8bit support ICs at the cost of performance. WIth an 8bit bus, the 8088 required two cycles to get 16bits of data from memory. The prefetch queue was also shortened to just four bytes from six. The Intel 8089 I\/O coprocessor was also introduced in 1979. In executive leadership, Gordon Moore became chairman of the board while remaining CEO, Bob Noyce became vice chairman, and Andy Grove became president and COO. They closed the year with $662,996,000 in revenues and $77,804,000 in profits. For all of these early years, it is important to note that taxes have been effectively cutting the income number in half. Up to this point, microprocessors were not Intel\u2019s business. Intel was a memory company first, second, and last. For them, their CPUs were a way to sell more memory. After all, there aren\u2019t as many mainframes or minis as there could be micros, and all of these systems needed memory. Still, the 8080 had been making money whether or not people used Intel memories. Money making was something the 8086 wasn\u2019t doing. Sales for the 8086 didn\u2019t meet expectations, and both the Zilog Z8000 and the Motorola 68000 launched in 1979. These competing chips were more powerful than the 8086 in some of their variants such as the Z8001 which could address more memory (8MB), clocked higher, and had more registers. The 68000 didn\u2019t use memory segmentation, offered even more memory than the Z8001 (16MB), and had a 32bit design with a 16bit data bus. It was an easy transition for programmers who\u2019d become accustomed to VAX, and it clocked higher. While Motorola had never been a real threat to the 8080, the 68000 was objectively more powerful than the 8086 and could potentially take serious market share. Motorola was also a much larger company than Intel with more resources. Zilog, on the other hand, had handily taken the market with Z80, and Intel had good reason to fear Faggin and Shima\u2019s next chip. Both of these chips were getting design wins, and Intel was in third place for the year. The answer to these two serious and competent competitors was Operation Crush. Operation Crush really began in November when Don Buckout sent a message (eight-page telex) to Intel\u2019s senior management which informed them that they were consistently losing business and that there was no way to win with the 8086. Bill Davidow who ran the microcomputer systems division copied the telex, handed it out at the next executive meeting less than a week later, and added fire to the issue. He stated that the microprocessor team was killing his business unit as well. Andy Grove looked at him and told him to solve the problem. Shortly thereafter a group (Dave House, Jim Lally, Regis McKenna, Jeff Katz, Richie Bader, Casey Powell, Don Buckhout, Bill Davidow) met to design the response. Jim Lally gave posterity quite the quote: Are we doing this as an exercise to improve our position in the marketplace, and achieve the recognition that we deserve or are we doing this to fucking kill Motorola? Because the other guys are so stupid that they won\u2019t make any difference at all. The Z8000 is nothing because Zilog doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing. The 16016 is even more of a joke because National doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing. There\u2019s only one compay competing with us, and that\u2019s Motorola. The 68000 is the competition\u2026. We have to kill Motorola, that\u2019s the name of the game. We have to crush the fucking bastards. We\u2019re gonna roll over Motorola and make sure they don\u2019t come back again. As Lally not so eloquently stated, Zilog had some serious issues. Without the Zilog 8010 memory controller, the Z8000 was essentially limited to just 64K RAM, and the 8010 wasn\u2019t available at the time of the CPU\u2019s introduction. What he referred to as the National 16016 would be more recognizable today as the NS32000 series of CPUs, or the Swordfish micontrollers. These chips were meant to be single chip implementations of a VAX-11. They were, however, severely delayed and not available at the time. This meant that Motorola was really the primary competitor as they saw it, and it was Motorola who had the most design wins. If you must compete, compete for first place. They were out to crush the competition. A quick note about the name. The name for Operation Crush came from Lally\u2019s love of the Denver Broncos who wore orange and had the Orange Crush defense, love for the orange Crush soft drink, and the notion of crushing one\u2019s competition. The legal department didn\u2019t really like any of this. The key strength that Intel had in this effort was their supporting chip ecosystem. If a company chose the 8086, they immediately got access to all of the support chips and those chips were available in quantity even if not the best possible technology of the time. A chip that may be poor is better than a chip that doesn\u2019t actually exist. If a company chose Motorola or Zilog, they\u2019d need to invest a significant amount of time, money, and expertise in building out their system. Intel also had software to help. They had compilers, debuggers, and in-circuit simulators. In short, if a company chose the 8086 their time to market would be considerably shorter, and their design costs would be considerably lower. With this sober analysis of the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, it became obvious to them that it was time to sell to CEOs and not to programmers. The resultant sales and ad campaign was the largest that Intel had ever run at the time, and it cost the company $2 million. To encourage their sales team, Intel offered a trip to Tahiti for the teams (and spouses of those team members) who met their respective quotas, and in the end, all of the sales force went to Tahiti which was about another $2 million. To enhance the pressure to win, Intel\u2019s management sent Tahitian tourism brochures to the sales teams\u2019 spouses. The most critical part of the entire effort came down to people being willing to sacrifice their own departmental prestige and ego for the sake of the company-wide effort. This isn\u2019t normal in any bureaucratic organization. Grove and Noyce addressed the company and said this was the mission, and the entire company pivoted. A company with revenues over $2.5 billion in 2025 dollars changed directions completely in under two weeks. The second major thing that allowed this switch was that several Japanese companies had entered the memory business and they were driving prices down on an already low margin product. While the company\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t yet showing the struggle, people in the business were acutely aware of it. Within the memory business, Intel was now only the leader in static RAMs and EPROMs. As part of Crush, Intel held seminars on their products, and they had a futures catalog that provided some data on the next generations of Intel\u2019s 8086-compatible CPUs, namely the 186 and 286. The idea was that should one choose Intel now, he or she would have a decade of products ready to go. Intel was no longer selling just a CPU, they were selling an entire architecture of CPUs and the associated support chips. Further, the Crush team began to realize that Zilog couldn\u2019t keep up in manufacturing, they couldn\u2019t keep up in the number of products they could manage, and they couldn\u2019t match the sales force or support that Intel could offer. Meanwhile, given Motorola\u2019s size, they couldn\u2019t pivot as quickly, and Motorola had a single sales force that couldn\u2019t focus on microprocessors alone. All of this worked in Intel\u2019s favor. Operation Crush had a goal of 2000 design wins; they achieved more than 2300. Given that the 8086 was rather slow at floating point, Intel released the 8087  coprocessor in 1980. Depending upon the operation, an 8087 was able to perform arithmetic anywhere from 50% to 500% faster than an 8088 or 8086 alone. The release of the 8087 was the culmination of work that had begun in 1977 when Pohlman had initially conceived of the chip. John Palmer served as the mathematician for the project, Ravenel was the architect, and the project was later shifted over to Haifa where Rafi Nave led the implementation effort. Robert Koehler and John Bayliss were responsible for figuring out how to get instructions offloaded to the coprocessor from the central processor. With increased competition in memories, a sluggish global economy, and all of Intel\u2019s prior investments in production coming to fruition, Intel had a problem with oversupply. Despite these factors, Intel posted proft of $96,741,000 on revenues of $854,561,000. On the 12th of August in 1981, IBM launched the PC with the Intel 8088 at its heart. IBM\u2019s choice of the 8088 was the combination of several factors. The PC needed to be cheap enough for small businesses and individuals to purchase, and this would easily explain the choice of the 8088 over the 8086. Not only was the 8088 cheaper, all of its support chips were too. Then, there\u2019s the IBM directive that the PC be made with off-the-shelf components. For Zilog or Motorola, this wouldn\u2019t have been as easy; they didn\u2019t have the large number of support chips. Further importance was given to those support chips as the IBM project was only given a year, so design time was scarce. Proof of Intel\u2019s delivery of a complete ecosystem of components is demonstrated best in that the design for the PC\u2019s motherboard was completed in just 40 days. Intel had a history of successful volume delivery, and I can only imagine this too played a large part in IBM\u2019s decision making process. Intel\u2019s success with the 8080 that had already created a standard around CP\/M, VisiCalc, and WordStar no doubt also helped considering Intel\u2019s automated translation tooling. At launch, the IBM PC 5150 started at $1565. The base model included the 8088 clocked at 4.77MHz, 16K RAM, and the best keyboard ever made by humankind. With this base model, users of the computer were expected to use cassette tapes for data storage. In my life, I have never heard of, read about, or met a single person who ever used cassettes to load or save data on an IBM PC. For those with deeper pockets, the addition of a 5.25 inch floppy disk drive and a monochrome monitor would raise the price to $2880. For those who wished to part with their money as much as was possible, a 5150 with 256K RAM, a color monitor, and dual floppies would have cost around $6000. In all cases, the PC had 5 expansion slots, but the 5161 expansion chassis was also available providing space for two winchester disks and 8 more expansions slots. For these first machines, those prices did not include any software other than BASIC in ROM, but IBM was more than willing to sell their customers some software. The PC is always associated with the rise PC-DOS, and at launch this was the only OS available. CP\/M-86 and UCSD p-System became available shortly after. All of these specifications changed rather quickly as IBM released upgraded versions of the PC. Within four months, IBM sold 65,000 PCs. The PC platform, and with it the 8088\/8086, swiftly became a standard around which many other companies would bloom. By the end of the year, around 5000 products had been designed around the 8086\/8088. Intel had conquered the market, but they may not have known that in 1981. Intel\u2019s revenues were down to $788,676,000 and profits down more significantly to $27,359,000. Much of this was largely due downward pressure on memory prices and still more competition in that market, but some was also due to capex of $154 million.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  There's a pretty clear sentiment in America's corporate world these days: anxiety.          Yes, big business generally welcomes the deregulatory promise and likely lighter tax bill that comes with Donald Trump's second presidency. But the accompanying uncertainty of Trump 2.0 is also leaving corporate America slightly on edge. The president is issuing executive orders at a breakneck pace, but vague wording, court battles, and questions of legality mean the significance of these orders is unclear. Trump has promised to take big swings on tariffs and immigration, but how those swings actually manifest is in flux. Elon Musk is a similarly disruptive figure, with his DOGE staff firing federal workers and slashing funding for various programs at a head-spinning rate. Given the bum-rush first month, many corporate leaders are scrambling to gain some favor with Trump or, at the very least, avoid his ire.               In short, we're in an era of scaredy-cat capitalism. American business isn't moving boldly and swiftly \u2014 it's acting slowly and timidly, waiting for the uncertainties to shake out and trying not to call much attention to itself in the meantime.               When Trump took office in 2017, many CEOs were alarmed by his immigration and climate policies. When Trump was inaugurated in 2025, some of America's most recognizable corporate executives were seated behind him. Major companies and leaders donated millions of dollars to Trump's inauguration fund and have visited the president's Mar-a-Lago club. If companies appeared somewhat willing to strike a tone of defiance in 2017, the vibe this time around is one of compliance.               In December, ABC News, owned by Disney, agreed to pay $15 million to Trump's future presidential library in order to settle a defamation lawsuit. Meta similarly cut a deal in January to give $22 million to settle a 2021 suit. CBS's parent company, Paramount, has thus far held out on settling a lawsuit Trump filed over a \"60 Minutes\" segment, though some observers believe it's only a matter of time before it folds, possibly in hopes that the administration will look more kindly upon a pending acquisition by the studio Skydance. As my colleague Peter Kafka has pointed out, these Trump lawsuits are the type that typically would not get very far \u2014 but now that he's back in the White House, the risk-reward calculus is different.               \"Powerful companies with enormous legal resources are deciding that they're better off making a payment \u2014 in the form of a donation \u2014 to Trump than fighting him,\" Kafka wrote.               In an attempt to head off Trump's anti-DEI campaign, several companies have backed away from diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Companies including Target, Walmart, and Meta have announced policy rollbacks. Others, such as GM, PepsiCo, and Disney, have taken a subtler approach, quietly axing DEI language and programs. The US Chamber of Commerce has pulled much of the information about its Equality of Opportunity Initiative, announced in 2020 to \"help close race-based opportunity gaps,\" from its website.               This isn't happening in a vacuum: The right has been increasingly vocal in its opposition to DEI efforts in recent years, and Trump has put that opposition into overdrive \u2014 and in writing. He's signed executive orders seeking to root out DEI practices in the private and public sectors, including barring government contractors from engaging in them and asking federal agencies to identify corporate targets for potential lawsuits over DEI. The plan, according to Trump, is to stop \"illegal DEI.\" It's not clear what that means, and the underlying law hasn't changed, but it still makes companies nervous and has had a chilling effect. No one wants to be the government's target \u2014 or draw the conservative internet's ire and become the next Bud Light. Agencies may be looking for low-hanging fruit to make an example out of in order to scare others off. And regardless of what the government does, negative publicity and social media campaigns are a threat in and of themselves.               Some business leaders may remember some of the vindictive nature of Trump's first term, such as the president's opposition to the AT&T-Time Warner merger, reportedly partly because of his dissatisfaction with CNN. In an interview with Bloomberg last July, Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, cited it as cause for trepidation about a second Trump term. \"The fear is real,\" he said.               Daniel Kinderman, an associate professor at the University of Delaware who studies business responses to right-wing populism, said companies may regret cozying up with Trump and being quick to bend to his will.               \"What the government's doing is so radical that I think a lot of companies will be sorry that they got on the bandwagon or did not keep a greater distance,\" he said. \"It's not reducing their risks.\"               On the domestic and foreign fronts, the perception of Trump as a loose cannon may give him an advantage in negotiations \u2014 acting unpredictable and volatile is a way to throw, say, China off balance. But for business, it can be challenging to navigate.               \"Businesses like predictability, and that's not what they're going to get from Trump,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was the communications director for Marco Rubio's 2016 campaign. \"Trump is highly unpredictable, which creates a challenging business environment.\"               In a note on Tuesday, David Kelly, the chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said that the policy uncertainty created by the Trump administration could slow economic growth, affect hiring, and stunt investment. He pointed to tariff threats, immigration crackdowns, federal workforce reductions, and federal budget uncertainties as areas where action could be cause for business hesitancy.               \"The rapid pace of these moves, along with frequent reversals, court challenges and mixed signals on future policy actions, make it difficult for economists to assess their cumulative effects,\" he wrote. \"Also important, and even harder to analyze, is the potential for policy uncertainty to delay business decisions.\"               If you're an automaker, for example, you're staring down the potential of steel and aluminum tariffs, separate tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, and reciprocal tariffs from trading partners. Plus, you're not sure what's going to happen with electric vehicle tax credits. It's hard to know where to begin or whether to make an investment at all. At a conference in February, Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, said Trump's moves had created \"a lot of costs and a lot of chaos\" for the industry.               In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Walmart's chief financial officer, John David Rainey, said the retailer was \"not going to be completely immune\" from tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. Tariffs on imports from China would likely affect the company, too. He said that there was \"far from certainty in the geopolitical landscape\" and that Walmart hadn't calculated tariff increases into its financial expectations for the year.               Companies are tasked with laying out various scenarios of what might happen next \u2014 and reassuring their shareholders that they're prepared for whatever's ahead. Elaine Buckberg, a former chief economist at GM, has been in this situation before: the trade war with China that Trump kicked off during his first term.               \"I feel like I was doing scenarios on China tariffs back and forth, basically, until COVID came and took away all the attention,\" she said. \"I would prepare presentations the night before, and they'd be updated by the next morning.\"               Buckberg pointed to a 1983 paper from Ben Bernanke (who would go on to be the chair of the Federal Reserve) on investment decisions and uncertainty. \"If there's this irreversible investment and there's uncertainty, you'd rather wait until the uncertainty clears up,\" she said. \"And so that means you should expect lower business fixed investment, which hurts growth until this uncertainty resolves.\"               Congress and Trump will need to negotiate through at least one tax bill this year, as Trump's 2017 tax law is set to expire. Conant pointed out that this fight will be more uncertain for businesses. Congress may look to find ways to raise revenue \u2014 whether from higher taxes on certain activities or by eliminating tax credits. That could make for some winners and losers, and pit various industries against each other. \"I don't think the business community is going to be as united this time as they were last, because there's going to be winners and losers,\" he said.               To be sure, businesses are benefiting from plenty of Trump's actions, uncertainty and all. He signed an executive order halting enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies from bribing foreign government officials. The Trump administration is likely to be more hostile toward unions than the labor-friendly Biden administration and take a hands-off approach to regulation. Still, the insecurity of it all remains a challenge.               \"I've been in Washington for 15 years, and this is the most chaotic time, where there's so many surprises that are happening on a weekly basis,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, a research firm in Washington, DC. \"There's too much uncertainty for meaningful decisions to be made right now.\"               The global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which tracks news coverage of economic policy uncertainty, has risen sharply since the 2024 election. The National Federation of Independent Business' optimism index ticked down in January, though it remains well above where it was during the Biden administration. The National Association of Home Builders survey that tracks sentiment among homebuilders found that confidence fell in February. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment indexes dropped in February as people began to worry about tariffs and inflation concerns bubbled back up. As Americans contemplate the landscape, optimism remains, but reality is setting in, and it's a bit unnerving.               Across corporate America, a pervasive sense of unease is setting in. Businesses do not want to call negative attention to themselves, even on what many might consider run-of-the-mill diversity programs. They don't want to become a target of the president or of angry people of any political persuasion online. Meanwhile, they're managing an outlook where it seems like anything could happen \u2014 an executive order here, a court battle there, an immigration raid, a new tariff, an axed tax break. The feeling permeates through consumers and workers, too. If the federal government is taking a slash-and-burn approach to its workforce, what's stopping business from following suit? Many companies have been cutting their workforces. Plenty of consumers have wondered if they should stock up on stuff before tariffs take hold, and some have taken action.               Scaredy-cat capitalism doesn't mean panic mode \u2014 but it's a scenario where everyone's a little insecure about what comes next.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":". Stanford educated Soubhik Dawn, a two-time founder and seasoned product management professional, understands the abyss that confronts many job seekers. So he founded a company called Upplai (pronounced \u201cup-ply\u201d). It provides a wide range of services to help people market themselves with the tools and savvy of a seasoned brand manager. With creative use of AI, the company offers features like automated r\u00e9sum\u00e9 feedback, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tailoring, cover letter generation, the ability to pass automated filters, and other tools that boost a candidate\u2019s chances of landing interviews. Dawn says job seekers can learn a lot from the TV ads shown during the recent Super Bowl. So, what does an effective r\u00e9sum\u00e9 have in common with a good TV ad? \u201cBrands shelled out a record-breaking $8 million for a single 30-second Super Bowl ad \u2014all for a fleeting moment in front of an audience glued to their screens,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cWhy? Because in those 30 seconds, companies must grab attention, tell a compelling story, and leave a lasting impact\u2014or risk being forgotten. Job seekers face the same challenge. Studies show that recruiters spend just 3-7 seconds scanning a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 before deciding if it\u2019s worth a deeper look. Just like a Super Bowl ad, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 needs to captivate immediately, communicate value, and differentiate the candidate from the competition.\u201d Apparently, the idea is to ditch the hype and deliver value. \u201cTake the T-Mobile\/Starlink ad for example,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cIt was the most engaging commercial of the night, generating 12.6 times more engagement than the average ad. It didn\u2019t feature celebrities or over-the-top humor. Instead, it focused on solving a real problem faced by every audience (cell phone dead zones) with a simple, tangible solution. This clarity and directness made it stand out.\u201d Takeaway? \u201cDo not fill up your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with buzzwords like \u2018synergy,\u2019 \u2019innovative,\u2019 and \u2018disruptive,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, focus on your value proposition. How do your skills and experience solve the employer\u2019s problems? Make it clear, concise, and easy to understand. Avoid generic statements and focus on the unique benefits you bring.\u201d For example: What role does storytelling play in a person\u2019s work to develop and project a personal brand? \u201cThe most powerful brands don\u2019t just sell products\u2014they tell stories that resonate emotionally,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cThis is exactly why the NFL\u2019s \u2018Somebody | It Takes All of Us\u2019 ad had the highest positive emotional response of the night at 55.8%. By celebrating underdogs, community, and perseverance, their aspirational storytelling struck an emotional chord, positioning the league as a platform for progress and opportunity.\u201d  Takeaway? \u201cYour personal brand should tell a story, too. Whether it\u2019s in your LinkedIn profile, cover letter, or interview, weave a narrative that showcases your journey, values, and goals.\u201d For example: Stories stick, Dawn says. Facts fade. \u201cIf you can connect emotionally with recruiters, you\u2019re halfway there.\u201d As any alert jobseeker knows, the workplace is crowded. How can someone stand out by being different without coming across as \u201csalesy\u201d or contrived? Dawn points to Pfizer\u2019s \u201cKnock Out\u201d ad. \u201cIt stood out because it took a fresh angle on fighting disease. Instead of a conventional pharmaceutical ad, Pfizer framed the fight against cancer as a boxing match, using powerful imagery and emotion to inspire resilience. This bold yet authentic approach made it one of the night\u2019s most memorable commercials.\u201d Takeaway? \u201cDon\u2019t blend into the crowd,\u201d Dawn advises. \u201cFind ways to differentiate yourself. Maybe it\u2019s showcasing a unique skill set, sharing unconventional career moves, or even formatting your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 creatively (within reason).\u201d For example: \u201cBeing different doesn\u2019t mean being flashy\u2014it means bringing a unique angle to the table with confidence and authenticity,\u201d Dawn says. \"Those who do this aren\u2019t just seen, they\u2019re remembered.\u201d Soubhik Dawn Because a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 needs to capture a reader\u2019s attention in a matter of seconds, what role does language play? Make every word count, Dawn suggests. He points to Jeep\u2019s \u201cOwner\u2019s Manual\u201d ad starring Harrison Ford. \u201cThat ad didn\u2019t waste time on flashy gimmicks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had the second highest positive emotional response of the night at 54.2% because it focused on the message that truly matters\u2014Jeep ownership is like a lifelong adventure, where the vehicle is not just a mode of transport but a companion through life\u2019s defining moments.\u201d Takeaway? \u201cCut the fluff from your application materials,\u201d Dawn counsels. \u201cRecruiters skim r\u00e9sum\u00e9s\u2014they don\u2019t read novels. Highlight only the most impactful achievements and skills.\" For instance: Dawn says that in interviews, job candidates should avoid rambling. \u201cPractice concise answers that focus on results, not processes. Remember: clarity = impact.\u201d How can a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 transform the boring and mundane into something that grabs the attention of the prospective employer? Dawn points to another Super Bowl ad. \u201cLiquid Death through its \u2018It\u2019s Safe for Work\u2019 spot (the 3rd most engaging ad of the night) managed to present something as boring and commonplace as water as a cool beverage that anyone can drink anywhere, including at work.\u201d Takeaway? \u201cDon\u2019t overlook the fundamentals. Sometimes, demonstrating a mastery of the basics is what sets you apart. For example, you shouldn\u2019t shy away from listing an everyday tool like Google Docs as a skill. But instead of saying, \u2018Proficient in Google Docs,\u2019 say, \u2018Increased outbound sales by 20% through Google Sheets automation.\u2019\u201d In what ways is a job search a long-term campaign? Dawn advises engaging beyond the initial impression. \u201cWhile a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter are key, your job search doesn\u2019t end there,\u201d he says. \u201cThe most successful brands don\u2019t just air a great Super Bowl commercial. They extend the narrative across social media, digital platforms, experiential marketing, and long-term content strategies to keep audiences engaged beyond game day.\u201d Takeaway? Think of your job search as a long-term campaign. \u201cOne touchpoint won\u2019t cut it,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cYou must be consistently active on multiple channels and at multiple points in time.\u201d","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"The new Tesla Model Y at a Tesla store and service center in North Hollywood.  EVs aren\u2019t cheap. The only reason they\u2019re accessible to many U.S. buyers is the $7,500 federal tax credit. What happens if that goes away? The average transaction price for electric cars was $55,614 in January versus $48,122 for gas-powered vehicles, according to Kelley Blue Book. The federal tax credit, because of the size of the credit, can make the difference in closing the gap with gas cars. \u201cIt\u2019s not the raw price that needs to be addressed. It\u2019s the gap between a similar sized ICE (gas) vehicle and the electric version,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility, in a phone interview. ICE refers to internal combustion engine. The credit is typically $7,500 for new vehicles and $4,000 for used EVs. For example, the new AWD Tesla Model Y launch edition is $59,990 without the credit and $52,490 with the credit. KKB added that with the new presidential administration, it\u2019s \"likely that EV incentives may change.\u201d A change to incentives increasingly appears to be the case. Though the tax credit cannot be eliminated with an executive order and requires an act of congress, there appears to be momentum. Recently two Republican senators proposed legislation that would eliminate the tax credit. In an interview aired on Fox News Wednesday (February 18) with Elon Musk and President Trump, the President addressed the elimination of the credit saying that Elon Musk is \u201cprobably not that happy with it\u2026But this was in the tax bill. They\u2019re cutting back on the subsidies,\" Trump said. Without a hefty EV incentive, there\u2019s no telling what could happen to EV sales. \u201cIf that goes away, I think without question that you will see the impact of that in the marketplace, in terms of the rate of growth at EVs. Unquestionably,\u201d said Brian Irwin, Managing Director with Alvarez & Marsal\u2019s Automotive & Industrials Group. Irwin continued. \u201c$7,500 is in the neighborhood of 15 percent. A 15 percent shift in transaction price is a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat 7,500 dollars for many consumers will play a factor in whether or not that vehicle remains affordable.\u201d \u201cIf it goes away, all automakers are in the same position. It\u2019s very likely to slow sales,\u201d said Brinley. \u201cWe could see some automakers give some incentives to kind of counterbalance that,\u201d she said. Sam Fiorani, an analyst at AutoForecast Solutions, believes the biggest benefit is to manufacturers. \u201cToday, the tax credit is an incentive to make electric vehicles by boosting the revenue to automakers,\u201d Fiorani said, adding that \u201cEVs are here to stay. While this may be a bump along the road and may delay the eventual shift to zero-emission vehicles, the road is set.\" Elon Musk has consistently downplayed the elimination of the federal EV tax credit, arguing that it would benefit Tesla in the long term while hurting competitors. In July 2024, during a Tesla earnings call, Musk stated that removing the $7,500 tax credit could be \"slightly\" bad for Tesla initially but \"probably actually helps Tesla\" over time.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"College degrees are becoming obsolete. Employers want to see job candidates with hands-on ... [+] capabilities and real world skill sets. Traditional degrees are no longer the golden ticket to career success. Employers across industries are shifting their focus away from academic credentials and instead prioritizing hands-on experience, technical expertise and problem-solving skills. As technology evolves, professionals must adapt by continuously upskilling to stay competitive. For decades, a four-year college degree was the standard requirement for landing a high-paying job. However, many businesses now recognize that requiring a degree unnecessarily shrinks their talent pool and excludes highly skilled candidates who have gained expertise through alternative learning paths. This shift is particularly noticeable in high-growth fields such as technology, healthcare and renewable energy, where specialized knowledge often outweighs a diploma. Companies are realizing that real-world experience, industry certifications and demonstrated skills frequently produce more job-ready employees than traditional degree programs. Large corporations like Google, IBM and Tesla have already removed degree requirements for many of their roles, opting instead to assess candidates through coding challenges, case studies and technical assessments. As companies embrace this hiring model, professionals must rethink their approach to career development and focus on acquiring in-demand skills.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"TL;DR: Morse Micro has introduced the MM-HL1-EXT, a Wi-Fi HaLow router that promises to advance long-range, low-power communication. This device, part of the HaLowLink 1 series, uses the IEEE 802.11ah Wi-Fi HaLow standard to achieve connectivity ranges of up to 10 miles in rural areas and 1.86 miles in urban environments.  The MM-HL1-EXT sets itself apart from conventional Wi-Fi routers by operating in the 900MHz band in the U.S. while also supporting 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n). This dual-band capability allows the router to function as a standalone access point or an extender, improving connectivity in hard-to-reach areas. At the heart of the HaLowLink 1 is the MediaTek MT7621A dual-core CPU, complemented by 256MB of DRAM and 32MB of NAND flash storage. The radio module features Morse Micro's MM6108 chipset alongside AzureWave AW-HM593, delivering a transmission power of up to 23 dBm for stable, long-range performance. The router's connectivity options are equally impressive, with two Gigabit Ethernet ports and support for Ethernet-over-USB. Power and data transmission over Ethernet are facilitated through a USB-C port. Running on the open-source and customizable OpenWrt 23.05 networking platform, the HaLowLink 1 supports online firmware updates, making it adaptable to future needs.  While the HaLowLink 1's Wi-Fi HaLow speeds max out at 32Mbps using an 8MHz bandwidth, its Wi-Fi 4 capability supports speeds of up to 300Mbps at 40MHz bandwidth. This versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of IoT and industrial applications. In harsh industrial settings, two HaLowLink 1 units can be deployed as a wireless alternative to outdoor and remote installations, effectively replacing Ethernet cabling. The MM-HL1-EXT has already received certifications for use in North America (FCC), Canada (IC), and Australia (RCM), with Morse Micro actively working to secure certifications for EMEA (868MHz) and Asia. The MM-HL1-EXT is now available on Mouser for approximately $99. Stock is currently limited, but more units are expected to be available by April 14, 2025. Larger bulk orders have an estimated factory lead time of eight weeks. Morse Micro's journey in developing Wi-Fi HaLow technology spans nearly a decade. The company demonstrated router hardware capable of providing 2-mile coverage for months while running on coin batteries in tests conducted in February 2024. By September, that range had increased to 10 miles. At CES 2025 in January, Morse Micro showcased Wi-Fi routers capable of delivering 250Mbps over a 10-mile radius.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) is a super-charged HBM replacement for AI workloads  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  It certainly seems as if splitting from Western Digital has lit a fire under Sandisk. At its recent investors day, the flash memory specialist look the wraps off super large SSDs, with the promise of even larger ones to come, and unveiled a new, cheaper DRAM alternative called 3D Memory Matrix. At the same event, Sandisk also unveiled its High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) concept which is taking aim at HBM by augmenting it with NAND flash to cater to AI inference workloads. Sandisk\u2019s key objectives with HBF seems to be to match HBM bandwidth while providing 8\u201316 times the capacity at a similar cost. According to a slide that Sandisk shared, HBF combines BiCS technology with CBA wafer bonding, allowing for efficient high-density stacking. The company has developed a proprietary stacking technology that reportedly delivers ultra-low die warpage, making it possible to achieve 16-die stacking without major structural issues.  The architecture of HBF has been developed over the past year, with Sandisk incorporating input from \"major AI players\" (it doesn\u2019t name names, sadly). The diagram in the slide shows an HBF stack, which consists of multiple HBF core dies connected via TSV (Through-Silicon Via) and micro bumps, interfacing with a logic die and PHY, which then connects to a GPU, CPU, TPU, or SoC die. The entire stack sits on an interposer atop a package substrate, similar to the packaging design used in HBM. HBF isn\u2019t a straight drop-in replacement for HBM, but it does share the same electrical interface, so will only require minor protocol adjustments, according to Sandisk. In another slide, a GPU with HBM providing 192GB of total memory, is compared with an alternative version combining HBF and HBM that increases the memory capacity to 3TB. A fully optimized setup with only HBF (which you can see at the top of the page) can scale up to an impressive 4TB. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Sandisk's HBF roadmap (below) shows how the company sees the technology advancing across multiple generations, focusing on capacity, read bandwidth, and energy efficiency. In the first generation, HBF establishes a baseline for these metrics. By the second generation, capacity is expected to increase by 1.5x, while read bandwidth sees a 1.45x improvement, and energy efficiency slightly decreases to 0.8x. By the third generation (there's no indication of when Sandisk expects to arrive at this point), HBF is projected to double in capacity and read bandwidth compared to its initial version, with energy efficiency dropping further to 0.64x. HBF is likely to receive some push back from rivals like Samsung and SK Hynix who are heavily invested in the $100 billion HBM market. Painfully aware of this, Sandisk is looking to establish an open standard ecosystem, and also a technical advisory board made up of industry experts and key partners.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Three people in business attire speaking around a coffee table The Oracle of Omaha never invested in tech stocks\u2026 until he did. Warren Buffett\u2019s surprise move to start accumulating Apple stock with an initial $1 billion stake in 2016 now ranks as one of the greatest investments he ever made. While they had previously focused almost entirely on value stocks, Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway realized they could no longer ignore technology\u2019s growth opportunities. They had to get in the game. As of this January, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Apple had grown to $73 billion, making it by far its biggest holding and accounting for about 25% of its portfolio. Buffett, of course, is worshiped by the investment community for his genius in identifying undervalued companies, outperforming the market for decades, and turning Berkshire Hathaway from a struggling textile company into the world\u2019s most successful investment vehicle. But there\u2019s another constituency that should be paying closer heed to the approach of Buffett and other smart investors\u2014corporate heads of growth and innovation. For those execs, it\u2019s more important than ever to balance the Now and the Next\u2014to cope with the incessant demands of the moment without getting distracted from the longer-term momentum that is truly shaping tomorrow\u2019s world and their companies\u2019 place in it. And some of the best lessons on how to do this don\u2019t come from business schools or management gurus. They come from your financial advisor. Financial advisors and wealth managers tend to guide their clients with a set of tried-and-true principles: simple, yet effective wisdom that has created wealth despite market crashes, international crises, and dramatic political shifts. For sophisticated investors, these principles sound like Investing 101. And yet, most management teams don\u2019t apply these same ideas to how they manage their growth initiatives. If they did, they might be far better equipped to drive sustainable growth, tune out short-term noise and focus on future opportunities. If you\u2019ve ever sat down with an investment advisor, here\u2019s what they probably told you\u2026 As Buffett\u2019s Apple investment showed, you don\u2019t win if you\u2019re not in the game. Amateur investors often obsess over picking the right individual stocks, or stay out of the market until they feel conditions are perfect. But research has shown that the bulk of investment returns come from simply being in the market. A 2023 study by Charles Schwab found that investors with bad timing beat those investors who stayed in cash through every single rolling 20-year period since 1926. The study found that a hypothetical investor with even the worst market timing crushed the returns of one who stayed in cash between 2003 and 2022. The lesson for corporate growth and strategy leaders is to recognize that the perfect conditions for entering a new market are never going to exist, even though it may seem risky. Sitting on the sidelines waiting for those ideal conditions to fall into place is the riskiest strategy of all. If you\u2019re a carmaker today, you need to be in the electric vehicle game. The new U.S. administration\u2019s rhetoric against EVs and its aim to kill tax breaks on them may make it feel like a risky time. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the planet is warming or that governments are gradually phasing out the sale of gas-powered vehicles. Likewise, media companies need to be in the streaming game. It seemed like a scary place to be in recent years as new players crowded into the space, but we\u2019re not going back to a world where viewers watch cable and will accept being tied to a traditional TV schedule. When a financial advisor takes on a new client, they don\u2019t immediately start discussing allocation strategies and expected returns. They start by asking about the client\u2019s long-term goals. Maybe the person wants to retire early. Or maybe they have three kids to put through college. Depending on those goals, the investment strategy would be completely different. Corporate leaders need to be just as clear-eyed about their goals. Growth for its own sake is not a strategy. Saying you want more innovation sounds great, but to what end? Are you looking for new revenue to compensate for a declining core business? Or are you trying to raise your EBITDA multiple with a compelling story to the street? Innovation for innovation\u2019s sake isn\u2019t much of a goal. Leaders should identify their biggest opportunities, anticipate \"doomsday\" threats that could kill the business, and define clear success metrics. Target, for example, isn\u2019t just competing with Walmart\u2014it\u2019s competing with Amazon. Clarity about the competitive landscape shapes the right risk-reward decisions. And even beyond strategic objectives, there\u2019s the question of purpose. The best companies aren\u2019t just out there to make money; they stand for something bigger\u2014whether that\u2019s providing great customer service, bringing more joy into people\u2019s lives, or caring for the environment. One of the most effective ways to build stock market returns is to stop being alive. That\u2019s what wealth management giant Fidelity Investments found a few years ago when it studied its best-performing client accounts. Many of its best performers had been dead for years. As a result, they weren\u2019t tinkering with their holdings every time the market got scary. Of course, dying has other downsides. But the dead have the advantage of not feeling the fear that most of us suffer in the face of short-term market turmoil. The best investors are able to tune out panicky emotions and keep their focus on long-term value. As legendary value investor Benjamin Graham said: \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long-run it is a weighing machine.\u201d Great businesses have the same mindset\u2014they try and try again despite setbacks. Likewise, future-focused leaders don\u2019t let dips in sales, failed projects, or negative headlines derail them from their long-term vision. Jeff Bezos famously gave Amazon initiatives a seven-year runway, while most companies operate on a three-year horizon or less. In 2022, declining subscriber numbers sent Netflix\u2019s stock plunging over 50%, prompting many commentators to start writing its obituary. But its relentless focus on investing in streaming and global content production are paying off over the long term. Its shares are now up nearly sixfold from that 2022 low. Unfortunately, too many companies take a \u201claunch and leave\u201d approach: they try something once and then drop it when it\u2019s not an immediate success. That\u2019s not acting like Warren Buffett. That\u2019s being the corporate equivalent of a day trader. Investors don\u2019t just track earnings when deciding what companies to invest in\u2014they look at valuation multiples. Yes, a company with a high price-to-earnings ratio is more expensive, but that\u2019s usually for good reason\u2014it has a more compelling future growth story. Microsoft\u2019s P\/E ratio, for example, has risen to around 33 from the mid 20s in 2022 because its actions and statements have convinced investors that it\u2019s positioned to play a leading role in the generative AI growth story. A business valued at 10x earnings is viewed by the market as having a very different future than one at 20x. Leaders must ask what actions and strategies will tell a better story about their company\u2019s future growth prospects. Universal Music Group, for example, is currently valued slightly higher than Microsoft, partly because CEO Lucian Grange has built a credible story about its future growth prospects through strategic acquisitions and collaborations with tech platforms like Spotify and YouTube. While most large company executives can tell you what their sales were last quarter, a smaller number can tell you what multiple their stock is trading at. And they have an even shakier understanding of the relationship between the growth story they present and the multiple they achieve. Legendary investor Peter Lynch, the former head of Fidelity\u2019s Magellan Fund, swore by firsthand research. \u201cInvest in what you know\u201d was his mantra. That means that if he was considering investing in a retail chain, he wouldn\u2019t invest a cent before going to shop at one of its stores. He invested in Dunkin\u2019 Donuts after personally visiting its store, being impressed by how good its coffee was and seeing how busy they were. Warren Buffett takes the same \u201cwalking the floors\u201d approach. John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods Market, once told me that he never signed off on a new store location without personally walking around the neighborhood first. Yet many executives rely on PowerPoints and consultant reports rather than direct experience. If you\u2019re running a restaurant chain, eat at your own restaurants\u2014and your competitors\u2019. If you\u2019re in auto manufacturing, test-drive your own cars and those of rivals. Data is great, but you need the experience, too. Good investors diversify their portfolios across sectors and geographical areas in order to insulate themselves from individual company risks and ensure stability. Berkshire Hathaway owns companies across industries, from insurance to railroads to consumer goods and technology firms. Corporate leaders should do the same with their initiatives. Instead of a pipeline where one project follows another, companies need a balanced portfolio: short-term initiatives for quick wins, medium-term projects for steady growth, and long-term bets that could reshape the business. Too often, firms place all their bets on the next iteration of their current product, rather than planting seeds for multiple future directions. Even expert investors can\u2019t consistently time market highs and lows. That\u2019s why dollar-cost averaging\u2014investing steadily over time through market ups and downs\u2014wins. Yet companies routinely halt long-term investments during downturns, planning to restart \u201cwhen the time is right.\u201d That\u2019s what Ford did in mid-2024 when it announced it was scaling back its EV ambitions, citing uncertainty over demand and legislation. The long-term trend toward EV adoption is likely to make that decision look overly hasty. Businesses should maintain a steady commitment to innovation, even in tough times. As with dollar-cost averaging, they should invest consistently into projects that will drive future growth both during good times and bad. Cutting back on R&D or experimental projects in lean years is a good way of ensuring that competitors pull ahead when better conditions return. If there\u2019s a single takeaway for executives from the wisdom of the best investors, it\u2019s this: success doesn\u2019t come from reacting to the present\u2014it\u2019s founded on positioning for the future. Like Buffett, strategy and growth leaders need to remember that their companies aren\u2019t just a series of quarterly earnings reports\u2014they\u2019re bets on a future that\u2019s still at least 5-7 years away. The ones that tell the most credible stories about that future and keep their eyes on it, despite short-term crises, bad news weeks, and scary headlines, will end up with outsized returns. Future-focused leaders balance the Now and the Next. And the best ones look a lot like savvy investors.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"XRP is one of the most discussed and traded digital currencies online. What lies ahead for XRP in ... [+] 2025? Few digital assets spark as much debate as XRP. Some see it as the future backbone of cross-border payments: faster and more cost-effective than traditional methods, while others question its underlying value and long-term viability. Uncertainty surrounding XRP\u2019s regulatory situation and its close association with the fintech company Ripple only adds to the intrigue. Yet, beyond the controversies, one undeniable reality remains: XRP is among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and any potential shift in its utility can significantly impact its price. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the fundamental question of what truly gives XRP its worth, examining how Ripple\u2019s ongoing forays into central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), stablecoins and other initiatives could shape the token\u2019s trajectory. While a hint of skepticism is warranted, especially amid fierce competition and mounting legal scrutiny, there are genuine signals that XRP\u2019s use cases may continue to expand including the recent launch of the first global XRP ETF which was launched in Brazil earlier in February. Ultimately, the goal is to offer a balanced view of the forces propelling XRP forward and the obstacles that may stand in its way so that readers can form a clearer perspective on its price outlook through 2025. Before delving deeper into XRP\u2019s price dynamics, it\u2019s helpful to understand how Ripple itself operates. Ripple is a fintech company that provides software solutions for cross-border payments, primarily targeting financial institutions and payment providers. Instead of relying on potentially slow, expensive bank-to-bank transfers, Ripple offers an alternative settlement infrastructure, RippleNet, that aims to reduce transaction times and fees by leveraging blockchain technology. Ripple\u2019s clients include several financial players, including major banks and remittance operators, who seek faster, more efficient ways to move money across borders. Where XRP fits into this picture is as a bridging asset on RippleNet. In theory, XRP can be used to source liquidity on demand, letting financial institutions convert one currency into XRP and then from XRP into another currency, all in near real-time. This on-demand liquidity (ODL) model can appeal to firms looking to free up capital otherwise tied up in pre-funded accounts worldwide. However, not all of Ripple\u2019s partners choose to use XRP, some may use Ripple\u2019s software suite without relying on the token. Whether the market and regulatory environment will favor widespread adoption of XRP in these cross-border channels remains one of the biggest unanswered questions shaping its future value. One of the most frequently leveled criticisms at XRP is its somewhat opaque relationship to Ripple, the fintech company behind much of XRP\u2019s enterprise adoption. For purists in the crypto community, the reliance on Ripple\u2019s business development and partnerships raises doubts about XRP\u2019s actual decentralization. They question whether market demand for XRP is organically driven by real-world usage or primarily sustained by speculation and promotional campaigns. Ongoing regulatory scrutiny has only magnified this tension, especially in the United States, where debates persist over whether XRP should be classified as a security. Adding to the skepticism is the concern that XRP\u2019s purported use cases, namely, cross-border payments and liquidity solutions, are increasingly contested by emerging stablecoins and even central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Critics argue that if national monetary authorities release their own digital currencies or private stablecoins continue to capture market share, the utility of XRP might diminish. This prompts a key question: if Ripple\u2019s technology can function just as effectively with other digital assets or fiat-backed instruments, will XRP remain integral to the broader vision Ripple has laid out? For now, that doubt underscores why many investors remain uncertain about the token\u2019s intrinsic value, demanding more concrete evidence of sustained, widespread usage. Ripple\u2019s value proposition extends well beyond simply facilitating cross-border payments. Over the years, the company has sought to fortify the XRP ecosystem through various initiatives, from forging partnerships with traditional banks and remittance providers to investing in blockchain start-ups that could integrate XRP into their platforms. Proponents argue these strategic moves signal Ripple\u2019s commitment to broadening XRP\u2019s utility, offering real-world backing for its perceived value. Yet, for all the headline-grabbing announcements, the actual market adoption of XRP\u2019s liquidity solutions can be difficult to figure out. While Ripple has released pilot programs related to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), there is no guarantee these efforts will translate into widespread usage of XRP itself. Indeed, some central banks exploring Ripple\u2019s technology may opt to build proprietary digital tokens or use stablecoins backed by fiat, thus sidestepping the need for a volatile cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, these partnerships and proofs-of-concept underscore the potential for XRP to evolve alongside new financial infrastructures, if that is, Ripple can convert interest into concrete demand for XRP-based solutions. A few factors will likely shape XRP\u2019s market performance in 2025. While the token\u2019s price is partly driven by general crypto sentiment, certain XRP-specific developments carry significant weight, especially given Ripple\u2019s active role in expanding its use cases and engaging with regulators. Below are four key factors that could determine whether XRP experiences another surge or faces continued headwinds in 2025. Perhaps the most urgent question for XRP is how it will fare under shifting regulations, particularly in the U.S. Ongoing legal battles, including those involving Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could establish precedents that either encourage or stifle institutional usage of XRP. A favorable ruling may propel new listings on major exchanges, while an adverse outcome could limit access to both retail and corporate investors. Beyond regulatory considerations, real-world adoption by banks, fintechs and payment processors is essential for XRP\u2019s longevity. Ripple\u2019s partnerships, pilot projects and the integration of XRP into liquidity solutions all matter here. If these entities use XRP for cross-border remittances or treasury management, the token could gain steady transactional volume, potentially stabilizing price fluctuations. However, if companies opt for private, permissioned versions of the technology that bypass XRP, its demand could stall. XRP\u2019s speed and typically low transaction fees are often touted as major advantages. Yet the broader crypto landscape continues to evolve, with new blockchains and Layer-2 solutions vying for dominance. Ripple\u2019s development roadmap must keep pace to remain competitive, whether through protocol upgrades that enhance scalability and privacy or by building interoperability bridges that connect XRP to other major blockchains. Such innovations can reinforce investor confidence and stimulate new use cases. As with most digital assets, XRP\u2019s price is also influenced by broader economic and crypto market conditions. Factors like global interest rates, inflation and investor risk appetite often drive capital flows into and out of cryptocurrencies. Bull markets could accentuate any positive developments around XRP, while economic downturns or crypto-specific bear cycles may overshadow even the most promising Ripple initiatives. Keeping a close eye on macro signals is crucial for anyone looking to understand XRP\u2019s price trajectory. At this stage, XRP\u2019s path forward looks far from linear. A variety of outcomes, both bullish and bearish, will hinge on how effectively Ripple can convert its partnerships, regulatory battles and technology upgrades into tangible adoption of XRP. While no single factor will likely make or break XRP\u2019s prospects, the interplay between regulatory clarity, institutional usage and broader market cycles could propel the token in different directions. In reality, XRP\u2019s price trajectory may fall somewhere between these extremes. Even a moderately positive resolution of regulatory issues and a handful of successful implementations in cross-border payments or digital currency initiatives could sustain, and potentially boost, XRP\u2019s market presence. Conversely, a sequence of unfavorable legal outcomes or missed opportunities in the face of rising competition may see XRP struggle to recapture past highs. The key takeaway is that XRP\u2019s long-term value depends less on headlines and more on definitive, widespread usage that validates its role in the evolving financial ecosystem. Ripple\u2019s ongoing exploration of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoin initiatives represents a potentially game-changing frontier for XRP. The core premise is that XRP\u2019s infrastructure could serve as a bridge currency, smoothing transactions between newly launched digital fiat currencies and existing crypto assets. If various central banks worldwide roll out their own digital tokens, a neutral settlement asset like XRP might unify these disparate systems by facilitating near-instant cross-border transfers. In that scenario, Ripple\u2019s established relationships with financial institutions could lend XRP additional credibility, making it more attractive to risk-averse partners and potentially enhancing liquidity. However, significant challenges remain. Many central banks may develop closed-loop systems or issue fiat-backed digital currencies rather than rely on a volatile third-party token. Likewise, private sector stablecoins could gain the trust of corporations and government entities by demonstrating strong regulatory compliance and minimal price fluctuation, reducing the perceived need for XRP. Collaborations with policymakers also demand stringent oversight. Any lingering legal or structural uncertainty surrounding XRP could deter central banks from integrating it directly into their digital currency frameworks. While the opportunity for XRP to act as an intermediary in a rapidly evolving digital financial system is compelling, Ripple must prove that the token\u2019s speed, cost-efficiency, and interoperability justify its inclusion over less volatile alternatives. XRP\u2019s price potential ultimately hinges on its ability to demonstrate genuine utility in the face of formidable competition and frequent bouts of regulatory uncertainty. While the token\u2019s performance has traditionally followed the broader ebbs and flows of the crypto market, XRP\u2019s fate is more closely tied than many realize to Ripple\u2019s ongoing legal entanglements and its success in persuading banks, fintechs, and payment processors to integrate XRP for real-world transactions. Investors who believe in XRP\u2019s long-term prospects may point to the ongoing development of cross-border payment solutions, pilot CBDC initiatives, and attempts to cultivate stablecoin partnerships as signs that Ripple is committed to solidifying XRP\u2019s place in the global financial infrastructure. However, skepticism remains justified, as it is unclear whether governments, central banks, or large corporates will embrace an externally managed asset like XRP over proprietary or fully fiat-backed systems. Consequently, XRP\u2019s near- to mid-term pricing will likely be a barometer for its actual adoption; if transaction volumes remain modest and legal challenges persist, it may struggle to maintain bullish momentum. Conversely, visible progress in regulatory resolutions and corporate usage could help stabilize the token\u2019s reputation and foster renewed investor confidence. Bottom Line XRP\u2019s ongoing journey straddles the line between ambitious, real-world adoption goals and doubts about its utility. Regulatory clarity, significant institutional partnerships and meaningful use cases, particularly concerning CBDCs and stablecoins, remain pivotal to shaping the token\u2019s trajectory. While some see a streamlined, widely adopted liquidity tool on the horizon, others await more concrete evidence before considering XRP a sustainable, long-term value proposition. For investors, the key lies in watching the data behind the headlines. Actual transaction volume, corporate integrations, and evolving regulatory positions will speak louder than market hype alone. Should Ripple successfully convert partnerships into tangible growth opportunities, XRP could see its role expand in the broader crypto market. If not, the crypto landscape\u2019s rapid innovation and stiff competition may eclipse XRP\u2019s once-promising narrative, leaving skeptics with the last word. Regulatory clarity, especially in key markets like the U.S., will be crucial, alongside the level of real-world adoption by financial institutions and payment providers. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions, crypto market sentiment, and Ripple\u2019s success in expanding XRP\u2019s ecosystem (such as through CBDC initiatives) will all play a significant role. XRP was designed primarily for fast cross-border payments and liquidity management, setting it apart from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (positioned as \u201cdigital gold\u201d) or Ethereum (focused on smart contracts). However, it faces competition from newer, faster networks and stablecoins that offer similar benefits without the volatility risks. Key risks include ongoing legal scrutiny, the potential for regulatory setbacks and volatility driven by speculative trading. Investors should also consider the pace of adoption: If real-world usage lags and competing solutions outpace XRP, its long-term prospects may suffer. Most investors buy XRP through a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that supports fiat or crypto deposits, then transfer their holdings to a secure wallet. As always, it\u2019s wise to diversify across multiple assets, stay informed on regulatory developments, and only invest money you can afford to lose.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, arrives for a House Financial Services Committee ... [+] hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025.

The minutes from the FOMC\u2019s last meeting in January stated that, \u201cRespondents generally judged that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed.\u201d That implies any cuts may come later in 2025, if at all. In addition, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, \u201cIf the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer,\u201d in congressional testimony on February 11. Recent economic data has supported the FOMC holding rates steady. The jobs market has continued to show momentum. That means there\u2019s little impetus for interest rate cuts to support job growth. In contrast, inflation is running closer to 3% than the FOMC\u2019s target of 2%, based on data to January 2025. That slightly elevated inflation is causing the FOMC to hold interest rates at higher levels. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said. \u201cAt our latest meeting in January, I supported the decision to hold the policy rate steady. I see this as appropriate, given that the downward risks to employment have diminished but upside risks to inflation remain,\u201d at a speech on February 20. Fixed income markets imply that one or two interest rate cuts are possible in 2025, but that there may not be another rate cut until summer, perhaps at the FOMC\u2019s June or July meeting. That\u2019s according to the CME FedWatch tool which tracks the implicit projections of fixed income markets. Even though a rate cut is highly unlikely in March, at that meeting the FOMC will update their own projections for economic data including interest rates. That may help reveal the FOMC\u2019s latest thinking. Nonetheless, much will depend on how jobs and inflation data trends over the coming months. If inflation moves closer to 2% or the job market were to weaken, then the FOMC could quickly move to cut interest rates. Tariffs may complicate the FOMC\u2019s decision making in 2025, too. The scope of tariffs remain unclear currently, beyond Chinese tariffs many tariffs are proposed but not yet implemented. It may be that the FOMC elects to looks through any one-time increase in prices caused by tariffs. However, if there were a broader trade war or if firms used tariffs as a way to raise prices across a broader range of goods and services, then the FOMC may react to those broader economic implications. The markets view it as extremely unlikely that the FOMC cuts interest rates in March. However, if inflation does cool over the coming months, or the jobs market were to soften, then the FOMC may well cut interest rates by the summer. For now, there is significant uncertainty around economic outcomes given government policy. Currently, it is expected that interest rates decline in 2025, but unclear by how much. One or two cuts are seen as most likely in 2025, but they most likely won\u2019t start until the summer.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Successful nuclear energy companies have proven business models, substantial liquidity and recurring ... [+] cash flow to support capacity expansion and innovation. Investors are excited about the nuclear energy outlook. Energy demand is on the rise, partly due to the rapid buildout of AI data centers. These technology campuses can use as much electricity as small cities. Nuclear energy is an appealing option for serving increased power demand because it has low carbon emissions and cost advantages relative to wind and solar power. If you expect nuclear energy companies to capitalize on the growing need for cheap, clean energy, then read on. The five best nuclear energy stocks introduced below may be worth a look for your portfolio. These nuclear energy stocks were selected by screening on the following criteria: The table below includes five U.S.-listed nuclear energy stocks that meet the above criteria, plus the market capitalization and business focus for each. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025 and best growth stocks. Vistra generates power and provides electricity to households and businesses around the country. The company operates natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar assets and battery energy storage facilities. With a total capacity of about 41,000 megawatts, Vistra is one of the largest power producers in the U.S. Vistra has been increasing and protecting its nuclear capacity by acquiring the minority interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary and extending licenses at two owned nuclear facilities. The company created Vistra Vision with an 85% ownership position after purchasing nuclear and retail assets from Energy Harbor in 2023. Vistra has great liquidity and an active share repurchase program. The third quarter 2024 balance sheet included $905 million of cash and equivalents plus nearly $2.5 billion in availability on a revolving credit facility. Share repurchases over the last three years have totaled $4.58 billion. The company has reduced its share count by 30% in that time, achieving a buyback yield over 7%. Vistra also pays a small dividend yield of 0.52%. GE Vernova is a clean energy spin-off from General Electric (GE). The company generates, transfers, converts and stores electricity in the U.S. and globally. GEV's power portfolio includes products and services for gas, nuclear, hydro and steam power generation. Since spinning off from GE in 2023, GEV has turned a profit and more than tripled its free cash flow. The company has also published a promising five-year outlook. GEV\u2019s 2028 guidance includes $45 billion in revenue and $14 billion in free cash flow. This represents substantial growth from the 2024 results of $1.4 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in free cash flow. Capacity expansions and rising EBITDA margins across the power, electrification and wind businesses will be key profit drivers. Nuclear will play a role in GEV's growth. The company's alliance GE Hitachi produces the BWRX-300 small modular reactor, which offers scale and size advantages. Specifically, the reactor can be constructed in 36 months and requires a much smaller plant footprint than other options. The BWRX-300 will be deployable globally as early as 2029. Talen Energy sells electricity produced by its nuclear, fossil, solar and coal power plants. The company's power generation capacity is approximately 10.7 gigawatts, including 2.2 gigawatts of nuclear power. Talen Energy has a relationship with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division AWS. The power company sold a nuclear-powered data center campus to AWS in 2023. Talen also signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with AWS. In November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) blocked the PPA due to transparency issues. Talen has subsequently filed a lawsuit against the ruling. Despite the FERC disagreement, the investment community is excited about Talen\u2019s ability to supply carbon-free power to data centers. Analysts expect a revenue dip for Talen in 2025, followed by four years of double-digit growth. The average revenue growth expectation in 2026 is nearly 93%. The company also has a strong share repurchase program and good liquidity. The share repurchase target is 70% of adjusted free cash flow. At September 30, 2024, Talen had $648 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. BWX Technologies supplies nuclear components and services, primarily to the U.S. government. The offering includes naval nuclear reactors, commercial nuclear components and nuclear facility management. BWXT recently announced it would acquire Kinetrics, a leading nuclear services company. The acquisition, to close mid-2025, should add $300 million to BWX\u2019s commercial segment. This complements the company's government business, which recently secured $2.1 billion in new naval nuclear contracts. Strength in the company\u2019s government business drove 14% revenue growth and 15% GAAP EPS growth in the third quarter 2024. The company raised its full-year 2024 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the strong performance through the third quarter. The consensus price target for BWXT is $127.50, 18.4% higher than the stock\u2019s current value. Centrus Energy provides uranium enrichment and nuclear reactor engineering services. Nuclear reactors require enriched uranium fuel, which has a higher concentration of the uranium-235 isotope. LEU is the only U.S.-owned, U.S.-technology uranium enrichment company. Centrus\u2019s leadership team believes this is an advantage in winning U.S. federal contracts. The future opportunity in federal work could be substantial. There is currently $3.4 billion in federal funding already approved by Congress. However, $700 million of that is appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which President Trump paused by an executive order in January. Centrus already has multiple contracts with the Department of Energy, including one with a recently expanded Phase 2 contract value of $129 million. The company has sales momentum, too. 2024 revenue grew 38% to $442 million. However, higher cost of sales led to a profit decline in the period. Centrus does have a $3.7 billion backlog that extends to 2040. Bottom Line Nuclear companies are uniquely positioned to provide cost-effective, low-carbon energy to power the future. The ones that will rise to the top\u2014whether they're power generators, reactor and component makers or service providers\u2014will have proven business models, substantial liquidity and recurring cash flow to support capacity expansion and innovation.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-23","content":" \t\t\t\t\tBy Stewart Clarke    Cathy Payne knows the distribution market as well as any exec in the international business.  \tShe headed up Southern Star International, which was bought by Endemol in 2009. It merged with Shine in 2015 before Banijay acquired Endemol Shine in 2020. Payne is now CEO Banijay Rights, the distribution arm of that huge business, which has a catalog of more than 200,000 hours including Black Mirror, Big Brother and Survivor.   \t\u201cWe\u2019re big, but we want to keep that feeling we always had when we were small,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always worked in companies where production and distribution were integrated. When we started off in Australia, we always had to think about how we were going to get anything funded, we always had to find a way.\u201d  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tAcquisitions \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Safe Harbor': ITV Among Buyers Of Drug Trade Drama From 'Ozark's Mark Williams -- London TV Screenings\t\t \t\t\t                \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tBBC Studios & Orient International Making 3D Giant Screen Version Of Natural History Series 'Asia'\t\t \t\t\t        \tPayne has been part of the evolution of the international TV business and has seen seismic M&A deals from the inside. She speaks to Deadline during a trip to her native Australia, before heading back in time for the London TV Screenings.     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \t\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the recalibration of the streamers but we\u2019re still working through a lot of big corporate consolidation,\u201d Payne says when asked about what\u2019s shaping the international industry. She notes that distributors are waiting to see the consequences, at a buying level, of the Skydance and Paramount Global merger, and the impact of NBCUniversal and others separating linear and non-linear assets.  \tBanijay Rights response to the industry change? \u201cIt\u2019s been a very challenging market. It becomes about your strength as an organization to come up with creative solutions that can help make things happen that may not have happened otherwise.\u201d  Drama\u2019s New Reality  \tWith money tight and commissions thin on the ground in many places, making things happen in high-end scripted TV is a puzzle. The UK especially is feeling the pinch. Many projects are in limbo; they have been commissioned but cannot square off their funding.  \tPayne acknowledges it\u2019s tough out there but spies some green shoots. The question, she says, becomes how to make shows with the money that is available.  \t\u201cIt\u2019s about how do you find a different production model. Not every show has to cost a fortune to be successful. I was really pleased to see a show like Baby Reindeer, putting aside any controversy. It wasn\u2019t expensive, it was just a really good show. It spoke to the audience.  \t           \t\u201cWe just have to find a way to make things work because we can\u2019t complain about what we had. The market is what it is.\u201d  \tBanijay prodco Mam Tor is making Half Man, Baby Reindeer writer and star Richard Gadd\u2019s new show for the BBC and HBO. Payne\u2019s team will take it to market. With the London Screenings kicking off, the distributor\u2019s key scripted titles include a contemporary take on detective classic Maigret, and a new version of vintage British series Bergerac. Banijay bought Caryn Mandabach Productions last year and Banijay Rights shops Steven Knight\u2019s ever-popular Peaky Blinders internationally.  \t\u201cThere will always be those shows that people really want, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a big influx of new money for co-productions,\u201d Payne says of the wider drama scene. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to wake up and find it\u2019s 2021 again.\u201d  \tDistributors are being asked to fill bigger funding gaps in return for rights, but ultimately, the numbers need to stack up.  \t\u201cThere are certain shows where you might take a longer-term view, but at the end of the day you can only invest what you think you can make back,\u201d is Payne\u2019s take. \u201cI really like content; I like to read it and I\u2019m very passionate about it. I also like the sales process, and the sales process is sophisticated and creative.  \t\u201cDistribution can\u2019t invest to fill the gaps and then lose money.\u201d  Scripted Gloom, Unscripted Boom?  \tThe swings and roundabouts of the international business mean that when drama production is challenged it can mean an uptick in unscripted. But that part of the business is facing its own tests.  \t\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been as much of that mid-price-point factual entertainment commissioned from the UK, but there have been more formats commissioned,\u201d the Banijay distribution boss says. \u201cFor us, the entertainment formats, especially the well-known titles and the franchises continue to do well; our MasterChefs and Survivors.  \t\u201cHow they\u2019re rejuvenated is part of their success, how you work out different production models that mean you can make Survivor for a market like Hungary and also make it for a market like Australia. We\u2019ve got some MasterChef deals where we\u2019ve never sold it before, there are still new markets being broken.\u201d  \tPayne says the Discovery channels are ordering less, which is an issue. \u201cThere used to be a lot of factual programming commissioned from there, especially from a lot of UK producers, where a distributor like us would put up the rest of the money. A lot of that commissioning has just stopped. It\u2019s been very difficult for some of those producers. They\u2019re really reliant on royalties from catalog deals to help them sustain.\u201d  \tWith a deal for Mythbusters outfit Beyond International, Banijay Rights added 8,000 hours to its own catalog and Payne says size matters. \u201cIn distribution, it\u2019s either the big or the boutique, but the middle is expensive. If you\u2019re boutique, you can have really low overheads. Once you start getting into that mid range, the overheads between a company turning over 250 million and 150 million are not that much different.\u201d  \tHaving an enormous library also opens up direct-to-consumer opportunities for distributors, such as rolling out FAST channels. It\u2019s an area Banijay Rights has been moving into. The most attention-grabbing launch has been a Mr Bean: The Animated Series\u00a0channel.  \t           The London Look  \tBanijay was one of the quartet of distribs behind London TV Screenings. What started as a moment to capitalize on BBC Studios bringing buyers to town for its Showcase event has grown into a must-attend fixture in the calendar.  \tBanijay rolls into the Screenings with the aforementioned Maigret, a doc on the 7\/7 London Bombings and a new dating format, 30 Dates 30 Nights, among its key priorities across drama, factual, entertainment.  \tFor Payne, the February get-together with buyers \u201cis more than a trade market.\u201d She adds: \u201cPeople come and sit and take time. Like the LA screenings, you\u2019re actually watching shows.\u201d  \tSigning off, Payne boss reflects on her roles atop the distribution biz and running Banijay Rights. \u201cI want to make sure that it\u2019s set up for good succession, someone else will lead the business at some point.\u201d That is something for her to ponder, but not for a while yet, she is quick to add: \u201cNot that I\u2019m intending to go anywhere right now.\u201d Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Chinese car and battery manufacturer BYD apparently already produced its first solid-state cells last year. The source for this is not an anonymous informant, but the company's Chief Technology Officer. However, BYD does not expect series production in the near future. According to Chinese media, Sun Huajun, CTO of BYD\u2019s battery business, stated at a forum event on solid-state batteries that the company had already produced its first solid-state cells with 20 Ah and 60 Ah on its pilot production line in 2024. The portals CN EV Post and Car News China reported on this based on a video recording of the presentation. According to the battery business CTO, BYD expects to start \u201cmass demonstration\u201d of solid-state batteries around 2027. However, he did not provide any information on the number of prototype cells produced to date. And even after the demonstration applications, there are no plans to start series production in the near future: A truly large-scale introduction of solid-state batteries could possibly only take place after 2030, Sun is quoted in the reports. Sun also does not expect the technology to be used by its competitors any earlier than this. \u201cLooking at the industry as a whole, different players are making about the similar progress,\u201d Huajun said. In fact, Wu Kai, Chief Scientist at CATL, stated at an event in April 2024 that battery market leader CATL plans to produce the first solid-state cells in small quantities in 2027 \u2013 similar to BYD. However, there will still be problems with producing large quantities, including in terms of costs, according to Wu. In the technical presentation, Sun also announced that BYD is focussing on sulphide electrolytes in the development of solid-state cells \u2013 apparently driven by \u201ccost and process stability considerations.\u201d According to the BYD manager, the costs for solid-state cells with sulphide electrolytes could theoretically reach a comparable level to today\u2019s NCM cells with liquid electrolyte level of scale of use. However, the quantities are still too small \u2013 especially for sulphide electrolytes: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense to talk about cost in the absence of volume.\u201d Other technology paths for solid-state cells are oxides and polymers. According to a report from November 2024, CATL is also said to have opted for sulphides. In theory, replacing the current liquid electrolyte in a battery cell with a solid offers a number of advantages. As the flammable liquid electrolyte is no longer required, solid-state cells are generally safer. At the same time, higher energy densities and more power are possible, resulting in a longer range and shorter charging times. Although many companies and institutions have been working on the technology for years due to these advantages, battery cells with \u2018real\u2019 solid electrolyte are still very rare \u2013 as BYD\u2019s timetable also suggests. A semi-solid, gel-like electrolyte, also known as a solid, is already being used in some cases. However, this is actually a so-called \u2018semi-solid-state battery\u2019 (SSSB), while BYD and CATL use \u2018all-solid-state batteries\u2019 (ASSB) with an actual solid electrolyte. BYD is best known today for its blade batteries with LFP cell chemistry. These lithium iron phosphate cells are considered to be more robust and cheaper than cell chemistries based on nickel and cobalt, but generally have a lower energy density. In its report, Car News China quotes Sun as well as Lian Yubo, BYD\u2019s chief scientist, chief engineer for motor vehicles and dean of the Automotive Engineering Research Institute. \u201c\u201cSolid-state batteries will be mainly used in high-end models, empowering each other with lithium iron phosphate batteries, and used in vehicles of different levels,\u201d said Lian, who expects LFP cells to be used for at least another 15 to 20 years. cnevpost.com, carnewschina.com Your email address will not be published.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Classic Beef Barley Soup is a comforting, hearty soup made with carrots, celery, onions, beef, and pearl barley. It\u2019s also high-protein, high-fiber and freezer-friendly! This easy beef barley soup is a one-pot meal that\u2019s high protein and high-fiber, and simple to make. But it takes a little over an hour for the meat to get tender, so I like to make this on the weekend or when I have more time. The pressure cooker is perfect to speed up the process, so I also included Instant Pot instructions which cuts the cook time in half. More soup recipes with beef that are also popular here, try my\u00a0Stuffed Pepper Soup, Acini Di Pepe Soup and\u00a0Chunky Beef, Cabbage, and Tomato Soup. And I also have this Chicken Barley Soup if you don\u2019t eat red meat. When I was a kid, we had soup for\u00a0dinner almost every night. Sometimes, we had a bowl as a first course and other times as a main dish. I wasn\u2019t always happy about it, but when my mom served Beef Barley Soup, I never complained. This is her recipe that I have been making for years, it\u2019s delicious! Here\u2019s the ingredients I use to make this beef soup along with some tips and variations, see the recipe card below for exact measurements: Here\u2019s the step-by-step process for making this beef barley soup recipe. See the recipe card below for printable directions. For a quicker soup, I love to use my pressure cooker or Instant pot. It cuts the cook time in half. This hearty beef barley soup is packed with protein and fiber, making it an excellent meal all on its own. You could pair it with crusty bread to soak up the broth or a quick salad for an easy dinner.  Leftovers only get better and make for great lunches. This beef barley soup recipe also freezes well if you want to make freezer meals for the month. I like to pour the soup into two-cup containers or these Souper Cubes so I can pull out one portion at a time. To eat, thaw it in the fridge overnight and warm it in the microwave or stove. You can also reheat it straight from frozen. Refrigerate up to 4 days or freeze up to 3 months.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"  Now in its 63rd year of existence, the James Bond franchise has experienced its share of turbulence, but though it all has managed to adapt its formula to the ever-changing times without losing its old-school sense of fun. Even when an individual film fails to deliver the goods (e.g. \"Diamonds Are Forever,\" \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" and \"Die Another Day\"), fans are still guaranteed the globetrotting exhilaration \u2014 be it gripping or goofy \u2014 of several major action set pieces jam-packed with practical stunt work. The viewer also knows there will be an array of new gadgets, and they can be fairly certain Bond will team up with a stunning beautiful foil who, now that we live in more enlightened times, will prove every bit his equal in the combat department. There's also a pleasing sense of continuity with the actors. Starting with Sean Connery, Bond aficionados came to love actors like Bernard Lee as M, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, and Desmond Llewelyn as Q \u2014 and when these actors retired from their roles, they tended to grow fond of their successors. Obviously, most franchises have a steady company of actors, but there was something charmingly quaint about 007's clockwork deployment of its stock characters. They didn't often play a huge role in the unfolding plot, but Bond couldn't do his job without them (even though he typically made their jobs harder to do). Among the series' many familiar faces, there are two that were recognizable in considerably different roles. In one film, they played a Bond ally, while in another they were hellbent on trying to kill him. Their dual casting is doubly interesting because they weren't\/aren't known for their chameleon-like acting talents.   When Charles Gray was cast as Tokyo-stationed MI6 agent Dikko Henderson in Bond's fifth big-screen adventure, 1967's \"You Only Live Twice,\" he was just settling into what would become a successful character actor career. Given that viewers at the time didn't have a sure sense of him as a portrayer of somewhat stiff, officious types (most notably in 1975's \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\"), they weren't thrown to see him playing a decidedly more agreeable sort \u2014 though one wonders throughout just how far Connery's Bond can trust his MI6 colleague. It turns out he can trust him with his life because poor Dikko sacrifices his own during the course of 007's mission. For those who watched the Bond films out of chronological order and checked out 1971's \"Diamonds Are Forever\" first, Gray's appearance is especially jarring because he played the character's archenemy Blofeld in the later installment. In this case, the viewer's first instinct is that should Bond shoot Dikko the second he walks through the door (which is a distinct possibility until the latter establishes his identity), and it's a testament to Gray's effectiveness as Blofeld in a very bad movie that he never puts the audience fully at ease on subsequent viewings.   Though Joe Don Baker became an American movie star as the crusading real-life Sheriff Buford T. Justice in Phil Karlson's surprise 1973 box office hit \"Walking Tall,\" and a bona-fide cult flick sensation as the titular lawman in the MST3K vilified actioner \"Mitchell,\" the broad-shouldered Texan always seemed more at home exuding down-home, s***kicker menace in films like \"Fletch,\" \"Junior Bonner\" and Don Siegel's neo-noir classic \"Charley Varrick.\" Unfortunately, the Bond franchise had already done and been loudly ridiculed for introducing a southern-fried character into its rarified universe (via Clifton James' hayseed Sheriff J.W. Pepper in \"Live and Let Die\" and \"The Man With the Golden Gun\"), no one had any reason to believe the series could find a home for such a distinctively tough-guy actor. This made Baker curious, yet surprisingly spot-on casting for the role of arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Timothy Dalton's first Bond movie, \"The Living Daylights.\" Cleanly coiffed and clad in a hilariously intimidating authoritarian uniform that would've looked smashing on Idi Amin, Baker slathers on the nastiness and only relents when he's finally splayed dead across a miniature battlefield depicting the folly of Waterloo. It's a fitting exit for a ferociously awful character. He was so dastardly as Whitaker that it was odd to see him turn up as good-guy CIA agent Jack Wade in 1995's \"GoldenEye.\" Cast opposite Pierce Brosnan in his first 007 go-round, Wade is as straight a shooter as a spook can be, and he was so well-suited to the part that the Bond team brought Baker\/Wade back for the subsequent film, \"Tomorrow Never Dies.\" Baker might've made his name playing disheveled Southern types, but always cleaned up nicely for the Bond franchise.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Samsung will officially make a return to the realm of ultra-slim phones in the coming months with the Galaxy S25 Edge. So far, the company has only given us a distant glimpse of the upcoming phone, but has remained mum on its innards or market arrival timeline. Well, an apparently working unit of the Galaxy S25 Edge briefly appeared in a leaked video this week, parading its svelte profile from all sides. In the short clip, the phone is compared against the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and we also get a look at its supposed innards via the AIDA64 app running on the phone. This is the first time we are seeing the phone in flesh, and in a functional form. It looks stunning, a fitting return for the \u201cEdge\u201d phones that once established Samsung\u2019s superiority as the maker of bold and stylish devices. Remember the beauty that was the Galaxy S6 Edge? Now, ever since Samsung put a demo unit up for showcase at its Unpacked event earlier this year, I have been fairly skeptical. What kind of sacrifices Samsung has made to achieve such a thin profile? Will it be competitive enough to slot within the mainline Galaxy S25 series? Well, it seems like the Galaxy S25 Edge will be a high-end phone, in the same vein as the iPhone 16. By that, I mean pairing a flagship silicon with a dual-camera setup. In the now-deleted video, we see the mention of Adreno 830, which is the graphics engine Qualcomm serves with its top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Elite silicon. This is the same silicon that powers the entire Galaxy S25 line, and a whole bunch of other Android flagships such as the OnePlus 13, iQoo 13, and the Red Magic 10 Pro. The video also shows 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage inside in the upcoming phone, which is again at par with the Galaxy S25. I had some doubts that Samsung would fit a low-end processor inside the Galaxy S25 Edge so that it doesn\u2019t deplete the small battery and cause any heat management hassles. But it seems Samsung has managed to address both the concerns. If the leaked video is anything to go by, the slim phone will come equipped with a 4,000 mAh battery, matching the Galaxy S25. I\u2019ve had a fairly good experience with the Galaxy S25 so far, easily going a full-day without having to charge the phone despite its relatively small battery. I expect the Galaxy S25 Edge won\u2019t fare any different. The biggest difference would be the imaging hardware. Unlike the regular Galaxy S25 and its Plus variant (which comes equipped with three cameras), the Edge trim will only pack two cameras. As per the latest leak, we are looking at a primary sensor that captures images at 12-megapixel resolution. That may not be the actual camera sensor resolution, because the AIDA 64 app shows the default image resolution clicked in pixel-binned format, and not the actual sensor details. A 50-megapixel, or even a 48-megapixel sensor, takes pictures at a 12-megapixel resolution using 4-in-1 pixel-binning tech. In a nutshell, there\u2019s a chance that Samsung fits a a 12-megapixel primary camera on the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it could very well turn out to be a 50-megapixel sensor, as well, just like the regular Galaxy S25. The Galaxy S25 Edge is shaping up to be a mainline Android flagship phone by 2025 standards. And that\u2019s both good and bad news. If you\u2019ve yearned for a thin phone that doesn\u2019t cut any serious corners when it comes to performance or other crucial aspects like camera or battery, this is the best that Android will offer in 2025. On the flip side, it is likely going to be pretty expensive. And not just because the innards more or less match the mainline Galaxy S25 and the engineering labor that went into making it. It seems the build materials are even more premium than the regular Galaxy S25. The Korean electronics giant is reportedly eyeing some form of ceramic glass material for the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s rear shell. Taking into account everything that leaks have served so far, the Galaxy S25 Edge might be priced at $800 by the safest estimates, or higher. There is definitely some historical precedent for that. In 2015, Samsung launched the Galaxy A8, it\u2019s slimmest smartphone so far. That phone didn\u2019t offer any flagship chops in the same league as the Galaxy S or Galaxy Note series phones back then, but still commanded a price tag close to $500. Now that Samsung\u2019s mainline Android flagship starts at $800 and touch the $1,300 base sticker tag for the Ultra model, the near-match that is the Galaxy S25 Edge will most likely exceed the entry point. Just how far Samsung goes with its innovation tax remains to be seen. As for me, well, I am not keeping my hopes high for any pleasant surprise. Rumors have swirled about Samsung's unreleased Galaxy A56, A36, and A26 handsets, but the company has yet to confirm their existence. That changed today when the three devices were listed on the Chilean Samsung service website. The website is aimed at customers who are out of warranty but need repairs, listing the price for different models. Since none of these handsets are released yet, the price is simply listed as \"not available.\" However, it does give us the model numbers. At the Galaxy S25 launch, Samsung also teased -- and confirmed -- its upcoming slim phone. Rumored to be less than 6mm in thickness, the Galaxy S25 Edge is set to be Samsung's thinnest candy bar phone, and potentially pull our attention away from the iPhone 17 Air, which is still at the rumor stage. Ahead of the launch, new details have emerged on how the Galaxy S25 Edge could be lighter, and it has to with Samsung revisiting an older design choice. The Galaxy S25 Edge is said to ditch glass for its back for the sake of durability. Instead, SamMobile claims to have exclusive information about the material it uses instead. According to the report, Samsung is instead opting for a ceramic material, which will be complemented by an aluminum frame. Samsung\u2019s previous-gen flagship phones are yet to get a taste of Android 15, but for the adventurous few who signed up for beta testing, they finally have some consolation coming their way. Samsung has started the rollout of One UI 7\u2019s fourth beta update for the Galaxy S24 series smartphones. Multiple users on X, Samsung\u2019s Community Forum, and YouTube have shared news of the latest beta update arriving on their Galaxy S24 series phones in India and Korea. The update also brings the February Android security patch, but the most notable addition is a key camera trick that Samsung introduced with the Galaxy S25 series earlier this year.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"HAMTRAMCK, MI - OCTOBER 11:  Assembly line workers assemble Chevy Volt electric vehicles and Opel ... [+] Amperas at the General Motors Detroit Hamtramck Assembly Plant October 11, 2011 in Hamtramck, Michigan. Officials from the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration toured the plant today to highlight the Obama administrations fuel economy standards. (photo by Bill Pugliano\/Getty Images) During the Great Depression\u2019s darkest days, President Hoover passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act intended to boost America\u2019s economy. But the result was higher prices on more than 20,000 imported goods, which significantly worsened the country\u2019s economic woes. Now 95 years later, new tariffs coupled with policy repeals proposed by the Trump administration could similarly slam one of America\u2019s biggest economic sectors \u2013 the auto industry. Major automakers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis will face a crossroads if new tariffs are placed upon our key trade partners, especially if those tariffs are paired with repealing policies that support this core American industry. China invested heavily in an automotive sector to meet 21st century demands, and is rapidly overtaking the U.S. as the world\u2019s largest auto producer and exporter, pushing American automakers out of major markets where they\u2019ve been leading for years. While China supported its auto industry growth \u2013 including plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles \u2013 U.S. automakers spent years deferring needed investment in emerging technologies. Coupled with federal policy that has until only recently failed to stimulate the sufficient research and development, America\u2019s auto industry is in a precarious position. Policies proposed by the Trump administration like imposing tariffs on key trade partners and eliminating federal tax credits will only worsen this trend, harming some of America\u2019s biggest companies while reducing consumer choice and forcing drivers to pay more. More than ever, the U.S. auto industry needs supportive policy to position it as a 21st century leader. What it\u2019s getting instead is policy that sets it up to fail and hands global auto dominance to China. China has quickly become the world\u2019s leading passenger car manufacturer, producing more than 26 million of the 68 million passenger cars manufactured in 2023, up from about 2 million cars 20 years ago. Increased domestic vehicle manufacturing met much of China\u2019s vehicle demand growth, reducing U.S. automakers\u2019 share in that market, with no indication this trend will change. Meanwhile, vehicle sales from U.S.-headquartered companies in other markets are freefalling while China keeps rising. China exported more than 5 million cars in 2024, including about 2 million plug-in vehicles. As the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Brad Setser notes, \u201cright now nothing \u2013 except politics and the risk of further trade action \u2013 precludes [China from]    exporting another 6 million or even another 12 million cars.\u201d In Europe, a major market for U.S. automakers, Chinese imports surpassed Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. in 2022. While European imports across the board generally declined in 2024, China remains well ahead of America. This trend is apparent in other prominent economies across Southeast Asia where China is eating into Japan\u2019s share of those markets, and growth has been especially strong in Brazil and Turkey. Tops in Europe This all hits as U.S. automakers face enormous uncertainty. The Trump administration\u2019s enacted and proposed tariffs, especially those targeting key trade partners Canada and Mexico, will significantly raise costs to produce vehicles in the U.S. and further threaten the viability of major U.S. automakers. Steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico might help U.S. steel and aluminum producers, but tariffs raise those commodity prices for every other business and factory that require them to manufacture goods. For example, 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada could raise vehicle prices for consumers 1-4%, increasing prices up to $3,000 per vehicle. Auto manufacturing is already a business of thin margins, and tariffs would simultaneously raise costs for consumers while kneecaping U.S. automakers\u2019 competitiveness, especially in markets where they are already slipping, by making their vehicles more expensive to produce. Ford CEO Jim Farley proclaimed the proposed tariffs \u201cwould blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen\u2026that kind of a size of a tariff would be devastating.\u201d Given how rapidly U.S. automakers have lost market share to China abroad, smart government policy is badly needed for U.S. automakers\u2019 global competitiveness. Tariffs harm U.S. automakers, point blank. And equally important, repealing federal tax credits that support research, development, and manufacturing of 21st century vehicles undermines the ability of U.S. automakers to grow their market share abroad. The world increasingly wants vehicles with batteries \u2013 one in five cars sold worldwide in 2024 were electric, and the International Energy Agency forecasts 50% of all cars sold worldwide will be electrified by 2035, pushing the global stock of plug-in vehicles from about 50 million today to more than 500 million. Plug-ins are already approaching cost parity with internal-combustion engines in many economies \u2013 they\u2019re already cheaper in China than gasoline equivalents \u2013 and the world\u2019s largest auto markets are implementing policies that require higher shares of plug-ins. For instance, European Union regulations require an increasing share of electrified vehicles including sales of more than 60% zero emissions vehicles by 2030 and 100% by 2035. The opportunity for U.S. auto manufacturers lies in meeting this rapidly growing demand at home and abroad. Unfortunately, major U.S. automakers are already years behind China\u2019s manufacturers in producing high-quality, low-cost plug-in cars. For example, the BYD Sea Lion 07, highly comparable to the Ford Mustang Mach-E, retails for nearly $13,000 less while offering nearly 60 miles more range \u2013 perhaps why Jim Farley says China\u2019s progress is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Ford. The same is true for other U.S. manufacturers. Comparison of the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the BYD Sea Lion 07 To compete with China, U.S. automakers must increase plug-in vehicle production and decrease production costs \u2013 one of the core ways to do this is cutting costs for plug-in vehicle batteries. America traditionally had comparatively little domestic manufacturing capacity for plug-in batteries but tax incentives passed by Congress, particularly the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, strongly incentivize battery manufacturers to locate in the U.S. and produce American batteries. Since Congress passed this tax credit in 2022, 373 manufacturers announced more than $118 billion in planned investment, alongside 203 EV manufacturing announcements totaling more than $54 billion in investment. U.S. battery output is now forecast to produce more than 10 million EVs per year by 2030. IEA (2025), Battery cell levelised cost of production by economy at different graphite price levels, ... [+] IEA, Paris https:\/\/www.iea.org\/data-and-statistics\/charts\/battery-cell-levelised-cost-of-production-by-economy-at-different-graphite-price-levels, Licence: CC BY 4.0 However even with current incentives, Chinese batteries today are still about one-third cheaper than American batteries. That means battery developers need confidence in long-term market development to know spending tens of billions to build new factories will be reciprocated with a stable market for their batteries that continues growing without unfair barriers as they scale and drive down costs. Therein lies the need for a holistic strategy to support U.S. automakers. Cutting costs requires policy to encourage development of domestic battery and plug-in vehicle manufacturing, which in turn requires policies supporting plug-in vehicles sales and domestically manufactured batteries to power them. The good news is existing battery and plug-in vehicle incentives, coupled with backstop standards, are providing this confidence. Existing policies, including the 45X, 30D, and 45W tax credits, as well as national and state tailpipe pollution standards, have are fostering this growth. BEV demand has grown steadily in the U.S. to reach 1.5 million plug-in vehicles sold in 2024, about 9.4% of 16 million new vehicles. But while plug-in demand is certain to continue growing, the growth pace is uncertain, particularly if the Trump administration guts incentives and policies to foster market growth. Repealing these key policies, especially while adding tariffs, will crater the market - WoodMackenzie modeling predicts ending these policies could cut 2030 annual sales share of plug-in vehicles from 32% to 23%, or about 1.4 million cars. This policy uncertainty is discouraging some battery developers and auto manufacturers who had announced new investments \u2013 in Georgia alone over the past two weeks a battery manufacturer cancelled plans for a $2.5 billion factory and an American EV component supplier halted construction on a new plant. Major companies share those concerns. Jim Farley warned Trump administration policies could force layoffs, while other U.S. automakers have urged that if they are amended, EV tax credits should be phased out instead of repealed. The solution to this uncertainty is relatively straightforward. First, avoid tariffs that harm U.S. auto manufacturers. Second, provide manufacturers with a stable investment environment by preserving existing incentives like the 30D, 45W, and 45X tax credits to encourage investment in battery production and EV manufacturing. Third, maintain existing federal and state tailpipe pollution and vehicle efficiency standards that provide automakers a strong and clear market for plug-in vehicle demand. America\u2019s automakers have gotten back in the fast lane toward economic dominance, but the race with foreign competitors has barely begun. Preserving existing tax credits and standards will provide the domestic support and demand certainty American battery suppliers and automakers need today to make investments that will position them to succeed tomorrow. Throwing our economic growth in reverse by imposing harmful tariffs and repealing existing laws will only leave the U.S. auto industry in the dust.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Mercedes-Benz CLA Shooting Brake Mercedes shares dived more than 5-1\/2% as it slashed costs and forecast weaker profits for 2025 but analysts had been bracing for worse numbers and reckoned the company was doing well compared with other German automakers. Successful electric vehicles are key to any recovery, while an unexpected turnaround in internal combustion engine vehicle sales will boost profits short-term. BMW gets the nod from one analyst as being in a strong position, thanks to its leadership in electric vehicles. Meanwhile, Mercedes\u2019 share price had been had been advancing, despite investors expecting the auto industry to face severe problems in 2025. European sales appear headed for stagnation at best, and competition from China is increasing, especially with EVs. Tightening European Union CO2 emissions rules will require strong EV sales. Tariff threats from the Trump administration were a big worry, not least because of the impossibility of predicting the scale of the possible hit. Mercedes shares rallied from a low of \u20ac51.21 in mid-November to \u20ac61.94, until news Thursday lower profits are expected, and it plans to cut production costs by 10% through 2027. On Friday the shares closed at \u20ac58.24 in Europe, according to Reuters. Mercedes said its car-making profit margin dropped to 8.1% last year from 2023\u2019s 12.6% and would dip to between 6 and 8% in 2025. That compares with a more bullish future expected as recently as 2022 which included a long-range profit forecast of up to 14% in good times and no less than 8% in tougher ones. Last year\u2019s biggest problems were weakness in China and the German home market where the withdrawal of government subsidies crippled EV sales. Global sales in 2025 are expected to be less than 2024\u2019s 1.98 million. Later this year Mercedes will launch a new C-Class CLA, and next year an updated S-class limousine.

Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of Germany\u2019s Center for Automotive Research, said Mercedes has less problems than some other German automakers. \u201cThere are other German manufacturers that have more to worry about than Mercedes. The efficiency and savings program is making Mercedes stronger in terms of costs, the new C-Class with the CLA is important for 2025 and the renaissance of the combustion engine in the USA and Europe is making Mercedes more profitable. However, it could be a temporary high if future electric cars do not attract more attention from customers. China and the electric car in China is the big challenge for Mercedes,\u201d Dudenhoeffer said in an email. Other big automakers in Germany include BMW, Volkswagen and its spun-off Porsche subsidiary. President Trump\u2019s decision to scale back U.S. government mandates, which would have forced manufacturers to make and sell more EVs, has been scaled back. This will revive the U.S. market for ICE vehicles. In Europe, the strict rules forcing more EVs on the market are expected to be diluted by the EU, leading to a revival of ICE technology here as well. Frank Schwope, Automotive Industry lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences FHM Hannover, said Volkswagen and Porsche have already initiated cost-cutting programs but BMW seems to be more secure. \u201cOnly BMW seems to be in a better position. BMW\u2019s openness to technology combined with its advantage in electromobility shows the company\u2019s strengths. In addition the \u201cNeue Klasse\u201d will be launched at the end of the year, which could become a new milestone for the Group,\u201d Schwope said in an email.

Investment researcher Bernstein was impressed but not overwhelmed. \u201cThe CMD was certainly a tour-de force, and we came away more confident that Mercedes has credible technology and product responses to the significant challenges faced by legacy auto. But with most of these new products only having a positive impact from 2027, it is clear that 2025-26 will remain challenging.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"NOTE: Paid subscribers now get access to our private discord.  WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 An unearthed episode of a podcast hosted by Trump loyalist and FBI-director nominee Kash Patel reveals a pre-existing tension underlying the already-rocky marriage between the MAGAworld populists and the Elon Musk\u2013led Silicon Valley elites who powered Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s campaign. Following a chaotic 15-month run working for the first Trump administration, Patel, a staunch Trump loyalist, launched Kash\u2019s Corner, a podcast in which he offered his MAGAfied take on the news alongside his co-host, Epoch Times senior editor Jan Jekielek. Drop Site News is reader-supported. Consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. In an episode from October 2022, Patel warned not only of Musk\u2019s financial motives, but of his monopolistic ambitions and hunger for consumer data and defense contracts\u2014the very things that concern the economist-populist wing of Trump world. At the time, Musk had recently decided he didn\u2019t want to buy Twitter after all because the social-media platform\u2019s exorbitant cost would force him to take on billions of dollars of debt with no obvious path to profitability. The billionaire and eventual Trump backer later moved forward with the purchase anyway because Twitter sued him when he tried to back out of buying it at the previously agreed upon price. But Patel didn\u2019t fully buy his rationale. In fact, his diatribe against Musk revealed a deep skepticism over his monopolistic intentions, a cornerstone concern of the economist populists of the MAGAverse. Patel sounded almost perturbed as he decried Musk\u2019s intentions in attempting to buy the social-media platform. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Patel said, \u201cI spent some time thinking about it, and it's money.\u201d \u201cEven if you're worth $250 billion and you buy a $50 billion company\u2026 that's a fifth of your wealth\u2014especially if you need to use liquid capital, which you do in these deals to buy a large portion of it,\u201d Patel said. \u201cSo I think he realized that his payment penalty, if he withdrew, was going to be huge, a billion dollars in cash. And I think he realized that he wants to continue building the Elon behemoth, and he put out a statement. It basically says all roads lead to the one app for everything, the X app. Cute from SpaceX founder\u2014I'm not really sure what he means by the one app for everything.\u201d While Patel played coy, the point was clear: Musk\u2019s acquisitive appetites were alarming. \u201cIt makes me think of the One Ring,\u201d Jekielek said, making a reference to The Lord of the Rings. Patel burst out laughing, briefly cutting off his co-host. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t bode well.\u201d Patel, along with a faction of the president\u2019s inner circle and a cadre of other Trumpworld figures including Steve Bannon, have been at odds with Musk and the Silicon Valley titans who injected themselves into the president\u2019s orbit over the home stretch of his campaign. \u201cAs soon as I can turn Elon Musk from a techno-feudalist to a populist nationalist, we\u2019ll start making real progress,\u201d Bannon recently said. But Trump has welcomed the Silicon Valley billionaires with open arms, starting on the fundraising circuit and intensifying once Musk publicly endorsed Trump immediately following the July assassination attempt. \u201cPresident Trump likes titans,\u201d a Trumpworld operative told Drop Site News when asked what\u2019s stopping other MAGA stars from taking Musk on publicly. Patel appeared to have put some serious thought into his critique of Musk, raising questions about his dependence on U.S. taxpayer money for his companies as well as the good will of Beijing. \u201cAnd that's the other thing,\u201d Patel said after Jekielek\u2019s Lord of the Rings quip. \u201cThis guy's already got Starlink, so he's providing internet to the world, supposedly. He's already got Tesla. He's already got the SpaceX program, and the government DOD contracts \u2014 which I believe to be the largest portion of his income \u2014 and now he'll have Twitter?\u201d The largest share of Musk\u2019s net worth comes from his Tesla stock shares, which he can borrow against and spend at a far greater level than a traditional salary. At Tesla, his compensation is tied to the company\u2019s valuation and stock price. SpaceX alone has raked in more than $20 billion in federal contracts to date. \u201cSo, what scares me is, like,\u201d Patel continued, \u201cyou wanna talk about a monopoly? It is the ultimate monopoly. Is he going to execute the businesses and allow others to compete? On free speech platforms, that is? Is he just going to buy everything up, and then become one ginormous trust\u2014for lack of a better word, a monopoly\u2014which is supposedly illegal under antitrust laws?\u201d MAGA stalwarts such as Vice President J.D. Vance have been vehemently against monopolistic behavior and Trump even ran on a quasi-anti-trust platform. Patel did not return a request for comment. In the October 2022 episode of Kash\u2019s Corner, Patel lobbed an even more incendiary suggestion, this one about Musk\u2019s use of consumer data. \u201cWhat's he going to do with all the data? That's my concern,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe data collection \u2014 he's got a global wifi satellite system, in space, for the world: Starlink. He has Tesla, he has, as I said, the SpaceX program, and now he'll have Twitter.\u201d Patel found himself asking a version of the question many Musk critics have been asking themselves amid the DOGE takeover, in which the billionaire and his associates have seized control of government databases, frozen payments, accessed federal employee, vendor and taxpayer data in a deluge of changes with questionable authority, at best. \u201cWhat do you do with everyone's personal information?\u201d Patel asked. Then they turned to China, where Musk has substantial business interests, including Tesla\u2019s access to the Chinese electric vehicle market and, now, plans for a data center. (Patel also has a stake in Shein, it turns out.) \u201cDo you allow the CCP to have backdoors? Like other companies, like TikTok, has done in the past, and sell Americans\u2019 data? Or provide Americans data directly to the CCP for future use against American and American interests? Those are questions that people should be asking, I think, rather than fixating on the ups or downs of Elon buying Twitter,\u201d Patel said. Musk\u2019s hurricane of activity since arriving in the new administration as a special government employee has major implications for data security. The billionaire\u2019s team of young staffers, part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), seek access to internal systems and servers containing information including social security numbers and payments, tax returns, and other private data belonging to American citizens. While Patel\u2019s current views on Musk remain unclear, his analysis of his business interests and motivations appear to speak directly to the current fears surrounding his intentions with DOGE. At various points, Patel has taken to Truth Social to blast Musk. In one post from July 2023, Patel accused Musk of being \u201cbig tech colluding with our government to censor our elections,\u201d adding: \u201cYour cheap Titter [sic] posts and your Mickey Mouse clown droppings do not absolve you,\u201d as first reported by The Daily Beast. \u201cYou are as bad as FBI\/DOJ n you and are making millions from the disinformation campaigns. You are a complete and total fake who cares only about $.\u201d Since Trump nominated Patel to serve as his FBI in late November, he has not appeared to post anything about Musk on his Truth Social account. Overall, he has quieted his online activity during the confirmation process. While the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday delayed consideration of Patel\u2019s nomination, it is expected to move along shortly. Despite trying to keep a lower profile, Patel\u2019s own financial dealings are now likely to face further scrutiny. Independent journalist Roger Sollenberger posted financial disclosure forms showing Patel is in for a seven-figure payment for eight months of work as a \u201cconsultant\u201d for a Cayman Islands-based holding company that is the controlling entity of Shein, the Chinese fast fashion conglomerate. (The exact amount is unclear.) The stock arrangement went into effect in November, according to the disclosure, months after Patel joined the holding company as a consultant and the same month Trump nominated him for FBI Director. Patel has not publicly disclosed what he did for the holding company. Several members of the board of directors for that holding company are top-level executives with Shein. According to reporting by independent campaign finance reporter Roger Sollenberger, Patel has no intentions to divest once in office, and began vesting his shares on February 1, two days after his first confirmation hearing. During inauguration week, Patel posed for photos with other MAGA figures, but notably, not Musk. In one photo, Patel appeared with longtime Trump aide Boris Epshteyn, who reportedly had a public blow up with Musk at Mar-a-Lago during the transition. Toward the end of Patel\u2019s diatribe against Musk on Kash\u2019s Corner in 2022, he also swore to never join Twitter. \u201cNever,\u201d he told his co-host. \u201cTruth Social all the way.\u201d By the time he\u2019d been nominated to serve as Trump\u2019s FBI director, Patel joined X. Musk congratulated him in a reply to Patel\u2019s first ever tweet: \u201cCongratulations on being nominated to run the @FBI!\u201d  Leave a comment Share He's a SHEINholder?!  They have total access to your data.  Read the TOS.  Direct link to China.   No better than TikTok. If everyone would not buy Teslas and more importantly, SELL ALL OF THEIR STOCK IN IT, boy would it be fun to watch the mighty fall.  Because that would do it.  Almost instantly. Gotta love how Tesla sales are down 50% in Europe.  Especially Germany.  Don't f*ck around with them and Naziism.  But of course FElon has cut prices for them in China.   God America is stupid.  This love of money got us where we are today.  Started over 40 years ago and nobody has done shit about it.  Including two Democratic administrations.   *Not counting Biden's term as the damage was done and there was no way he was gonna be able turn it back. Very interesting report! A couple of thoughts:  1) Trump clearly likes his appointees to duke it out -- as shown by the Elon-Kash clash. That's one among many signs that Trump is his own boss. 2) The MAGA populism, as articulated by Steve Bannon, is actually an impressive, robust philosophy and platform (even if it includes some toxic crap). This long Bannon interview is fascinating as it shows his disdain for most Republicans and for Silicon Valley titans: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/01\/31\/opinion\/steve-bannon-on-broligarchs-vs-populism.html?unlocked_article_code=1.tk4.nC7b.er1sAOShOHBq&smid=url-share 3) I think it odd to protest Elon's monopolistic and data-collection pursuits because Google, Meta, and the rest do that as well (not so much U.S. govt. data, but global citizens' data). Let's also keep in mind that the federal contracts of Musk were all acquired\/escalated in the Biden administration. All in all, we're in a topsy-turvy Trump-world, and it's a mixed bag of some excellent things and some that make no sense or worse.  No posts Ready for more?","label":0}
{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Login  Peter  23 February 2025   Weekly poll OnePlus  The OnePlus 13R can add last week\u2019s poll to its resume \u2013 these results are something to brag about. The perception of this phone is that OnePlus fixed some of the major complaints about the 12R (mainly the camera). This led to a positive score on the poll and one major complaint \u2013 the price. The 13R matches the price of the 256GB 12R, but the 12R also had a cheaper 128GB model. Well, actually, in Europe and India the 13R got a small price hike. Anyway, while OnePlus phones aren\u2019t regulars at the discount section in stores, they do get price cuts and promos often enough. Things aren\u2019t the same everywhere, e.g. an iQOO 13 offers better hardware (like a Snapdragon 8 Elite instead of 8 Gen 3) for a slightly higher price (but still much lower than the flagship OnePlus 13). The problem with that is that the iQOO 13 is not available in most markets. What is available is the OnePlus 12 \u2013 you can even find it on OnePlus.com. For example, in the UK the 256GB model is \u00a320 less than the 13R. In Germany, both phones are the same price. In the US and Canada, the 12 is more expensive since there are no discounts at the moment. Still, if you live in a region where the OnePlus 12 is the same price as the 13R, you will be tempted to go with the older flagship. Of course, stock won\u2019t last forever, so this is a temporary issue.      OnePlus 13R And yes, some will be willing to pay the premium and get the flagship OnePlus 13. In addition, there are alternatives from other brands at competitive prices. But even with all that, the 13R is looking like a winner for OnePlus. Yes, both are sh**.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  The US risks encountering what some forecasters say is a worst-case scenario for the economy in 2025 \u2014 a situation that could potentially spark a 10% hit to stock prices, according to Stifel's top stock strategist.          Barry Bannister, the managing director and chief equity strategist at the firm, was one of the few bears on Wall Street heading into this year, predicting the S&P 500 would end 2025 in the mid-5000s.                He says he sees the risk that the US economy enters a period of mild stagflation by the second half of the year. That refers to a scenario where inflation remains sticky while economic growth slows\u2014 a dynamic that saw prices and unemployment soar in the 1970s.               Bannister told Business Insider there are early signs that the dynamic is taking shape, despite most investors generally expecting another strong year of growth and for inflation to continue cooling in 2025.        Inflation, for one, has accelerated in recent months. Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in January, above estimates and above December's 2.9% inflation rate.                Investors have been concerned about the inflation picture in recent months, despite price increases slowing significantly since the middle of 2022.                Some of the concern is due to President Trump's economic policies, Bannister said, pointing to Trump's tariff plan, which forecasters have warned could pass price increases onto consumers.               \"I think it's foolish that people assume that inflation's going back down to 2%. It's not going back down to 2%, not without a recession,\" Bannister said, later pointing to the impact of tariffs on prices. \"Tariffs undo a lot of the disinflation.\"               In a note, Stifel analysts said they expected core personal consumption expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, to remain \"stuck\" at around 2.75% in 2025, above the Fed's 2% target.               Elevated inflation also spells bad news for economic growth, given that it's impact on consumers, Bannister said.       Consumer spending powers around 70% of US GDP. Meanwhile, households are already showing signs they're starting to pull back, with retail sales falling nearly 1% from in January, according to data from the Commerce Department.                Meanwhile, growth could stumble this year. Real average hourly earnings for all workers in the private sector grew 4% year-over-year in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, down from a peak of 8% year-over-year growth during 2020.               Worker productivity growth has been trending down for much of the last year, as well. Output per worker in the nonfarm business sector rose just 1.5% in the fourth quarter, down from a peak of 7% productivity growth in 2020.               \"I think what's out there is there are a lot of armchair economists who just assume productivity is going to soar. They're missing the cyclicality of productivity, which is already fading,\" Bannister said.               The result could be an ugly feedback loop: Waning productivity spells bad news for inflation, as businesses getting less from workers can influence them to raise prices. Meanwhile, high inflation could prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates, which could hurt economic growth, Bannister said. He added that he didn't expect the Fed to cut interest rates any further this year.               All of that is a negative for the market, where investors have been pricing continued economic strength and lower borrowing costs.                Stocks look due for a correction to begin with, Bannister said, pointing to historically high valuations. He expects the combined headwinds of slower growth and higher rates to spark a 10% sell-off sometime in the second half of the year.               \"It says I dip down to 5,500 at the end of the year as this slowdown combined with sticky inflation puts the Fed in a bind,\"he said, referring to the bank's forecast for the S&P 500.                Other forecasters have also flagged the risk of stagflation amid an uncertain outlook for prices and trade policy.                Mark Malek, the chief investment officer at Siebert Financial, told BI he saw stagflation as a risk to the economy, though it wasn't his base case for what could happen in 2025. That's largely due to the risk that tariffs push prices higher, which could put enough pressure on consumers to spark an economic slowdown, he said in an interview earlier this month.               \"It's not a word that I like to bring up often, but we're starting to look now at the realities of these potentially draconian tariffs, right? They're not small tariffs,\" he said of a stagflation scenario. \"You have inflation pressure, and then on the other side of it, you have a situation where you have the potential for an economic slowdown.\"               BCA Research said it also saw the risk of a \"mini stagflation\" event due to growth in the economy slowing and inflation sticking close to 3% throughout 2025. The scenario could be triggered by stalling labor supply growth, waning productivity growth, and prices remaining elevated in the US, Dhaval Joshi, a chief strategist at the firm, wrote in a note.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"It just isn't the budget iPhone I expected   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  For the longest time I was excited about the release of the iPhone 16e, or as it was originally named, the iPhone SE 4. Well, Apple finally revealed the device in all its glory, and I don't think I'll be recommending it. First, a bit of quick history if you have no idea what I'm talking about. For the longest time, Apple kept to only making iPhones sequentially. However, Apple eventually realized there was a market for an affordable option and started the SE series in 2016, with the last being the iPhone SE (2022). The next in line was the rumored iPhone SE 2024, and there was a lot of buzz about the phone. However, when it was finally announced it was clear that Apple had fully dropped the SE brand. This is not a direct replacement for the iPhone SE; think of it more of as slightly cheaper brother of the iPhone 16. So what is the reason for this general dislike, is it just a lack of features or is it something more? Well, let's delve into the phone to see why this is the least excited I've been for a new iPhone in a while.  Now, it wouldn't be fair to just start hating on the phone without first acknowledging what Apple has done right. Firstly, there\u2019s no doubt that the iPhone 16e has some great features, mainly the inclusion of the A18 chip and more RAM. The problem is that a device needs at least 8GB of RAM to make use of Apple Intelligence, which means that any phone older than the iPhone 15 Pro loses access to the feature. So it wasn't a surprise to see that Apple launched the iPhone 16e with 8GB of RAM, as well as full Apple Intelligence support. I honestly expected Apple to hold back on at least some features for the new phone, but it seems everything is on the table. This is great news for consumers, especially for those looking to explore Apple Intelligence for $200 less than it costs to buy a new iPhone 16.  The new iPhone 16e is missing a lot of features versus the regular iPhone 16. For one, it doesn't feature the Camera Control button, instead, it has the iPhone 15's Action Button. Now, this might be a bit more personal, but I don't like the Action Button. I've always seen it as an overly complex silent mode toggle that you might consider changing the function of but likely won't. The iPhone 16e also doesn't have the Dynamic Island seen in modern iPhones, instead, it uses the same notch seen in the iPhone 14. The iPhone 16e has just a single camera compared to the regular iPhone 16, so you don't get an ultrawide option. And there's no macro mode either. Finally, and worst of all, there's no MagSafe on the iPhone. This is weird because MagSafe has been a part of the iPhone range since the iPhone 12. It is such an odd thing to remove given how handy MagSafe chargers and other accessories have become.  There was a lot to love about the iPhone SE 4 in concept, mainly the idea of having access to some great features while sacrificing some hardware. To my mind, the idea of the phone basically being an AI-capable iPhone 14 was a great one, but somewhere along the line Apple has made a strange missmash of a device. Why make the phone so similar to the iPhone 15, then stick what looks like an iPhone 14 display in so that you're stuck with the notch? Why include an Action button but not include MagSafe charging? Now, I should be fair and say that there is still a fair amount we don't know about the iPhone 16e's performance. Not only that, there is little doubt that there will likely be bigger iPhone 16e discounts when the iPhone 17 is finally released. However, for the time being, I'll go back to wishing for the iPhone SE 4 that was rumored before, the one that would undoubtedly have been one of the best cheap phones.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Eroica Riesling is celebrating 25 years of innovation. A quarter of a century ago, Riesling wasn\u2019t served at swanky Asian fusion restaurants. It wasn\u2019t collected or poured at prestigious American wineries. In fact, it was a mostly overlooked, undervalued grape varietal. But then in 2000, an unusual partnership changed its status in the United States. German winemaker Ernst Loosen, owner of the Dr. Loosen estate, tried a Riesling from Washington state that gave him an intriguing notion. Loosen, whose winery had been making Rieslings for more than two centuries, reached out to the Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery. \u201cHe had tasted the Chateau Ste. Michelle Cold Creek Riesling, and he approached Chateau Ste. Michelle with the idea to partner together to produce a high-end Riesling from Washington,\u201d says Katie Nelson, Chateau Ste. Michelle winemaker. \u201cThe goal of the partnership was to make the best possible Riesling from Washington state and demonstrate the true quality, elegance and enjoyability of Riesling.\u201d The result of that partnership was Eroica Riesling. \u201cNamed after Beethoven\u2019s Third Symphony, Eroica debuted with the 1999 vintage and immediately generated excitement for Riesling and showed people what Riesling can do,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cIt set the bar for American Riesling.\u201d Since that debut vintage, Riesling\u2019s interest among American wine drinkers has flourished. Washington state increased its Riesling acreage from 1999 to 2011 by 6,320 acres from 1999 to 2011, according to the University of California-Davis. It has since become the largest producer of Riesling in the United States. \u201cOver 25 years ago, the major Riesling producers were German,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cRiesling was not as widespread as it is today where more regions are producing different expressions of the grape\u201d Riesling continues its growth today. According to Data Insights Market, the global Riesling market was valued at $3.5 million dollars, and it\u2019s expected to grow at a rate of 4.5 percent through 2033. \u201cGrowing consumer preference for premium and luxury wines and the rising disposable income are primarily driving the market growth. Additionally, the increasing popularity of Riesling wines in the food and beverage industry due to their versatility and pairing capabilities with various cuisines is contributing to the market expansion.\u201d Riesling still represents a smaller varietal category compared with more dominate varietals like Chardonnay, Nelson says. \u201cHowever, over the past two decades as the quality and image of Riesling has improved, more consumers have discovered the versatility and flavorful appeal of Riesling,\u201d she says. \u201cThose who enjoy Riesling see it as a good go to \u2013 it\u2019s well balanced with a nice blend of a hint of sweetness and refreshing acidity. They see it as stylish, elegant and modern.\u201d \u201cGen X and more experienced wine drinkers see it as a good food pairing, for example with seafood, Asian dishes and spicy foods,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cMillennials see Riesling as a good choice for when you want to make a nice impression.\u201d  Riesling also has a higher percentage of people who, new to the grape varietal, are willing to try it, Nelson says, noting that 60 percent of these \u201ctriers\u201d enjoy it, \u201cversus many other varietals so it\u2019s doing a good job of introducing itself to new audiences.\u201d Riesling is well-received by both older and younger generations, Nelson notes. \u201cGen X and more experienced wine drinkers see it as a good food pairing, for example with seafood, Asian dishes and spicy foods,\u201d she says. \u201cMillennials see Riesling as a good choice for when you want to make a nice impression.\u201d Nelson says she and her team are thrilled to celebrate this quarter-century milestone. \u201cLike Beethoven\u2019s Third Symphony, Eroica is a masterful composition with notes of white peach, mandarin orange, and apricot, harmonizing with minerality and lively natural acidity, each sip offers a unique and elegant experience,\u201d she says.","label":0}

Warren Buffett retains a huge cash hoard, with the level now at an all-time high relative to the size of the company. (Photo by Daniel Zuchnik\/WireImage) Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (BRK\/A, BRK\/B) fourth-quarter earnings release also includes the annual letter from Warren Buffett as part of the annual report. Warren Buffett leads Berkshire as CEO and chairman, with Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance, and Ajit Jain, vice chairman of insurance. The yearly letter continued the theme of previous years as a type of owner\u2019s handbook for Berkshire shareholders. Buffett spent a significant portion of the letter focused on how to think about Berkshire\u2019s insurance business. As usual, he noted that shareholders should focus on Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings rather than the volatile GAAP results. Berkshire Hathaway reported earnings of almost $19.7 billion in the fourth quarter, well below the $37.6 billion in the same quarter of 2023. Operating earnings, which remove the distortion from market changes and better reflect the firm\u2019s earnings power, skyrocketed by 71% for the quarter versus 2023. Operating earnings for 2024 rose 27% compared to 2023. Per-share operating income increased by 28% for the year, illustrating the value of share repurchases. Berkshire Hathaway 4Q And 2024 Earnings Berkshire\u2019s most significant business by annual operating earnings is insurance, followed by the manufacturing, service, and retailing segment. Berkshire Hathaway: 2024 Percent Of Operating Earnings A more detailed look into the various operating segments for 2024 shows a robust improvement in results over 2023. The insurance business is the primary driver of the growth for the year, growing operating earnings by 51%. Operating income, excluding insurance, grew by 11% compared to last year. Berkshire Hathaway: 2024 Operating Earnings By Segment For 2024, investment income was 43% higher than in 2023, primarily due to higher short-term investment balances. At last May\u2019s annual meeting, Buffett was correct in predicting that yields and cash levels would lead to higher investment income in 2024. Buffett noted in his annual letter that Geico continued its improvement and credited Todd Combs with \u201cincreasing efficiency and bringing underwriting practices up to date.\u201d Buffett added that the overhaul of Geico was \u201cnot yet complete.\u201d Notably, policies in force grew in the second half of 2024. The two most essential concepts in insurance investing are \u201cfloat\u201d and underwriting profit. In simple terms, float is created for insurance companies because insurance premiums are paid before any claims are made by the insured. Insurance companies can invest the float, sometimes for years, before insurance losses are reimbursed. Berkshire\u2019s float at $171 billion is $5 billion higher than its Dec. 31, 2023 level. In general, the value of float increases as yields rise since an insurance company can earn more when investing the cash. Float per share ended 2024 at $118,897, above the level at the end of 2023. Though not a factor for most of this year, share repurchases aid the growth of float per share. Berkshire Hathaway: Float Significant catastrophe losses from Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton hit Berkshire. Despite these losses, Berkshire\u2019s insurance segment earned an underwriting profit. Berkshire has a history, unlike many insurance companies, of earning an underwriting profit, meaning that their float costs them nothing and makes them money in addition to allowing them to earn a profit off of investing the float. Berkshire has three main insurance businesses: Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. All three insurance segments had a profitable underwriting year. An underwriting profit means the insurance premium exceeds all insurance claims and expenses. For example, Geico had a combined ratio of 81.5% in 2024, which means that only 81.5 cents of every dollar in insurance premiums were spent on losses and expenses. A combined ratio over 100% indicates the insurance company has an underwriting loss, as seen with the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group in the third quarter. Despite the poor third quarter, the Primary Group had an underwriting profit for the year. Berkshire Hathaway Insurance - Combined Ratios Berkshire owns one of the largest railroads in North America, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad, operating in the U.S. and Canada. Railroad freight volume improved, but a \u201clabor agreement in the fourth quarter of 2024 and litigation charges related to an ongoing legal case\u201d weighed on results for 2024, with operating earnings down 1% versus 2023. On a more positive note, BNSF continued to see better productivity, which bodes well for earnings improvement outside of extraordinary items. BNSF\u2019s operating ratio, operating expenses divided by revenue, improved in 2024. BNSF: Trailing 12 Month Operating Ratio BHE generally provides steady and growing earnings, as one would expect from what primarily consists of regulated utilities and pipeline companies. In addition, BHE typically produces significant tax credits due to its renewable electricity generation. For this reason, Berkshire focuses on after-tax earnings, which is \u201chow the energy businesses are managed and evaluated.\u201d BHE had a strong year on the surface, with operating earnings soaring by 60% over 2023. However, lower wildfire loss accruals in 2024 flattered the year-over-year comparisons. Since 2022, BHE has set aside approximately $2.75 billion for possible losses from the wildfires involving PacifiCorp. Pre-tax earnings fell by 4.2% due primarily to the service and retailing businesses, despite better results at some manufacturing companies. This segment consists of many diverse businesses, so this analysis will focus on the best and worst performers and some themes when looking at this segment. Manufacturing, Service & Retail: 2024 Pre-Tax Earnings The service group saw a 23% decline in pre-tax earnings for the quarter, primarily attributable to TTI, the aviation services businesses, and XTRA. TTI is a distributor of electronic components, and management began noting weakness in the group in 2023 due to inventory levels and sagging demand. It is not abnormal for distribution businesses to suffer from these issues after a period of supply chain issues and high demand, as seen surrounding Covid-19. The aviation services businesses, including NetJets and FlightSafety, saw strong revenue growth, but increased costs hurt results. XTRA, which leases transportation equipment, had fewer units leased and an increase of the expenses. The retailing group was another significant drag on earnings growth, with a 19.2% decline in pre-tax earnings for 2024. The most critical portion of the retailing segment is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, which owns over 80 auto dealerships. BHA had 7.9%% lower earnings for 2024, \u201cprimarily due to lower vehicle gross profit margins, partially offset by higher earnings from finance\/service contract and parts\/service\/repair operations, as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\u201d Pre-tax earnings for the remainder of the retailing group fell by 40.2%, due primarily to lower sales and higher costs per unit of sales. On the positive side, the consumer products group had a 10.9% increase in 2024 pre-tax profits. According to management, the \u201cincrease was primarily attributable to higher revenues from Forest River, Brooks Sports, and Duracell, partially offset by lower revenues from Fruit of the Loom, Garan, and Richline.\u201d Berkshire\u2019s aerospace exposure remains substantial despite selling its publicly traded airline holdings in 2020. Berkshire\u2019s Precision Castparts (PCC) business has been a bright spot within the industrial products segment due to its exposure to the aerospace industry. PCC\u2019s 2024 pre-tax earnings rose by 24.4% relative to 2023, primarily due to \u201csales increases and generally improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies.\u201d Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) are the largest operator of travel centers in North America, under the names Pilot and Flying J. On Jan. 16, 2024, Berkshire acquired the final 20% and now owns 100% of the entity. It is shown as a segment within the financials of the operating companies. Still, the January 2023 results are included in the non-controlled business results, so the year-to-date comparison is apples-to-oranges. On an apples-to-apples basis, pre-tax earnings fell by 41.9% for 2024, driven by lower average fuel prices and increased expenses. Manufacturing, Service & Retail: 2024 Pre-Tax Earnings Summary This segment includes companies\u2019 profits that must be accounted for under the equity method due to the size of ownership and influence on management. The after-tax equity method earnings have Berkshire\u2019s proportionate share of profits attributable to its investments in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Berkadia. In addition, the January 2023 results from Pilot are included in the 2023 non-controlled business results. According to Bloomberg, Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum\u2019s largest shareholder, with an over 28% stake. More about the reasons for the Occidental investment is here. The segment had a gain for the year produced primarily by foreign currency exchange rate gains generated from bonds issued by Berkshire Hathaway and denominated in British Pounds, euros, and Japanese Yen. These foreign currency swings are not a concern as Berkshire has significant assets and earnings denominated in these foreign currencies. Investment losses from non-U.S. dollar investments generally offset some of these gains and vice versa, depending on currency exchange rates. Acquisition accounting expenses are also reflected in this segment. These expenses are created by amortizing intangible assets connected to companies purchased by Berkshire. Finally, the gain in other earnings includes \u201c Berkshire parent company investment income, corporate expenses, intercompany interest income on loans to operating subsidiaries when the related interest expense is included in earnings of the operating subsidiaries and unallocated income taxes.\u201d Insurance Investment Portfolio: $497 Billion Berkshire was a net seller of $6.7 billion in publicly traded stocks in the fourth quarter. This marks the ninth straight quarter of Berkshire Hathaway's net sales of stocks. Berkshire bought $3.4 billion of stocks while selling $10.1 billion. This brings the total net sales of publicly traded stocks to $134.1 billion for 2024. The 13F filing with the SEC, released on February 14, provided more details of the publicly traded stock portfolio changes, including a new purchase of Constellation Brands (STZ). After the sales, Berkshire\u2019s insurance company investment portfolio is down to 53% publicly traded stocks from 63% in the first quarter, while cash rose from 28% to 43%. As a positive, Geico showed strong profitability and increased policies in force in the second half of the year. Returning Geico to a growth company was crucial, but Buffett noted there was still work to be done. The BNSF railroad had slipped the five other major railroads, but there looks to have been some improvement in profitability and efficiency in 2024. An update on progress at the annual meeting will be heavily anticipated. While BHE earnings looked much better for 2024, the threat of further liability for wildfires hasn\u2019t gone away and possibly imperils the attractiveness of future capital spending in the business. Further, significant additional capital investments in liability-impacted utility areas should signal positive progress since Buffett stated, \u201cWe will not knowingly throw good money after bad.\u201d Again, an update at May\u2019s annual meeting will be crucial. The insurance underwriting losses from the California wildfires will be seen in the first quarter, with an estimated loss of approximately $1.3 billion. Berkshire has a history of being a disciplined underwriter with a pristine balance sheet, so the short-term pain should not be an issue. Berkshire Hathaway: 2024 Pre-Tax Margin By Operating Segment Berkshire\u2019s stock price outperformed the S&P 500 in 2024, rising by 25.5% versus a total return of 25.0% from the S&P 500. Year-to-date through February 21, Berkshire\u2019s price was +5.6%, while the S&P 500 had a total return of +2.4%. Short-term results are generally not meaningful for Berkshire since it is managed with a focus on increasing long-term value and not meeting quarterly hurdles. This ability to take advantage of time arbitrage has served the company and shareholders well over the years. The goal in looking at the results is to see if the segments are generally operating as expected and consider the capital allocation decisions made by Warren Buffett. Last year, Buffett provided a handy blueprint for the goals of Berkshire\u2019s management. The first goal would be to \u201cincrease operating earnings.\u201d Secondly, success in the \u201cdecrease shares outstanding\u201d goal would boost operating earnings per share faster. Lastly, \u201chope for an occasional big opportunity,\u201d allowing for a sizable cash investment at an attractive expected return. This analysis will use Buffett\u2019s blueprint as a lens through which to evaluate how Berkshire is performing. Increase operating earnings: Fourth-quarter operating earnings were 71% higher than last year\u2019s same quarter, and 2024 was 27% above 2023. Buffett says that operating earnings are the \u201cmost descriptive\u201d way to view Berkshire since they remove the short-term volatility of market fluctuations in net earnings. Last year was exceptionally strong by this measure since Buffett said at last year\u2019s annual meeting that \u201cwe would expect our earnings should go up modestly from year to year.\u201d Berkshire Hathaway: Trailing 12 Month Operating Earnings Decrease shares outstanding: Particularly since 2018, a significant capital allocation decision has been made to increase share repurchases. When Berkshire Hathaway actively repurchases shares, it signals Buffett believes its share price is below his intrinsic value estimate. If he is correct, the purchases are a value-creator for the remaining shareholders. Berkshire has stated that there would be no stock repurchases if it would cause cash levels to fall below $30 billion, so the firm\u2019s safety will not be compromised. Operating earnings were 27% above 2023, with operating earnings per share growth of 28%, aided by modest share repurchases. Berkshire repurchased no stock in the third or fourth quarters. Share Repurchases Until an announcement in mid-2018, Berkshire had only made repurchases when the stock traded at less than 1.2 times the price-to-book (P\/B) ratio. While that constraint is now relaxed, it is still a good indicator of the general range when aggressive repurchases will likely be seen. Berkshire\u2019s price-to-book ratio remained somewhat elevated during the quarter, so share repurchases were suspended. Berkshire only intends to repurchase shares when the \u201crepurchase price is below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\u201d The price-to-book ratio remains a reasonable proxy for gauging Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value. Still, Warren Buffett\u2019s judgment about its intrinsic value versus other available uses of capital can differ from that simple price-to-book measure. Berkshire Hathaway: Price-To-Book Ratio A longer-term view of the positive impact of Berkshire\u2019s share repurchases is illuminating. Since the start of more aggressive share repurchases in 2018, Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings have grown at an 18.5% compound growth rate, while operating earnings per share have done 2.3 percentage points better at 20.8%. Berkshire Hathaway: Annualized Earnings Growth Rates Hope for an occasional big opportunity: Berkshire has a fortress balance sheet with cash and equivalents of over $334 billion. This cash hoard provides flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, including repurchasing its stock if the price declines to attractive levels. Buffett spoke directly about the significant cash position: \u201cDespite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won\u2019t change. While our ownership in marketable equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to $272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far greater than the value of the marketable portfolio.\u201d He also noted: \u201cOften, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities.\u201d Cash as a percentage of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s size is the highest since we have data at 29%. At least some of that abnormally large cash stake is likely driven by a lack of \u201ccompelling\u201d investment opportunities within Buffett\u2019s circle of competence. Share repurchases might be off the table for now, removing one lever for Buffett to create value. Despite Berkshire shares being too dear relative to Buffett\u2019s estimate of intrinsic value for share repurchases, shareholders should take comfort in knowing that the firm continues to be managed to survive and emerge stronger from any economic or market downturn by being in a financial position to take advantage of opportunities during a crisis. Berkshire Hathaway: Cash As A Percent of Total Assets The insurance business was the primary driver of the robust positive operating earnings growth in 2024, but even operating income growth excluding insurance hit the double-digits. This was all despite 53% of Berkshire\u2019s 189 operating companies seeing earnings declines in 2024. As a somber note within his annual letter, Buffett stated: \u201cAt 94, it won\u2019t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters.\u201d Buffett showed his faith in Greg Abel\u2019s capabilities to successfully run Berkshire Hathaway when he compared Abel\u2019s ability to act decisively when opportunities presented themselves to Charlie Munger's. I am a long-time shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO. Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\/A, BRK\/B) and other companies mentioned within its recommended investment strategies.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"Florida residents have been inundated with stories about insurers saying they don't have enough money to pay claims in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Michael, but that's because they were siphoning off the profits to their parent companies and affiliates to the tune of billions of dollars, according to a study obtained by the Miami Herald\/Times.  The start of the state\u2019s insurance market meltdown came on the heels of those two storms between 2017 and 2019, as companies justified big rate increases to cover their losses.  But those financial hardships don\u2019t tell the full story, according to the 2022 study that has never been made public and was released to the Herald\/Times after a two-year wait for public records.  The report, the most in-depth dive into the byzantine finances of Florida\u2019s homeowners insurance market, reveals that as the insurance market was ailing and companies were losing money, executives distributed $680 million in dividends to shareholders while diverting billions more to affiliate companies. Executives with most Florida-based insurers were removing so much money from their companies that they violated state regulations, the study\u2019s author concluded.  The result left some insurers financially weaker \u2014 and potentially unable to pay claims \u2014 heading into the depths of the state\u2019s insurance crisis. State lawmakers never saw the report. The state\u2019s then-insurance commissioner and Gov. Ron DeSantis focused on legal reforms making it harder to sue insurers. How about that. When I was a reporter, I once had an interview that ran over several hours because a Republican state official was explaining to me the political ins and outs of the insurance market. I've never forgotten one thing he said: \"Follow the insurance and bonds. That's where all the payoffs are hidden.\" So if Ron DeSantis is going out of his way to make taxpayers reimburse the \"stressed\" insurance market in Florida, he just might be in on the scam.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"** FIRST DROP HAS SOLD OUT - SUPPLIER HAS AGREED TO HOLD PRICING BUT DISPATCH OF ORDERS FROM NOW FORWARD MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER (MID MARCH DISPATCH) ** Hi Ozbargainers, If there is something I have learned about Ozbargainers, its that - many of you are balding.  Don't worry, I can help you with that\u2026.. We sell THOUSANDS of bottles of Minoxidil Extra Strength per year to you guys (and to a few gals), so much in fact an old rep friend noticed our sales were booming and has reached out from his new company to offer me a deal on one of their latest products - Restor (5% Minoxidil). Key selling features of this product  * Made in Oz * Spray Application (no more dripper) * CHEAPEST IN MARKET (enter Ozbargain opportunity). I have committed to help get this product off the ground and have a large order incoming to our store.  Part of the agreement made was that I would take all stock at a certain wholesaler, with the balance of stocking to come in shortly thereafter from another supply.  So while technically this isn't really a presale as I have stock on hand, I only have enough product on hand for 20-30 Ozbargain orders which will pack and ship tonight, with the balance of stock then dispatching in around 1 week - if you are happy with this arrangement please consider this deal, so unless you order in the first few mins of the deal, your order will most likely ship in 1 week or so.  Based on previous Ozbargain deals for Minox that we'll sell several hundred bottles.  I am expecting that once this product becomes more mainstream the price will rise, so here is your chance to lock in 8 months supply from my first supply drop. Item: 8 Months Supply, Minoxidil Extra Strength 5% - RESTOR (Made in Australia) Link: https:\/\/pharmacysavings.com.au\/products\/restor-minoxidil-5-e\u2026  Price: $72.99 Code: NOT REQUIRED Exp: END December 2026 Delivery: FREE with tracking, select free post at checkout Please note as mentioned I have some stock on hand (as in can process and pack\/post now) but I expect the majority of orders for this product will be processed around 5-6th March, when all stock arrives in store. If you want guaranteed dispatch of product NOW, our trusty old Generic Health Minoxidil is still powering along very strongly and in stock for immediate dispatch tonight: https:\/\/pharmacysavings.com.au\/products\/minoxidil-extra-stre\u2026 LOTS as in hundreds of you - missed out on our last deal which was the 50x Cetirizine Offer: https:\/\/www.ozbargain.com.au\/node\/894400 I have pulled all shelf stock from our store, which expires END NOVEMBER 2025 - and made it available for $8.99 for anyone still looking (use the code on the previous deal page) If you are looking for BULK Cetirzine - these older deals may appeal: *  200x Cetrine @ $19.99: https:\/\/www.ozbargain.com.au\/node\/834351 *  420x Cetrine 10mg & 70x Loratadine - $49.99 https:\/\/www.ozbargain.com.au\/node\/887664 Good price, however i went with the oral 2.5mg daily. But if you hair follicles lack the enzyme to convert minoxidil to active form, it becomes useless. Also before spending money on minoxidil and fin, there is a genetic test kit for male baldness for $199 - $219 which will give you a 99% accurate result if your prone to baldness Does oral minoxidil also require the enzyme? If you don't achieve hair growth with the topical, is oral minoxidil likely to be ineffective too? Oral minoxidil will convert  to active form via enzyme (i think in the liver). Topical minoxidil requires the follicles to produce the enzyme, some people lack the enzyme in follicles Thanks. That's really useful intel. My mom took Q10 and collagen pills until the doctor said too much from a blood test. She ate lots of meat steak at the time, so I guess she overdid but should be temporarily. Is that the enzyme you talking about? are you an American??? Do you mean the test kit will let you know if minoxidil will have any effect?  And second what Kategs asked. Test kit will let you know if you will go bald Wait, so you think you can sell this to OzBargainers who aren't even starting to bald yet? LOL @GandalfTheCheap: Hair shedding and thinning has multiple causes. Test will confirm the conditions that min and fin are traditionally prescribed for @easternculture: Wow, didn't know such test existed. Okay so I don't think my hair is thinning or my head is shedding any excess hair. As a matter of fact, all my hairdressers \"complain\" to me that I have too much hair. But my dad is balding (so he is taking medicine like you) and almost all of my paternal uncles + paternal grandfather are bald. On my mum side, they have full hair but it still doesn't give me a sense of certainty for the future. With this test, do you just go to GP to order one? And with medication, do people take it before they start to notice that they are losing hair? @lyoo01: Its called Tricho Test. Its about $250 and looks at 50+ genes connected to hair loss. GP needs to order it for you. GP will generally start you on fin and min with first signs of hair loss if they suspect male pattern baldness also known as androgenic alopecia which is caused by the biproduct of test converstion in body aka DHT. Fin will block up to 90% of DHT while min will encourage hair growth by promoting better blood circulation around hair follicles IMO, better to do test to confirm because it will save you $200+ per year if it confirms you dont have the genes @easternculture: Thank you. I can tell you, if you spend to much time on OzB, then you will go bald.  No need for a test! OzB wisely\u2026 lol Is this wrong then? \u201cThere is no genetic test currently available to predict whether you will experience male pattern baldness.\u201d https:\/\/www.healthdirect.gov.au\/amp\/article\/male-pattern-bal\u2026 From your article In most cases, male pattern baldness is hereditary (genetic) and can't be prevented The test will confirm this https:\/\/easydna.com.au\/dna-tests\/alopecia-dna-test\/ Yeah it\u2019s hereditary\/genetic. It\u2019s not saying it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just saying there\u2019s currently no test for whether you\u2019ll manifest it or not. Anyway, it\u2019s from an official Australian government website so it could be wrong. Obviously I\u2019m all up for eradicating this malady from all men as much as the next guy. @CuteWittleCorgi: @easternculture I wanted to chime in here on the genetic testing because I can help. I'm a medical doctor, my practice is private hospital general care but I have a personal special interest in androgenetic alopecia. I want to confirm that genetic testing is not a standardised practice for the condition. The genetic predispositions are multifaceted and idiopathic (essentially unknown) - it includes very many genes and a complicated interplay between their expressions. Genetic testing can not be interpreted in any useful way. That's important because there are a lot of private, largely online, pathology services that can sell you testing out-of-pocket. But they are rarely of much utility, and any test can be ordered by a doctor and more importantly considered and discussed between patient and doctor to derive an objective meaning from them. Yes, there is friction in having an appointment and having those discussions, but that's where the value is (not to mention Medicare bulk-billed access to pathology services). I would advise to definitely save your $$ on any marketed online testing. The broadest tool to use for androgenetic alopecia is the Norwood scale. You are making a visual comparison of your scalp, particularly your temples (front corners) and vertex (top and back), to a set of pictures of typical male-patterned baldness progression. All men follow a similar progression - typically temporal regression is the earliest indicator (and can be missed when subtle because it's misinterpreted as a widow's peak until it gets deeper). If you want to get a bit more scientific about it, you can see a dermatologist who has methods to do follicle counts, but that's probably unnecessary for most. It's better to think of androgenetic alopecia as less than a disease and more of a natural marker of aging. Although everyone has different rates and progression of hair loss, it does affect everyone to varying degrees, as that's the accumulative effect of exposure to DHT (the tissue version of testosterone) to the scalp, and your (complex) genetic predisposition determines that. Even look closely at post-menopausal women, and the silver foxes who's family say he kept a \"full set of hair,\" and you will see signs of androgenetic alopecia such as some temporal recession and vertex thinning. @muwu: Thank you for your input. If a patient walked in and asked to see how he can keep most of his current hair (before excess hair loss starts), would you recommend prescription of these drugs before these symptoms? @lyoo01: If the patient has a concern for hair loss and values it, I would start with topical minoxidil liquid form bd, as well as some ketoconazole shampoo once-twice week. The reason for that is because they are the simplest interventions to initiate, and have almost no downside. They aren't very effective, but that may be most appropriate if hair loss is minimal and to make a start pre-emptively. The other issue is use of topical minoxidil is arduous for most and compliance often lacks eventually, so talking about how to optimise it's use or consider oral minoxidil might be needed at some point. If hair loss is starting to advance, we ultimately need to start a consideration for alpha-2 reductase inhibitors (like finasteride) which is by far the most effective treatment. @muwu: So whats your view on the Tricho Test @easternculture: As above. There is no useful data for anyone there. @muwu: I respect your opinion but i still think it is a useful test to rule out any probability of hair loss , especially MPB. Ill be doing it in the next month or so @easternculture: Your individual choice. Perhaps the best thought exercise is, what's the downside of having data that can not be definitively interpreted? As an example, say a for-profit company sells you a pricey service with the expectation that you will get an answer to a question you enter the transaction with. It's a binary outcome only (which is how you know its a false question in the first place) - but it's either getting a \"Yes-You-Have-Androgenetic-Alopecia\" and you continue the treatment minus the cost of some off-label testing, or it's a \"No-You-Don't-Have-Androgenetic-Alopecia\" and you withdraw treatment in the trust you're definitively being decreed to that DHT isn't and will never affect your scalp. So aside from the biology of the condition in question, is the availability of the test enough for you to find value in it, or do you need to establish trust that it has an objective utility and does not present a risk? It is possible to pay for a worse outcome. @muwu: or it's a \"No-You-Don't-Have-Androgenetic-Alopecia\" and you withdraw treatment Although tests are not 100% accurate, it will offer me some type of comfort knowing that the probability of MPB is very low because id love to get off the fin and jump on a few test cycles, but thats just me @easternculture: Think harder on the testing, is my only (repeat) advice. This isn't screening where probability is relevant, this is a false positive\/negative test that has as much chance of misguiding you as it does inadvertently not misguiding you and thankfully only taking your money. As for using exogenous testosterone\u2026 I don't know your history, if you've used it before, I won't presume. I would advise any man to go on a very long journey of education before pulling the trigger on that. I would give myself 12 months minimum of reading and research, follow-up appointments with your GP to guide you, and consulting with an endocrinologist. I can disclose my personal experience. I have my own endocrinologist for a couple of unrelated endocrine issues, the lesser of which is a slightly low age-adjusted testesterone and bone mineral density. I am keenly interested in increasing bone strength and muscle bulk and strength, and my endocrinologist offered me TRT (physiological, of course), but I declined. There are so many downsides to cover, but for me the primary ones are lipid dysfunction and metabolic dysfunction and cardiac muscle remodelling (pathological) causing very premature artherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart disease. You will take decades off your life. And secondly testicular atrophy causing suppressed spermatogenesis (infertility) and suppressed endogenous testosterone (inducing endocrine primary hypogonadism). Your virility is a tough exchange to make, both in the present day and to your future self. Use of exogenous testesterone is a very very long hard think.. @muwu: Dont think an endocrinologist will prescribe you 500mg of test a week lol but anyways appreciate your replies and respect your opinion. @easternculture: You're right, we're not seeking supra-physiological levels of testosterone because we don't deal out death, quite the opposite \ud83d\ude09 @easternculture: Also as an aside, I've heard from a few non-natty bodybuilders who use finasteride along with exogenous testosterone. Just because you're blocking 70% of the conversion to DHT, doesn't mean you can't jack your total T numbers and get the strength and recovery benefits while (largely) preserving your hair. In fact I think most of them tend to use dutasteride because they block a lot more of the DHT this way as their total T skyrockets. @muwu: True but the DHT is more potent than T, theoretically you would get better gains while off fin and more DHT circulating in your body. The bulking AAS with a anabolic profile primarily convert to DHT. But again have to test this theory. @easternculture: I'm only going off the anecdotal, but I don't think there's much difference being on an alpha-2 reductase inhibitor concomitantly with exogenous testosterone, at least as far as muscular gains are concerned. You'll still blow out your coronaries and get permanent heart failure, more importantly, but on the question of skeletal muscle alone I heard it's just as good with fin @muwu: blow out your coronaries and get permanent heart failure, Your probabaly thinking about pro bodybuilders or gym bros who inject 5 to 10 mls twice weekly haha @easternculture: It is scalable, but you get most of the downside  once you're above physiological T levels and less so are the higher and higher extremes. Unfortunately there's no safe dose of supra-physiological exogenous testosterone, nor is the damage reversible. There's just no easy way to get around the fact that it IS premature death. But like most things, you get to make an individual choice. Dr. Mike Israetel speaks pretty insightful about it, he balances for himself the value of body-building against all the years he's taking off his life expectancy. Even so, still think it's impossible for a younger person in good health to make that trade - I've seen a lot of dying humans and there's nothing more important that could be traded for time, you just don't realise it until it's almost gone. @easternculture: Hate to break it to you but you have MPB, you don't need the genetic test. Elsewhere you said your hair is thinning enough for you to go on fin, and 25% of your family have it. If the test is negative, what then? You're still thinning\u2026 @fredblogs: Thing is i experiment with alot of medications and supplements and at that time i was on a few  off label meds  (thanks to 3rd  world overseas pharmacies and alldaychemist lol) and was testing out some new supplements. But due to family history and scalp examination, GP started it. @muwu: Have you seen many side effects in your patients from fin? @fredblogs: Sure. The usual that you've read about. Sexual dysfunction is the most common one, particularly reduced libido. The most important facts though are.. 1-2% of people taking low-dose finasteride report side-effects. In other words, the vast majority of people find no difference (except better hair). That studies that followed up patients up to 18mo with finasteride found no significant difference in side effects, so there is a normalisation on the medication in the longer term. And studies have shown to statistical power that all side effects are reversed after ceasing the medication. Now the internet loves to talk about \"Post Finasteride Syndrome\" - it doesn't exist in the literature, and what is anecdotally being reported by some individuals is likely sexual dysfunction due to other causes (as it's a common issue for many men relaged to a myriad of causes). @muwu: Post Finasteride Syndrome Created by reddit users @muwu: @muwu Just interested in your opinion. Ive never had a full hairline. Had high temples and thinner hair on top since primary school. Now later in life, that frontal hair is getting super thin\/ gone.  Yet ironically hair at the back of my head is super thick (clippers struggle to get through). Top is thinner than it should be, but not the center of balding. So a frontal recession of not much to beging with. I started on minoxidil years ago. Not sure if it does that much. But I felt my body hair increased significantly. I went off it for a few months. Body hair reduced, but the thin hairs on my fringe area started getting really thin. I also had some bad heart pain. I thought I was having a heart attack. Bent over in a lot of pain. Had a heap of tests, full MRI with dye.  Found no issues, zero plaque. So wondering if it is side effect of minoxidil. Still get the pains. But just living with it. So I spoke to the GP about trying finastride. He wouldn't entertain it without me speaking to dermatologist first. The dermatologist took my $200 and said the Finastride side effects are not worth it. He felt the body hair\/ heart pain side effects were unrelated, and would only give me a script for oral minoxidil. I also asked about topical Finastride, and he felt that it wouldn't work. So my questions are: What is the difference between oral and topical minoxidil? I believe it started as a blood thinner. But patients got hairy as a side effect. I definitely don't want any more body hair or facial hair. I can go from shaved  clean, to looking like I've been stranded on a deserted island for years in one week.  So cruel when hair where you want it is basically gone up front. Will the oral be worse for body hair\/ facial hair than topical? What are your thoughts re: topical Finastride? I've tried Morr F. (Topical min and fin).  Nothing grows back, but I felt it was thicker. Dermatologist thought otherwise. Can I just make my own topical Finastride by dissolving oral fin in minoxidil. More F is a lot more expensive, and 50\/50 if you will get a fake. Side effects here vs oral fin? Lastly, stem cell therapy. Surely stem cells are the answer? Why don't we hear anything about this in Oz? If not stem cells, then is a hair transplant out of Turkey the only option. I've never had a good hairline (always wanted one), so all the minoxidil and fin can't entirely help. So will need something. Got enough hair at the back of my noggin to fill 5 heads. But don't want to become one of those people where all they have is the transplant lines, and the rest is gone. So want to keep the rest around. But now in a financial situation I might be able to do something. Feel a transplant is a bit \"caveman\". Lastly, the dermatologist was bald. He said why not just shave it off. I did note his head look riddled with sun spots\/ looked cancerous. I don't want that.  I like water sports (wake boarding, kite boarding, surfing, swimming snorkeling). I wear a hat always outdoors, but wearing a hat doesn't work on the water.  So really want to keep the cover on top. Sorry about the 1000 questions ,but would really appreciate your insights, as the dermatologist (which I had to wait 8 months to get seen), only succeeded in taking my $200 and giving me a script for oral minoxidil. Thanks @tunzafun001: There are side effects. @soulblighter: Definitely. Mate tried it and recons his loads turned to thick almost custard. Freaked him out and he is off it. Statistically, he may be the one of the 2 in every 100. @tunzafun001: George was freaking out too Where do you get? GP Mind sharing the cost, cheers @HitlersDad: GP consultation if they dont bulk bill = $50 to $80.

I'm about your age and hair is thinning badly. Married with kids so no one to impress (thankfully wife was never with me for my looks or lack thereof, and I'm fitter now than when we met). I'd say save your money on both the hair loss treatment and cost of haircuts and accept it. Wish AI is much more advanced for hair R&D To be honest mate if you're thinning, people have noticed already. There's nothing worse than someone trying desperately to hold onto their hair through growing it longer to hide the thinning or having a comb over. Can you grow any sort of beard or facial hair? That will help. I had the same thing, early 30's my long thick hair thinned, and I just went and shaved it all off. Now I have a beard and look 10x better. You have to make a value judgement and decide what you want. Just know there are options either way. For treating androgenetic alopecia, you do need to maintain the treatment to persists with the results. Yes if you withdraw treatment you will have a prompt (3-6mo) regression to your natural pattern of hair. The medication can slightly increase hair density, but it largely slows ongoing regression. Minoxidil has a minor effect, alpha-2 reductase inhibitors (like finasteride) has a major effect. Personally, I've had regression since 21yo and have been adopting in stages medication, finasteride and minoxidil, now 37yo and have maintained thick hair on top with a fair degree of deep temporal recession. With some styling to soften my widows peak appearance, I get complements on my hair and many don't pick up on my loss. Mate I'm a year older than you and I have been shaving my head since I was 18. By then it was done for, never to return. You made it to 42 and its started to thin, that is a great run. Be careful, if you stop using it the hair will shed and you will have less hair than if you never used it. Incorrect. You will only loose the hair that grew as a result of min. I think you mean fin This is completely incorrect. For both fin or min it will return to what it should be without using the medicines. This \ud83d\udc46 You will return to your pre-intervention natural hair regression if medication is withdraw. They do not worsen your follicle count. What is the point of this hair growth formula anyway, you are getting too old so you use this to increase your hair to meet a beautiful woman to fall in love with you, maybe start a family but your supply is cut off or it stops working and your hair falls out, what then? And the woman is wondering why you are always applying this stuff to your hair. What is the mechanism for this? \"The odds are Dimoxinil could help me grow as much, or as little hair as I want to\" - Dimoxinil actor Let the fools have their TAR-TAR SAUCE Don't get it on your hands unless you want hairy palms It's fine, just wash your hands after Palms are hairy   Something something   Mom's spaghetti Gives me too much dandruff Use ketaconazole shampoo 3 X per week That makes hair fall out Match made in heaven i\u2019d say \ud83d\ude02 @kaleidoscope: Hahahaha Ketoconazole may help with some types of hair loss, including male and female pattern baldness. It's available as a shampoo, and some people find it effective.  How it works  Ketoconazole may reduce inflammation of hair follicles It may improve the strength and appearance of hair It may reduce levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the scalp It may improve follicle health Same use minoxidil FOAM my bro. The liquid gives me terrible dandruff and irritation, foam is all good. Two questions if I could 1) How do you get the foam onto the scalp if you don't have short hair? 2) Do you have to wash your hair afterwards, e.g. if you use it at night, does your hair look horrible after waking up requiring a wash?

Liverpool are now 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League with 11 games to go after capitalising on Arsenal's defeat at home to West Ham by winning 2-0 at Manchester City with a dominant display against the champions. Arsenal were forced to play midfielder Mikel Merino up front against West Ham after losing first-choice strikers Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus to season-ending injuries, while Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli are also out. Arsenal knew they would be without Saka and Jesus for the foreseeable with time left in the transfer window, but decided against signing a forward before Havertz and Martinelli were also sidelined and they appear to have paid the price. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Asked if losing that forward quartet is a fair defence for falling so far behind Liverpool, Neville told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"It's a defence, but then you've got to plan for it. \"I know they didn't want to do business in the January transfer window, they thought there wasn't value in the market, or they couldn't get the player that would come in and impact them. \"But they have left themselves short, there's no doubt about that, and they've fallen short.\"                Arsenal fixtures                              Live PL table - Liverpool 11 points clear                             Stream Sky Sports with NOW                             Get Sky Sports on WhatsApp              He added: \"I know they've lost Saka and Jesus, and I know they've lost Havertz, which is a big problem for Arsenal, but I still think you've got to do that job against West Ham at home.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Neville expects Arsenal to be particularly frustrated at falling short in the season when Manchester City dropped off after finishing runners-up to the champions for the last two years. \"When City weren't going to be there, the team that had to be there was Arsenal,\" said Neville. \"It's not going to be them, it doesn't look like, and that's the big shock and surprise. That'll be the one that'll hit hardest in that Arsenal boardroom, and with Mikel Arteta and the players, because they're desperate to win a title. \"Liverpool have drawn two in the last three, they've drawn four in the last eight, Arsenal have had a chance to get back closer, they could have gone within five points [against West Ham].\" Neville also accused Mikel Arteta's side of becoming obsessed with set-pieces to the detriment of their fluidity in open play this season. \"For Arsenal, they've become quite rigid, they've become quite turgid at times to watch,\" said Neville. \"I felt there was an obsession with set-pieces, which almost overtakes the whole game, exacerbated by the fact that there's the presence of the set-piece coach on the touchline. \"I feel like the freedom's gone a little bit from them.\" Sky Sports' Zinny Boswell: Arsenal worked hard to sign a forward during the transfer window, but decided there was not a player available on the market that would have improved them. Aston Villa's winter signings, and their success in the short space of a few weeks, demonstrates that this was incorrect. Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford, loan signings from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, came with obvious risks after patchy form of late, but have made an immediate impact. Depth was clearly an issue for Villa and they addressed it by signing two experienced players on temporary deals. It begs the question of why Arsenal did not pursue a similar approach. Arsenal's first priority should undoubtedly be a striker, but they are also short on forwards, as illustrated by Arteta bringing on two left-backs, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Myles Lewis-Skelly, when trailing West Ham on Saturday. Can you imagine how much better Arsenal might have been if that had been Asensio coming off the bench? There is a sense that every signing has to be the perfect one, perhaps that is more of a reality under the current Premier League's spending rules, but that can be no excuse for Arsenal here. Adding bodies was crucial. The lack of a permanent replacement for sporting director Edu Gaspar may have played a role. So too could the lack of goalscorers at the elite level. Whatever the issue, Arsenal have left themselves short in the season City have fallen out of contention. And it has surely cost them the title.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"There was no \u201cBidenflation\u201d from 2021 to 2022. History books will make clear that there were rising prices, not inflation. There\u2019s a difference. Just the same, the dollar has declined fairly substantially from March of 2022 until the present, thus the actual inflation that has some worried in the present. Bidenflation from 2021-2022 was the headfake, while what we\u2019re seeing now is the real thing. That the Fed\u2019s rate hikes did nothing to arrest both the headfake and the real thing was and is a statement of the obvious. But first, let\u2019s backtrack to go over what pundits, politicians and economists on the left and right imagined to be inflation in 2021-22, even though it wasn\u2019t. Republicans near monolithically joined prominent Democrats including Larry Summers and Jason Furman in saying government spending signed into law by President Biden ignited the 2021-22 spike in prices that they described as inflation. The explanation from the right was that the spending created \u201cexcess demand,\u201d while those on the left actually believe against all rationality that government spending boosts economic growth. For the right, the problem was and is that all demand begins with supply, and governments supply nothing. They can only spend insofar as those producing have less to spend. Republicans seemingly knew this but chose to politicize inflation, while Democrats still broadly believe once again that government is an \u201cother\u201d capable of creating demand. It should be added that even if it were true that government spending had increased demand (in reality, it\u2019s impossible), this wouldn\u2019t be evidence of inflation as is. Economics is about tradeoffs. If demand is pushing up prices of certain market goods, the latter presumes commensurate price declines for other goods. None of this is to say that prices weren\u2019t elevated in 2021-22, but it is to say that the elevation had an obvious origin: think the lockdowns related to the coronavirus that revealed their ugly self in March of 2020. The lockdowns were global in nature, and subsequent price surges revealed just how interconnected the global economy was and is. That\u2019s because the biggest factor (by far) when it comes to market prices is the number of hands and machines at work in the creation of market goods. Lockdowns of varying duration eviscerated this incredibly sophisticated global cooperation to varying degrees, and with predictable results: prices didn\u2019t surge during and after the lockdowns because of demand outstripping supply (an impossibility as is since the former is a direct effect of the latter), but because fewer hands and machines were working together in 2021-22 relative to 2020. Global production symmetry that took decades to build will surely take years to rebuild, thus prices that remain elevated to this day. Still, command-and-control in the form of globalized shutdowns is decidedly not inflation. Inflation is one thing: a decline in the unit of measure. And as written last week, the dollar didn\u2019t decline in any notable way from 2021-22. The gold signal was clear that \u201cBidenflation\u201d was a myth. Rather than acknowledge the dollar\u2019s relative stability as a signal of a lack of inflation, Democrats and Republicans joined hands again in saying the Fed must fiddle with interest rates to arrest the higher prices that they mistook for inflation. Economic historians will marvel at the monolithically wrongheaded approach. See above. Falling prices are yet again an effect of a growing number of hands and machines at work in the production of market goods, thus the obvious prescription for what ails us: free trade and never again using economic contraction as a virus mitigation strategy. If so, prices will take care of themselves. Instead, the left\/right consensus was market intervention. Notable there is that when the Fed began hiking in March of 2022, the price of gold was roughly $1950\/ounce. To be clear about the Fed\u2019s actions, to suggest that higher rates would strengthen the dollar is like saying a facelift will fix a broken leg. It\u2019s a total non sequitur. And markets agreed. After 525 basis points of rate hikes the dollar price of gold had risen all the way to $2559. And the dollar has continued to weaken. Gold today sits at nearly $3,000 an ounce as both sides reveal how little they understand inflation. And markets have responded wisely. Without guidance from the Biden Treasury, or Trump\u2019s, the dollar continues to reveal the bitter fruits of the absence of concept that is \u201cbenign neglect.\u201d You fix inflation with a definition of what the dollar should be, not fiddling with market signals like money in circulation and rates of interest. To fiddle with the former is to say that production is inflationary, while messing with the latter is like (rather vainly) limiting the supply of rulers as a way of strengthening the foot. No, the foot has a definition while the dollar needs one.","label":0}

Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs, own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate. They allow investors to participate in the real estate market without having to buy, manage, or finance any property directly. This provides diversification in your portfolio and a steady income stream, making them an attractive option for many investors. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are a simple way to invest in real estate without buying property. They work like stocks, meaning you can easily buy and sell them whenever you want. REITs help diversify your investment portfolio and often pay good dividends to investors. If you\u2019re watching an upcoming IPO, REITs can be a smart way to get in early on exciting new opportunities. You need to follow a few steps if you want to open a demat account: The first step is to choose a brokerage firm or financial institution that suits your investment style and goals. Look for a provider with a user-friendly online platform, reliable customer service, and competitive fees. Many brokerages today offer packages specifically tailored for beginners and seasoned investors alike. Ensure the brokerage supports REIT trading and provides insights on market trends and upcoming IPO events. Opening a demat account is similar to opening any bank account; you must submit some essential documents for identity and address verification. You should have: Once you\u2019ve chosen your brokerage and gathered the necessary documents, the next step is to fill out the application form. Most brokers offer an online form that\u2019s simple to complete. As you fill in the details, double-check for errors and ensure all information matches your supporting documents. Accuracy is key in this step, as any mismatches might delay the verification process. Many brokerages now offer an online Integrated Verification Process (IPV) that can be completed via video calls or a mobile app. However, if an in-person visit is required, schedule an appointment at the nearest branch. During this step, a representative will verify your documents and identity, which is critical to setting up your account. After the verification, you\u2019ll be asked to sign an agreement. This document outlines the terms and conditions of the demat account, the fees, and the services the brokerage provides. It\u2019s essential to read this document thoroughly and understand your responsibilities as an investor. Once signed, submit your application. The brokerage will then process your application, and once approved, you\u2019ll receive your demat account details. Linking your bank account to your demat account is essential for easy transactions. This connection lets you transfer funds directly, making investing in REITs or even participating in an upcoming IPO simple. Most brokers offer a secure online process to complete this step, ensuring that your investments are just a few clicks away. Now that your demat account is active, you\u2019re ready to invest. With your account set up, you can purchase REITs directly through your brokerage platform. Browse the available REITs and compare their performance, dividend history, and property portfolio. Many platforms also offer research reports and expert analysis, which can help you make informed decisions.

{"date":"2025-02-23","content":"   Print   Yoshiko Abe is about to turn 89, but that hasn't stopped her from going to the gym every day and trying the free-of-charge makeup course at her housing complex.  \"It was really helpful,\" she said, all smiles and glowing after putting on foundation and pink lipstick, something she hadn't done in years.  Japan has the largest percentage of older citizens than any other country in the world. More than a quarter of Japan's population is 65 and older, at 36 million people. In about a decade, the ratio will be one in three.  No wonder the young-at-heart, like Abe, is a growing target for Japan Inc.  The market for older people is estimated to grow to more than 100 trillion yen ($650 billion) in size this year, according to a study by Mizuho Bank. And that business isn't just about remedies for sicknesses and old folks' homes but taps into solid consumerism. The growth of artificial intelligence and robotics also offers promise for such services and gadgetry. Akira Shimizu, professor of business at Keio University, calls them \"cool grandpas and cute grannies\" who remain sensitive to trends, including the latest luxury and health products.  \"They think about the clothing and makeup that express their style,\" he said.  From luxury cruises and \"oldies\" rock concerts, companies are leveraging the fact that older people these days remain active, go out with friends and on dates, so they want to dress up and look good, said Shimizu.  Maintaining one's looks is good physical exercise because it takes hand agility to open cosmetics tubes and draw eyebrows nicely, and massaging the face gets one's saliva glands going, according to Miwa Hiraku, the makeover class instructor from the Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido.  Shiseido Co., which started out as a pharmacy in 1872, said that makeup is not just good for your physical well-being but also your soul.  The company has been holding free makeup courses for older people across the country. \"Putting on makeup works as a switch to turn on your energy at the start of your day,\" said Hiraku, who vows to wear makeup even at 100. \"It's not just about looking beautiful. It's about living a long healthy life.\"  Yoshihiko Hotta, 85, the only man in the class of about 30 people, didn't try the rouge but happily put on the hand cream and went along with all the exercise routines. While acknowledging he felt some effects of aging like sore legs, he declared with conviction: \"I don't think age is relevant.\"  ","label":0}
