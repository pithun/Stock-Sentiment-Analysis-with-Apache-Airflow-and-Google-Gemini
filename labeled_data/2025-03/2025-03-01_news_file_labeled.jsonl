{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"It is the season for affordable smartphones to duke it out among one another. We had Apple, we\u2019re expecting Google, and Samsung just threw its roster into the ring. The Galaxy A-series is set to be refreshed next month. It starts with the Galaxy A36 starting at $400, then the Galaxy A26 at $300. The Galaxy A56 starts at $500 and will also get a bump, though there\u2019s no expected release date yet. All three devices have \u201cAwesome Intelligence,\u201d which seems to be Samsung\u2019s rebranding of Galaxy AI for its lower-cost devices. The Galaxy A56, A36, and A26 all come with the same size screen, though they each offer a different tier of essentials. Each phone has a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate\u2014not a standard spec at this price point\u2014and a 5,000 mAh battery to accommodate it. All phones start with 128GB of storage. Samsung\u2019s Exynos 1580 chipset powers the Galaxy A56, while the Galaxy A26 and A26 run Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 platform. Only the Galaxy A56 offers 8GB of RAM, while the A36 and A26 are stuck with 6 GB. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Awesome Intelligence works, considering the flagships have all gone the opposite way in adopting more RAM to accommodate AI. Software updates are also locked in here; Samsung promises six years of support and Android OS updates. The camera systems in the A-series all vary, but only bit by bit. The Galaxy A56 considered the \u201chighest\u201d tier of the trio, has a 12-MP ultrawide camera, a 50-MP primary camera, a 5-MP Macro camera, and a 12-MP front-facing camera. The Galaxy A36, starting at $300, has the same primary camera but is dialed down to an 8-MP ultrawide camera and a 5-MP macro camera. There\u2019s also a 12-MP front camera. The Galaxy A26, the cheapest at $300, has all that except a 20-MP macro camera and a 13-MP front camera. What exactly is \u201cawesome intelligence,\u201d you are likely asking yourself? It\u2019s Samsung\u2019s attempt at rebranding artificial intelligence for its budget lineup of phones. It\u2019s good for Samsung to come up with a way to differentiate its product from Galaxy AI, as that sounds more \u201cforward-thinking\u201d than being \u201cawesome.\u201d Awesome Intelligence will let you use key Google Gemini abilities, like Circle to Search, including the new ability launched to the Galaxy S25 series that helps you identify a song. It\u2019ll also give you access to Galaxy AI features like Object Eraser. Beyond a few other key Samsung features, like Nightography algorithms in the camera app, that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s enough Awesome Intelligence to make you say, \u201cAwesome!\u201d or something like that. This is a slightly different approach from Apple and Google, which use the same processor for their flagship and lower-cost devices to offer parity of software across the ecosystem. Samsung chose instead to lean into where its manufacturing prowess remains strong. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll see killer screens and bigger batteries on Samsung\u2019s budget-friendly phones. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Samsung continues paring down AI features from flagships to the lower-cost subset and what it will deem \u201cessential\u201d features for Awesome Intelligence.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Investors have enjoyed sunny days over the last two-and-a-half years thanks to a strong economy and enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. But at some point, it's going to rain, warns Smead Capital Management founder Bill Smead. Smead styles himself as a modern-day Noah of the financial world, drawing on the biblical tale of Noah's Ark. By that he means he's continuing to lean into value stocks as the growth factor remains frothy. \"Everything we have studied about common stocks, including The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham, A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith, and from listening to the wise words of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett for decades leads us to believe that we must build a common stock portfolio which will float when the multi-year bear market creates a waterfall of selling among magnificent growth stocks and passive S&P 500 Index owners,\" Smead wrote in a recent letter to investors. Smead's downcast outlook stems in part from how fast this rally has unfolded. \"It is the most all-encompassing momentum market of my 45 years in the investing business,\" he wrote. The prospect of persistent inflation also concerns Smead. He said the mismatch between commodity supplies and the high demand for them will keep prices rising, as will ongoing wage increases. \"Ask the dock workers or Boeing machinists what a long-term union contract that raises your income 8.5% per year compounded means,\" Smead wrote. \"Ask the U.S. Postal Service why they are raising last-mile delivery prices by 60% and forcing UPS to cut Amazon deliveries in half!\" Inflation has proved sticky since coming down from its 2022 highs, sitting consistently in a range near 3%. President Donald Trump's tariff threats have incited fears of a further reignition of inflation. Rising prices have historically been bad news for stocks when they're highly expensive, particularly those of the growth tilt. Right now, stocks are at some of their highest valuation levels in history as far as the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio goes. However, some investors have also started to worry that\u00a0economic growth could start to slow\u00a0enough to send the economy into recession. Falling yields on the 10-year Treasury note, a risk-free asset, are one signal that investors are seeking safety. Yields on bonds fall when their prices rise. For the moment, however, jobless claims have remained virtually flat. One might expect a value manager like Smead to have a gloomy forecast in a growth-driven market like this. But there's no denying Smead's eye for picking winners. According to Morningstar data, his Smead Value Fund (SMVLX) has beaten 97% of similar funds over the last 15 years. He also crushed the S&P 500 in 2021 and 2022 before AI exuberance sent the benchmark index soaring. In 2021, Smead returned 37% compared to the S&P 500's 26.9%. And in 2022, when the S&P 500 fell 19.4%, SMVLX was down only 4.4%. Smead's current top-five holdings in order include Simon Property Group (SPG), American Express (AXP), Macerich (MAC), Merck (MRK), and DR Horton (DHI). All of them have weightings above 5%.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"There has been little good news to come out of Intel in recent memory, and now the storied chipmaker has announced it will postpone the opening of a new Ohio semiconductor factory that was originally slated to begin operating this year. The company said Friday it will not will be finished with construction on the plant until 2030, and likely begin production in 2031. Bloomberg earlier reported on the news. The announcement is a blow to the United States\u2019 ambition to become a semiconductor superpower. Intel is a major centerpiece of the plan that would help America become less exposed to Taiwan as it faces threats from China. Intel is set to receive $7.9 billion in funding from the federal government through the CHIPS Act, but the company must reach certain milestones, from construction to starting production. The CHIPS Act was a bill put forth by President Biden that received bipartisan support to bring chip production back to the U.S. Reports indicate that President Trump is delaying payments and looking to renegotiate terms of some of the deals with chipmakers set to receive funding, potentially slowing down Intel at a time when rivals are only speeding up. Among other concerns, the Trump administration wants to remove requirements that new factories offer workers paid paternal leave. Intel already has chip manufacturing located domestically, but primarily to build its own chipsets. Its business making chips for other clients has never quite taken off, as experts have said the company was not adept at catering to other companies\u2019 needs like Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, today the largest chipmaker in the world that has perfected advanced nanometer-process semiconductors at scale. President Trump earlier this week declined to say whether or not the U.S. would intervene should Taiwan be invaded by China. Some estimates suggest that if China took over Taiwan and cut off access to TSMC, the U.S. economy could lose 8% of GDP and untold numbers of jobs, since many electronics rely on TSMC-built chips. Intel was always going to be a risky bet for a U.S. chip renaissance. The company, once a shining beacon of Silicon Valley, missed numerous major technological shifts, most famously declining to develop a mobile chip for the original iPhone, ceding the smartphone business to the likes of Arm and Apple. It never invested heavily in GPUs either, leading Nvidia to recently become one of the biggest companies in the world and capture much of the profit from the AI boom. Intel tried getting into the business of developing mobile cellular antennas, but abandoned that venture and sold it to Apple, which recently launched the iPhone 16e with its first modem. And with low-powered chips originally designed for mobile becoming more capable, Intel is even losing ground in PCs. It has been miss after miss for Intel as it never quite focused its energy on the right bets, and has strong competitors eating away at its market share from every direction. Some critics argue Intel should focus on what it always did best: Chip design. The idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law\u00e2\u0080\u009d came out of the company. The idea theorized that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, making smaller chips more capable. But TSMC has it beaten there at scale today. Maybe because of intense Taiwanese work ethic, maybe because Intel lost focus. Recent reports have suggested that Intel is considering the possibility of splitting up entirely, selling its chip design business to Broadcom and the manufacturing side to TSMC. The company has laid off thousands of employees in recent years amid shrinking sales and increasing losses; its stock is down more than 50% in the past five years. It is unclear whether the Trump administration would allow TSMC to take over Intel\u2019s factories, considering it is a foreign company. It all goes to show how even once-great titans of industry can fall from grace through management missteps, and perhaps explains why the big tech companies today are pouring billions into AI before knowing whether or not returns will come. They do not want to be the next Intel.  chipsIntelSemiconductors  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 CEO Lip-Bu Tan's wants Intel to be an \u00e2\u0080\u009cengineering-focused company.\u00e2\u0080\u009d                     Plus, there's a Lenovo laptop with a 3D screen, one with a vertical folding display, and another with literal wings.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations. There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine. Apple discontinued the AirPort line in 2018, but the company could return to the Wi-Fi router market in an unexpected way in the future. Back in December, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Apple was developing its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that will debut in new Apple TV and HomePod mini models later this year. He said the chip is \"so sophisticated\" that it could \"theoretically\" turn these devices into a wireless access point. However, it is unclear if Apple will actually follow through with that idea, so temper your expectations for the time being. Apple is reportedly aiming to make a bigger push into smart home products, with the company rumored to be planning an all-new smart home hub for release later this year. Apple is also said to be planning a HomeKit-enabled smart home camera that can connect to the hub, and together the products could serve as a home security system. If future Apple TV and\/or HomePod models could effectively double as AirPort routers for Wi-Fi, that would be another way for Apple to expand its presence in the smart home market. Apple's chip will support Wi-Fi 6E, according to Gurman, whereas the final AirPort models supported what is now known as Wi-Fi 5. However, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu believes the chip will actually support Wi-Fi 7. It remains to be seen if the Apple TV and HomePod actually become Wi-Fi routers, but Apple is seemingly developing technology that allows for it. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Wall Street strategists in the last year have pointed to a key reason stocks are likely to keep pushing higher: the mountain of cash on the sidelines. There's a record $6.9 trillion in money market funds, according to data from Bank of America. The theory goes that as soon as the stock market sees a compelling dip, investors will rush in, deploying their cash and preventing any downturn from spiraling out of control. The idea gained steam in September when the Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates, which made holding cash slightly less attractive. The hope was that as yields on safer assets came down, investors would flock back to the stock market and spur a fresh run of gains.  But if the bulls are counting on\u00a0a \"wall of money\"\u00a0to rescue the stock market during its next big sell-off, they might adjust their thinking.  Here's why.  The problem with this bif the bull thesis is that much of the increase in assets in money market funds is being driven by cash optimization decisions among investors, according to Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. \"During the period of rising money market assets, the level of M1, which included checking accounts but not money market assets, declined by over $2 trillion, indicating that the increase in money market balances was mostly optimization activity and not risk reduction activity,\" Hatfield told BI. In other words, investors took advantage of 5% cash yields by transferring their money out of low-yielding bank checking accounts and transferring it into money market funds. As long as cash yields don't crash to zero, it's unlikely that cash on the sidelines will seek other investment opportunities. And even if yields did tumble to 0%, that probably means the economy is in trouble, in which case investors will probably not be eager to move their risk-free cash into a more volatile asset like stocks.  According to Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at the Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, the record $7 trillion in cash isn't all that impressive an amount, at least on a relative basis. A data analysis by Tentarelli showed that money market cash has been steadily declining as a percentage of the S&P 500's total market capitalization even as the absolute number has hit records. The data point is ultimately noise for Tentarelli, who thinks it should be ignored. \"I don't know that we should expect a sudden influx of cash into the equity markets from money market funds or that this 'dry powder' should be considered as either bullish (money ready to come in) or bearish (investors scared to commit),\" Tentarelli said in an email to BI. To be sure, some investors sitting on cash are waiting to pounce on any significant stock market decline. Ben Hunt, a retail investor from Kentucky, told BI earlier this month that he viewed the stock market as ripe for a correction and believed investors were exhibiting signs of exuberance. This key behavior has historically occurred right before a market peak. \"I plan to raise up to 50% cash in my portfolio before the end of the quarter,\" Hunt said, adding that he was already at 30% cash in his portfolio. Hunt said he would use that cash to strategically buy a bigger decline in the stock market, \"hopefully at lower prices.\" In any case, dip buyers don't seem to see any bargains just yet as the stock market declines on worries of fading economic growth. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are down 4.5% and 7.5% since their peaks in mid-February and have yet to stage any significant bounceback. Jump to","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":" Since its unveiling in 2020, the Sydney Fish Market is nearing completion, boasting an impressive timber roof crafted to mimic the appearance of fish scales and weighing a substantial 2,500 tons. This architectural marvel is the brainchild of the Danish studio 3XN, working in partnership with BVN, GXN Innovation, and Aspect Studios. The project forms a key component of a broader initiative aimed at revitalizing Blackwattle Bay, infusing new life and vibrancy into this part of the city. Designer: 3Xn, BVN, GXN Innovation, & Aspect Studios       The roof stands out as the most impressive feature of the Sydney Fish Market. It spans an impressive length of 200 meters (656 feet), and its intricate structure comprises 594 glulam (glued laminated wood) roof beams. The longest of these beams extends up to 32 meters (104 feet), creating a sturdy framework topped with aluminum panels designed to resemble fish scales. Installing this architectural innovation was no easy task. Over the years, the team used three cranes, each weighing as much as 17 passenger cars, into their precise positions. The roof incorporates integrated solar panels, significantly reducing the building\u2019s reliance on the grid for electricity. A rainwater collection system supports irrigation needs, enhancing the building\u2019s sustainability. The roof also features skylights that allow indirect sunlight to illuminate the interior\u2019s upper levels, creating a naturally bright and inviting space. Multiplex, the construction company behind the project, declares it the largest roof of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, highlighting its impressive design and engineering achievements.  As the Sydney Fish Market approaches the final stages of its construction, a few tasks still need to be completed before it can open its doors to the public. The roof still needs some finishing touches, including essential waterproofing that will be completed in the upcoming weeks. The interior still needs some work to be done, and it will be filled with natural light, owing to the skylights, and the stunning transparent facade composed of aluminum and glass, complemented by glazed louvers. This combination enhances the building\u2019s aesthetic appeal but also ensures a bright and welcoming atmosphere inside. The interior space is marked by an open and flexible layout designed to accommodate a variety of functions and activities. On the outside, the market is surrounded by public plazas, inviting gatherings and community interactions in the adjacent areas. The project is moving towards completion and will open in the coming months, serving as a vibrant addition to the city\u2019s architectural landscape and a bustling hub for locals and visitors. \u201cThis building will serve many functions when it is completed: a vibrant fish market, an attractive amenity for the city, a cultural destination, an urban connector, and an inspiring icon along the world-renowned Sydney Harbour,\u201d said Kim Herforth Nielsen, Founding Partner and Creative Director, 3XN.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByJohn S. Tobey  ByJohn S. Tobey , Contributor.  It is time to think twice before taking on more risk Now is a challenging time for consumers, economists, businesses and investors (including professionals). Multiple, diverse concerns are heightening uncertainties dramatically, putting the U.S. stock market at risk. There are three risk areas to examine: Normal, Federal Reserve, U.S. Government. Here are my two previous articles that address these growing \u201cnormal\u201d risks. December 28 - \"Eight Issues Could Undermine The 2025 U.S. Stock Market\" \"As the 2025 New Year\u2019s excitement ends, look for the U.S. stock market to falter. It is carrying a lopsided enthusiasm from 2024, so 2025 could be a period of adjustment. There are eight issues that have begun to undermine the stock market's shaky support.\" February 14 - \"Wall Street's Four Bullish Views Will Likely Reverse\" \"The stock market's behavior is the gauge by which we can measure Wall Street's attitude and outlook. Clearly, today's reading continues to be one of bullish optimism. \"However, there is a problem with following Wall Street's current enthusiasm. The four bullish views cited as reasons to own stocks carry the risk of having reality chip away at the optimistic rationale.\" The Fed\u2019s reputation continues to be as a provider of growth and bullishness by lowering interest rates. This 15-year experiment of the Fed overriding capital market rates has unproven benefits, but its drawbacks are clear: However, it appears that the capital markets (aka Wall Street) have finally begun to act independently. I explained how this shift could occur in my December 31 article: \"2025\u2019s Outlook: Capital Markets Will Correct Federal Reserve Irregularities\" \"Time's up. The fallacy-driven beliefs and actions have had their turn. Once again, the visible irregularities are stretched. Therefore, the misshaped environment is ready to produce profits from reality-driven investing.\" The \"abnormal\u201d adjective is serious. It means rarely or never before used government actions and behavior. Additionally, the actions are significant, sizable and rushed. Moreover, there is no congressional input, only President Trump\u2019s minimal explanations of his executive orders. Therefore, there are now many serious uncertainties regarding the U.S. Government actions\u2019 effects on the economy, businesses, labor, consumers and investors. So, when will the results be known? Probably not until the latter half of 2025, when the completed actions are evaluated alongside the then-visible results. Since Wall Street typically looks six months ahead, it is currently faced with a widespread list of possible outcomes, many of them with unknown negatives. Wall Street and investors necessarily focus on the future. Normally, that means judging the likelihoods of issues like economic growth, consumer behavior and business developments. However, those items now are blanketed by overriding uncertainties. Thus, likelihoods are harder to determine, and the risk of negative outcomes is high. Naturally, that means a shrinking interest in buying and owning risk-based investments \u2014 hence, markets fall.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"     Exclusive: The video game-inspired blaster line arrives at the New York Toy Fair with swappable parts.    Nerf's new Loadout line, revealed Saturday as Toy Fair kicks off in New York, features interchangeable parts that make the blasters endlessly customizable. This includes barrel attachments, scopes and other accessories that can be mixed and matched between the six Loadout blasters. Each use the newer Nerf\u00a0N1 darts that debuted last summer. The $50 Nerf Galactic Commander blaster will be available in July. The Nerf Loadout blasters are set for release starting in July, and the headlining Galactic Commander blaster costs $50. It includes three firing modes (semi automatic, three-dart burst and automatic) along with attachments like a scope, clip storage stock and barrel attachment. Other blasters in the series will cost between $15 and $25, including the $15 Shadowspeed Recon with a 14-dart storage attachment for reloading and the $30 Cyberlight Ghost with glowing LED lights. Each blaster has its own color theme, which can carry over to other blasters when mixing the various attachments. For instance, Nerf suggests mixing up the Frostfusion and Flarefusion sets if one wants a blaster with both ice and magma aesthetics. Nerf's giving the Loadout line a video game theme, and while there are no official video game partners with the line, each blaster does feature vivid colors that could fit in with the styles we see in games like Fortnite or Overwatch. You can check out the full Nerf Loadout line in the gallery below. The Nerf Loadout line launches alongside two new additions to the company's Gelfire line that uses gel-based ammo that pops instead of needing to be picked up like darts.\u00a0 The $70 Nerf Pro Gelfire Warp Speed can hold 2,000 rounds of gel-based ammo. The $70 Nerf Pro Gelfire Warp Speed holds up to 2,000 rounds and can fire at a velocity of 150 feet per second. The $20 Gelfire Pronto holds 800 rounds and can shoot at the same velocity of 150 feet per second.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"A Mumbai-based collective\u2019s experimental videos transform surveillance tools and TV networks into community-driven devices. A Mumbai-based collective\u2019s experimental videos transform surveillance tools and TV networks into community-driven devices. by  Kristen Radtke Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales Since its founding in 2007, the Mumbai-based collaborative studio CAMP has used surveillance, TV networks, and digital archives to examine how we move through and record the world. In addition to their film and video projects, the wildly prolific studio runs a rooftop cinema in Mumbai and maintains several online video archives, including the largest digital archive of Indian film. CAMP\u2019s first major US museum exhibition is on view now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York through July 20th and includes three video projects spanning two decades of work. The exhibit\u2019s three films repurposed private television sets into interactive neighborhood portrayals, collected cellphone footage recorded by sailors navigating the Indian Ocean, and reimagined how a CCTV camera could be utilized for exploration rather than control. In one film, CAMP collected cellphone videos that sailors shared at ports via bluetooth; in another, passersby on street level control a surveillance camera 35 stories above. I chatted with two of CAMP\u2019s founders, Shaina Anand and Ashok Sukumaran, about the importance of maintaining an open digital archive, the slippery definition of piracy, and how footage that never makes it into a finished film is often the most illuminating. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Your film, From Gulf to Gulf to Gulf, offers a portrait of sailors navigating the Indian Ocean, using cellphone videos to document their journeys and daily lives. Can you talk about how that project came to be and how this partnership with the sailors began? Ashok Sukumaran: Around the global financial crisis, in 2009, we were walking around the city of Sharjah in the UAE. Sharjah is a creek city, like Dubai. Before oil was discovered, the creeks were the main city center focus. And these boats were these kind of weird, out-of-time wooden ships, and many of them were going to Somali ports. So, we asked them, \u201cHow come there were no issues with pirates?\u201d Because everything we were hearing about Somalia at that time was about piracy. They said, \u201cNo, no, there\u2019s a difference between going to the Somali town carrying everything they need and driving past it with a ton of oil.\u201d Shaina Anand: Almost all of these giant wooden boats were built in these twin towns in the Gulf of Kutch, in Gujarat, and they were massive. They were 800\u20132,000-ton giant wooden crafts.  AS: There\u2019s a kind of language of the port. The Iranians, the UAE folks, the Somali, and of course, Indians and Pakistanis speak a kind of common language, which is close to a Hindustani mix of Farsi and Urdu. So, we were able to talk to everyone, to some extent, and we discovered a kind of music video genre that was really inspiring. This was the 2000s, with early Nokia phones, and sailors would shoot video and add music to it. Then their memory cards would run out [and they\u2019d get deleted]. Some of the videos were 100 by 200 pixels. SA: It was really important to us to try to trace the genealogy of the cellphone video, and it obviously was changing so fast. [The videos were] 10 frames a second, or 13 frames a second, in odd, square formats. It was rapidly changing.  For us, what was striking was that this image emerged in the middle of nowhere, out at sea, when a brethren boat or a comrade boat was filming on a phone. When our film had its festival run at the National Theatre in London, one of the film programmers came and told me, \u201cIt gives us such joy to see those images on the best screen in London.\u201d And it gave us the same joy, too. That there is an equality, then. Many people misread this \u201clow-res image\u201d and [call it] \u201ca poor image,\u201d and we\u2019re like, that is not what it is at all.  How were the videos originally transferred and shared among sailors? AS: It was a very physical process because these were not found on the internet. We were physically sitting down with people and saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s on your phone? Can I have a look at it? What did you film?\u201d These [videos] were exchanged over Bluetooth, so they were not uploaded to YouTube, but they were literally transferred by putting the phones together. SA: [When the boats] anchor for a bit at these smaller islands along the Gulf of Aden or Gulf of Persia, they\u2019re still always in pairs or threes. They travel together for safety. That\u2019s also the time for leisure and piping in those songs. There\u2019s something sweet about this moment of being bored at sea and using that space to create something.  AS: In a lot of our work, you see this idea that the subject of the film is usually behind the camera. They\u2019re usually running the thing, and they are looking out at whatever interests them. At sea, you have a lot of time, even though it\u2019s busy when it\u2019s loading and unloading. But at sea, a lot of people are basically hanging out and taking pictures of the things that they can see. Then the music adds the emotional tenor. All the music in the film was found with the video; we didn\u2019t add any music ourselves.  SA: And then if your phone has 2GB memory, that\u2019s the ephemera bit. The video gets deleted, but it\u2019s found on another boat on someone else\u2019s phone. AS: And within these communities, the videos are quite traceable because the boats are known. There are a thousand boats, but people would instantly recognize, \u201cThat\u2019s so and so.\u201d Even by looking at the shape of the boat in a 100-pixel video, they would know which boat it was.  You talked a little bit about how these videos were really ephemeral; they got erased very quickly. So much of your work seems to be about a commitment to maintaining an archive.  SA: We set up CAMP in 2007, with our collaborators who were lawyers and coders and cinephiles, and then, all of us together, good friends. We set up Pad.ma, our first online archive, and the lawyers were working around copyright law and trying to challenge them legally, pushing fair use. We didn\u2019t want to valorize piracy, but we realized how, for countries in Asia, piracy was vital. You didn\u2019t even think of [buying software from] Microsoft. You bought the parts of a computer with help from the person selling them, saying, \u201cOkay, so much RAM, this motherboard,\u201d and so on, and then loaded what you wanted.  AS: The whole Indian tech sector was built on piracy, or what\u2019s called piracy. People were not able to pay the fees. With Pad.ma, we basically initiated this idea of a footage archive or a collection of material that was not films, but things that were shot by people during film projects that never made it into the cut. For political reasons, for economic reasons, for the reasons that the films were only 30 or 60 minutes long and they had filmed for years, all those kinds of things. The idea was that Pad.ma was a footage archive that allowed you to deeply access that material.  So it\u2019s an archive of scraps \u2014 the things around the edges that maybe weren\u2019t shown elsewhere. AS: Yeah, but here, the scraps are 20 times the size of the finished thing. SA: I think that\u2019s the important thing. You had 100 hours of footage for a 60-minute film. That was really the reason for building a non-state archive, and we\u2019re the custodians and collaborators who think the 99 hours may be more important. It\u2019s not those old remnant scraps. It\u2019s the other way around. SA: It\u2019s the other way around. I mean, you have a one-hour interview, and two minutes might make it into a film. AS: You had all these examples of European avant-garde filmmakers coming to India making films and then doing these edits of what they thought they were seeing. But the footage is saying much more than their particular edit at the time. It can be very revealing of what was actually going on and how they filmed. So the archives contain a huge amount of data. AS: I mean, we have committed to that. We raised money from various sources for the projects. Indiancine.ma, which is a sister project, that\u2019s like the whole of Indian cinema as a metadata archive. AS: There were magical things in 2008 on the platform. One was that the timeline had cut detection. So, you can actually go to a cut just by using your left and right arrow keys. And you don\u2019t have that even in [Adobe] Premiere. You could also densely annotate. So you have researchers working, you have activists, you have film scholars, and they may take from the archive. But in that process, they\u2019ve given back their expertise or their views of the archive. Can you talk more about your work with participatory filmmaking? SA: On one level, what had been occupying my head space was this critique of how documentary images are taken, or why this relationship between subject, author, and technology is so dumb. I would keep saying, \u201clook at the image,\u201d and we can say a white guy filmed it, or we can know this really important Indian filmmaker filmed it, or you can say a top feminist filmmaker filmed it, or a queer person filmed it or a person from that community. But something\u2019s a bit off in that form as well. Not just [in terms of] who\u2019s speaking for who and all of that.  Another of your projects in the exhibit, Khirkeeyaan, which created video portals between neighbors and community centers using CCTV, seems like a place where the subject has a lot of authority over their image. SA: Between 2005 and 2006, CCTV cameras started to proliferate all over. And they were cheap. So, the electronic market where we\u2019d go to buy computer stuff now had become a CCTV market. It was $10 for those static cameras. You could get that quad box, like a four-channel mixer. They were everywhere really fast: the grocery store, the dive bar, the beauty salon, the abortion clinic. Wherever I went, I was seeing these tiny things. AS: When you put the camera on top of the TV and you allow the two systems to meet, you can just look into the television, and then that\u2019s part of the cable television network. By default, these systems are kind of oppositional. One is a broadcast system, or one is a sucking and one is a closed thing, and if you join them together, they start to talk to each other or\u2014 Download and upload simultaneously. SA: Exactly, which was the key property of video. That there was feedback. It was immediate. AS: It was live, and unlike film, you don\u2019t have to process it. They were ambient. They would go on for 24 hours. You were able to say that your household TV is now a portal. SA: The key thing was that this wasn\u2019t the internet. The cables were all 100 meters each. For a long time, until it got replaced by dish antennas, coaxial cable just used to snake across our cities. The cable would come to your house from the window sill, where the coax would be wrapped around, and there\u2019d be a little booster. It would go from neighborhood to neighborhood, building to building, terrace to terrace. [With Khirkeeyaan], the network was neighborly, but these neighbors were meeting each other for the first time.  Was there anything that kind of surprised you about the way that this network was used? SA: What always surprises me, and continues to, is that when you set up your own kind of collaboration with the subjects, and then you exit, you\u2019re not asking those leading questions of, \u201cTell me about your life,\u201d or \u201cWhich village do you come from?\u201d And poetry happens. I think, what was very affirmative for me, was just the confidence with which people sat and looked at their TV sets. You sit and look at your TV set all the time, but the TV set now had a hole in it, and it was looking back at you. Another of your videos in the show, Bombay Tilts Down, uses a CCTV camera. Can you talk more about your work utilizing surveillance? AS: CCTV, in a way, changes how we behave. It sort of infects, depending on who is watching us and how.  In Bombay Tilts Down, it was the simple idea that this gaze of the camera is already there. In the city, there are 5,000 of exactly the same kind of camera, and probably many more. They\u2019re all at least 4K, and now they\u2019re 8K, but they are robotic controllable cameras that are designed to do facial recognition at a distance. Instead of being a guard, waiting for something to happen, we used it to film the city. And the range is incredible; it goes way beyond the property line of the thing it\u2019s trying to protect. You can see 15 kilometers away with it, from the 35th floor. So you installed the camera yourself.  AS: This one, yes. The people you see in Bombay Tilts Down are looking up at the camera because people could see the stream downstairs, and some of them were moving the camera around, calling the shots.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Business Insider Edition  Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past couple of years.          Nvidia wasfounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem \"with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets.\"               The boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia.       Nvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang \u2014 who once worked for the chain \u2014 Malachowsky and Priem.               Personal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they \"wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea.\"               \"We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help,\" he said. \"It was fun.\"               Their goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC.               By 1999, the year it went public, Nvidia had invented the graphics processing unit, a computer chip that can handle many tasks simultaneously. It had faced challenges; it built two chips that failed, and it nearly went bankrupt. But it had also established itself as a formidable player in the industry, partnering with companies such as Sega, Dell, and Micron and winning rounds of funding from the venture firms Sequoia Capital and Sierra Ventures.               In 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming.               On Sequoia Capital's \"Crucible Moments\" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, \"Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA \u2014 not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different.\"               \"We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another,\" he added.               Nvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning.               The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 800% from the start of 2023 to the start of 2025.               Much of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models.               Nvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO: Jensen Huang.               A 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about$110 billion. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. BI identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm.               Huang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region.               He attended a reform school in Kentucky. In an interview with NPR in 2012, he recalled that \"the kids were really tough,\" adding: \"They all had pocket knives \u2014 and when they get in fights, it's not pretty. Kids get hurt.\" He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion.               Huang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984.               During his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children: Madison Huang, a marketing director at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang, a senior product manager at the company.               Jensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia.               Huang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company.               Nvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers.               Nvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3.               Demand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to US export bans on the chips to China.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup unitsfor their startups.               Last year, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips.               But a key to Nvidia's success is CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years.               Still, AMD, Nvidia's maincompetitor, is quietly catching up. In AMD's third-quarter earnings call in October 2024, CEO Lisa Su said the company had \"closed a good part of\" the gap with Nvidia.               Nvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips.               In January 2025, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft.               Nvidia has been competing with Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world. It briefly surpassed Apple to take the top spot numerous times in 2024 and again in January 2025, when its market capitalization reached $3.45 trillion.               For the fiscal quarter that ended January 26, 2025, Nvidia reported record revenue of $39.3 billion, up by 78% from the prior year. Net income for the quarter was more than $22.1 billion, up by 80% from the prior year.               Nvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet.               It has parks, \"treehouses\" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure.               \"When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible,\" Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023.               It's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs \"by definition\" should have the most direct reports at a company.               Huanghas earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a \"Jensen grilling.\"       Nvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research.               Landing a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"NVIDIA -$50? How about NVIDIA -$150? AMD's $599 RX 9070 XT is the GPU that I'm buying to replace my aging hardware. Here's why.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  AMD finally unveiled its new RDNA 4 GPUs in an official presentation on February 28, which arrived full of performance and pricing metrics. I won't lie. I was worried that AMD would bungle the RDNA 4 announcement, whether with unrealistic pricing, poor performance, or lackluster FSR 4 improvements. The standout news from AMD, at least for me, is that the RX 9070 XT performs at roughly the same level as the RTX 5070 Ti, dropping 2% at 4K ultra settings. That is, of course, raw performance without FSR 4 or DLSS 4 upscaling techniques involved. So, did AMD hang itself once again with uncompetitive pricing? Quite the opposite. The RX 9070 XT is confirmed to have a $599 MSRP. That's $150 less than the RTX 5070 Ti's MSRP, which in itself is more of a dream than a reality. With NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti approaching $1,000 on the open market \u2014 that's without considering scalpers' prices \u2014 AMD's opportunity to seize a larger portion of the GPU market share has never been better.

AMD's RDNA 4 GPUs \u2014 including the RX 9070 XT and its more affordable $549 RX 9070 sibling \u2014 are set to launch on March 6 with \"wide availability.\" If that claim holds, I'll be one of the first to pick up what AMD calls \"the world's best graphics card under $600.\" Here's why.  Many people, including myself, want a reasonably priced mid-range GPU that can handle modern gaming demands. However, NVIDIA's RTX 5000 \"Blackwell\" generation effectively decimated the mid-range GPU market despite launching with a mid-range MSRP. A combination of severe stock shortages, high third-party prices, and scalpers has caused the RTX 5070 Ti to approach $1,000 despite the $749 MSRP, putting it out of reach of many PC gamers. There is still, of course, the $549 RTX 5070 that's expected to launch on March 5 following a delay. Will it be more readily available? No one knows. The same can be said for the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 that are set to launch on March 6; will there be plenty of stock to sell? Considering there have been rumors of retailers receiving RDNA 4 GPUs to sell as far back as December 2024 \u2014 as well as AMD's claims of \"wide availability\" in its RDNA 4 presentation \u2014 it's looking good. Having two more next-gen GPUs sitting in the mid-range tier is nothing but a positive for PC enthusiasts, and NVIDIA has received the competition it so desperately needs. The 9070 XT's raw performance roughly matches that of NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti, and that's despite a $150 price difference. As AMD points out, that's a 23% better performance-per-dollar ratio. If you've been waiting for a mid-range GPU to slot into your gaming PC, the RX 9070 XT appears to be the new superstar.  I'm not someone who needs to have ray tracing enabled in everything I play, and I know I'm not the only one. As it stands now, I'm happy with a GPU that can meet ray tracing requirements in games where it's not an option to turn off. The RX 9070 XT appears to meet those demands. AMD's ray tracing performance continues to lag behind NVIDIA's capabilities, but it's clear that AMD wasn't sitting back and ignoring the tech in between RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 architectures. AMD shared some 4K RT performance metrics in its presentation, putting the 9070 XT lower than all but two games \u2014 Spider-Man 2 and Far Cry 6 \u2014 compared to the 5070 Ti. Compared to the last-gen RX 7900 GRE, on the other hand, the RX 9070 XT offers up to 66% better ray tracing performance at 4K ultra settings. At 1440p, the resolution I use to game, the numbers look even better, with the 9070 XT offering up to 68% improved ray tracing performance compared to the 7900 GRE. I'm eager to see real-world RT results once RDNA 4 reviews go live, but I don't foresee there being enough of a discrepancy between AMD's claims and reviewer results to scrap my buying plans.  FidelityFX Super Resoltution (FSR) is AMD's answer to NVIDIA DLSS, and it's about to receive the most significant upgrade in its history. AMD made the switch to machine learning for FSR 4 \u2014 older FSR versions use spatial algorithms \u2014 bringing it more in line with NVIDIA's DLSS that has, from the start, used AI to upscale. In tandem with RDNA 4's improved hardware, FSR 4 appears to be the generational improvement I was hoping for. With FSR 4 enabled on the RX 9070 XT, AMD claims up to 4.4x better performance at a 4K resolution. In Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, for example, frame rates jump from 43 FPS to 191 FPS with FSR 4 enabled. Spider-Man 2 is almost as good, jumping 4x from 48 FPS to 192 FPS at 4K. Even the newly-released Monster Hunter Wilds picks up a 3.5x improvement with FSR 4, going from 42 FPS to 147 FPS at 4K. As discovered by Hardware Unboxed shortly after AMD's pulled CES 2025 presentation, FSR 4 isn't just about boosting frame rates. FSR 3.1 notably struggles with small but high-quality details, especially as you raise the resolution. That issue appears to have been smoothed out with FSR 4. Quality frames and lots of 'em? I'm sold, even if DLSS 4 remains the premier upscaling technology.  AMD's RX 9070 XT reveal couldn't come at a better time despite nearly a two-month delay. In that time, I've gone from being enthused about the RTX 5070 to firmly siding with AMD regarding my next PC upgrade. The jump from an RX 6800 to an RX 9070 XT will be a massive change, and it'll pair well with my Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU. NVIDIA has been busy harming itself since the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launched on January 30, and there are plenty of good reasons why you shouldn't buy an RTX 5000 GPU. From melting RTX 5090 power cables to missing ROPs in all RTX 5000 cards to outrageous prices and unavailable hardware, NVIDIA has undoubtedly tarnished its reputation in the eyes of many PC gamers. While Team Green continues to offer the most powerful GPUs on the market, AMD's re-entry with RDNA 4 is shaping up to be a massive win for anyone who wants to spend around $600.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  A Tesla Cybertruck parks in front of the International Finance Center Seoul (IFC Seoul) in the ... [+] Yeouido financial district as a pedestrian walks past on February 27, 2025, in Seoul, South Korea. (Photo by Chris Jung\/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a fantastic company, and its founder, Elon Musk, is probably the most influential entrepreneur of our time. With almost a trillion dollars in market cap, even after a close to 40% recent decline in Tesla\u2019s stock, it is hard to disagree with a simple fact: Tesla has created incredible value for its shareholders over the long term. See More On Trefis.com What\u2019s not to love? Here\u2019s the thing: in a downturn, Tesla could lose - no, there is evidence, from as recent as 2022, that Tesla stock lost over 70% of its value over just a few quarters. So, could Tesla\u2019s $290 stock slide to under $100 if a repeat of 2022 were to happen? However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Again, while Tesla might be promising great things with the new Cybertruck, humanoid robots, and new factories, there is a larger risk to the U.S. economy, which is worth factoring right now. What is that? Sure, inflation fears have subsided, but they are not extinguished. If anything, Trump\u2019s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have stoked fears that inflation could come back. All of this means the U.S. economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture. When you factor in higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration, these are critical risks. After all, the Ukraine- Russia war is still ongoing, trade is uncertain, and everyone, including long-term allies Canada, Mexico, and Europe, are now being called to the negotiating table. Here is the specific data on Tesla that concerns us: TSLA stock fell 72.7% from a high of $399.93 on 3 January 2022 to $109.10 on 27 December 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500. The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 10 December 2024. Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $479.86 on 17 December 2024 and currently trades at around $290. TSLA stock fell 60.6% from a high of $61.16 on 19 February 2020 to $24.08 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500. The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 8 June 2020. Tesla stock has been considerably more volatile than the S&P 500 over the last four years. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, 102% in 2023, and 63% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Overall, it also doesn\u2019t help that Tesla\u2019s stock is still expensive; it trades at almost 10x last year\u2019s sales and close to 120x last year\u2019s earnings. To make matters worse, Tesla revenues didn\u2019t grow much last year, and the consensus estimates point to just about 14% growth this year. So yes, while Tesla didn\u2019t just invent the new EV category, it has energized or jolted - however you see it, the entire auto industry - make sure if you want to hold on to your Tesla stock, that you\u2019re not going to sell it if the stock dives into $200 or $100 levels. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? See the last six market crashes compared.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Nickel contamination can render soils infertile at levels that are currently impractical to treat. Researchers at UMass Amherst are looking at how plants can help these soils and source nickel for the growing EV market. Phytoremediation is the use of plants that preferentially hyperaccumulate certain contaminants to clean the soil. When those contaminants are also critical materials, you get phytomining. Starting with Camelina sativa, the researchers are looking to enhance its preference for nickel accumulation with genes from the even more adept hyperaccumulator Odontarrhena to have a quick-growing plant that can be a nickel feedstock as well as produce seeds containing oil for biofuels. Despite\u00a0being able to be up to 3% Ni by weight, Odontarrhena was ruled out as a candidate itself due to its slow-growing nature and that it is invasive to the United States. The researchers are also looking into what soil amendments can best help this super Camelina sativa best achieve its goals. It\u2019s no panacea for expected nickel demand, but they do project that phytomining could provide 20-30% of our nickel needs for 50 years, at which point the land could be turned back over to other uses. Recycling things already in technical cycles will be important to a circular economy, but being able to remove contaminants from the environment\u2019s biological cycles and place them into a safer technical cycle instead of just burying them will be a big benefit as well. If you want learn about a more notorious heavy metal, checkout our piece on the blessings and destruction wrought by lead.   Sounds too good. Trifids? It sounds kind of like yet another case of science reverse-engineering traditional agricultural wisdom which was originally found through trial and error over thousands of years. Which is a good thing, it\u2019s always good to verify and formalize things which we already know but we don\u2019t know why we know them It\u2019s like real life Tiberium. \u201cbut they do project that phytomining could provide 20-30% of our nickel needs for 50 years,\u201d That\u2019s an easy projection to make, as the amount that can be regained depends on how much contaminated soil you have. And you can predict the amount of contaminated soil. Moreover, you can control the amount of contaminated soil: by not doing anything to mitigate the contamination in the first place. Just stop protecting the environment, and your grandchildren could be billionaire phytominers! Where do you think the nickel we gain from this is gonna go Could this introduce high concentrations of nickel into new parts of the ecological food chain or does it stop inside those plants? That\u2019s the fun part of engineered organisms: we don\u2019t know yet! Cool idea but short time to yield also means relatively short roots, so even with tillage it will only efficiently treat the top ~1m of ground. Even if the top layer is stripped off the freshly exposed material will need to be amended to grow a decent crop.  \u201cWe believe that there is currently enough nickel in the barren soil in the U.S. to   supply us for 50 years of phytomining,\u201d  Large tracts of \u201cbarren\u201d land that are not already being farmed in the US means that it is likely a national park or there isn\u2019t enough water. And much of the those areas will have a relatively undisturbed ecosystem. Planting a monocrop will destroy that unless remediation is demanded like with surface mining. From an economical standpoint lets assume the plant produces a similar biomass to corn, which is probably being generous. Corn can produce ~4.5 tons of biomass per acre. Assuming 3% uptake that is 60lbs of nickel. Assuming 100% extraction at the current $6.80\/lb leaves us with $408\/acre. That is on par with a good crop of corn or soybeans. So we are looking at farmer levels of return on investment. A plant with really high biomass like sorghum would double this, but it would need decent soil and water to get those levels. Having plants mine minerals sounds very interesting. Although I doubt I would like a tour of a nickel mining orchard anytime soon Well anyway, hope they manage to get it to scale Decades ago I heard of copper tailings being seeded with extremophile bacteria to remediate\/reprocess\/recover more copper.  I wonder what ever became of that. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent. (Comment Policy) This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"The conflict between Israel and Palestinians \u2014 and other groups in the Middle East \u2014 goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them.         Hadeel Al-Shalchi                        Hamas fighters stand guard as an International Red Cross vehicle arrives at the site of the handing over of two Israeli hostages in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, as part of the seventh hostage-prisoner release on February 22, 2025.                                                           Youssef Alzanoun\/Middle East Images\/AFP via Getty                                       hide caption  TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 The Palestinian militant group Hamas says talks must begin on the next phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, rejecting what it says was an Israeli proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Israeli, Hamas and other negotiators were in Egypt on Friday to discuss the ceasefire. The Israeli delegation returned home from the talks Friday evening. \"Extending the first phase of the deal in the format that Israel wants is unacceptable to the organization,\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in an interview with Al Araby television. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office did not have an immediate response to Hamas' refusal of the extension. Qassem accused Israel for the failure to begin negotiations on the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire which came into effect Jan. 19. The agreement, negotiated by Egypt, expires Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, fighting won't resume during the negotiations. Qassem claimed Israel wanted to get back the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza and then resume the war. Hamas released 33 Israeli hostages, including eight bodies, under the current phase of the ceasefire in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails. Phase two of the ceasefire deal would see the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a commitment to end the war. The war started after Israel suffered the worst attack in its history on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked and killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostage. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, and over the next 15 months airstrikes and attacks killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, destroying or damaging most of the buildings in the occupied territory. The first phase of the ceasefire is ending as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins. During the six weeks of the ceasefire, the United Nations has been able to deliver much needed basic goods, though residents in Gaza say they still don't have enough food and medical supplies. At a market in the Jabaliya refugee camp in north Gaza, Khalid Abu Sultan, 33, was trying to find affordable groceries for the meal he planned to prepare to break the daily Ramadan fast. But he said the prices were too high. \"Ramadan usually brings joy and delight, but this year it will be bleak,\" Abu Sultan said. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Fears of a dire economic scenario have crept into the discussion recently, with top commentators this week expressing concern the US could be headed for a period of stagflation. Such a scenario entails\u00a0high inflation\u00a0and low economic growth, two things that don't normally go hand in hand. Stagflation slammed the US during the 1970s and economists say it can be even trickier for policymakers to resolve than a recession. While central bankers would typically cut interest rates in response to slowing economic growth, high inflation would make the Fed hesitant to loosen financial conditions any further, leaving their hands tied in both directions. Jeff Schmid, the Kansas City Fed president, has suggested such a scenario is already on his radar. \"While the risks to inflation appear to be to on the upside, discussions with contacts in my district, as well as some recent data, suggest that elevated uncertainty might weigh on growth,\" Schmid said at an event in Virginia on Thursday. \"This presents the possibility that the Fed could have to balance inflation risks against growth concerns.\" Meanwhile, that same day, Torsten Sl\u00f8k \u2014 the chief economist of Apollo Global Management \u2014 told Bloomberg TV he believes the ingredients for stagflation may already be present. He pointed to more fragmented global trade, increased immigration around the world, and industrial policies from other countries that have limited competition, all of which could raise prices. \"On a number of different fronts, you can both have, at the same time, higher inflation and weaker growth, which is the definition of stagflation,\" he said on Thursday. \"It's a stagflationary shock when you see inflation going up and growth slowing down. And that just happens to be the backdrop for the conversation that we're having in markets at the moment.\" Inflation has shown signs of re-accelerating in recent months after a period of cooling off from multi-decade highs. Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in January, above December's 2.9% inflation rate. Personal consumption expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, eased slightly to 2.5% in January but remained well above the central bank's 2% target. Economic growth, meanwhile, appears to have slowed in recent years. GDP is expected to grow 2.3% this quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed's latest GDPNow reading, down from a peak of 4.4% in the third quarter of 2023. Dhaval Joshi, a chief strategist at BCA Research, told Business Insider that he believed the US could slip into a \"mini-stagflation\" as soon as the second quarter of this year. Inflation already looks to be \"stuck\" above the Fed's 2% target. Higher prices will make the Fed unwilling to cut interest rates any further this year, Joshi said, which could fuel a slowdown in growth. \"We've got inflation around 3% or above, so that's already there. But the 'stag' bit \u2014in other words, the growth slowdown \u2014 that is still to come,\" he added. \"I think that could happen quite quickly.\" Barry Bannister, the manager director and chief equity strategist at Stifel, told BI this month that he foresees the US tipping into a mild stagflationary scenario in the second half of 2025, a situation he believes could spark a 10% decline in stock prices. Bannister and others have pointed to the further inflationary impact of President Donald Trump's plan to levy steep tariffs on the US's top trading partners. Economists have argued since the election that the cost of Trump's protectionist trade policy would ultimately be borne by the consumer. \"I think it's foolish that people assume that inflation's going back down to 2%. It's not going back down to 2%, not without a recession,\" Bannister said. Jump to","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Another new dating app is hoping to appeal to users with swipe fatigue. Left Field launched in New York City this week and is the latest startup trying to make inroads as industry heavyweights falter. When Left Field's founders, Samantha Martin and Kate Sieler, moved to New York after graduating from college, they were met with the same qualms that many daters have right now. Martin told Business Insider that endless swiping, lack of organic interactions, and a barrage of paywalls are just some of the \"dating pains\" the two felt. The two began building Left Field in 2024 and have since quit their jobs in finance and consulting after raising a family and friends funding round. Sean Miller, a founding engineer at fintech startup Apollo Card, joined Left Field as its technical cofounder in 2025. The app officially launched on the Apple App Store in February. Here's how Left Field works: The profile itself is similar to many dating apps (it has photos, biographical details, and some prompts). However, instead of swiping through a stack of nearby singles, the app will send push notifications of a potential match in the area if location services are enabled and a user crosses paths with someone on the app. \"We like to call ourselves the Pok\u00e9mon Go of dating,\" Martin said. The idea is that Left Field is a more passive way to date, where you can toggle location services on and off. \"If you're interested in meeting someone, you just turn on the app, and then you can close it and forget about it,\" Sieler said. It's not the first dating app to try to capture the feeling of crossing paths with someone nearby. Happn, a French dating app, launched a decade ago with a similar premise. \"Singles today are looking to bring back real-life encounters, like going to bars and restaurants,\" Happn CEO Karima Ben Abdelmalek told BI last year. As of now, Left Field does not incorporate any paid features. Like many new dating apps that have launched recently, Left Field is turning to social media to build an audience. It's working with three comedy creators to make content across Instagram and TikTok. It's also taking a page from Tinder and Hinge's playbook by throwing parties and focusing on college campuses. Left Field plans to expand to several college campuses in May and introduce ambassador programs for college students. In the meantime, to grow the app in New York, Left Field plans to partner with local groups and venues, such as running clubs, bars, and comedy clubs, and host singles dating events. Left Field hosted its launch party on Thursday night at a crowded bar in Brooklyn, where I spoke with a handful of attendees about the state of dating. The general feeling at the event around dating \u2014 particularly in New York \u2014 was exhaustion with the apps. Dating app giants like Bumble and Match Group have seen stock prices decline since reaching all-time highs in 2021. \"It's the prime time to have a dating app startup because people are clearly so frustrated with the current offerings,\" Martin said. \"The Catch-22 is that simultaneously, people don't like dating apps, but it's also harder to meet in real life because people are dependent on them.\" Jump to","label":0}

I don't understand why a company like Google doesn't just make their own Library of memory safe constructs and tell everyone to use that. You may have missed that Google did just that. Google employees wrote \"Comprehensive Rust\" [github.io], a tutorial for a memory-safe language. Can't really be done in C++. Let's suppose, for example, that you wrote a \"memory safe\" vector. If you pass any of the vector elements by reference to a function, especially in a concurrent context, how is the function supposed to know that the pointer is still valid at any given moment? It just can't. Why? Among other things, the language lacks features like lifetime annotations, and adding a borrow checker would totally negate the only remaining argument for continuing to use C++ to begin with. To even come  Of course it does, and not only did I allude to that, but I even named a few. For example, in C++ what you call shared_ptr is just an atomic reference counter (which, by the way, Rust has both a regular reference counter and an atomic reference counter, namely because you don't always need atomics, which not only are not present in every platform, but carry their own overhead.) What you call weak_ptr makes use of locking behavior, among other things.   https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/61...

Pocket showed me an article last night about how \"Vibe coding\" with AI will enable anyone to write software. Google is just trying to get the vibe right for AI to do the testing and review. ~Goog Vibrations~ So this is just another push to try to make \"AI\" look useful? Makes sense. The thing is, you either need what absence of memory safety gives you in control, performance and hardware access, and then it is a coder skill, testing and review issue. Meaning things being done cheaper than possible is the root-cause for all the problems. Or you do not need the advantages and can just code in a memory safe language. These have been around forever. Incidentally, what you are asking for is called a \"Harvard Architecture\" ( https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/...  [wikipedia.org] ) and it is quite old. Never reall Indeed. As C will not go away and will not become memory-save, coding in C (or C++) should be restricted to where you actually need its advantages. And it has numerous advantages that a memory-save language cannot give you and lots of scenarios where it is the best choice. Hence for those cases, better skills, better processes and likely liability and formal skill requirements are needed. For cases where the restrictions that necessarily come with memory-safety are not important, use a memory-save language.  Google is driven by revenue and information vacuuming, not goodness.  This will probably be an attempt to drive developers into using Google AI coding tools.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"(Bloomberg) -- The US stock market sent some troubling signals this week as investors\u2019 euphoric post-election vibe slams into a few challenging...","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"BySergei Klebnikov  andMatt Schifrin  This past Thursday, President Trump did it again\u2013and so did the financial markets. In a Truth Social post, Trump said that he would be carrying through next week on his previously delayed threat to slap 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods because (he said) these neighbors weren\u2019t doing enough to stop drugs at the border. Then, in the oval office later, he said China would get hit with an additional 10% levy\u2014taking the total to 20%. The market\u2019s response was swift and unambiguous. The S&P 500 closed down 1.6% for the day, taking it into negative territory for 2025, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ closed down 2.8%, off 3.8% for this year. By contrast the MSCI European stock index is up nearly 11% and MSCI China stock index has gained 17%. What the erratic 47th President will do next week is an open question. But investors can at least be sure, based on his performance both during his last term and this one, that Trump is paying attention to the market. On February 1, after he initially signed three executive orders declaring these tariffs, stocks plummeted the next morning. They recovered a few days later after Trump \u201cpaused\u201d what a majority of economists view as an ill-conceived proposal. A failure of checks and balances. A strongman presidency. Constitutional crisis. After just a few weeks in office, these are the words echoing in the halls of power as President Trump and Elon Musk steamroll through federal agencies. So far, there\u2019s no pushback from a Republican controlled Congress and it\u2019s unclear if the judiciary will intervene. Given his fake news rhetoric, Trump is certainly not worried about media reports, traditionally a strong external check on presidential power. After all, his own supporters don\u2019t trust the mainstream media. But there is one authority that President Trump seems to recognize: the market. \u201cTrump is a president who has more closely aligned his own success with the stock market than any other president in US history,\u201d says Jeremy Siegel, a Wharton emeritus professor and WisdomTree senior economist. \u201cThe market is the ultimate check, especially for a president who cares.\u201d While stocks surged higher following Trump\u2019s reelection in November, cracks have now started to emerge in the rally. Along with stocks, Bitcoin prices have retreated 20% from their Trump-infused highs. During Trump\u2019s first term, his announcement of 25% tariffs on China in March 2018 caused markets to tank nearly 5% in a week. While that escalated into an all out trade war with China in 2019, by 2020 Trump backed down and signed a trade agreement. \u201cIt is instructive that in the trade war in his first term, Trump was willing and able to pivot when the economic damage caused by that war became apparent, easing tensions with the Chinese,\u201d wrote Moody\u2019s chief economist Mark Zandi in a recent report. \u201cWe expect a similar dynamic this time as well.\u201d Growing up in Queens, New York\u2013and for decades seeking the approval of Manhattan\u2019s market rich elite\u2013Trump has many Wall Street billionaires within his inner circle. So it is hardly any surprise that he has always been highly sensitive and attuned to financial markets and their movements. In December, Trump triumphantly rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange while standing in front of his 2024 Time \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d cover. (It was his first time ringing the bell, and he brought along his children and Vice-President Elect J.D. Vance for the occasion.) The bond market may be an even more important check than the stock market for Trump, especially considering that the nation\u2019s $36 trillion in debt needs continual refinancing. There is no greater cautionary tale than the experience of short-lived British Prime Minister Liz Truss. After taking office in September 2022, she boldly announced she would slash taxes and ramp up borrowing. This widespread fear over inflation and mounting debt quickly caused bond prices to plummet, sending yields sky high as the British pound plunged to a record low against the U.S. Dollar. With several pension funds on the brink of default, the Bank of England had to announce three emergency interventions to save the bond market. Within three weeks, Truss had scrapped her tax cutting plan and resigned. While the prospect of a United States President resigning over a drubbing by the capital markets is farfetched, Truss\u2019 implosion is instructive. Bond vigilantes are likely to keep President Trump on his toes. Things like the adherence to the rule of law matter a lot to the entities that buy and hold United States government paper. In terms of interest rates, 10-year Treasury yields have come down since Trump assumed office from about 4.8% to around 4.2% today. However, mortgage rates (and inflation) remain problematic. According to Freddie Mac, 30-year fixed home mortgage rates, which recently rose above 7%, are hovering around 6.76% today. Right now the Trump administration is riding on the coattails of the Biden Administration\u2019s strong economy, which averaged about 3.6% GDP growth from 2021 through 2024. That compares to Trump\u2019s 1.5% average annual GDP growth during his first term. The test will come if President Trump encounters a real crisis, not of his own making, like the Financial Crisis of 2008, which occurred at the end of President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. As is often the case during times of economic turmoil, the market guided the nation\u2019s leadership. When the House of Representatives in 2008 voted down the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout on September 29, the S&P 500 plunged nearly 9% in four days before members of the House reconsidered the plan and approved the bill on October 3. During Trump's first term he tried to downplay the Covid 19 pandemic but the global shutdown, and a stock market plummeting more than 30% in a matter of weeks, jolted his administration and Congress into action. The result was $5 trillion in stimulus over two years, that buoyed markets then and ever since.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"     Your kidney health is linked to what you eat. Focus on these foods for a boost in function.    The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that over 1 in 7 US adults has chronic kidney disease. This can cause excess waste and fluid to build up in the body, leading to health problems like heart disease, increased infections, depression, anemia and loss of appetite. The kidneys are essential for overall health.  To give your kidneys some love, there are foods you can add to\u00a0your diet in the name of kidney health. Below, we outline 13 superfoods to eat, many of which you may already have in your fridge or pantry. Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the\u00a0National Kidney Foundation. If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has a chart you can use to determine levels in specific types of fish. Although, it's best to consult with your doctor. This nutrient-dense vegetable is low in both potassium and sodium while packing in fiber, vitamins C and K and more. Plus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more. Like cabbage, bell peppers pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants too. You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner. Cranberries help to prevent urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation. Plus, cranberries have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table. We've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What foods help repair kidneys? Blueberries\u00a0deliver. With high levels of antioxidants and loads of vitamin C and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD. There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get key vitamins and minerals, plus immunity-boosting benefits. Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet. Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. A study from Harvard University\u00a0found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer. Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin. Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For people with CKD, allicin \u2014 an active compound found in garlic \u2014 worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list. Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt. From the same family as garlic, onions give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper. They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. Cauliflower brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work. Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake. Egg whites are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis. Arugula is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types. You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example. Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants. Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"On the surface, the HP EliteBook X G1a ($2,199 testing, $1,999 starting) looks like any other business laptop. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a safe, elegant design that screams \u00e2\u0080\u009cwork laptop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But dig a little deeper, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the EliteBook X G1a, one of the most intriguing business laptops of the year to date. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the first laptops to sport one of the new AMD Ryzen AI processors. Built on AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Zen 5 architecture, this chip is designed to deliver power and efficiency in equal measure. And with an NPU capable of pushing out 55 TOPS, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most powerful AI laptops available (if only there were more interesting things to do with that power). The EliteBook X is for mobile professionals looking for a workhorse that can handle heavy workloads and last longer than the average workday. It can do all that and more with a durable, sustainable design, seriously strong speakers, a comfortable keyboard, and a bright, vivid display. Oh, and it\u2019s got a heaping helping of AI spread throughout for good measure. HP EliteBook X G1a The HP EliteBook X G1a is a business laptop that offers performance, endurance and durability with a heaping helping of AI Pros Cons There are three models of the EliteBook X G1a on deck. My review unit costs $2,199 and has a 2-GHz AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375 processor with 32GB of LPDDR5x RAM, a 1TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe TLC M.2 SSD, an integrated AMD Radeon 890M Graphics GPU, a 14-inch, 1920 x 1200 WUXGA display. The $1,999 base model has an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 CPU with half the storage and a 2.8K OLED panel. The $2,749 top model has the same specs as the review unit, except with double the RAM and the 2.8K OLED screen. See HP EliteBook X G1a at Amazon As befitting a business laptop of its stature, the EliteBook X sports a refined design that will look good in any office, coworking space, or coffee shop. The chassis is made from matte silver-colored aluminum, and the lid is made from 80% recycled materials. Speaking of the lid, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a swath of silvery matte-ness outside the gleaming strips of metal that make up the HP logo. The dark gray backlit keyboard sits nestled between the large top-firing speaker grilles in more of that silver aluminum. The palm rest is long enough to accommodate most wrists comfortably. The display is connected to the deck via a long hinge. While the bezels along the sides of the display are thin, they could be thinner. That goes double for the top and bottom bezels. However, the HP emblem on the bottom bezel is a nice touch. Although the EliteBook X is most certainly dressed to impress, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a tough little S.O.B. The notebook has undergone the gauntlet of toughness, passing 19 tests to earn its MIL-STD-810H certification. That means the notebook can withstand shocks, extreme temperatures, drops from certain heights, and extreme altitudes. Since the EliteBook X is a relatively slim notebook, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a lot of room for ports. On the right, you have a Thunderbolt 4 port, a USB-A port, and a Kensington lock slot. The laptop has another Thunderbolt 4 port on the left, along with a USB-C port, an HDMI 2.1 port, and a headset jack. Weighing in at 3.3 pounds, the 12.3 x 8.5 x 0.36~0.52-inch EliteBook X is on the heavier end of the ultraportable category. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a scooch lighter than the MacBook Pro 14 M4 (3.4 pounds. 12.3 x 8.7 x 0.61 inches) and Dell XPS 14 (3.7 pounds, 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 inches). But the Asus Zenbook S 14 (2.65 pounds, 12.2 x 8.5 x 0.47 ~ 0.51 inches) are both lighter systems. HP slapped one of AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Ryzen AI chips into the EliteBook X. Launched earlier this year, the 4-nanometer AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375 processor is the most powerful chipset in this new lineup. The processor is built on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Zen 5 architecture and has 12 cores and 24 threads. The chip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neural processing unit (NPU) uses AMD\u2019s XDNA 2 NPU architecture. With that and AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ryzen AI technology, the NPU can hit a performance rate of up to 55 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second), making it one of the most powerful AI laptops currently on the market. AMD claims the NPU offers up to 2x in power efficiency with AI workloads compared to last-gen chips. And finally, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the integrated AMD Radeon 890M Graphics. AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RDNA 3.5 graphics architecture is designed to optimize graphics performance but with reduced power consumption. So, all that jargon means this APU is designed to give you more power without sacrificing efficiency. I subjected the EliteBook to my usual workload, which starts with between 50 and 65 tabs in Google Chrome (don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t judge). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mix of GSuite apps like Docs and Sheets, a slew of news and social media sites, Google Analytics, several Gmail accounts, and a few YouTube videos. Even with all of that, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t induce any lag. I started editing videos in Adobe Premiere and photos in Photoshop with similar results. The EliteBook X also held its own when I put it through the benchmark gauntlet. During CPU-focused tests, the EliteBook X tended to dominate its PC compatriots. For example, in Geekbench 6, the notebook produced scores of 2,819 and 14,483 on the single and multi-core tests. That was more than enough to clear out the likes of the Zenbook S14 and XPS 14. However, it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conquer the MacBook Pro 14 (3.845, 15,105). The EliteBook X took 3 minutes and 48 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. Once again, the HP laptop folded its Intel-powered competitors, only to place second to the MacBook, which turned in at 2:29. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend playing Cyberpunk 2077 on the EliteBook X. However, I can say I played a lot of Hades II trying to take out the newest surface boss. And despite biting the dust more times than I care to admit, the colorful rogue-lite played beautifully. So you know the drill, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmarking time. And I was pretty surprised to see the Zenbook S14\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Intel Arc Graphics beating the EliteBook X on the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark 4,215 to 4,133. The XPS 14\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5,193 wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a shocker as it has a discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU. See HP EliteBook X G1a at Amazon The EliteBook X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 14-inch, 1920 x 1200 non-touch display is bright and bold. Actor Morris Chestnut\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skin looked like burnished bronze in the Watson trailer. Meanwhile, a gaggle of red blood cells forming a clot had such intense color that it bordered on florescent. Clear details revealed the fine striations in the ultrasound of a baby and a myriad of bubbles created from a body sinking into the water. Despite being an anti-glare panel, the EliteBook X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 16:10 panel is pretty bright. At least it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bright enough for me to read and watch videos in direct sunlight. HP acquired Poly, formerly known as Plantronics, a while ago, and it was a great decision. The quad speakers and amplifiers are better than they have any right to be on a laptop this slim. The pair of top and side-firing speakers created a full, powerful sound that easily filled my living room. Listening to a few songs on Tidal and Spotify, I noticed the highs can get brassy and distorted, and the bass is a little weak. The 5-megapixel webcam captures images and video in 1920 x 1080p. In my test shots, the shooter gave mixed results on the color. The camera did a good job capturing the color in my multicolored locs but washed out my rose quartz blouse. I love how big the keycaps are on the EliteBook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keyboard. The keys are also nicely spaced, with bright backlighting and firm feedback when typing. I hit my usual 70 words per minute on the Monkeytype test. The Fn row on the keyboard does double duty, as many of the keys have media functionality. The F11 key can be programmed to a few features in the MyHP app. The power button also serves dual purposes, functioning as a fingerprint reader for secure logins. And finally, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Microsoft Copilot button in the bottom right quadrant in case you want to shoot the breeze with Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI. The touchpad is your standard. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large, responsive, and agile, with your usual cache of multiple gestures. As a business laptop, the EliteBook X has a special set of security utilities. Dubbed HP Wolf Security, it provides protection against malware and phishing attacks, monitors critical applications, and can restore the operating system in case of infection. HP Sure Click acts as a virtual container, so you can open questionable files and websites without potentially affecting the rest of the computer. And since this is the AI era, HP has thrown its hat into the ring with its own AI companion. Currently in beta, the companion does many things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen on other apps, including Google Gemini and Copilot. It can summarize your docs and emails as well as craft them. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a chatbot in case you have a question, want to ask, or need help creating a to-do list or other tasks. And, of course, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some AI built into the system management, so you ask for the camera to be turned on\/off, mute or unmute the speakers, or enable\/disable autoframe in the camera app. Then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got myHP and Support Assistant, where you can adjust performance settings, run system diagnostics, or contact tech support. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of talk about performance without sacrificing efficiency. I definitely had to put that to the test. During the course of one day, where I wrote this review, took video calls, answered emails, watched a few videos, and took a couple of go-rounds in Hades 2, the laptop lasted 9 hours and 13 minutes at 50% brightness on the balanced power setting. I also ran the PCMark 10 Modern Office battery test, where the notebook lasted 13:25, which is pretty good. Even though we are getting deeper and deeper into AI land, I still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t found that killer AI app. So while the HP EliteBook X G1a is one of the most powerful AI laptops available, for right now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a nice-to-have than a must-have. But when the app emerges, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice to know that a lot of that AI processing can be done locally instead of in the cloud, where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damaging the environment. But if you take the AI hoopla out of the equation, you still have a damned-good business laptop. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s durable and has plenty of security features to keep your files nice and secure. Its performance will satisfy even the most demanding mobile professionals. And when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not working, that display can be put to good use by watching a movie or two or even getting some gaming in (within reason). And barring some slight distortion on a few songs, the EliteBook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speakers can hang with quite a few Bluetooth speakers. Plus, it can last well over eight hours on a charge. The HP EliteBook X G1a is the business laptop to beat this year.

Other growth areas, that were up big earlier in the month, are also selling off such as: robotic, drone, quantum computing, nuclear, semiconductor, and other growth stocks. Growth stocks can rally sharply and enjoy tremendous moves when the story \u2014 and institutional demand- is strong. Returns in growth stock can be mind boggling. That said, when the story fades, look out below. Trade Desk is a good example of a growth stock that can turn ugly, fast. Tesla is another good example of growth stock that nearly doubled since the election only to erase all the post election gains in a few short weeks. I\u2019ve seen it a million times\u2014investors chase stocks, throw caution at the wind, think \u201cthis time is different\" only to see the stock fall hard after they part is over. Many investors experience the fear of missing out and buy stocks just to say they own XYZ. Right now, approximately 17% of the Nasdaq 100 is down double digits, the market is speaking loud and clear: when the hype ends, the story stumbles, and there\u2019s no meat on the bone, investors can lose a lot of money. Defense is first in my world because it protects both our mental and physical capital in all market environments. Growth stocks like certainty and the macro environment is uncertain right now.    When you step back and look at the big picture\u2014the macro environment is questionable at best. February\u2019s been a wake-up call for growth investors. Inflation\u2019s above the Fed\u2019s 2% sweet spot, and the FOMC\u2019s mid-month minutes screamed \u201cno rate cuts for you!\u201d The 10-year Treasury yield also impacts growth stocks and it is not helping right not. Higher rates are kryptonite for growth stocks because it discounts their future cash flows and makes future growth bets look pricey.    Then there\u2019s Trump, swinging tariffs like a sledgehammer\u2014cars, semiconductors, steel, aluminum, you name it. All that uncertainty creates a risk-off environment. Growth stocks thrive in a risk-on environment and suffer in a risk-off environment. territory. Investors who slept on this macro shift? They\u2019re the ones holding the bag. You can\u2019t ignore the Fed or the White House\u2014those are two massive elephants in the proverbial room. The first thing successful investors do is they have a plan and the second thing they do is remain disciplined and trade their plan. First, kill the hype addiction. Second, don\u2019t chase stocks. Third, always respect risk. Here are three important questions I ask before I buy or sell a stock: Where am I going to enter? Where am I going to exit? And How much am I going to risk if I\u2019m wrong. This way everything is clear before I enter a position. My entry point is defined. My exit point is defined. My max risk is defined. Only then, if I\u2019m comfortable, I\u2019ll enter the position. That is true for just about any investment I make, even if it is not buying a growth stock. Paying attention to risk and remaining discipline are two super powers in this business. February 2025\u2019s been a gut punch for growth stocks. That said, this too shall pass.    Take some time to study your trades, where can you improve? What lessons can you learn? Then, create a plan going forward. Monday will be the first trading day of March. Then we have the jobs data, Fed moves, inflation, more tariff drama. If we rally from here what stocks held up the best?    Where are the leading stocks right now? Do you have an updated watchlist of leading stocks? The easiest way to do that is to find the stocks that are up or didn\u2019t fall as much as the market during this pullback. They are likely the ones to lead when the market rebounds. I like to say, always keep your losses small and don\u2019t fight the tape.    Remember, this too shall pass and when it does I want to be there to clean up.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"If done correctly, flipping a home can turn a tidy profit. Colorado-based investor Whitney Elkins-Hutten bought her first property \u2014 a single-family home in need of some elbow grease \u2014 in Fort Collins in 2002. About a year later, after turning it from a \"1960s, green shag carpet, psychedelic daisies painted all over the walls to a really beautiful property,\" she said she sold the property and walked away with a $52,000 check. In Louisville, Kentucky, business partners Mike Gorius and Kevin Hart have used flipping to get \"a quick capital boost,\" they told BI. They used the capital boost to pay down their personal debt and invest in long-term rental properties. High school friends and business partners Aria Khosravi and Alan Blue have created a seven-figure business out of flipping. As of 2023, they had done 91 flips in the Denver area. The commonality between each of these investors, who do business in different regions of the States, is that they keep things simple \u2014 so simple that it borders on boring, suggested Hart: \"In reality, if you're doing a lot of flips, flipping is a pretty boring business. You're using the same paint colors, you're using similar flooring. Whatever's in style that year, we're like, 'Okay, for the next five houses, this is what we're doing.' We're doing neutral colors, neutral floors, and just making everything fresh and clean so that it appeals to the most amount of people possible.\" Here are two strategies each of these successful flippers have used to simplify. Khosravi and Blue learned to avoid unique properties the hard way. On their second flip, they purchased \"a funky property,\" Blue said. Among other quirky features, \"it had this big, weird detached garage with a mother-in-law suite above it.\" They ultimately lost money on the sale. Part of the problem was that fewer buyers were interested in such an unusual property. He and Khosravi have learned that, generally, prospective buyers like \"standard layouts,\" such as a two-bed, two-bath with a kitchen and a dining room. \"If you're looking at a house that feels funky when you walk in \u2014 maybe the kitchen or bedrooms are super small, or it doesn't make sense where they are in the layout \u2014 don't overlook that. Because if you feel kind of strange when you're looking at it, so will the potential buyers.\" Sticking with a more standard layout may help you avoid a common but costly mistake: Biting off more than you can chew. \"Don't take on a project that's way bigger than you can handle,\" said Hart, acknowledging that it's easier said than done, especially if you draw inspiration from HGTV shows that tend to feature full gut renovations. He and Gorius prefer buying 3-bed, 1-bath, ranch-style homes in Louisville that need cosmetic upgrades \u2014 such as new flooring, paint, and light fixtures \u2014 rather than major structural updates. \"You don't want to start a huge construction project when you have no experience doing construction,\" said Hart. An early flipping mistake Elkins-Hutten made was thinking about what she would want to see in a home, rather than what her potential buyers would want. For example, \"if the home is in an area where a lot of families are moving into and it's going to be a starter home, they're going to want better finishes, they're probably going to want a yard with a fence, they're probably going to want good soundproofing from neighbor activity,\" she said. Think about the typical buyer in your market and ask, \"What do they want? I'm always thinking through, 'Who's the person that's actually going to use this property?'\" Gorius has found success following the same principle. \"Don't pretend that you're the one moving into this house and start putting finishes on there that are overpriced or don't make sense,\" he said. \"Stick with what works, talk to contractors, and walk other people's flips to see what finishes and paint colors and materials they're using, because they're doing that for a reason.\" Ultimately, the key to successful flipping also involves reps. Khosravi and Blue advise going into your first flip with conservative projections and assuming that everything won't go exactly to plan. \"Once you've come across every situation at least once, you learn how to deal with those things,\" said Blue. \"We've made a lot of mistakes along the way and they cost money. You pay for your education one way or the other, and we opted to do it in the field. But now that we've been doing it for a long time, we know what to expect and we know what to look for.\" Jump to","label":0}

SM Investments\u2014the holding company of the family of the late retail billionaire Henry Sy Sr\u2014will spend 60 billion pesos ($1 billion) to buy back its shares, which are trading at a two-year low. The open-ended buyback is the biggest ever for a Philippine company and the first for the Manila-based conglomerate, which posted a 7% increase in net profit last year to 82.6 billion pesos. \u201cWe believe in the upside of the market and our economy,\u201d Teresita Sy-Coson, vice chairman of SM Investments told Forbes Asia via text message. \u201cThe growth can be sustained.\u201d With shares of SM Investments down 15% this year, Franklin Gomez, executive vice president of SM Invesments, said the stock is undervalued. Its trading at about 11 times price-to-earnings ratio currently, compared with 36 times back in 2017, he noted. Gomez said the company has sufficient cash to bankroll expansion plans and fund the buyback. It raised $500 million in bonds in 2024, while unit SM Prime has earmarked 100 billion this year to expand its property footprint across the Philippines. \u201cWe see the potential of the Philippines for a very long term so the way we appreciate SM Investments\u2019 value is on a much longer time horizon compared with other investors with a much shorter time horizon,\u201d Gomez said at a media briefing on Friday. SM Investments\u2019 buyback comes at a challenging time with the property sector seeing softening demand with developers sitting on thousands of unsold condominiums units in Metro Manila. \u201cThe Sy family is putting up the largest buyback in Philippine corporate history,\u201d said John Gatmaytan, chairman at Luna Securities and who has been trading stocks for four decades. \u201cThey must be seeing something that the public is missing.\u201d  SM Investments also has interests in banking, geothermal energy, logistics, retail, and shipping. The group traces its roots to Henry Sy Sr., who sold overrun shoes in 1958 at a store in Manila he aptly called Shoemart and built his first shopping mall amid political turbulence in the early 1980s. Following Sy\u2019s death in 2019, his six children\u2014Teresita, Elizabeth, Henry Jr, Hans, Herbert and Harley\u2014inherited his fortune. The family is the richest in the Philippines with a net worth of $13 billion.  \u201cThis is a family that made its fortune by betting during the worst of times for the Philippines,\u201d Gatmaytan said. \u201cSM Investments wouldn\u2019t have grown this big if they didn't know how to ride the business cycle.\u201d","label":1}

The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is \u2014 in the words of one U.S. official \u2014 a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. By\u00a0         Willem Marx       ,\u00a0         Eleanor Beardsley                        Britain's Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer (left) welcomes Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky to 10 Downing Street on March 1, 2025, in London. The Ukrainian President arrived in London on Saturday to meet with the British prime minister ahead of a summit of European leaders on Sunday.                                                           Peter Nicholls\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  Volodymyr Zelenskyy got a warm welcome in London on Saturday as leaders across Europe rallied to his defense on the heels of an extraordinary Oval Office clash in which President Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of \"gambling with World War III.\" In Zelenskyy's first official meeting since the row \u2014 which also included Vice President JD Vance and took place in full view of the media \u2014 British Prime Minister Kier Starmer embraced Zelenskyy as the two met at 10 Downing Street. Starmer told the Ukrainian leader that he has \"full backing across the United Kingdom.\" Meanwhile, many of Europe's leaders pushed back against the Trump administration's perceived alignment with Russia's leader Vladimir Putin and the apparent browbeating of Zelenskyy.                  U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office at the White House on February 28, 2025 in Washington, D.C. The discussion devolved into a tense exchange.                                                           Andrew Harnik\/Getty Images\/Getty Images North America                                       hide caption  French President Emmanuel Macron was among the most pointed in his public statements, distinguishing between what he called the \"aggressor\" \u2014 Russia \u2014 and the \"victim\" \u2014 Ukraine. He said that countries including France that had helped Ukraine and sanctioned Russia three years ago after its February 2022 invasion were \"right\" to continue to do so. Both Macron and Starmer visited Trump this week to try to hammer home the need for continued military aid to Ukraine, and to keep the U.S. aligned with Europe in any peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv. France's prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, praised Zelenskyy as the honor of Europe for \"refusing to bend,\" despite the televised criticism he faced from both Vance and Trump. \"It remains for us to decide what we Europeans want to be,\" Bayrou wrote, in light of the new Trump administration's impact on Europe's defense. \"And if we want to be at all.\" Meanwhile, the Eiffel Tower was lit up on Friday night in the Ukrainian flag colors of blue and yellow. Speaking earlier on Saturday, Starmer said he spoke to both Trump and Zelenskyy after the uncomfortable Oval Office meeting. His office issued a statement that said Starmer \"retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine.\" But one of his ministers, Douglas Alexander, called the fracas in the White House \"deeply troubling and sobering.\" Starmer's chief political opponent, Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch, posted on social media that \"respectable diplomacy\" was essential for peace, and that a \"divided West only benefits Russia.\" Europe's leaders will meet in London on Sunday, at Starmer's invitation, to discuss their next steps after the Oval Office episode in Washington. The European Union's most powerful leader, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, told Zelenskyy in a message posted on social media on Friday that his \"dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\" adding an encouragement that he \"be strong, be brave, be fearless,\" and concluding \"you are never alone.\" Within just an hour or two of the Oval Office meeting, similar expressions of support and solidarity online came from the Spanish premier, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da, Latvian Prime Minister Evika Sili\u0146a and President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and President Petr Pavel and many others, including Australia's premier, Anthony Albanese. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, whose country recently ended centuries of neutrality in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to join the NATO alliance, said Sweden stood with Ukraine, which was fighting for its own freedom, as well as Europe's. Germany's current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also voiced their support, as Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said her country and other European allies stood united \"alongside Ukraine \u2014 and against the Russian aggression.\" She said Ukraine could rely on \"unwavering\" support from Berlin, as well as elsewhere in Europe, and minutes later her Dutch counterpart, Caspar Veldkamp, said Kyiv could rely on the Netherlands' support too. \"Whatever it takes,\" Veldkamp wrote, \"for as long as it takes.\" In Ukraine itself, the reaction was fast \u2014 and vociferous. One prominent Ukrainian politician, Mustafa Nayyem, who previously served under Zelenskyy, posted on social media that the Trump administration \"doesn't just dislike Ukraine. They despise us.\" He said the U.S. leader's \"contempt is deeper than indifference, and more dangerous than outright hostility.\" At the Kyiv Food Market, a soldier named Denys Sokolov said, \"I think the main difference is that Ukraine wants to makes peace but Trump wants to make a deal. That's a huge difference in our politics, in our vision to how we want to end the war.\" EU foreign policy chief and former Estonian President Kaja Kallas went further in her direct criticism of Trump, saying, \"it became clear today that the free world needs a new leader,\" adding, that \"it's up to us Europeans, to take this challenge.\" In one country bordering Ukraine, Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk who, as president of the European Council, regularly met with Trump during his first term, expressed support for Ukraine too. \"Dear Ukrainian friends,\" he wrote on social media, addressing Zelenskyy and repeating the mantra, \"you are not alone.\" In Moldova, another Ukrainian neighbor, President Maia Sandu won re-election in a presidential runoff in November. Her government has since publicly shared multiple allegations of Russia's electoral interference, as it continues to confront a Russian-supported breakaway region known as Transnistria. Sandu wrote that \"Ukraine defends its freedom \u2014 and ours.\" There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin, but prominent Russian government officials took to social media to praise Trump and savage Zelenskyy \u2014 long a favorite target of a Russian propaganda machine that depicts him as fascist, corrupt and drug-addled. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish head of Russia's Security Council, compared Zelenskyy to an \"ungrateful pig\" who got a \"good beat down.\"  \"It was useful but not enough,\" added Medvedev. \"[The U.S.] needs to end military aid to the Nazi machine.\" President Vladimir Putin has claimed Russia's offensive aims to \"denazify\" Ukraine \u2014 whose democratically elected president is Jewish. In an official comment posted to the Foreign Ministry website, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova seized on Trump's view that, rather than seeking a negotiated peace, Zelenskyy wanted to provoke a wider world war. \"With his ugly and boorish behavior during his time in Washington, Zelenskyy confirmed that he is a dangerous threat to the global community and an irresponsible firebrand for a wider war,\" Zakharova said.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"A round-up of the biggest Tech-related news that stood out this week.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.   News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. We're currently gearing up\/packing our bags to head to sunny Barcelona to witness the yearly tech conference \u2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC). Two of Android Central's best, Derrek Lee and Harish Jonnalagadda, will be on the ground, giving us a first-hand account of all the tech innovations that will be showcased this year, and here's a gist of what we expect to see. Now, getting back to what went down this week \u2014 the Pixel Watch 3 got FDA approval for loss of pulse, Slack's massive outage impacted workplaces globally, Clicks cases have landed on Android phones, Qualcomm plus Google collab gives the latest Android phones eight years of upgrades, and Nothing continues to drop specs of the Phone 3a ahead of launch next week. Let's get into it.  Read more here. On Wednesday, Pixel Watch 3 received FDA clearance to add a Loss of Pulse Detection feature to this wearable in the U.S. Here's how it is supposed to work: the watch will \"detect when you\u2019ve experienced a loss of pulse,\" which will then vibrate with a check-in message before setting off an alarm to alert people nearby. If you continue to be unresponsive, it will attempt to call 911 and send an automated message with your location to the emergency responder. While this feature isn't new on the wearable, since it is already integrated into the Watch 3 in 14 countries in the EU and UK, it is now that users in the U.S. will finally have access to it. The rollout of the \"loss of pulse detection\" is said to happen this month; however, this will only be limited to the Pixel Watch 3, and older generations will not see this feature. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android  Read more here. No, you were not fired, but Slack was on a 'break' for thousands across the globe. The messaging app experienced an outage and workplaces that rely heavily on this app to communicate across the seem to have been seeing a \"We\u2019re having trouble loading your workspace\" message pop up at the center of their screens. When faced with the outage, Android Central's team creatively came up with a workaround to use a shared Google document to communicate, although it was far from perfect and mostly a hilarious mess. Slack's status page indicated that the outage began at around 10:30 am ET, and users could not send or receive texts, view workflows or threads, and use other in-app features. Some are having trouble logging in to the app as well. Services were fully restored by the end of the day.  Read more here. Gone are the Blackberry days, but if you're someone who loves keypads, this one's for you. Clicks is finally going beyond iPhones and expanding its case compatibility with Android phones. The company is rolling out new cases for the Google Pixel 9 series, Motorola Razr Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S25 series. These cases bring back tactile typing, giving you the satisfaction of using a keypad when you send out a text. These cases can snapped on by aligning your phone's charging port with the connector inside the case. This helps these cases run without any additional intervention. However, it is important to note that Clicks cases are not compatible with MagSafe chargers, but wireless charging could still work, nevertheless. Users with a Google Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 can pre-order these cases at a lowered cost of $99 until March 21. After this, the price will hit $139, with shipping for some starting in April.  Read more here. Qualcomm announced this week that it will be teaming up with Google to bring 8 years of updates to new and upcoming Android devices that have the new Snapdragon 8 series chipset or new Snapdragon 7 series chips launching later this year. This means phones like the OnePlus 13, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Honor Magic 7 Pro, and the Asus ROG Phone 9 are all among the devices included to potentially receive up to eight consecutive years of Android software and security updates, assuming OEMs opt in. This collaboration promises to make it cheaper for manufacturers to provide these yearly upgrades. Qualcomm is leaving eligibility for these updates to the OEM's discretion. That said, Google has already offered extended software support since the Pixel 8 series, offering 7 years of updates with its newer Tensor chipsets, and Samsung offers the same software update promise with its latest phones, including the Galaxy S25 series. Looks like the tech giant is trying to bring that same level of support to other phones on the market.  Read more here. Nothing seems to be dropping more than just hints before it launches its next flagship phone. Recently, it teased the rear panel and camera array for a device from the Phone 3a series. The X post reads, \"Technically refined. Enlightened in every aspect.\" The video shows a white device with three curved Glyph lighting LEDs around a horizontal camera bar. Ring a bell? The bar looks similar to the one we saw on Google's Pixel 7 Pro. Earlier this week, In a separate teaser, the company showed off a gray device, allegedly the Phone 3a Pro, with a massive, circular camera with three lenses: a 50MP main camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultra-wide lens. The triple array also features quite a hefty camera bump, but it's still surrounded by a few of the company's signature Glyph lighting. In a separate rumor, tipster Shivam Kumar claims that a new action button on the Phone 3a will launch a whole host of things that are part of an AI suite called \"Essential Spaces.\" That said, our speculations will be soon put to rest as the Nothing is set to launch both these flagship models on March 4.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"By John\u00a0Gruber WorkOS: Scalable, secure authentication, trusted by OpenAI, Cursor, Perplexity, and Vercel. Nora Deligter, writing for Screen Slate in June 2023, \u201cElegy for the Screenshot\u201d: About five years ago, Catherine Pearson started taking screenshots of every bouquet featured on The Nanny (1993\u20131999), the six-season CBS sitcom that was then streaming on Netflix. She was just becoming a florist, and she found the arrangements\u2009\u2014\u2009ornate, colorful, and distinctly tropical\u2009\u2014\u2009inspirational. She now keeps them in a folder on her desktop, alongside screenshots of flower arrangements featured on Poirot (1989\u20132013), the British detective drama. A few months ago, however, Pearson suddenly found that when her fingers danced instinctively toward Command-Shift-3, she was greeted by a black box where her flowers used to be, a censored version of what she had meant to capture. It was around this time when streaming platforms like Netflix, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, and the Criterion Channel imposed a quiet embargo on the screenshot. At first, there were workarounds: users could continue to screenshot by using the browser Brave or by downloading extensions or third-party tools like Fireshot. But gradually, the digital-rights-management tech adapted and became more sophisticated. Today, it is nearly impossible to take a screenshot from the most popular streaming services, at least not on a Macintosh computer. [...] For PC users, this story takes a different, and happier, turn. With the use of Snipping Tool\u2009\u2014\u2009a utility exclusive to Microsoft Windows, users are free to screen grab content from all streaming platforms. This seems like a pointed oversight, a choice on the part of streamers to exclude Mac users (though they make up a tiny fraction of the market) because of their assumed cultural class. This assumption isn\u2019t unreasonable. Out of everyone interviewed for this article, only one of them was a PC user. Deligter\u2019s essay has been sitting in my long (and ever-growing) list of things to link to ever since she published it back in 2023. I referenced it in my post earlier today re: Matthew Green\u2019s entreaty to Apple to add \u201cdisappearing messages\u201d to iMessage, and re-reading it made me annoyed enough to finally write about it. I\u2019m not entirely sure what the technical answer to this is, but on MacOS, it seemingly involves the GPU and video decoding hardware. These DRM blackouts happen at such a low level that no high-level software\u2009\u2014\u2009any sort of utility you might install\u2009\u2014\u2009can route around them. I think Windows still offers easy screenshotting of frames from DRM video not because the streaming services somehow don\u2019t care about what Windows users do (which, when you think about it, would be a weird thing not to care about, given Windows\u2019s market share), but because Windows uses a less sophisticated imaging pipeline. Or perhaps rather than less sophisticated, it\u2019s more accurate to say less integrated. These DRM blackouts on Apple devices (you can\u2019t capture screenshots from DRM video on iPhones or iPads either) are enabled through the deep integration between the OS and the hardware, thus enabling the blackouts to be imposed at the hardware level. And I don\u2019t think the streaming services opt into this screenshot prohibition other than by \u201cprotecting\u201d their video with DRM in the first place. If a video is DRM-protected, you can\u2019t screenshot it; if it\u2019s not, you can. On the Mac, it used to be the case that DRM video was blacked-out from screen capture in Safari, but not in Chrome (or the dozens of various Chromium-derived browsers). But at some point a few years back, you stopped being able to capture screenshots from DRM videos in Chrome, too\u2009\u2014\u2009by default. But in Chrome\u2019s Settings page, under System, if you disable \u201cUse graphics acceleration when available\u201d and relaunch Chrome, boom, you can screenshot everything in a Chrome window, including DRM video. You can go to the magic URL chrome:\/\/gpu\/ before and after toggling this setting to see a full report on the differences\u2009\u2014\u2009as you\u2019d expect, it turns off all hardware acceleration for video encoding\/decoding, compositing, and more. You wouldn\u2019t want to browse like this all the time (certainly not on battery power), but it\u2019s a great trick to know for capturing stills from videos. What I don\u2019t understand is why Apple bothered supporting this in the first place for hardware-accelerated video (which is all video on iOS platforms\u2009\u2014\u2009there is no workaround like using Chrome with hardware acceleration disabled on iPhone or iPad). No one is going to create bootleg copies of DRM-protected video one screenshotted still frame at a time\u2009\u2014\u2009and even if they tried, they\u2019d be capturing only the images, not the sound. And it\u2019s not like this \u201cfeature\u201d in MacOS and iOS has put an end to bootlegging DRM-protected video content. This \u201cfeature\u201d accomplishes nothing of value for anyone, including the streaming services, but imposes a massive (and for most people, confusing and frustrating) hindrance on honest people simply trying to easily capture high-quality (as opposed to, say, using their damn phone to take a photograph of their reflective laptop display) screenshots of the shows and movies they\u2019re watching.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByNicolas Straut  ByNicolas Straut , Contributor.  SPY and SPMO offer distinct investment opportunities to investors with SPMO being more focused on ... [+] momentum-based growth with higher returns in bull markets while SPY delivers consistent growth with less volatility. Investing in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, like SPMO and SPY can offer a straightforward and cost-effective way to invest in the U.S. stock market. While both funds are tied to the S&P 500 index, they offer different investment strategies with SPMO being designed for active investors who want greater growth and SPY catering to more passive investors. In this article, you\u2019ll learn the basics of both ETFs, how they perform, and which is more ideal for your investment goals. ETFs like SPMO and SPY are cost-effective and convenient instruments to invest in stock portfolios. Rather than buying individual stocks to create a diversified U.S. stock portfolio, you can buy an ETF which tracks an index like SPY which tracks the S&P 500 index for a low expense. ETFs are also liquid and easy to sell during market hours, often have low expense ratios and are considered more tax efficient than mutual funds. Investors are likely to buy SPMO or SPY shares for different reasons. SPMO is based on the S&P 500 Momentum Index which tracks S&P 500 stocks which have a high momentum score and have positive price performance. As mentioned, SPY tracks the S&P 500 and is more suitable for passive investors who wish to buy and hold, in contrast to SPMO which is more suitable for active investors who wish to trade this ETF. SPMO and SPY are both ETFs which track S&P 500 indexes with SPY providing broad market exposure by tracking the S&P 500 index itself while SPMO tracks the Invesco S&P 500 Momentum Index which is a subset of stocks from the S&P 500 with recent positive price performance. In this section, you\u2019ll learn the basics of both ETFs, their key benefits and considerations before choosing one to buy. The Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO) is an ETF which tracks S&P 500 stocks which have a high momentum score and positive price trends. SPMO momentum indicators include significant price increases over a period, adjusted for volatility, ensuring chosen stocks are those with smoother price increases. SPMO can deliver high short-term returns due to overperformance during long bull markets compared with SPY but also more volatility as stocks which have surged in price can experience corrections. SPMO is ideal for investors who wish to ride a wave of performance and not have performance knee-capped by low-performing sectors. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is a more simple ETF which tracks the S&P 500 index offering exposure to 500 large-cap U.S. stocks, weighted by market capitalization. SPY offers broad-market diversification across sectors of the U.S. economy with a low expense ratio and high liquidity. SPY is not actively managed and doesn\u2019t attempt to beat the market as it essentially tracks the market. This ETF is most suitable for investors who wish for consistent long-term growth with less volatility than SPMO. For those interested in actively investing in stocks, rather than SPY\u2019s passive strategy, you should read about the best stocks for 2025. SPMO has historically outperformed SPY in bull markets, with a 45.81% return in 2024 compared to SPY\u2019s 24.89%. Over the past 1, 3 and 5 years, SPMO consistently delivered higher returns (45.83%, 19.95% and 19.80%) than SPY (26.23%, 11.81% and 15.08%), benefiting from its momentum-based strategy. However, SPMO\u2019s performance can lag during market downturns, as seen in 2022, when it fell 10.46%, while SPY declined 18.17%. Unlike SPY, which has a 10-year track record with a 13.66% annualized return, SPMO lacks extensive bear market history, having launched in 2015. SPY remains a stable long-term investment, while SPMO offers higher growth potential with greater volatility. For investors interested in other growth-focused strategies, review this list of the best growth stocks in 2025. SPY and SPMO both hold large-cap U.S. stocks based on the S&P 500. SPY\u2019s market-cap weightings lean towards large technology companies like Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA. 31.97% of SPY is concentrated towards technology but also includes allocations from lower-performing industries. SPMO holds more high-momentum stocks with a great weighting towards Amazon and NVIDIA and more exposure to financial firms than SPY (23.15% vs 13.65%). The top 10 holdings in SPMO make up almost 60% of the portfolio compared to SPY\u2019s 36.18%. SPMO therefore is more suitable for growth while SPY is more ideal for stability as SPMO tilts its holdings more towards outperforming firms. SPY boasts a higher dividend yield of 1.17% compared to SPMO\u2019s yield of 0.46%. SPY is therefore a better investment vehicle choice for investors focused on earning income from their investments. SPY holds more dividend-paying stocks versus growth-focused stocks held in SPMO. SPMO\u2019s momentum-focused stocks often reinvest earnings towards growth rather than distributing earnings as dividends to investors. Investors seeking dividend income should invest in SPY rather than SPMO. For investors interested in dividend investing specifically, review this list of dividend aristocrats, companies who have increased their dividend in each of the past 25 consecutive years. Market sentiment shows that analysts are bullish on both SPMO and SPY but with different average expectations for growth. According to TipRanks, 100 analysts have set the price target for SPMO to $115.03, an 11.60% increase from its current price of $103.07. Meanwhile, 1,007 analysts have set the price target for SPY to $763.91, a 24.93% increase from the current price of $611.49. Christopher Lange, Head of Investments at Cache, a modern brokerage for large stock positions, shares that \u201cif we continue to see strong market returns like we have over the last 12-24 months, we would expect strategies like SPMO to continue to provide strong returns. Momentum strategies like SPMO offer attractive return opportunities in these environments. That said, investors should be cautious, SPMO and other similar strategies are likely to experience challenges when the market falls, especially if it is a sharp move down. These strategies often perform well when the existing market conditions prevail, and struggle when there is a change in market conditions. I would advise investors to be cautious about allocating too much to SPMO \u2014 or related strategies \u2014 at these elevated market levels.\u201d SPY offers broad market exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks with lower risk and volatility than SPMO through diversification across sectors and the passive nature of the index. SPY has performed consistently delivering the standard for returns over decades making it a more ideal option for risk-averse investors. SPMO has delivered higher returns than SPY historically since its inception in 2015 but it has not been tested during an extended bear market. Its outperformance of SPY could also lead to worse performance in bear markets as well as greater price swings during volatile periods. For investors seeking greater performance, who are also tolerant to risk, SPMO could be a superior option. As discussed, SPMO follows a momentum strategy which has higher turnover, meaning there is more frequent buying and selling of stocks. This can lead to more realized capital gains which can result in investors being subject to more short-term capital gains taxes. If investors are considering holding their SPMO shares in a taxable account, they should consider how taxable distributions could result in higher taxes and how holding SPMO in a retirement account like an IRA would be more optimal. SPY, in contrast, has lower turnover and fewer taxable events for investors. SPY is a more tax-efficient option for long-term investors because of fewer capital gains distributions. SPMO and SPY offer different advances depending on your strategy. SPMO delivers higher return potential through its momentum investing strategy while SPY delivers more stable and broader market exposure. Below are the key pros and cons of each ETF. SPMO is more ideal for active investors who believe in momentum investing and are able to tolerate greater volatility in their portfolio for potential higher returns. SPMO is also ideal for short-term trading opportunities, for example, taking advantage of a short-term bull run. SPMO is also ideal for investors who are comfortable with less historical data on SPMO returns during an extended bear market. SPY is more ideal for long-term investors seeking broad market exposure and U.S. stock diversification. SPY is also more ideal for retirement portfolios and investors less comfortable with cutting-edge strategies like momentum investing with less of a track record during different types of markets. SPY is also ideal for investors who want a higher dividend yield and lower-expense ratio. Bottom Line SPY and SPMO offer distinct investment opportunities to investors with SPMO being more focused on momentum-based growth with higher returns in bull markets while SPY delivers consistent growth with less volatility. Depending on your investment goals, whether you\u2019re seeking higher short-term growth or long-term sustainable growth, each ETF has its advantages.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Yves here. The highly kinetic conduct of the Trump Administration, despite dominating news coverage, is unlikely to divert the attention of most Americans to day to day household budget realities. Inflation has still not been tamed. Consumers face the visible sign of ever-levitating egg prices along with pressure in many other expenditure categories, even with energy prices not presently being a big contributor. Tariffs are set to make matters worse. On top of that, we have Musk Federal employment and program whackage directly damaging many, plus creating broader anxieties. Below, Tom Ferguson and Sevaas Storm describe a big and not sufficiently acknowledged driver: strong spending at the very top of the income distribution. The well off party on as most of the rest feel the wallet squeeze. By Thomas Ferguson, Research Director, Professor Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Boston, and Servaas StormSenior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Here we are again. First the IMF, then the Fed belatedly tiptoed to the conclusion that we reached almost two years ago: that the bubbling consumer demand that has sustained US inflation in the face of Fed interest rate hikes is driven principally by the spending of affluent Americans whose wealth has soared thanks to the Fed\u2019s doubling down on quantitative easing during the pandemic. Due to surging house prices and stock market prices, the net worth of the wealthiest 10% of US households has increased by more than 50% in nominal terms, or $36.3 trillion, during the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2024. This, in turn, has unleashed a powerful wealth effect on consumer spending, as we have repeatedly pointed out (Ferguson and Storm 2023; Ferguson and Storm 2024a; Ferguson and Storm 2024b). Now comes Moody\u2019s Analytics with more of the same. A Wall Street Journal article interviews that institution\u2019s chief economist, Mark Zandi, and cites data and charts from the institution in support of the claim that \u201cMany Americans are pinching pennies, exhausted by high prices and stubborn inflation.\u201d This is underscored by Figure 1, which plots the monthly change in real hourly earnings of American production and non-supervisory employees during January 2021 to January 2025. Higher prices did eat up almost all of the nominal pay raises of American workers, whose real hourly earnings rose by a pitiful 22 dollar-cents during these four years. Similarly, real median weekly earnings of American workers hardly increased during 2021Q4-2024Q4 (see Figure 2), even as prominent economic commentators trumpeted claims that the US labor market was extremely tight. The clamor about the looming threat of an imaginary wage-price spiral (Ferguson and Storm 2024a) diverted attention from the real action: astonishing increases in home values, the stock market, and the net wealth of the top 10%. Between January 2021 and December 2024, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index rose by almost 17% (in real terms), while the S&P Stock Market Index increased by a whopping 31% (also adjusted for inflation). In contrast, real weekly earnings of American workers grew by a grand total of just 0.4% during this period.   In America\u2019s ever deepening dual economy, most citizens struggle to afford more than the basics and feel exhausted by the persisting financial stress. But, as the WSJ writes, \u201cthe well-off are spending with abandon. The top 10% of earners\u2014households making about $250,000 a year or more\u2014are splurging on everything from vacations to designer handbags, buoyed by big gains in stocks, real estate, and other assets. Those consumers now account for 49.7% of all spending, a record in data going back to 1989, according to an analysis by Moody\u2019s Analytics. Three decades ago, they accounted for about 36%.\u201d A separate Moody\u2019s Analytics report that Zandi himself issued at virtually the same moment echoes the importance of the wealth effect in explaining the strength of consumer demand and economic growth but cites statistics on spending by the top 20% of the income quintile instead. We have minor reservations about details of both sets of estimates. But none of our reservations add up to anything material. The latest data in the longer Moody\u2019s piece extend to the same period as our last investigation. While neither Moody\u2019s nor the Wall Street Journal ever directly make the crucial final conclusion, the linkage is clear: Yes, consumer demand by America\u2019s most affluent citizens is indeed driving consumer spending, and consumer spending, in turn, is the main force keeping inflation so high. The CPI inflation jumped in January 2025 \u2014 rising by 3% during the 12 months that ended in January and drifting away from the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target of 2%. The Fed finds itself in a fix. On the one hand, it cannot lower the interest rate (as President Trump would like it to do), because the wealth bonanza enjoyed by the richest 10% is still fueling spending and inflation, while the majority of Americans have a hard time scraping by. It is perhaps oddly appropriate that a regime so intertwined with unelected billionaires is kept afloat by the spending of the super-affluent. On the other hand, monetary tightening or any other shock that leads to a stock market selloff or decline in home values would rattle the confidence of the top 10%, cause them to cut back spending and hurt the economy. This may bring down inflation, but the collateral damage would be substantial. The implication is that the Trump administration has a tiger by the tail. Waiving some qualifications, since after all, unilateral tariffs by the US would be one offs, unless they lead to escalating tariff wars, it is easy to understand why fears of still higher inflation are so pervasive. The Moody\u2019s data provide further confirmation that wealth-price inflation, not any phantom wage-price spiral, is a powerful force running in the background as the administration sorts out its policies on tariffs and other issues.  \u2018the well-off are spending with abandon. The top 10% of earners\u2014households making about $250,000 a year or more\u2014are splurging on everything from vacations to designer handbags, buoyed by big gains in stocks, real estate, and other assets. Those consumers now account for 49.7% of all spending\u2019 And this is exactly why Biden and the Democrats never saw the red wave coming to hit them \u2013 everybody they knew, including their consultants, said the economy was going great which is why Biden said in public the economy is going great. Of course the argument may have been made in private behind closed doors that it was not possible to hit the 10% with extra taxes instead of the bottom 90% to re-balance the economy. If they did, the economy would suffer too much as those rich people would stop spending! Yah, I\u2019m not sure things were rosy even at the top 10 percent before January 20th.  The tech job market has really cooled down and people are coming down from the post-COVID YOLO travel and purchases. Maybe my friends and family in this tier were still spending but they\u2019re not exuberant about it.  I did see quite a few people finally break down and buy a house in the last 5 years, after decades of renting.  I wonder if that kicked a lot of consumer spending up as they\u2019re buying furnishings and appliances and getting trades people in to help them fix up the house. Now DOGE is taking aim at a lot of gold plated rice bowls at government contracting and perhaps the finance sector (DOGE taking heavy early strikes at the various financial regulators, who have typically worked hand in glove with large financial institutions, is interesting), is going to be far more economically impactful than the firing of 75 percent of federal workers threatened by Project 2025.   The biggest shocker so far is that DOGE forced the Veterans Administration to cancel a huge number of contracts because they were described as consultant contracts, keeping in mind that basically anytime the US government procures services from the private sector, the word \u201cconsultant\u201d gets thrown around to get around the \u201d inherently governmental function\u201d concern about hiring non-feds to fill in work that federal workers are not staffed to do.  Apparently this was done without any prior notice to the contracting officers or government program managers.  Norms and decades of carefully crafted regulations and procedures completely out the window. Ditto forcing the General Services Administration (the federal government body responsible for managing government building leases, a lot of routine building maintenance work, government credit cards, and a lot of routine \u201ccommercial\u201d goods and services like monitors and software licenses) to cancel leases on government buildings and selling government owned buildings, again without prior notice to the program managers and contracting officers responsible for the leases \u2013 who may sin be unemployed as DOGE asked for a 50 percent cut in head count at GSA).  This stuff is pretty much impossible to reverse at a large scale.  This is at least one previously very cozy corner of the world where decades are happening every week. Also apparently most government credit cards used by federal employees to travel and pay for small dollar purchases has been reset to a limit of $1.   Anti-DEI means the deference that American government contracting has given to \u201csmall\u201d businesses for almost a century, is getting smashed to bits and preparing the ground for those with deeper pockets to come in.  A lot of the dwellers of very nice houses in DMV (DC\/Maryland\/Virginia) suburbs must be laying awake at night wondering when their number is going to be up. It\u2019s going to be an interesting couple years, possibly decades, possibly forever, for some people who were at the top of the current American economic pyramid. Luxury spending slowed in 2024: https:\/\/www.fashiondive.com\/news\/bain-luxury-spending-flat-worst-2024\/733451\/ https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/retail\/our-insights\/state-of-luxury https:\/\/institute.bankofamerica.com\/economic-insights\/luxury-spending.html If consumers are feeling the squeeze, then where is the crisis? https:\/\/wolfstreet.com\/2025\/02\/19\/our-drunken-sailors-and-their-credit-cards-delinquencies-balances-burden-and-available-credit-in-q4-2024\/ https:\/\/wolfstreet.com\/2025\/02\/18\/auto-debts-auto-loan-to-income-ratio-serious-delinquencies-for-prime-subprime-our-drunken-sailors-and-their-auto-loans-leases\/ Muppets only have themselves to blame. As has been well documented by Wolf Street, incomes are outpacing inflation and muppets have been spending like drunken sailors. https:\/\/www.spglobal.com\/spdji\/en\/indices\/equity\/sp-global-luxury-index\/#overview Luxury stock index has gone nowhere the past year, so no, the rich have not been splurging on luxury handbags. Thanks for this. Though honestly better than I thought.   I bought a lot of my protein from D\u2019Artagnan (high end online meat seller that sell a lot to mid to upper end of American restaurants but also direct to consumer) and their prices haven\u2019t gone up much after an initial COVID spike.  Ditto Costco where a lot of prices actually are going down because of dollar strength. I definitely haven\u2019t seen it in my upper middle class circles.  They\u2019re still spending but it\u2019s on things they perceive as necessities (insanely expensive child care and child enrichment activities, \u201csanity\u201d vacations, smaller home updates but reluctance for taking on bigger projects).  I imagine that Gaza, Ukraine, and saber rattling against China aren\u2019t opening a lot of Muslim, Chinese, or Russian pocketbooks either. The biggest individual price jump at Costco is for their 24 pack Cup Noodle ramen.  I think it used to be $5 in 2019 and now it\u2019s $14.  The next biggest might be canned corn and beans, I feel like they doubled in price.  The other price creeps were not too visible. Though somewhat elliptical to the thread of your comments I have noticed Costco\u2019s tendency to lean into selling to high end consumers. Consider the wine packages on offer \u2014 for example six bottles of wine for $2000. I guess like Willie Sutton\u2019s fondness for banks, Costco is catering more and more to its high end customers. I have also noticed that fewer Costco sales include items I put into my cart when I shop there, purchases which include items like canned corn and beans. I know people who had memberships for their wine (and they were serious wine aficionados) and the steaks. I grew up in California and strongly prefer wine to other alcohol. I buy the Costco wines whenever I can, the Kirkland Brand box wines and I sometimes try some of the blended reds Costco sells at a small subset of their warehouses. I doubt I will ever buy one of the wine packages available from costco.com \u2026 and unfortunately they are the only wines available from costco.com. [The only Costco warehouse near me I know of that sells wines is a five-hour drive.] Is wine drinking instead of beer drinking still considered a class marker in this age of boutique beer? I may have missed the costco.com wine package sales in the past but I do not remember seeing them until recently. I also feel that fewer plain-old food items are available for delivery. The last time I tried to send some food items to my daughter I remember having trouble finding items I thought I saw when I ordered in the past. Also, out of curiosity \u2014  do serious wine aficionados really pay $300 for a single 750 ml bottle of wine? If so, I am seriously out of touch with the amount of money my betters have to spend on things like a bottle of wine. Does $300 per bottle win really taste that much better than a $20 \u2013 $30 bottle of wine? Spending appears to continue in my neighborhood. New Teslas including a Cybertruck on my street. Also seeing a lot of home improvement work, a mix of people preparing for sale (the RE market has boomed here after the LA fires) and those updating in preparation for retiring in place. Seeing a fair number of restaurant closures however. They have boosted sales elsewhere: https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2025\/02\/19\/walmart-earnings-wealthy-shoppers-boost-sales.html\/ Drunken sailors paying their co=pays, rent, car insurance and interest on credit cards! Let the good times roll!! You do realize that almost 30% of USians have no credit cards? And the bottom half that do are most likely making purchases that reflect the growing inflation-not spending like drunken sailors as the gold bug Wolf is alluding in his regularly parroted articles. Shaming those that are just trying to stay afloat is a bad look. I see Wolf as more of a chart bug, loves those squiggly lines running akimbo. A numbers man. Averages hide a multitude of sins. I keep trying to make that point when I comment over there \u2014 Wolf is not interested in hearing it. I see Wolf as a \u201cQuant\u201d. He loves statistics, and is really good at quantitative analysis. But I think Gary Stevenson is way better at explaining our asset economy and putting  what it means into perspective.  Economics used to be called \u201cpolitical-economy\u201d for a reason. Michael Hudson has an interesting perspective too. The premise of the article is \u201cThe top 10% of earners\u2014households making about $250,000 a year or more\u2014are splurging on everything from vacations to designer handbags, buoyed by big gains in stocks, real estate, and other assets.\u201d . I\u2019ve included links that show that luxury spending has moved pretty much nowhere i.e. the premise of the article is quite false. Whether 30% of the US population have credit cards or not is besides the point, because the 70% who do are clearly holding up spending and so far the credit card market has not been showing any visible stresses.  I\u2019ve realized that the NC commentariat does have a blind spot when it comes to articles like this. Just take Netflix which is like the epitome of discretionary spending, the company has been increasing subscription prices, but has that resulted in subscriber numbers going down because people simply could not afford it? No, https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/250937\/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us\/. Instead we get comments like \u201cWolf does not understand averages\u201d, etc, etc. The rich do have way more money than the rest of us, but there\u2019s only 24 hours in a day, so no, it\u2019s physically impossible for even the rich to consume more content than the rest of us.  The government has been spending like drunken sailors (crisis level spending), nominal interest rates are still below real interest rates, consumers likewise are also spending like drunken sailors so you have inflation. It\u2019s as simple as that. \u201cWalmart is drawing more online sales from higher-income shoppers, as it expands its online assortment, remodels stores and grows its membership program, Walmart+. Households earning more than $100,000 made up 75% of the company\u2019s market share gains in the fiscal third quarter,\u2026\u201d More affluent households are increasing their spending at places where the non-affluent shop. This article clearly says \u201c\u201cThe top 10% of earners\u2014households making about $250,000 a year or more\u2014are splurging on everything from vacations to designer handbags, buoyed by big gains in stocks, real estate, and other assets.\u201d  Also households making $100,000 are higher middle income (\u201chigher income\u201d does not mean high). You want prices to drop, how about doing something like this: https:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/live-news\/20250124-croatians-boycott-shopping-to-protest-high-prices? Supposedly a similar movement was supposed to happen a couple of days ago, https:\/\/time.com\/7262444\/why-consumers-are-planning-economic-blackout-february-28\/, so we\u2019ll see if muppets could do anything else but shop. Somehow I doubt it, since we are talking about people who are too happy to punch each other out over a good Black Friday deal.  Americans have always had a spending problem, this is not new, not sure why this is such a big deal. Late to this. The part of the luxury spending market that fell was among aspirational shoppers (not part of the 10% but who buy a really nice bag or shoes or a scarf to make a statement, which is actually pretty significant in total) and to your point, also some in the 10%. The 1% spent like bandits. >Eggs & You It\u2019s the name of a restaurant in Ft Lauderdale on the south bound corner of Federal and 26th. I drove by it last week and thought to myself that I haven\u2019t had an egg in a long time. So back in Central rural PA this week and I decided to buy some eggs, they were $7.95. The shelf was only 40% filled and I wondered if it was the price or availability. It started me wondering about maybe getting a chicken coup, but I realized it wouldn\u2019t work until I retire in a couple of years.  I don\u2019t think the politicians really care or not on what my thoughts are on the price of eggs at the grocery store, they are too busy lining their pockets, most of them, with exceptions I surmise. Will Trump feel the heat? I hope so, it will mark how he will act viz the Fed and what influence he can exert on monetary policy. Maybe the market will self-correct, I\u2019m not buying eggs at this price, I\u2019ll skip breakfast altogether and have a bigger lunch. I need to lose 10 pounds anyway. Since avian flu is spreading and killing lots of Canadian Geese right now, I wouldn\u2019t recommend establishing your flock at this time unless you keep them very carefully confined. Costco is selling 18 eggs for $7 and the supplies didn\u2019t look too bad.  I do think maybe we\u2019re all being a little overdramatic here.  Even if eggs cost $1 each now, a 4 egg omelette is going to cost less than most other protein options and only slightly more than making a tofu scramble (tofu costs about $2.50 a box around me).  So I think we can still afford to indulge in a few eggs here and there, for now So go for it\ud83d\ude01 My sister and her husband are pretty much the polar opposite of me in spending, they will splash out serious simoleons on a cruise getting top end digs and fly at least business class if not first class everywhere they go. They seem to get off on paying more, as crazy as it sounds. I know nobody else like them in terms of hey big spenders! in my life. The only avenue i\u2019m likely to see the moneyed class is at a ski resort, and i\u2019m only there to ski with my motley crew of golden years ski bums-not buy a couple million $ ski out-ski in chalet on the mountain. Aside from skis\/snowboard and clothing, there isn\u2019t much else you need nor would want, and on account of everybody wearing a helmet these days (in my observations over the years, I\u2019d guess its around 97% helmet wearers on the slopes now) and reflective goggles, everybody looks like Jeff Goldblum after metamorphosis in the remake of The Fly, so much for individuality.  I pretty much buy the same food all the time, and have watched inflation in not just prices, but shrinkflation too. WinCo has these wonderful premade salads which used to be $3.29 on the way to the present $4.99, and you used to get 2 boiled egg halves in each one, but now you\u2019ll get a half, and like it! My house insurance went up nearly 30% this year over last year\u2019s cost. It isn\u2019t all bad news, marijuana now costs 1\/6th of the price it was at the turn of the century.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByAdam Sarhan  ByAdam Sarhan , Contributor.  NEW YORK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 06: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] morning trading on August 06, 2024 in New York City. Stocks opened up slightly up in the three major indexes a day after the Dow Jones and the S & P 500 had their worst day of trading since 2022, amid a global market sell-off centered around fears of a U.S. recession. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago\/Getty Images) February 2025 was a tough month on Wall Street. The month began with promise: tariff concerns eased, tech stocks rallied, helping the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 to hit new highs, economic data was steady\u2014but then sellers showed up and sent stocks lower in the second half of the month. The major indices and many important areas of the market erased their post election gains and are now lower than where they were in November 2024. All things equal, that\u2019s not a good sign. In fact, the Nasdaq 100 erased all its gains going back to July 2024. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are trading where they were in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, the damage in small and mid cap stocks are much worse.    The mid-cap S&P 400 erased all its gains since March 2024 and the small cap Russell 2000 hasn\u2019t gone anywhere since January 2021! Walmart gapped down after reporting earnings and that sparked a wave of selling on Wall Street. First, retail stocks fell in sympathy then other stocks fell. The retail ETF ($XRT) is trading in the same spot it was in January 2021! That\u2019s not a good sign either. The artificial intelligence trade is under pressure as sellers showed up and sent a slew of AI stocks lower in February. Nvidia\u2019s earnings were the big disappointment in February. The institutional AI darling, a cornerstone of Wall Street\u2019s AI\/tech rally, posted robust earnings and revenue growth the stock fell over 4.1% which dragged the market lower. The broader \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d mega cap stocks\u2014already under pressure from a cooling AI hype cycle\u2014fell in February, which put more pressure on the market. Macroeconomic data also came in to play in February. Inflation was not a major concern (yet) but the Fed\u2019s February FOMC minutes, released mid-month, hinted at a pause in rate cuts, a stance that was more hawkish than initially expected.   By the end of the month, weaker retail sales and consumer demand data suggested a slowdown, complicating the inflation story. Investors are conflicting, some are worried about stagflation and some are hoping for a soft landing. Policy shocks added another layer of volatility. President Donald Trump\u2019s mid-February announcement of new tariffs on lumber, forest products, and other items sparked fresh concerns about a new trade war. Investors are concerned that a trade war could distrupt the supply chain and spark retaliatory risks from Canada, Mexico, the EU, and China. The tariff rhetoric, an extension of Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda, clashed with its inflationary potential, leaving Wall Street divided on its net impact. We saw a lot of damage in February on Wall Street. Right now a defensive stance is warranted until the bulls regain control and repair some of the technical damage. Looking forward, Wall Street\u2019s focus shifts to a trifecta of news: Economic, Political, and Earnings news. Next week we have the always fun jobs report and we\u2019ll see what the latest will be with respect to Trump\u2019s next policy moves. The sellers have the slight upper hand as the major indices test import long term areas of support. If support holds that will be bullish. If not, we can easily have another leg down.

The political events of recent months have provided new clarity to this old question.\u00a0 On November 21, 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) charged Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and ex-defense minister, Yoav Gallant, with crimes against humanity and war crimes and issued arrest warrants for them. The ICC was founded in 2002 \u201cto put an end to impunity.\u201d It has struggled to do so: that same year the United States Congress passed the American Service-Members\u2019 Protection Act, better known as the\u00a0Hague Invasion Act, authorizing the president to use any means necessary to obtain the release of American or allied personnel from the ICC. The US has never been a member of the court, and the Biden administration repeatedly denounced the warrants. On February 6 President Trump, explicitly retaliating against the ICC\u2019s \u201cillegitimate and baseless actions targeting\u201d Israel, issued an executive order announcing sanctions on it. As always Trump is blunt. But after two decades of bipartisan hostility to the court, other American politicians can hardly pretend they want to put an end to impunity.\u00a0 On December 1, despite his previous pledges to the contrary, President Biden pardoned his son Hunter, not only for the three crimes he had been convicted of and the nine he had pled guilty to, but also for \u201cthose offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\u201d As an injustice, it paled in comparison to an average Trumpian afternoon. But it further weakened the Democrats\u2019 claim to represent the rule of law. During the month of December 2024, twenty-four people were\u00a0murdered\u00a0in New York City. One of them, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, made $10.2 million the previous year; federal authorities from multiple agencies collaborated on a five-day-manhunt across several states to find his killer. The shooter inscribed \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny,\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d on the cartridge casings\u2014the first two of which are well known strategies used by the health insurance industry, which in 2023 spent $93 billion on administration and still generated nearly $25 billion in net revenue. A pre-pandemic study in The Lancet found that the private health insurance system leaves 37 million Americans uninsured, inadequately insures 41 million, and causes the unnecessary deaths of over 68,000 every year. The cost of the manhunt is unclear\u2014but it was surely considerable. The other twenty-three murders doubtless did not receive similar attention. On January 10 Donald Trump was sentenced for his thirty-four felony convictions. He received an \u201cunconditional discharge\u201d without a prison term, fines, or probation. Justice Juan Merchan, of the New York State Supreme Court, referred in his sentencing to the 2024 Supreme Court decision in\u00a0Trump\u00a0v. United States, which granted the president\u00a0sweeping immunity\u00a0from criminal prosecution, and argued that unconditional discharge was the only option \u201cwithout encroaching upon the highest office in the land.\u201d Ten days later, right after he was inaugurated, President Trump commuted the sentences of fourteen people convicted of crimes during the January 6 insurrection and granted a \u201cfull, complete and unconditional pardon\u201d to anyone else convicted of any actions taken at or near the Capitol on that day. It\u2019s an ouroboros of injustice: an immune criminal president granting immunity to criminals who attempted to overthrow the constitutional order while claiming to uphold it. What unites these various events is the clarity of their message: some people can commit crimes, and others cannot. Some people can be harmed while others will be protected. Or, in the words of Frank Wilhoit\u2014not the political scientist, but the classical music composer\u2014there are some who the law binds but does not protect, and some who the law protects but does not bind.\u00a0 Impunity refers to the way a person treats society\u2014specifically, how they exempt themselves from accountability. Immunity refers to how society treats a person\u2014specifically, how it protects them from negative consequences. As Ben Tarnoff recently\u00a0argued\u00a0in these pages, publicly demonstrating one, the other, or both has become a way for American elites to assert and reproduce their status, from not paying taxes to avoiding prosecutions. To be a member of the elite is to not be held to account. There are elements both of continuity and of rupture here. Disdain for the ICC, unconditional support of Israeli violence, and the shabby personal use of pardons have all spanned administrations and parties. The absence of pretense underlying Trump\u2019s actions, however, suggests an exhausted imperial sovereignty. The American state can no longer reliably win its wars, or produce broad-based economic growth, let alone claim some normative global leadership role; all it can reliably do, it seems, is insulate its elites from accountability and protect them from the consequences of their extractive depredations. Now that the elite is unable or unwilling to deliver other goals to other constituents, the maintenance of unaccountability has become one of its core functions, along with the  upward redistribution of wealth.\u00a0 Advertisement Because impunity is so deeply ingrained in political life, inflection moments in the distribution of impunity tend also to be moments of constitutional crisis\u2014if not changes in written constitutional documents, then tectonic shifts in the basic assumptions of how political institutions are run and how the norms of the political community are constituted. We are undeniably in the midst of one such shift. * New York Review Books Illustration by Syd Hoff The republican revolutions of the eighteenth century were in part disputes over who should be held accountable\u2014and to whom. European writers like Montesquieu developed a political lexicon that was especially concerned with despotism. In\u00a0Spirit of the Laws\u00a0(1748) he warned that rule by arbitrary authority\u2014constrained neither by a lasting constitution nor by intermediary bodies like the judiciary\u2014would make for a servile, obedient, and isolated citizenry. \u201cAs fear is the principle of despotic government,\u201d he wrote, \u201cits end is tranquility; but this tranquility cannot be called a peace: no, it is only the silence of those towns which the enemy is ready to invade.\u201d (The tranquility of surrender and submission, in other words\u2014not a bad description of the state of the Democratic opposition.) The French revolutionaries were also obsessed with accountability. They produced new literary genres of autobiography and court testimony for people to give accounts of themselves and the virtue of their actions.\u00a0 The American revolutionaries associated despotism with slavery, drawing from the classical Greek word\u00a0despotes, which refers to the authority that a head of household has over women, children, and slaves. It was also associated with ownership. In 1753 the English legal theorist Sir William Blackstone\u00a0called\u00a0property \u201cthat sole and despotic dominion\u201d over a part of the external world. The Declaration of Independence accused George III of \u201ca design to reduce [the colonies] under absolute Despotism,\u201d indicating that arbitrary rule was not pure caprice but part of a plan. The law professors Joseph Fishkin and William Forbath, in their book\u00a0The Anti-Oligarchy Constitution, show that, from the nineteenth century onward, abolitionists, radical Reconstructionists, populists, New Dealers, and others in what they call \u201cthe democracy-of-opportunity tradition\u201d have argued\u00a0that the Constitution imposes obligations to block concentrated economic power and to redistribute wealth and political agency.1 One member of that tradition, Eugene Debs, observed in 1918 that \u201cthe class which has the power to rob upon a large scale has also the power to control the government and legalize their robbery.\u201d Viewed in this longer arc of history, the current irruption of oligarchic despotism is decidedly precedented, and the set of past resistances to learn from is considerable. * There are two principal expressions of arbitrary rule in contemporary American society: bureaucracy and billionaires. They appear to be at war with one another, as Elon Musk and his writhing band of anarchocapitalists and corporate raiders vandalize the state. But the drama and malevolence of their rampage obscures how bureaucracy and oligarchy mutually reinforce one another, as part of a project of class domination. In his book\u00a0The Social Production of Indifference, the anthropologist Michael Herzfeld argues that bureaucracy and the public response to it are crucial arenas for expressing and contesting accountability in modern society.2\u00a0An ideal bureaucracy would be an obstacle to despotism. By routinizing and standardizing procedures, it would remove individual judgment and, with it, arbitrary decisions or bias; bureaucrats would be be loyal to their jobs, not to individuals or interest groups. The bureaucrat is supposed to be someone an oligarch cannot buy. But any encounter with bureaucracy reveals these ideas to be hollow. Since the 1980s, bipartisan enthusiasts for market-oriented social policy have pushed to privatize the welfare and administrative state, replacing systems of civic accountability with a relentless drive for profit. Decisions were to be made not based not on rights, obligation, or humanity\u2014but rather for shareholder value.\u00a0 The market acolytes who reconfigured social life in this fashion over the past forty years promised to reduce bureaucracy but instead they multiplied it. The most hectic labyrinth in the imagination of a Soviet Gosplan apparatchik would seem transparent compared to customer service at Comcast. The insurance company that Franz Kafka worked for in Prague was a model of sanity compared to UnitedHealthcare. Even the much-maligned public bureaucracies that remain have been heavily privatized behind the scenes; their regular functioning depends on Microsoft Teams, Amazon Web Services, and Cisco. The market has become a central site of encounters with arbitrary despotism. Your insurance won\u2019t cover the care you need; your company dropped your insurance with your doctor and switched to a different one; your plan \u201cis no longer supported.\u201d Private equity bought your child\u2019s daycare and quadrupled the prices. Your bosses closed your office and used the revenue to buy back shares for themselves. You depend on the market for your basic needs, and therefore you are subject to its whims. Advertisement The sociologist Melinda Cooper, in her recent book Counterrevolution, tracks the emergence of a new class of oligarchs, who owe their power less to stewarding corporations than to  accumulating personal and familial wealth\u2014they are dynastic rather than managerial capitalists.3 This is not an inevitable outcome of the gears of capitalist inequality churning but the result of a set of identifiable policies. As Cooper shows, the rise of billionaire despots can be traced precisely to the progress of tax cuts and financial deregulation that began in the early 1980s. The 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act (known as the Kemp-Roth Tax Cut) reduced the highest income tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent and the 1986 Tax Reform Act brought that down further to 28 percent. Together these two Reagan tax cuts incentivized businesses to reorganize as private partnerships or unincorporated structures, generating pass-through income that would be taxed at the lower individual rate than the corporate rate. Even publicly traded companies like Meta or Apple now pay their executives in stock options: in 2022 stock-related pay was\u00a081.3 percent\u00a0of CEO compensation. Since the 1980s those options have often been taxed at the capital gains rate, which for stocks held longer than one year is even lower than the personal income rate. The effect was immediate: between 1980 and 1994 the mean value of stock options paid to CEOs\u00a0increased\u00a0by 683 percent, while real wages remained largely stagnant.\u00a0The consequences since 2020 have been almost incalculable.  To those legal changes we should certainly add the effects of monetary policy: from the 2008 financial crisis through 2022 the Fed expanded its balance sheet to $9 trillion, mostly through quantitative easing policies,  inflating asset prices and thus enriching owners of assets, from landlords to private equity funds. Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos\u2014the centibillionaires quivering moistly in their row at the presidential inauguration\u2014are but the most recognizable examples. New York Review Books Illustration by Syd Hoff * Capitalism legitimates itself in part by evacuating responsibility from individuals to market forces. Writing in the early 1840s, the young Friedrich Engels used the term \u201csocial murder\u201d to describe one way this happens. It was, he wrote, \u201cmurder against which none can defend himself, which does not seem what it is, because no man sees the murderer, because the death of the victim seems a natural one, since the offence is more one of omission than of commission.\u201d The concept of social murder has proven  useful lately, in a variety of settings where the prevailing language of human rights was revealed to be insufficient: it was employed to describe the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London; to reckon with the consequences of Tory austerity cuts, which have been\u00a0attributed\u00a0as the cause of some 190,000 preventable deaths; and to think about climate change.\u00a0 We need this vocabulary to understand our own oligarchy\u2014not least because our judicial system is predicated on individual and intentional acts rather than on social and distributed ones. Yet by continually performing their impunity, the new oligarchs may be creating the conditions of their own undoing; their harms that can increasingly be identified, personified, and blamed. It is not the shareholders of Tesla who are strip-mining the federal government; it is Musk specifically. It was not only the pharmaceutical market that fueled the opioid epidemic; the Sackler family specifically profited. (Their company\u2019s bankruptcy settlement, which was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court, would have shielded them from all future opioid-related civil lawsuits.) Inaction on climate change is not only a failure of collective action; ExxonMobil knew about the threat decades ago, and worked hard and lavishly to oppose regulation. Trumpian governance is an unambiguous display of familial power and personal fealty. If the past is any guide, the response to impunity is to be found not in the courts. Fights for democratization\u2014from the workplace to suffrage to anti-imperial struggles\u2014have involved wrestling power away from elites rather than insisting they use it virtuously. The antidote to impunity is an active, organized, politicized working class. We need to remake and rediscover our infrastructures of dissent: unions, political groups, protests, and other forms of community predicated on the mutual recognition of a shared condition. No elite shares your struggle: they are immune  to it, and their actions will not have the consequences that yours will have. Accountability and responsibility are forms of power unamenable to market relations, and that is why we have lost them. Their rediscovery will surely be difficult, but probably not more so than their initial establishment in the struggles of the past.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByJohn Buckingham  ByJohn Buckingham , Contributor.  Taking Market Volatility in Stride After a turbulent trading session, equities rallied into the close as February ended, with the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 601 points, or 1.39%, on the final day of the month. Of course, one might have expected the day to have ended deeply in the red, given breaking news like, \u201cTalks between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy regarding rare earth minerals collapsed.\u201d And this headline might not have inspired enthusiasm toward equities: \u201cThe U.S. economy is setting up to take a major step back in the first quarter after a pair of reports showed weaker consumer spending and a dramatic widening of the trade deficit at the start of the year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s latest GDPNow forecast.\u201d No doubt, it is hard to figure out why stocks do what they do in the short run, and investing has always been an emotional ride. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the daily swings of the market. But as our founder, Al Frank, taught me early on in my investing journey, and after decades in the market, I\u2019ve seen time and again how investors who keep their cool, especially when fear is running rampant, tend to reap the biggest rewards. I could argue that the big bounce to close out February was because investor sentiment was about as gloomy as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Believe it or not, despite the major market averages still within shouting distance of all-time highs, the latest weekly Sentiment Survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed only 19.4% of folks on Main Street were bullish. This is well below the historical average of 37.5%, while a staggering 60.6% were bearish, compared to a norm of 31.0%. Those figures put the bull-bear spread at negative 41.2%, one of the most pessimistic readings on record. History tells us that when sentiment reaches these levels, it\u2019s usually a sign that much better days are ahead. AAII Bull-Bear Spread in the Lowest (Most Lucrative) Decile To be sure, this time (and every time) is different, while past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but we don\u2019t have to look far to see what happens when the AAII folks freak out. In March 2009, as the financial crisis raged on, the Bull-Bear spread hit negative 51.4%, right at the market bottom. Many thought stocks were finished, but six months later, the Russell 3000 Index was up 52.7%. In October 1990, when the first Gulf War was providing scary visuals on the evening news, 70.3% of AAII survey participants were bearish. Six months later, the market had surged 40.3%. True, today\u2019s number of Bears is not as great, but across the six other instances where the number of Bears exceeded the current level over the 37-plus year AAII history, the average six-month return has been 19.3%, compared to the \u201cnormal\" return over that time span of 5.9%. Time after time, extreme pessimism has set the stage for outsized gains, on average, as evidenced by the 39 previous times where the number of Bulls has been equal to or less than the present tally. True, not every subsequent short-term period was green, but we can\u2019t complain about an average six-month return of 12.2%. Students of market history will like what the current AAII Bull, Bear and Bull-Bear Spread figures ... [+] suggest about near-term equity returns. Al Frank knew to keep his head when those around him were not. Back in 1979, in the midst of market chaos, he wrote: \"I sometimes lose perspective and feel that I am in a battle with almost life and death outcomes. Will the Bull gore the Bear, or will the Bear maul the Bull? Perhaps we should see the market more as populated by chickens, what with all the clucking and squawking at every ruffled feather.\" The truth is, most investors react to short-term headlines rather than long-term fundamentals, and in doing so they often miss out on the very best buying opportunities. Yes, the world is uncertain today, but uncertainty never really goes away, even as it\u2019s natural to feel uneasy when markets are rocky. But I know that fear is often the market\u2019s greatest gift. Al had another saying that I keep in mind during disconcerting times: \u201cThey are having a sale in Wall Street, with recently increased discounts. Now is a good time to buy selected common stocks for long-term capital gains in a widely diversified portfolio.\u201d We will have volatility ahead, but I see no reason to alter my enthusiasm for the long-term prospects of undervalued stocks. Warren Buffett states, \u201cWe should be greedy when others are fearful,\u201d and I might argue we should be very greedy when others are very fearful!

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByTom Aspray  ByTom Aspray , Contributor.  Financial arrows up or down -staying with the trend One of the most important skills in trading and investing is being able to identify the key levels of support and resistance for a given market. Support and resistance levels are created by supply and demand for a market at particular price levels. When prices fall to a well-established support level, increased demand for the issue at lower prices often triggers new buying. When prices rise to high levels, traders are often willing to sell their position in a market, and that increased supply can cause a market to reverse and turn lower. There are many ways to determine support or resistance, ranging from chart analysis to the levels determined by moving averages. One of the lesser-used methods is pivot levels. I often use monthly and quarterly pivot analyses to identify support and resistance levels that are not easily identified by other methods of analysis. In basic pivot analysis, a stock, market average, or ETF is positive if it is trading above its pivot level. In a positive-trending market, the next level to watch is the first resistance level above the pivot or R1. Conversely, if a market is below its pivot then the focus should be on the first support level below the pivot or S1. In StockCharts.com, if one adds pivot levels to either weekly or monthly charts, it produces a chart with yearly pivot levels. If you are plotting daily data then monthly pivot levels are displayed. On the intra-day charts, the weekly pivot levels are plotted. Spyder Trust 2020 The weekly chart of the Spyder Trust (SPY) was previously featured in January 2021 and goes back to July 2018, with the yearly pivot levels for each year. The pivot levels for 2020 appear in the upper left-hand corner, and I have enlarged them as an insert on this chart. The pivot is a solid line, while dotted lines are used for the support (S1 and S2) and resistance levels (R1 and R2) The SPY opened in 2020 well above the pivot level which was a positive sign. However, the week ending February 21 (point a) the close was below the yearly pivot. The S1 level was also broken two weeks later, during the early March plunge. Another two weeks later, the SPY dropped just below the yearly S2 level at $216.62, with a low of $215.52 for the week ending March 21 (point b). It was not until Friday, May 23 (point c) that SPY closed at $300.50, which was back above the yearly pivot at $292.64. SPY traded above and below the year R1 level at $342.79 during August and early November. Then during the first week in December 2020 (point d) SPY surpassed the R2 resistance at $369.09. 2020 Pivot & Prices The 2020 yearly pivot levels and the actual price data for 2020 are provided in the table above for SPY as well as the Invesco QQQ Trust. Though QQQ easily exceeded the R2 for the year at $258.03 the low during the Covid decline at $164.40 was just a bit below the S1 at $169.55. In periods of high volatility, I have found that the yearly pivot analysis can often keep you in a major trend when the markets are swinging higher and lower. Looking at the longer term charts can help one avoid the market gyrations. Communication Service (XLC) This chart of Communications Services Select (XLC) is one of the cleanest examples of how well the yearly pivot analysis can work. This weekly chart covers the period from May 2020 through the early part of 2025. The yearly pivots are in purple and a rising 20-week EMA is in blue with a declining 20-week EMA in yellow. On the chart my colleague Jerry A has also programmed the starc bands and moves above either the starc+ or below the starc- band are noted by yellow squares. After a Covid low of $38.68, XLC closed at $51.96 on 5\/3\/20 which was above the yearly pivot for 2020 at $49.60. The pivot for 2021 was $58,14 and XLC stayed above it all year. In 2022 the yearly pivot had risen to $76.24 and on 1\/21\/2022 XLC closed at $71.17 and generated a sell signal. In October of 2022, XLC had a low of $44.36 and then started to rebound. On 1\/20\/23 XLC closed above the new yearly pivot at $57.20 but then quickly reversed. Another positive signal was generated on 3\/27 \/23 with the close at $57.97 which was back above the pivot. XLC was featured as one of my Teflon Sectors. In July XLC reached the quarterly R1 at $69.22 before correcting for the next three months. In 2024 XLC opened the year above the yearly pivot at $64.69 and stayed well above it for the entire year. XLC opened 2025 at $98.36 which was well above the new yearly pivot at $90.38 and has held up well so far this year. The R1 for 2025 is at $108.99. Sector ETFs & Pivot Levels I hope this introduction to yearly pivots has gotten you interested as I will be discussing them further in the weeks ahead. This table has the sector ETFs as well as SPY, QQQ, NYSE, and IWM with the closing prices on 2\/28\/2025. The yearly pivots for 2025 as well as the 2nd quarter pivots are also included. XLK closed the week at $225.53 and below the QPivot at $231.12 but it is still above the yearly pivot. XLY Alao CLOEd below its QPivot as did QQQ. The quarterly signals could be reversed next week as stocks rallied sharply on Friday. IWM this week closed below both the yearly and quarterly pivot. More on the technical outlook next week.","label":1}

This compact model features an \u201cupside-down\u201d layout, allowing it to sleep up to six people, albeit snugly. Designed by Havenwood Tiny Homes in Australia, who also developed the Joely, the Beau River Tiny House is built on a double-axle trailer. It boasts a metal exterior with wooden accents and receives power via a standard RV-style hookup. Although smaller than European models like the Cardabelle, it is certainly not the smallest tiny house we\u2019ve encountered. Designer: Havenwood Tiny Homes        As anticipated, the home\u2019s interior is quite compact and efficiently designed. Entry is through sliding glass doors, and to the right is the living room. This area is elevated and accessible via a few steps. It provides room for a sofa and features a large window that beautifully frames the outside view. Adjacent to the living room is the kitchen, which is simple yet functional. It includes a sink, a two-burner propane-powered stove, and cabinetry for storage. The bathroom is located at the opposite end of the home from the living room. It consists of a toilet and a shower; however, it\u2019s unclear if a sink is included in the bathroom setup.        How does the Beau River Tiny House accommodate six people? The clever design provides multiple sleeping arrangements to maximize space. In the living room, substituting the usual sofa with a sofa bed introduces additional sleeping capacity. Directly beneath the living room is a cleverly concealed bedroom featuring a low ceiling and a double bed. This space-efficient design element adds to the sleeping possibilities. The house includes a more conventional loft bedroom, accessible by a ladder, which comfortably sleeps two more people. Although fitting six people would make for a snug environment, it\u2019s unlikely that the designer intended for a family of six to reside in the house full-time. Instead, the space is probably best suited for use as a vacation getaway or a weekend retreat, offering a cozy and intimate setting for short stays. The design\u2019s emphasis on multifunctionality and efficient use of space makes it ideal for temporary accommodations, allowing occupants to enjoy the charm of tiny house living without the long-term commitment. The home is tiny but quite mighty, accommodating six people comfortably for some time, if not full-time. The house is currently priced at roughly US$63,000, making it a viable option for small families that are seeking holiday homes. The \u201cupside-down\u201d interior layout gives the home a unique element, allowing it to stand out from other tiny homes on the market.  Have you ever noticed how smartphone manufacturers boast about their incredible camera systems, yet the front-facing cameras always seem like an afterthought?

The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on \"AI for the real world\" \u2013 building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This \"private AI\" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources \u2013 precisely the capability essential for organizations seeking to implement Stargate's vision of interconnected AI. As the Stargate framework enables more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments will increase dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for Stargate deployments. The company's AIP offering already demonstrates Palantir's understanding of the need to connect proprietary data with external AI capabilities \u2013 a microcosm of what Stargate aims to achieve at a broader scale. This early positioning in the \"AI orchestration\" market suggests Palantir could emerge as a critical middleware layer in the Stargate ecosystem, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a somewhat higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will make Stargate's promise of interconnected AI a practical reality for enterprises and government agencies. Palantir Technologies saw its stock surge in early February 2025 after strong earnings, only to retreat sharply as concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts weighed on investor sentiment. The stock initially spiked to record highs but has since tumbled 30%, with accelerating selling momentum pushing it toward key support levels. Despite the pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are split\u2014some see the sell-off as a buying opportunity, given Palantir\u2019s role in federal data initiatives. At the same time, technical indicators suggest further downside risk if support near $85, $66, and $44 fails to hold. Investors should watch for a potential recovery toward $100 and $125 if momentum shifts. The Stargate AI Project represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence architecture that could dramatically accelerate AI capabilities by enabling previously isolated systems to work together seamlessly. The five companies profiled \u2013 NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, AMD and Palantir \u2013 each offer distinct advantages for investors looking to position themselves ahead of this technological evolution. From NVIDIA's dominance in AI hardware to Microsoft's enterprise software integration, Google's fundamental AI research leadership, AMD's competitive computing solutions and Palantir's expertise in complex systems integration, these firms provide complementary exposures to different aspects of the AI value chain that Stargate aims to revolutionize. While valuations remain elevated across the AI sector, these companies' strategic positioning, financial strength and technological advantages suggest they may be well-equipped to deliver long-term value as the artificial intelligence landscape evolves.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II  ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II , Senior Contributor.  While bitcoin and ether are both market-leading digital assets, they have important differences that ... [+] separate them. Ether and bitcoin are highly visible cryptocurrencies that might interest investors. They have both experienced significant gains during their respective lifetimes, so they can potentially provide interested parties with substantial upside. This article will explore the key differences between ether, sometimes described as Ethereum, and bitcoin, so that investors can differentiate these digital assets and make well-informed decisions for their respective portfolios. Bitcoin is the digital currency of the Bitcoin network, which was designed to be a global peer-to-peer (P2P) payment system that could function independently of financial institutions or governments. The whole idea was to create a \u201ctrustless\u201d network, meaning that it does not depend on trusting a third party like a bank or other financial institution. As a result, bitcoin was meant to function as a global digital currency. While bitcoin was not the first-ever digital currency, it was the first digital currency to scale, meaning that it managed to achieve widespread adoption. As the cryptocurrency space has obtained ever-growing visibility, bitcoin has obtained increasing acceptance. Bitcoin\u2019s total market value was roughly $1.75 trillion at the time of this writing, according to figures from Forbes Digital Assets. Ether is the native digital currency of the Ethereum platform, which is a blockchain network for decentralized apps (dapps). Basically, it is a platform that allows users to develop software applications that can function without a central authority. Decentralization is important because it means that there is no central authority that can shut down a dapp. Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by total market capitalization after bitcoin, with a total market value of over $300 billion at the time of this writing, according to data provided by Forbes Digital Assets. Bitcoin and ether have completely different purposes. Bitcoin was designed to be a global P2P payment system, enabling direct transactions between users without requiring the use of trusted third parties like banks. Ether, on the other hand, was designed to be the native digital asset of the Ethereum platform, providing users a way to pay transaction fees needed to use dapps based on the platform. One major difference between ether and bitcoin is Ethereum, the network of the former, uses smart contracts, which are basically software programs that execute (follow through with specific actions) when specific requirements are met. The whole idea behind this is enabling automated processes that take place once certain conditions are met. These smart contracts can automate processes with a wide range of applications, eliminating the need for a trusted intermediary to interpret the contract and follow through once its conditions are met. Another major difference between the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks is the consensus mechanism they use. Since these networks are decentralized, they need some method to arrive at a consensus that a transaction took place. Bitcoin uses a consensus mechanism called proof-of-work (POW), where users confirm transactions and incorporate them into blocks so they can be added to the network\u2019s blockchain. POW requires significant resources in terms of electricity and computing power, a characteristic that makes it very hard for users to cheat the Bitcoin network. Ethereum uses a consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake (POS), whereby users \u201cstake\u201d (or devote) their ether so that it can be used to confirm transactions. In order to run a validator, a node used in verifying these transactions, a user must be willing to commit 32 units of ether. POS helps maintain the security of the network. In order to act in a malicious way, a user would need to obtain control of the majority of validators on the Ethereum network, which would be prohibitively costly. Users can earn income (also known as rewards) by taking part in staking. Committing units of ether for this purpose helps the network to run effectively and increases its security. At the time of this writing, the estimated annual reward for staking was roughly 2%, according to Coinbase data. It is important to keep in mind that if units of ether are involved in staking, a user cannot buy, sell or transfer them. An innovative technology, bitcoin certainly comes with its costs and benefits. The digital currency has generated substantial visibility since coming into existence more than 15 years ago, giving many the hope that it will become a global payment network that replaces fiat currencies (currencies printed by governments). However, critics have not hesitated to point out its flaws. Compelling gains: Bitcoin is highly volatile and has experienced some very impressive upside over the years. This has resulted in the digital currency skyrocketing in value since coming into existence in 2009. Visibility: As the first digital currency to scale, bitcoin has generated widespread visibility and adoption. Retail investors, governments and financial institutions have all purchased the cryptocurrency. Diversification: Bitcoin has served as a potent diversifier at some points, meaning that its price did not move in tandem with asset classes like stocks and bonds. However, the digital currency has correlated tightly with stocks at some points. Volatility: Bitcoin\u2019s sharp price fluctuations have led some critics to claim that it is not useful as a currency since its value can change so rapidly. Lack of fundamentals: Many critics would argue that bitcoin does not have fundamentals like stocks and bonds do. Shares of stock represent ownership rights in a company, and investors can look at fundamentals like the revenue and earnings of the business issuing these shares. Illicit activity: A large number of critics have pointed to bitcoin\u2019s use in illicit activities. However, they should keep in mind that bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain and can be traced by interested parties. Ether is another innovative digital currency whose network Ethereum has taken the basics of the Bitcoin network and built upon them. The digital asset has benefited from sharp upside since it became available for trade. Multiple applications: The fact that the Ethereum network offers smart contracts means that there is a wide range of applications for the platform, including decentralized finance (DeFi), the creation of other tokens and gaming. Compelling gains: Like bitcoin, ether is highly volatile and has experienced some very impressive gains since its inception. Coinbase, a major exchange, offered ether trading starting in 2016. Staking Income: Users have the ability to passively generate income by staking their ether so that the network can use it to confirm transactions. Uncertainty surrounding altcoins: Many alternative protocol assets, also known as altcoins, have managed to generate significant visibility for a time but then fell from grace, meaning they lost a significant amount of visibility, declined in total market value or both. Stiff competition: Ethereum has encountered significant competition from other blockchain platforms. Solana, Polkadot and Binance Smart Chain have all vied for market share. Scalability challenges: The Ethereum network has faced significant challenges keeping up with user demand during bull markets. Sharp increases in demand can result in high transaction fees and long wait times. Bitcoin was the first digital currency to scale, so it has a first-mover advantage. As a result, the cryptocurrency has better name recognition than any of its peers. Past that, while bitcoin has its critics, it also has a community of devoted followers, many of whom are fully sold on the vision of creating a global P2P payment system that can function independently of financial institutions or governments. Ether, on the other hand, derives its value from having actual utility. The digital currency can be used in the thousands of dapps that exist on the Ethereum network, and these software programs can be used for a wide range of applications. On the other hand, Ethereum has several notable competitors. Long-term, it is impossible to know what the future will hold. If the coming years look like the brief market history we have thus far, bitcoin will continue to be the world\u2019s most valuable digital currency (both per unit and in terms of total market value) and ether will be the second-most valuable. Bottom Line  Investors should keep in mind that bitcoin and ether have experienced significant gains during their relatively brief market histories. At the same time, they should remember that these cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, meaning their values can fluctuate quite a bit over time. While some may consider these digital assets a fad, bitcoin has been around for more than 15 years and ether has been around for close to 10 years. While these are both market-leading digital assets, they have important differences that separate them. These two have varying purposes and consensus mechanisms. Past that, ether\u2019s platform offers users smart contracts and potential rewards for those interested in taking part in staking, which involves devoting one\u2019s tokens to the network in exchange for income. Bitcoin is better for beginners. It is arguably simpler, as Ethereum has built upon its technology, and it is both the first digital currency to scale and the most valuable member of this innovative asset class. It is impossible to know what the future holds. However, it is important to remember that ether has never overtaken bitcoin by eclipsing its total market value, in spite of predictions to the contrary. Once again, nobody knows what the future will hold. However, one could argue that bitcoin is a safer investment than ether, since it has been the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency by total market value for years. One could argue that the single greatest risk associated with bitcoin and ether is downside risk, meaning the risk that one\u2019s principal (amount invested) could fall in value. Both of these cryptocurrencies have experienced very impressive gains, but they have also suffered very steep declines in value during bear markets.\u00a0","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByChris Westfall  ByChris Westfall , Contributor.  Layoffs for BP, and a renewed focus on oil and gas. One of the largest players in the global energy industry - a company with over $194 billion USD in revenue last year - is cutting nearly 5,000 permanent employees and 3,000 contractors, according to reports. BP, ranked 5th among the largest oil and gas companies by brand value, with a market cap of $77.14 billion USD as of December 2024, has announced cuts as part of a plan to eliminate $2 billion in costs by 2026. The elimination of the employee positions represents over 5% of the company\u2019s global workforce. Sustainability.com reports that the layoffs and firings will be a part of $500 million USD savings this year. BP, with global headquarters in London (US operations are based in Houston) hired more than 20,000 people between 2022 and 2023. That\u2019s the largest year-over-year increase in the company\u2019s history. The additional talent, brought on board post-COVID, didn\u2019t translate into the desired results. In 2023, the company\u2019s revenues were $210.13 billion USD, a decline of $30 billion (or over 14%) year-over-year. BP\u2019s stock fell about 17% during 2024, a time when competitor Exxon Mobil (the largest oil and gas company in the USA) saw its stock price rise by 5%. According to an exclusive report in Reuters, CEO Murray Auchincloss will tell investors the company is abandoning its target to grow renewable generation capacity 20-fold between 2019 and 2030 to 50 gigawatts. Other oil and gas companies have shifted their portfolios to traditional fossil fuels, where returns are more predictable. Unnamed sources close to the recent announcements have shared that the company plans to divest certain assets and cut other low-carbon investments to reduce debt and boost revenues. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has been using its 5% stake to influence tighter cost discipline and other changes for BP\u2019s oil and gas operations. Five years ago, Auchincloss\u2019s predecessor, Bernard Looney, pledged to cut oil and gas output by 40% amidst ambitious goals for renewables. In 2023, the company lowered its projected cuts in oil and gas production to 25%. \"We have got more we need to do through this year, next year and beyond, but we are making strong progress as we position BP to grow as a simpler, more focused, higher-value company,\" the CEO wrote to staffers. Murray Auchincloss, BP CEO. Auchincloss took the top spot at the company in 2023, on an interim basis, and was given the job permanently just over one year ago. With a 25-year history at the firm, including work as the CFO, shareholders reacted positively to the Auchincloss appointment. \u201cHis assured leadership, focus on performance and delivery and deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the energy transition will serve bp well as we continue our disciplined transformation to an integrated energy company,\u201d said Helge Lund, Chair of BP. Rival Shell Oil, a company whose revenues grew 5.5% during 2024 (according to Reuters), has also reduced its workforce under CEO Wael Sawan. In addition to layoffs and job cuts, Shell has reduced oil and gas exploration by 20% and has made cuts in its low-carbon division. In addition to workforce reductions, BP remains focused on delivery, safety and efficiency. In December of 2024, the company announced a joint venture in wind renewable energy, for example, with Japanese power generator, JERA. This new venture allows BP to divest itself of most of its wind energy renewables - and follow industry trends to double-down on traditional oil and gas revenues. Across the energy industry, industry leaders like Chevron, Exxon and Shell have kept their focus on traditional oil and gas. \"Geopolitical disruptions like the invasion of Ukraine have weakened CEO incentives to prioritise [sic] the low-carbon transition amid high oil prices and evolving investor expectations,\" Rohan Bowater, analyst at Accela Research, told Reuters. He said BP, Shell and Equinor reduced low-carbon spending by 8% in 2024. Demand for oil and gas is slowing, driven by reduced demand in China, and the industry is anticipating tighter financial constraints ahead.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByTom Sanderson  ByTom Sanderson , Senior Contributor.  FC Barcelona looks set to miss out on a Brazilian pearl which SPORT described as being wanted by ... [+] \"half of Europe\". FC Barcelona will miss out on a Brazilian pearl which SPORT described as being wanted by \u201chalf of Europe\u201d. Barca sent scouts to \u201co pa\u00eds do futebol\u201d (\u201cthe country of football\u201d) in order to see Corinthians left back Denner Evangelista in the Sao Paulo-held U-20 youth football tournament known as the Copinha. The 17-year-old didn\u2019t disappoint, as his team reached a final where it went 2-0 down yet managed to pull level with Denner himself getting on the scoresheet. Corinthians ultimately lost the decider 3-2 to its bitter rival Sao Paulo FC, but the talent in question came out of the defeat with his stock having risen while talked up as a future Brazil senior side star for a role that Selecao head coach Dorival Junior is currently struggling to fill. Amid reports that Hansi Flick wants reinforcements at full back to give the likes of Alejandro Balde and Jules Kounde a rest, however, Barca looks set to lose out on Denner as are a number of continental rivals that aren\u2019t named Chelsea. After spending more than $100 million in the Brazilian market on youngsters such as Andrey Santos, Deivid Washington, Angel Gabriel and Estevao \u2018Messinho\u2019 Willian in recent years, the Premier League giant will stump up another $10.4 million (\u20ac10 million) on Denner as an agreement in principle was closed on Friday. A further $4.15 million (\u20ac4 million) in variables could come Corinthians\u2019 way depending on how Denner progresses and performs, while \u2018Timao\u2019 also reserves 15% of any future sale of the youngster. Denner - who has already been made a Brazil U-17 international - won\u2019t cross the Atlantic to London until he has become of adult age, which we have seen before with the likes of Vinicius Jr., Rodrygo and Endrick when they agreed to join Real Madrid. In the English capital, Denner will be welcomed by his cousin and Arsenal center back Gabriel Magalhaes, plus of course Estevao once he officially completes a $67.5 million (\u20ac65 million) switch from Palmeiras. As for Barca, the search continues for a full back though head coach Hansi Flick would reportedly prefer an ambidextrous one capable of operating on either flank.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"What just happened? Intel announced a significant revision to the construction timeline of its Ohio One semiconductor manufacturing site in New Albany. The setback is the third substantial delay from the facility's original 2025 completion target. Intel emphasizes its commitment to the project and its ability to accelerate construction if market demand warrants.  The first phase of the facility, known as Mod 1, should be finished in 2030, with chip production beginning between 2030 and 2031. The company's revised timeline also affects the project's second phase, Mod 2, pushing it back to a 2031 completion date, with operations beginning in 2032. The Ohio One campus, once dubbed the \"Silicon Heartland,\" is an ambitious undertaking. It will span approximately 1,000 acres and include up to eight semiconductor fabrication plants. The site will also accommodate support operations and industry partners. Initial investment estimates were around $20 billion, with potential for up to $100 billion in total development costs. Despite the frequent delays, the site has made significant construction progress since work began in 2022. Key milestones include completion of the underground foundation, commencement of above-ground construction, installation of air separation units and underground piping, pouring over 200,000 cubic yards of concrete, and more than 6.4 million hours of invested labor.  The revised timeline reveals that the Ohio facilities will utilize process technologies developed after Intel's 14A and 14A-E nodes, currently scheduled for introduction in 2026-2027. These advanced manufacturing processes will likely rely on ASML's cutting-edge High-NA EUV lithography tools, costing around $350 million each. Intel has already begun hiring and training employees for the Ohio facility. Workers are receiving training at existing Intel sites in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, preparing them for the eventual opening of the local facility.  Intel's decision to delay the Ohio plant opening comes amid a challenging period for the company and the semiconductor industry. The past year has seen Intel grappling with financial losses, layoffs, and leadership changes. The company has also made strategic decisions to simplify its product roadmap, including canceling an AI chip project. While the delay may raise concerns about Intel's outlook on future demand, it also allows the company to manage its capital expenditures more effectively during market uncertainty. By postponing significant investments in production equipment, Intel can focus on returning to profitability while maintaining the flexibility to ramp up operations when market conditions improve.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. saw $94.3 million of total inflows on the last day of February as crypto's worst month in three years came to an end.   The figure capped an eight-day streak of outflow during which investors pulled over $3.2 billion from these funds as digital asset prices fell.   BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF by assets under management, was one of the outliers that saw $244.6 million in outflows on Friday. Meanwhile, other large ETFs, including Fidelity\u2019s FBTC, brought in $176 million from investors, while the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF saw the largest inflows, bringing in $193.7 million, according to Farside Investors data. The inflows came as the cryptocurrency market started showing signs of recovery after the price of bitcoin hit a $78,000 low in the early hours of Feb. 28. Bitcoin is now trading around $84,900 after rising 1.6% in the last 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index rose 0.3% to 2,705.  Over the past week, BTC is still down by roughly 12%, while the broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, fell by 15.8%. Spot bitcoin ETFs had been enduring a significant outflow streak since Feb. 14, a day in which these funds saw $66.2 million inflows. Spot ether ETFs, on the other hand, have maintained an ongoing outflow streak on the last day of February, with $41.9 million leaving these funds. Since their last day with a positive net flow, $357.5 million exited these funds, according to data from Farside.  The recent market recovery comes as the White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will host a crypto summit on March 7 and after the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, added a 1% to 2% allocation of its spot bitcoin ETF to one of its model portfolios.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Halo has broken free of its Paramount+ exclusivity in some markets and is now available to watch on Netflix.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Famous Xbox franchise turned TV show, Halo, is now available to watch on Netflix in some global markets, but only Season 1. It first showed up a couple of weeks ago in the Coming Soon list, but March 1 marks the show's debut outside of the Paramount+ streaming service. Halo has, sadly, underwhelmed with its reception, and has subsequently been dropped by Paramount for any further seasons. I haven't yet seen it myself, because I don't subscribe to Paramount+, but there seem to be conflicting opinions on it. There are plenty of folks who enjoyed it, but long-time, devoted Halo fans, aren't always so complimentary about it. And apparently Master Chief doesn't wear his helmet enough. I guess that's fair, after all, the Master Chief suit is one of the most iconic and recognizable in all of gaming. Halo isn't outright moving to Netflix at this time, and so far as we know, it hasn't been picked up by the streaming giant for any future seasons. At least, not yet, anyway. It also won't be leaving Paramount+, so if you subscribe to that, you'll still be able to watch it there.  A report from What's on Netflix detailed that Halo is available in select markets in South America, Australia and New Zealand, the UK and markets across mainland Europe. Regardless of press or public reviews of Halo, there's one thing I'm fairly certain of; It launched on the wrong platform. Simply put, if you want your show to be a success, especially carrying the weight of a franchise like Halo, it needs to be on Netflix or Prime Video. Everyone wants a piece of the pie these days, which has led to a streaming service for just about every major provider. But above all others, Netflix remains the market leader, and Prime Video is certainly right up there as well. Why is that of note? Xbox's other recent TV show, Fallout, calls Prime Video its home, and it has been an incredible success. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Quality of the two shows aside, Fallout was immediately better placed for success simply for having a greater chance of hitting eyeballs. Paramount+ (at last report) had 72 million subscribers, where Prime Video boasts over 200 million, and Netflix over 300 million. It's a simple numbers game. Halo now has the advantage of being seen by a portion of that 300+ million subscriber base, and more besides if it ever joins the U.S. catalog. Netflix also has form for picking up shows cancelled by other networks and finishing them, as with titles such as Manifest and Designated Survivor. Who knows what could happen.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 1, 2025 While limited data plans still exist, unlimited plans have become much more prevalent in the US market over the last decade or so. Unfortunately, not all unlimited data plans are created equal. Many carriers only provide so much high-speed data before the line is slowed down in priority or even capped at a slower speed that ranges from unnoticeable to unusable. The most common limit you\u2019ll find is on streaming quality, with many services limiting the quality to just SD (480p.) Are there any US mobile plans that offer no streaming throttle, or at least all give you the option to adjust your quality settings? Yes, actually, there are several options on both the postpaid and prepaid side of the market. Even though the big three carriers typically stick to SD streaming for many of their plans, there are a few exceptions at the higher end of the scale: While many prepaid providers cap streaming at SD quality, there are certainly several exceptions: While there are a few other options, like MobileX, that offer higher-than-SD streaming on the prepaid side, most are limited data plans. In most cases, streaming above SD quality isn\u2019t ideal, as it can quickly deplete your data. If your carrier doesn\u2019t support higher streaming rates over cellular data, a VPN may be an option. For those unfamiliar, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is primarily designed for internet privacy, but it can also let you do things like change the region that streaming services and websites think you\u2019re in. Additionally, it can sometimes bypass carrier-imposed streaming restrictions. Before signing up for a VPN, be aware that this falls into a gray area at best. Even if you bypass your carrier\u2019s streaming quality restrictions, not all VPNs work equally well. Some may struggle with certain streaming services, leading to connection issues. Using a VPN can also slow down your internet speeds, which may impact your ability to stream videos smoothly. In most cases, we recommend using an official carrier-supported option from the list above rather than relying on a VPN, as this reduces the risk of compatibility issues with your carrier or streaming service. If you do decide to go down the VPN route our top recommendation would be ExpressVPN, though NordVPN is also a great alternative. While I ran through all the options above, you might be curious about my take on the best choice. The best network for streaming will largely depend on where you live and work, but here\u2019s a quick look at my recommendations across the three major carriers:","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"  (Welcome to Tales from the Box Office, our column that examines box office miracles, disasters, and everything in between, as well as what we can learn from them.) \"I know the real story. One guy wouldn't even sit for a f**kin' poster shoot.\" Those are the words of director Kevin Smith, speaking with Marc Maron on a January 2011 episode of his podcast \"WTF.\" Smith was coming off of his 2010 studio comedy \"Cop Out,\" which starred \"Die Hard\" legend Bruce Willis and \"SNL\" alum Tracy Morgan as a pair of odd-couple cops. Needless to say, Smith had a tough time making the film. Also worth saying, Smith wasn't disheartened because of Morgan. \"Were it not for Tracy, I might've killed myself or someone else in the making of that movie,\" Smith added. Smith, who made himself known to the world with his beloved 1994 hit indie \"Clerks,\" was coming off of the box office disappointment that was \"Zack and Miri Make a Porno.\" What looked to be his Judd Apatow-esque mainstream breakout hit turned out to be a bit of a misfire commercially. For his follow-up, the filmmaker went full studio by teaming with Warner Bros. for a two-hander, big-budget comedy with one of the most beloved movie stars of all time. It would prove to be another commercial dud, one that left a lasting impression on Smith and altered the course of his career. In this week's Tales from the Box Office, we're looking back at \"Cop Out\" in honor of its 15th anniversary. We'll go over how it came to be, why the title had to change, what went down behind the scenes with Willis, what happened when it hit theaters, what happened in the years after its release, and what we can learn from it all these years later. Let's dig in, shall we?   The film centers on veteran detective Jimmy Monroe (Willis) who needs money to pay for his daughter's upcoming wedding. He decides to sell his prized '52 Pafko baseball card, but it's stolen before he can collect the cash. As a result, Jimmy and his partner Paul (Morgan) must confront a gangster who is obsessed with sports memorabilia to track down this prized possession. Written by Rob and Mark Cullen, the film started life as a screenplay titled \"A Couple of Dicks\" that made it onto The Black List, which is an unofficial list of the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood. The script made its way to Warner Bros. and, eventually, into Smith's hands. This would be the first time that Smith would ever direct a movie he didn't write. It would also be the last.\u00a0 \"The whole movie is like cops who are practically married but not actually, and, I mean, that's right up my alley. It's like Dante and Randall [from 'Clerks'] as cops,\" Smith said to Vulture in 2009. Smith actually took a pay cut to direct \"Cop Out\" in part because he wanted to keep it R-rated, but also because he was so excited at the prospect of working with Willis. \"For anyone who says 'He just sold out, he's just going for the buck' \u2014 I'm making less to make this movie than I did on 'Dogma,' which is a movie I made 10 years ago and didn't make a lot of money,\" Smith said in March 2009. Willis had not done an outright comedy in a long time, whereas that was firmly in Smith's wheelhouse. But the $30 million budget was far more than Smith was accustomed to working with. He was, however, accustomed to working with Willis, as the director had a small role in 2007's \"Live Free or Die Hard.\" They had an established relationship. What could possibly go wrong?   In his book \"Tough Sh*t,\" Smith described Willis as \"the most dour\" person he's ever met. An entire chapter is dedicated to Smith's time making the film, and it is not an upbeat one. \"If I wrote the real story in the book, it'd be way worse,\" Smith later said at a San Diego Comic-Con panel in 2012. Put mildly, Willis was not the man Smith hoped he would be. According to Smith, he was uncooperative, late, and difficult. In that same interview on \"WTF,\" Smith made it crystal clear how he felt. \"It was difficult. I've never been involved in a situation like that where, one component is not in the box at all. It was f**kin soul crushing. I mean, a lot of people are gonna be like, 'Oh, you're just trying to blame the movie on him.' No, but I had no f**king help from this dude whatsoever.\"\u00a0 But some tried to shift the blame to Smith himself. \"He smokes way too much pot. He sat behind his monitor. He didn't interact with the actors. The actors felt they were on their own,\" a talent rep who worked on the production said of Smith to The Hollywood Reporter in 2011. Smith fought back against that characterization. The point is, the whole thing was ugly and the vibes on set were clearly bad. Willis' camp even released a statement trying to calm down rumors that the two didn't get along on set. \"There is absolutely no rift between Bruce Willis and Kevin Smith. Bruce very much enjoyed working with Kevin Smith as well as his co-star Tracy Morgan. The only reason Mr. Willis was not at the wrap party for the film is that he was in Los Angeles taking part in a press junket and press activities for his movie Surrogates.\"   There are near-countless hours of Smith discussing the Bruce Willis\/\"Cop Out\" situation, making it truly difficult to distill. What matters is that a script with promise was corrupted by a dysfunctional set. Despite having by all accounts a great screenplay and a great supporting cast, one that also included the likes of Seann William Scott (\"American Pie\"), Rashida Jones (\"Parks and Recreation\"), and Michelle Trachtenberg (\"Gossip Girl\"), who recently passed away, the end result failed greatly to live up to expectations. Warner Bros. did their best to market the film, which is part of why the title was changed. Unfortunately, the end result was a movie very few critics got behind, making things exceedingly complicated, particularly since the budget ballooned closer to $40 million. The marketing was clever. The above trailer is leaning into the fact that Warner Bros. had made some classic cop films over the years. It's a fun hook, but it only went so far. \"Cop Out\" hit theaters on February 26, 2010, taking in a respectable $18.2 million. Smith's comedy had to settle for second place as Martin Scorsese's \"Shutter Island\" was in the middle of its big box office run, topping the charts with $22.6 million. Unfortunately, lackluster reviews and competition from Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" among others, meant the film dropped sharply in the coming weeks, falling out of the top ten entirely by mid-March. Smith's buddy comedy finished its run with $44.8 million domestically to go with a weak $10.7 million overseas for a grand total of $55.6 million worldwide. With a smaller budget and better reviews, who knows what could've happened? As it exists though, the movie was a sizable flop. Yet, somewhat ironically, it's still the highest-grossing feature of Smith's career.   \"He changed everything for me though. Because now I'll never meet anybody. That was it. I'd rather like people from a distance,\" Smith said of Willis on that \"WTF\" interview. The experience left a mark on him, with Smith also taking aim at film critics in the years that followed. \"So many critics lined-up to pull a sad & embarrassing train on 'Cop Out' like it was Jennifer Jason Leigh in 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' watching them beat the s*** out of it [it] was sad,\" Smith said in an infamous Twitter rant in 2010. Smith then went back to his indie roots with the action\/horror flick \"Red State,\" in addition to leaning into podcasting. He hasn't made another studio movie since and, for a time, was even threatening to leave the world of directing behind entirely. Smith's tune changed following his heart attack seven years ago, an event that even influenced \"Clerks 3.\" Still, for much of that time, he didn't have much nice to say about Willis or \"Cop Out.\" Time does have a way of changing things. In 2022, it was revealed that Bruce Willis was retiring from acting due to his Aphasia diagnosis. This sent shockwaves through Hollywood, with love and support flowing in for the beloved action star. Smith, taking to Twitter at the time, apologized for everything he'd said about the actor over the years: \"Long before any of the 'Cop Out' stuff, I was a big Bruce Willis fan, so this is really heartbreaking to read. He loved to act and sing and the loss of that has to be devastating for him. I feel like an a**hole for my petty complaints from 2010. So sorry to [Bruce Willis] and his family.\"   Willis hasn't said much about the experience since the press tour wrapped up. For him, it was onto the next thing. For what it's worth, other directors have expressed some irritation with Willis over the years, with Antoine Fuqua calling him a \"pain in my ass\" while directing \"Tears of the Sun.\" So it's not like Smith is some singular outlier. Whether or not Smith looks back differently on \"Cop Out\" in earnest 15 years later is something only he can know. What's true is that he's certainly more accepting of it now, even holding a 15th anniversary screening at his own Smodcastle Cinemas recently with Tracy Morgan on hand. At the very least, Smith has let the bitterness go. There's something to be said about that as far as a life lessons go, more than one about the business of filmmaking. On a similar note, there is something to the whole \"don't meet your heroes\" thing. Actors aren't the people they portray on screen. For filmmakers out there, there is a square peg, round hole thing going on here. Smith wanted a change after what happened with \"Zack and Miri,\" but interpreting other people's work with big movie stars in the studio system didn't allow him to thrive. The downfall of \"Cop Out\" can't purely be attributed to the friction between Willis and Smith. Am I suggesting that filmmakers shouldn't branch out beyond their comfort zone? Of course not, but there's something to be said for trying to make something happen. It rarely pans out. As for the Bruce Willis of it all, Hollywood has a tendency to think stars = success. Can that be true? Absolutely. But getting Willis increased the budget and created an unhealthy working environment. Might this comedy have thrived with a different duo? It's certainly worth wondering. Star power isn't always the answer.  A post shared by Kevin Smith (@thatkevinsmith)  ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"ByRussell Flannery  ByRussell Flannery , Senior Contributor.    Harvest Capital Founder Alan Song.   (Note: This is an edited translation based on the cover profile of Beijing-headquartered Harvest Capital founder Alan Song in the December issue of Forbes China.) China's largest restaurant chains aren't as well-known globally as McDonald's and KFC. Yet one of the country's most successful venture capitalists thinks their international heft will increase over time, pointing to an important trend for investors looking for growth at a time of widespread economic uncertainty. \u201cThe companies we have invested in -- like Lao Xiang Ji (\u201dLXJ International\"), Xiaocaiyuan and Babi Food -- can all become the McDonald's and Starbucks of the East,\u201d Harvest Capital's founding partner Alan Song said in a recent interview with Forbes China. \u201cChinese people can create their own brands and deserve a better life. Chinese entrepreneurs will also become owners of outstanding brands like those in the West.\u201d \"The world is facing the possibility of consumption downgrade, and China is no exception. We will closely align with the development trends of the Chinese and global economies, placing greater emphasis on developing high-quality consumer industries\" that have found loyalty and growth worldwide, he added. Song, who holds a doctorate in business from the University of Minnesota, founded Harvest Capital in 2007 with a focus on consumer retail business. An industry mentor at China's elite School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University, he is also a member of the Global Council at New York University. Song joined the financial industry in 1995, working at Everbright Securities and Huatai Securities early in his career. Harvest has focused on value investing since its founding. Song said other key success factors include being the sole outside shareholder and bringing in enough capital to have an impact on a company\u2019s operations. Underlying his strategy is a belief that China's evolving \"consumer society\" will be a crucial driver for spending that improves the overall quality of life in the country. By focusing on essentials such as clothing, food, housing, transportation, healthcare, education and entertainment, Song said he wants to address the core and frequent needs of 80% of Chinese consumers. As income rises, consumption is \"no longer just about higher prices but about quality improvement,\" Song wrote in an article last year. \"Since the last century, companies like Coca-Cola from the United States and Unilever from the United Kingdom have grown globally by offering high-quality, affordable products. Similarly, more such companies will emerge in China.\" It\u2019s been a winning approach for Song so far. Harvest now has over $4 billion in assets under management. Among his most successful investments is a return of more than $1 billion from an investment of 350 million yuan (approximately $50 million) in the energy beverage company Eastroc. Harvest-invested restaurant chain Xiaocaiyuan has gained 25% since it went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December. In month, LXJ International, which has 1,400 stores in China and is the largest Chinese fast-food chain in Harvest\u2019s portfolio, submitted its application to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Harvest purchased 5% of LXJ International as a first-round investor in 2018 and is the sole outside shareholder, Song noted. Harvest Capital founder Alan Song made the cover of the December issue of Forbes China. Looking ahead, Song believes that as China transitions from a production-oriented society to a consumption-oriented one, the share of consumer spending in China's GDP has nearly 20% room to increase from 50% (including public and private consumption) last year. In the process, he believes, China will spawn more global companies\u2014hopefully including many of those in Harvest\u2019s portfolio. Song said he's learned about success from the restaurant industry in the United States and Japan. Japan's three major beef bowl chains \u2014Yoshinoya Holdings, Sukiya, and Matsuya\u2014underwent a fierce price war in the 1990s, establishing Japanese fast-food chains' core values and cost structures. Lessons from their experience has impacted the business communities in both China and the United States, Song said. Though domestic leaders at home in Japan, the group has not achieved success on par with KFC and McDonald's because of their inability to synchronize supply chain management efficiency with business expansion; Chinese companies now have the potential to do better, Song believes. Edited excerpts from a recent cover interview with Song by Forbes China follow: Forbes China: You're among the biggest gainers on the new Forbes China Midas List. How did you do it? Song: In the financial industry, most people adhere to the philosophy that investing is based on portfolio theory. After introducing mathematics into finance, it became a game for smart people attempting to profit from market fluctuations. The history of Wall Street over the past 100 years has proven that most narrow stories do not end well. In contrast, those who persist with an entrepreneurial spirit often reap substantial rewards. Over the past two decades, we have been fully committed to becoming a primary enabler of corporate growth. We're not limited to making suggestions in the boardroom; our (ideas) extend deeply into an enterprise's daily operations, encompassing brand building, channel expansion, marketing, insights into consumer trends, digital transformation and the establishment of business intelligence systems. We are not speculators seeking short-term arbitrage. In life's journey, flow (being fully immersed in a task) is crucial, and the essence of success is far more than just money. I use the following as a metaphor for my work: I\u2019m bringing a group of athletes to the corporate Olympics. I will feel very proud if I can help more Chinese companies become champions. I believe in Peter Drucker's management science. For example, I\u2019ve invested in many restaurants, fast-moving consumer good companies, food and beverage businesses, cosmetics and especially fast food. Many often ask why Chinese cuisine hasn't been able to go global and create world-class brands. I believe the reason is non-standardization. The diversity and complexity of Chinese cuisine make it difficult to standardize; it requires extensive training for chefs and personalized presentations. Pedestrians walk past a McDonald's Corp. restaurant in Shanghai in 2023. Harvest Capital's Alan Song ... [+] says effective supply chain management has been a factor in the company's big global success. Photographer: Qilai Shen\/Bloomberg With such a diverse range of global cuisines, why is it that only the United States has been able to cultivate the most publicly listed companies and brands? The U.S. has 61 publicly listed restaurant companies, and the world's largest industrialized restaurant brands are all in the U.S. \u2014 McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks, and Chipotle. If you study this phenomenon seriously, you will find that Americans believe in supply chain and management science. Globalization, industrialization, standardization, and modernization of their products are the secret weapon of the American fast-food industry\u2019s success. The companies we have invested in -- like LXJ International, Xiaocaiyuan and Babi Food -- can all become the McDonald's and Starbucks of the East. Chinese people can create their own brands and deserve a better life. Chinese entrepreneurs will also become owners of outstanding brands like those in the West. Charlie Munger once said life presents many opportunities, but few are genuinely structural. If you seize them, you will be a big winner. People who trade continuously cannot have a perfect life. Forbes China: Is Harvest itself expanding beyond China? Song: When an economy develops to a certain level, it has a certain degree of economic spillover. Capital, brands and entrepreneurs face the challenge of going abroad and participating in global competition. I think it is a good phenomenon. Harvest Capital is no exception. We are currently at a critical stage of international expansion. We are an institution deeply involved in consumption that has achieved significant results, and will participate in the global competition for consumer goods business. So far, we have established companies in the U.S., Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Consumer investment, however, differs from other types of investment. According to Maslow\u2019s theory of the hierarchy of needs, national cultures and ethnic backgrounds vary yet the underlying logic of consumption is fundamentally similar; people's basic consumption needs are consistent. Therefore, there\u2019s a commonality in consumption culture, consumer civilization and consumption demand across different markets, cultures, and ethnic groups. In the future, we will focus on the mass consumer goods market -- primarily essential and high-frequency products and services. At the same time, we will also cater to the everyday needs of ordinary people, focusing on products with exceptional cost-effectiveness. I don't reject elite consumption, but mass consumption has always been the mainstream demand in the development of consumer goods. We will do what we are good at within our understanding to create value for society. In the past, reform and opening up in China meant foreign investment coming to the country. In the future, reform and opening up will mean that Chinese entrepreneurs will go abroad, becoming a significant force in global competition. Harvest Capital will undoubtedly move towards globalization as well, applying the experience we have gained in the Chinese market worldwide. Forbes China: What are your plans for the coming year and beyond? Song: In the future, China\u2019s economy will face challenges. The world faces the possibility of a consumption downgrade, and China is no exception. We will closely align with the development trends of the Chinese and global economies, emphasizing the development of high-quality consumer industries. Harvest Capital\u2019s core investment principles currently rely on cash flow discount models. In the next one to two years, we will focus on building new channels in essential consumer goods sectors such as convenience stores, beverages and cosmetics. These areas are highly resilient to market risks and boast robust cash flow conditions. As a financial practitioner, my goal is to transform Harvest Capital into Harvest Industrial -- and not just in China but globally. We are now looking at markets in New York, London, Paris, and Japan. Industry is what truly creates value, has social value, generates a wealth spillover effect, and truly drives social progress. This is the principle to which we adhere and is the true core spirit and pursuit of Harvest Capital. So, from this perspective, we are different from most PE and VC firms. Forbes China: What, in a nutshell, does that approach boil down to? Song: Moving upstream. Charles Dickens once said, \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" However, all we need to do is become one of this era's strong ones.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Many engineering teams are purchasing AI code review tools, but are they solving the problem they think they are? \t Over the past few months, I've had eye-opening conversations with dozens of engineers from Series-B and Series-C \t\tstartups. As the founder of Vibinex, I'm naturally curious about their code review processes, especially when \t\tthey mention it's a pain point. A common pattern emerges: their most valuable engineers are spending significant time reviewing pull requests, or \t\tworse, fixing issues in previously shipped features, instead of building new features. This bottleneck slows \t\tdown the entire development cycle, leading to product delays and frustration across teams. To address this challenge, many have turned to AI-powered code review tools like CodeRabbit, CodeAnt, Greptile, or Ellipsis, hoping to \t\taccelerate their review process. When I ask these teams how they evaluated these tools before purchase, they invariably mention the quality of PR \t\tcomments \u2013 bug detection, security vulnerabilities, style recommendations, and readability improvements. These \t\tare all valuable capabilities focused on code quality. But here's where it gets interesting: when I ask them to walk me through their actual review steps with these \t\ttools in place, a different picture emerges. They're still performing every step they did before adopting these tools. This reveals a fundamental misalignment between expectations and reality. Teams purchase these tools hoping to \t\treduce the time senior engineers spend on reviews, but they're actually getting tools that primarily help \t\tauthors write better code. Don't get me wrong \u2013 improving code quality before review is tremendously valuable. Catching bugs, formatting \t\tissues, and potential performance problems early saves time for everyone. But if your primary goal is to reduce the review bottleneck, there's a disconnect between the problem you're \t\ttrying to solve and the solution you've implemented. This insight helped me realize an important distinction: most AI code review tools on the market today are \t\tfundamentally author-focused, not reviewer-focused. They excel at: But they don't fundamentally change how reviewers experience the review process. Reviewers still need to read the \t\tcode changes line-by-line to: When engineers tell me they've adopted AI code review tools to \"save time on reviews,\" there's often confusion \t\tabout which side of the equation they're optimizing for. I used to emphasize that Vibinex wasn't competing with these AI code review tools. But I've changed my \t\tperspective. We're all trying to solve the same problem \u2013 making the development cycle more efficient \u2013 just \t\tfrom different angles. Author-focused tools improve code before review, while reviewer-focused tools make the review experience itself \t\tmore efficient. The ideal solution likely includes both approaches. Rather than viewing these as competing solutions, engineering teams should consider how they complement each \t\tother: As development teams face increasing pressure to ship faster while maintaining quality, examining the entire PR \t\tlifecycle becomes critical. The goal shouldn't be eliminating human review, but making it as efficient and \t\tvaluable as possible. By understanding the distinct needs of authors and reviewers, teams can build a more holistic approach to code \t\treviews that truly accelerates development cycles. The next time you evaluate tools in this space, consider which part of the problem you're truly trying to solve: \t Clarifying this distinction will help you make more informed decisions about which tools will actually deliver \t\tthe outcomes you're seeking.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Some sports equipment is self-explanatory. Few people need an explanation for why football players wear helmets, or why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a better idea to catch a baseball with a leather glove than a bare hand. But recently, a peculiar-looking device has prompted curiosity among spectators\u00e2\u0080\u0094a wine bottle-shaped tool gripped by athletes during rest periods at basketball games. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also popped up at NFL and NHL contests. What they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clutching is the latest in sports science known as a palm cooler. Made by a variety of manufacturers, the product is meant to reduce the physiological effects of exertion. The athletes holds on to copper tubes or other material much cooler than the ambient temperature: Between 45 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. (Too cold, like a can of soda, and you wind up constricting blood vessels.) As warm blood passes through the hand, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooled down. In theory, this rapidly cools the entire body, aiding in recovery and facilitating improved endurance. While it might seem to flirt with pseudoscience, the idea of palm cooling has support from Stanford researchers. In the early 2000s, the university began exploring ways to bring down the core body temperature of soldiers stationed in Iraq. Building on thermal regulation observed in animals like bears, which release heat through their paws, the work led to the idea that body heat could be brought down via glabrous skin surfaces harboring plenty of rapidly-dilating blood vessels. By cooling palms, you cool the entire body. By 2020, a startup dubbed CoolMitt\u00e2\u0080\u0094which framed the concept as a literal mitt to be worn, and backed by Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0094was first to market. That was followed by other manufacturers, including Apex Cool Labs, which markets a $399 pair of Narwhals. Those are the wine bottle-shaped devices seen at the 2024 NCAA women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basketball finals, among other sporting events. Apex claims that 1 to 3 minutes of cooling \u00e2\u0080\u009creduces heart rate and extends a player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to sustain a higher intensity of play longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ten minutes can reduce core body temperature by one-half a degree Celsius. Anecdotally, athletes report a slower heart rate, better cardio, and even some mental benefits. But as with many novel athletic devices, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some skepticism. Research is encouraging but limited in scope. One 2012 Stanford paper on palm cooling in resistance training, for example, recruited only 67 subjects. And not all research is glowing: A 2023 study published in The International Journal of Sports Medicine found no difference in runners who palm-cooled and those who did not. According to The New York Times, the United States Tennis Association wants to see more sport-focused research before permitting the CoolMitt at the U.S. Open. CoolMitt is now working with USA Cycling to evaluate the strategy on bicyclists. Despite some doubt, palm coolers are gaining momentum in professional sports as well as other fields. Firefighters in Loudoun County, Virginia, have purchased Narwhals to help first responders cool down when overheated by their heavy and bulky protective gear. Advocates also see potential for palm coolers in hospital settings or at events like marathons or outdoor gatherings where heat-related illness is a concern. In all likelihood, you'll be seeing a lot more athletes embracing them in the future. \u00c2\u00a9 2025 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved","label":0}

The brand already has several slide-in models to its name, like the Adilette clogs and those Stan Smith platform mules. But of them all, adidas' revived Adiclog might be the most luxurious. The adidas Adiclog is back from the '90s as the brand's \"newest\" clog featuring an Italian-made construction. The slip-on shoe gets a full premium suede takeover, with the creamy material making up the uppers and interiors of the shoes (cushy-looking footbed, too). adidas has even prepared the Adiclog in classic neutral colorways, black and brown. The black is especially nice, going \"quiet luxury\" with stealth-like coloring atop high-quality textures. adidas' Adiclog reminds me of a premium Birkenstock but with Three Stripes, molded with a similar approachable shape and design. But what makes this Adiclog truly an adidas piece \u2014 besides the brand stamps throughout \u2014 is its sporty spirit.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":" Are we finally getting a GPU in stock and at MSRP on launch date?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Nvidia has allegedly delayed the launch of its mainstream RTX 5070 GPU to March 5 to counter the arrival of AMD\u2019s RX 9070 and 9070 XT GPUs, which are scheduled to become available the day after Team Green has put the 5070 on store shelves. But despite its launch date still a few days away, Best Buy has already put up a listing for the cheapest (so far) Nvidia 50-series GPU. The Asus RTX 5070 Prime 12GB (h\/t momomo_us) is live on Best Buy, although it\u2019s still marked as coming soon.  This listing is good news for users planning to upgrade to the latest 50-series GPU but who don't have the budget for more expensive options like the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5080. Both GPUs had very limited stock upon launch, with those available often selling for way above the MSRP. However, while seeing a listing for the 5070 at MSRP gives us hope that budget builders will finally be able to get a graphics card without paying hundreds of dollars more than what Nvidia said on stage, history tells us that these MSRP prices probably won't last long. We also wish that the RTX 5070 is readily available, meaning we can get one without needing to sign up for a lottery or lineup for days outside Micro Center \u2014 but we will figure that out soon enough on March 5. Given the recent trends, we also expect shortages to cripple this launch, just as we saw with the last few releases. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT GPUs also launched yesterday. These GPUs are designed to directly compete with RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, and while the launch price of RX 9070 is almost the same as the RTX 5070 at MSRP, the higher tier RX 9070 XT is substantially more affordable than the RTX 5070 Ti at just $599 (versus $749 for the Nvidia GPU). This $150 price difference could drive mainstream gamers to Team Red, provided that there\u2019s ample availability come March 6. AMD had several weeks to stock these GPUs, especially since the company suddenly dropped them from its CES 2025 announcement despite its board partners already showing them off. So, we believe that there should be at least some stock to satisfy the pent-up demand of gamers looking to get their hands on next-generation GPUs. Only time will tell if the supply lasts more than a few minutes, hours, or days, though. But before you go off buying a GPU either from AMD or Nvidia when they drop on store shelves, we recommend checking out feedback from trusted reviewers first, to ensure that you\u2019re getting your money\u2019s worth.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tTim Dickinson   Elon Musk, the de facto head of Donald Trump\u2019s government, is also the orchestrator of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But in leading a project to slash government agencies and the federal workforce, Musk is not missing his chance to attack the regulatory agencies that oversee the businesses that have made him the richest man on the planet.\u00a0  \tMusk \u2014 who bought his position of government power by spending roughly $290 million to elect Trump and Republicans last year \u2014 has no Senate-confirmed authority. And as a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d he has not filed any financial disclosures. Yet across his career, Musk\u2019s companies have reportedly benefitted from nearly $40 billion in government contracts, subsidies, and tax credits.  \tThe White House has said Musk is policing his own conflicts of interest. Given that Musk\u2019s business portfolio extends from social media, artificial intelligence, and financial instruments to rockets, satellites, and automobiles, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) describes him to Rolling Stone as having the \u201cMount Everest of conflicts.\u201d\u00a0  \t           \tBut even as Musk sends entire agencies that he has feuded with to the \u201cwoodchipper,\u201d he is continuing to reap new and lucrative government contracts, while deploying minions from his various companies to probe some of the most sensitive data at agencies in government.  \tBelow, we review how Musk is using his expansive executive-branch powers to defang the government agencies that pose a threat to his profits:  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  What\u2019s Musk\u2019s beef?  \tMusk, who first struck it rich at PayPal, wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into a peer-to-peer payments platform that would be regulated by the CFPB \u2014 the federal watchdog agency that polices corporate fraud, having returned more than $20 billion to tricked consumers.  What DOGE has done:  \tAfter Musk posted \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d on X, adding an emoji of a gravestone, the agency has effectively been shuttered. Short-tenured employees were fired en masse. The administration announced it would seek no funding for CFPB, and employees have been placed on forced leave, and ordered to stop all work. CFPB has also dropped investigations into firms it formerly accused of \u201ccheating\u201d customers. Perhaps most important for Musk, the CFPB\u2019s finalized rule to expand oversight of peer-to-peer payment systems is on hold.  \t            \t \t\tEditor\u2019s picks \t \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\t\t \t         U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)  What\u2019s Musk\u2019s beef?Last May, the Inspector General of USAID opened a probe into the agency\u2019s provision of internet terminals from Musk\u2019s satellite service Starlink to Ukraine. Musk also appeared to believe \u2014 or in any case was happy to parrot \u2014 brain-rot conspiracy theories about the aid agency being a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d and a \u201cviper\u2019s nest\u201d employing \u201cradical-left marxists who hate America.\u201d  What DOGE has done:  \tMusk announced on X in early February that USAID was being put through the \u201cwood chipper.\u201d The agency was effectively shuttered, with contracts to aid providers suddenly revoked, and staff called home to be laid off. The shattered remains of the agency have been folded into the State Department, and the vast majority of USAID\u2019s workforce has been put on leave.

Visit Canada\t\t \t         What\u2019s Musk\u2019s beef?  \tMusk clashed with the previous head of the FAA, Michael Whitaker, over the agency\u2019s regulation of Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX. The agency proposed more than $600,000 in penalties for safety violations at SpaceX in September, and opened an investigation into a recent catastrophic explosion of a SpaceX rocket that sent debris showering across the Caribbean.  What DOGE has done:  \tMusk effectively forced out Whitaker, who quit at the start of the Trump administration. Despite well-known staffing issues at the FAA, Musk and DOGE fired probationary employees across a wide swath of air safety roles, including lawyers who help keep pilots with drug and alcohol problems from flying, and staff who chart new air hazards like construction cranes on airplane approach paths. During the Trump administration, federal air traffic has been marred by a string of deadly collisions, and near-hit runway mishaps.  \tBonus conflict:  \tMusk\u2019s Starlink, part of SpaceX, is expected to receive a new contract in late February to upgrade FAA\u2019s air traffic IT infrastructure, taking over for Verizon.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  What\u2019s Musk\u2019s beef  \tMusk has a long-running feud with the SEC, going back to a 2018 controversy in which Musk tweeted about his hope to take Tesla private at the (stoner-friendly) price of $420 a share \u2014 briefly sending the company\u2019s stock price soaring. In a settlement of securities fraud charges, Musk and Tesla later had to each pay $20 million in penalties.\u00a0  \tThe SEC is also a regulator of cryptocurrency; Musk has long promoted the volatile currency Dogecoin, and is rumored to be a whale, or large-scale crypto investor. (He has said he owns \u201ca bunch\u201d of Dogecoin and that SpaceX holds \u201ca bunch\u201d of bitcoin.)\u00a0  \tIn January, right before Trump took office, the SEC sued Musk personally, accusing him of failing to abide by transparency requirements in the purchase of Twitter stock in 2022, which allowed him to reap a benefit of $150 million. Musk called the lawsuit \u201cshit\u201d and decried the SEC as being \u201ctotally broken.\u201d            What DOGE has done:  \tGary Gensler, whom Musk publicly derided as SEC chair, stepped down as Trump took office. Musk and DOGE set up an X account called DOGE SEC whose first tweet established a snitch line. \u201cDOGE is seeking help from the public! Please DM this account with insights on finding and fixing waste, fraud, and abuse relating to the Securities and Exchange Commission,\u201d the account wrote.  NASA  What\u2019s Musk\u2019s beef?  \tMusk does not have obvious beef with the agency that has a nearly $3 billion contract with SpaceX as part of a mission to return astronauts to the moon.\u00a0  What DOGE has done:  \tNASA has so far been prominently spared the buzzsaw treatment that has hit so many other agencies visited by DOGE and reportedly is attempting to negotiate an exemption from the Musk trend of firing shorter-tenured or \u201cprobationary\u201d employees.  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)  What\u2019s Musk\u2019s beef?  \tNHTSA is America\u2019s road safety regulator, and it has repeatedly clashed with Musk over his attempts to rush self-driving Teslas onto the road. Since 2021, NHTSA has required automakers, like Tesla, to report accidents involving cars with advanced driver assistance systems. In recent months, the agency opened a pair of probes into the dangers posed by the millions of Teslas equipped with \u201cfull self driving\u201d and remote driving features.  What DOGE has done:  \tNHTSA was hit with deep staff cuts, estimated at one-in-ten employees, through a combination of terminations for short-tenured or \u201cprobationary\u201d employees, and deferred resignations.  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  What\u2019s Musk\u2019s beef?  \tUSDA is reportedly probing Musk\u2019s brain-implant firm Neuralink for possible Animal Welfare Act violations.      \t \t\tTrending Stories \t \t       \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tTrump Administration Now Attacking Judge\u2019s Wife\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t\u2018Snow White\u2019 Is Like Being Stuck in the Most Controversial Disney-Adult Nightmare Ever\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tDel Records CEO Begins Trial, Calls Charges Linked to Drug Kingpin Act 'Deeply Wrong'\t\t \t          \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tHow One Scrappy RPG Studio Could Be Nintendo\u2019s Secret Weapon for the Switch 2\t\t \t         What DOGE has done:  \tDOGE has touted cuts of more than $230 million at the agency, which included mistakenly firing experts working on the bird-flu epidemic that has sent egg prices through the roof.

Its success lies not in its user interface or marketing but in its DNA to disrupt the status quo. And with tools like Divi at the helm, WordPress is no longer just about building blogs \u2014 it\u2019s rewiring how we think about building websites. But is this sentiment resonating with the consumers? Let\u2019s discuss where WordPress stands today in the market and what fuels WordPress\u2019s growth.  Remember when blogs were the hot new thing? That\u2019s when WordPress stepped into the spotlight.\u00a0WordPress didn\u2019t just stick to blogging, though. As more people started using it, the platform grew in exciting ways. Thanks to plugins, users could add new features without touching a line of code. They could also make their sites look exactly how they wanted with themes, opening up endless possibilities for customization. Fast forward to today, and the numbers are pretty impressive. WordPress now powers nearly 62% of all websites that use a CMS. That\u2019s not just blogs anymore \u2014 we\u2019re talking online stores, business websites, portfolios, and anything else you can imagine on the web. What made WordPress such a hit? It\u2019s simple \u2014 the platform grew with its users. While other website builders kept their code under lock and key, WordPress opened its doors to developers. Developers could jump in, add features, and improve the platform. It\u2019s like having millions working together to build the perfect website tool. Before we dive into the data, let\u2019s establish our source. W3Techs is a highly sought-after and respected information aggregator about web technologies, such as content management systems and server-side programming languages.  Recent data from W3Techs shows that WordPress powers over 43% of all websites on the Internet. That includes all websites, not just those using a content management system. As mentioned earlier, the numbers get even more impressive when broken down further. WordPress claims a massive\u00a061.7% share of the market among websites that use a content management system. 2014 WordPress powered just 21% of websites using a CMS worldwide. Now? W3Techs shows WordPress powers 43.6% of all websites as of February 2025. The numbers tell an interesting story. WordPress grew from 43.1% to 43.6% from January 2024 to January 2025 \u2014 a smaller jump than we\u2019ve seen before. But don\u2019t mistake steady for stagnant.  This steady growth marks a natural shift in WordPress\u2019s story. What makes this pattern so remarkable? Most tech platforms follow a boom-and-bust cycle, chasing trends and fighting to stay relevant. WordPress bucks this trend. Instead, WordPress shows the stability you\u2019d expect from a platform that runs nearly half the world\u2019s websites. It has become the backbone of the modern web, growing steadily while others struggle to keep pace. Let\u2019s see how WordPress compares to its rivals. Fresh numbers from January 2024 to January 2025 show some movement in the market for Content Management Systems.  What\u2019s behind these shifts? Specialty platforms are finding their groove. Webflow attracts designers who want pixel-perfect control. Shopify draws store owners who need simple setups. Each platform carves out its own corner of the web. These small shifts in the market tell a bigger story. While niche platforms chip away at specific segments, WordPress keeps its firm grip on the broader market. The gap between WordPress and these platforms speaks volumes about user preference. Not every website needs a content management system \u2014 29.5% of sites run without one. However, when people choose a CMS, they overwhelmingly choose WordPress. Its steady growth and market leadership show how well it meets the changing needs of website owners worldwide. Hence, the fall of websites with no CMS is inversely proportional to WordPress\u2019s growth.  Market share graphs don\u2019t paint a complete picture. A great way to understand the market\u2019s \u201cmood\u201d is to analyze what people are searching for. So, we dug into search trends on Google Trends for different website platforms. This gives us a window into what people consider before starting their website journey \u2014 not just what they end up using. As the trend from January 2024 to January 2025 suggests, WordPress remains the most searched Content Management System worldwide.  How is the interest measured? When Google Trends shows a score of 100, that\u2019s peak popularity. A score of 50? That term is half as popular. And 0 means there wasn\u2019t enough search data to count. Now for the real story: WordPress averaged 85 in search interest. Shopify followed at 74, Wix at 43, while Squarespace and Webflow trailed at 14 and 7. January 2024 started with:  But here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Shopify caught up to WordPress by November 2024 and even nudged ahead by one point in January 2025.  Breaking up this trend geographically, Shopify is popular in countries like the USA, Canada, Australia, the UK, New Zealand, Pakistan, And China. WordPress, on the other hand, is very popular in European countries such as Germany, France, and Italy, as well as in Asia and Africa (barring countries like Pakistan, China, and Cameroon.)  This tells a very interesting story. Shopify is primarily popular in countries with high per capita income, whereas WordPress doesn\u2019t necessarily see this trend. Its popularity is evenly spread across the globe, breaking geographic and financial barriers and keeping the internet\u2019s mission alive: democratization. WordPress started in a college dorm room and now runs nearly half the internet. Here\u2019s the stuff that didn\u2019t make the headlines: Numbers tell one story, but the real magic happens under the hood. WordPress didn\u2019t capture 43% of the web by accident. From cost savings that make CFOs smile to flexibility that developers love, let\u2019s unpack what drives millions to choose WordPress over alternatives. WordPress thrives because of you and a vibrant community of creators. Thousands of developers share, build, and solve problems together. But what does open source mean? It\u2019s simple. You can access the code that powers WordPress, allowing you to study, modify, and improve it. Unlike platforms that keep their code hidden, WordPress gives you complete control. This openness creates something unique. A bustling community of over 50,000 developers actively contributes to making WordPress better. Think of it as the world\u2019s biggest potluck. Developers bring their best features to the table. Designers share stunning themes. Users help each other grow through forums, meetups, and WordCamps. Need help with a tricky problem? The WordPress.org forums will likely give you multiple solutions within hours. Thanks to its open-source nature, WordPress evolves based on your needs, not corporate agendas. You get new features because you want them. Improvements occur because the community, including you, drives them. The result is a platform that truly serves you. Starting a website shouldn\u2019t drain your bank account. WordPress itself comes free. You only pay for essentials like hosting and domain names. Quality hosting providers like SiteGround offer WordPress-optimized plans starting at just $2.99 per month, with features like free SSL certificates and daily backups included.  But the real value goes beyond the price tag. WordPress gives you complete ownership of your website. There are no unexpected price hikes, no feature limitations, and no being held hostage to platform changes. Every dollar you invest builds your asset rather than renting space on someone else\u2019s platform. Most WordPress websites cost between $100 to $500 to launch, depending on your needs. Plus, you can start small and scale up as your business grows. With countless plugins and themes available, you can build a professional website without breaking the bank. Your investment keeps working for you year after year. WordPress plugins and themes are like building blocks for your ideal website. With over 60,000 free plugins and thousands of themes available, you can add almost any feature to your site. Turn a basic website into an online store with WooCommerce, create beautiful forms, or set up a full learning platform. This extensive ecosystem means you don\u2019t need a generic solution. You can tailor each website to meet specific needs without writing any code. WordPress can handle it all, whether you\u2019re creating a simple blog, a complex ecommerce site, a membership platform, or a learning management system. The best part is that new plugins and themes are released daily, offering fresh features and designs. Your website can continuously evolve as your needs grow. WordPress works great whether you\u2019re running a small or big business. If you own a local bakery, you can start with a simple website to show your menu and location. As your business grows, you can add features like online ordering, delivery tracking, and customer loyalty programs without changing platforms. Big companies like The Walt Disney Company, Microsoft, Sony Music, and The New York Times Post trust WordPress to manage millions of visitors. You\u2019ll find it easy to use, while its strong infrastructure supports large businesses. Universities use it for student portals, nonprofits for donations, and artists for portfolios. WordPress also smoothly handles different types of content. You can manage blog posts, products, events, courses, and custom content types. Your website can grow with your business, meeting new needs without starting over. WordPress plays nicely with your favorite business tools. Connect your email marketing service, set up payment processors, or sync with your CRM system. Popular services like Mailchimp, PayPal, and HubSpot are smoothly integrated through plugins or direct API connections. Your website traffic spikes? WordPress handles sudden growth without breaking a sweat. Smart caching, content delivery networks, and optimized databases keep your site running fast under pressure. Want to expand to multiple languages? Add an online store? Launch a membership site? WordPress grows with you. Each new feature integrates naturally with your existing setup, creating a seamless experience for both you and your visitors. A fast website keeps visitors happy and Google smiling. WordPress sites can achieve excellent performance with the right optimization tools. Quality hosting, like\u00a0SiteGround, forms the foundation while caching plugins like\u00a0WP Rocket handles technical tasks like file compression and lazy image loading. Search engines love well-optimized sites. Tools like Rank Math\u00a0simplify SEO by guiding you through content optimization and managing technical aspects behind the scenes. No expert knowledge is needed to achieve solid search rankings.  WordPress lets you build your perfect performance stack. Start with the basics and add more advanced optimization as your site grows. The platform\u2019s flexibility means you can fine-tune every performance aspect to match your needs. Page builders put the power of web design in your hands \u2014 no coding required. Your design ideas come to life through simple drag-and-drop controls, letting you see changes instantly as you work. Start with professionally designed templates and elements, then make them your own. Moving sections around or tweaking colors takes seconds instead of hours of wrestling with code. The days of waiting weeks for developers or spending thousands on basic websites are over. Page builders give you complete control over your site\u2019s look and feel \u2014 perfect for photographers showcasing their work or shop owners launching their first online store. Page builders changed the game for WordPress \u2014 and Divi took that change to a whole new level. While WordPress handles your content behind the scenes, Divi turns your browser into a design playground where websites come to life in real time.  Picture this: over 200 design modules are at your fingertips. No more puzzling over code or battling with clunky editors.  You can drag and drop what you want where you want it\u2014whether that\u2019s a fullscreen video header or an interactive pricing table. And when you need a creative jumpstart, Divi\u2019s library of 2,000+ professional layouts has your back, letting you mix and match designs until your site feels just right.  WordPress gives you the engine \u2014 Divi hands you the keys and shows you how to drive. Become A Divi Member But Divi\u2019s magic doesn\u2019t stop at individual pages. The Theme Builder breaks WordPress templates wide open, letting you customize every inch of your site. Want a unique header for your blog posts? A special footer for your shop pages? Done and done.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"For the past several years my desktop has also had a disk dedicated to maintaining a Windows install. I\u2019d prefer to use the space in my PC case for disks for Linux. Since I already run a home NAS, and my Windows usage is infrequent, I wondered if I could offload the Windows install to my NAS instead. This lead me down the course of netbooting Windows 11 and writing up these notes on how to do a simplified \u201cmodern\u201d version. The setup Terin Stock ended up with is rather ingenious, to be honest. They had to create not just an environment in which netbooting through iXPE using iSCSI, but also a customised Windows PE ISO that included the necessary drivers to make installing Windows onto a iSCSI-connected remote drive possible in the first place, because they\u2019re not included in the Windows installation ISO. This isn\u2019t exactly a standard setup, of course, so there were a few roadblocks to clear before getting there. They now have Windows 11 booting from a drive in their NAS, and it seems it doesn\u2019t affect gaming \u2013 the reason why they did this in the first place is an online game that hard-requires Windows \u2013 at all. Installing the game through Steam took a bit longer, sure, but regular gameplay seems unaffected, and there\u2019s no saturation on the network or disk. You\u2019d think this would be wholly too slow to be suitable for gaming, but I guess at least some games handle this just fine. My uneducated guess is that more demanding games that rely on a ton of disk activity to load textures and so on will have a much more difficult time running. In any event, this intrigues me, and I\u2019m kind of curious to try and set this up myself, if only for the memes. It looks like fun.  Follow me on Mastodon @[email\u00a0protected] If he\u2019s running iSCSI he\u2019s probably running a 10Gbps network, so as long as he has fast SSDs on the other end it shouldn\u2019t bottleneck. 1 Gbps network, switched across VLANs, to a ZFS cluster setup for durability\u2014not performance\u2014on WD Red 5400 rpm drives. For the type of game this setup was built for, this seems to work fine. I imagine immersive open-world experiences will struggle or have a lot of assets popping. In 2025 iPXE is completely useless for netbooting. You can just set an UEFI device path to the iSCSI LUN and boot it. Since the BootXXXX variables can use an iSCSI DevicePath as long as the NIC DXE Driver is linked against the UEFI iSCSI Boot library (they usually are). You also need the iSCSI Initiator Name Protocol in the UEFI implementation. In the UEFI boot menu you configure your IP addressing for the NIC (DHCP or static, VLAN ID if needed). Then you configure your iSCSI initiator. Once booted in the OS installer, most modern operating systems will get the IQN from the UEFI firmware and the iSCSI target information and use their own iSCSI initiators to connect. I\u2019ve done this countless times for virtualization clusters that have SAN Boot where Fibre Channel wasn\u2019t available. iPXE on UEFI hardware is completely useless for such a scenario. I\u2019ve built a K8S cluster with Raspberry PIs and the UEFI firmware for RPi, just like this. I\u2019ve also made them boot VMware ESXi for ARM just like this. Help keep OSNews alive!","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"Stocks Soar in Late Friday Rally Following Zelensky\u2019s White House Fiasco Wall Street ended the week on a high note, shaking off geopolitical tensions after President Donald Trump\u2019s tense White House showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Stocks wobbled early as Trump warned Zelensky he was \u201cgambling with World War III,\u201d but markets shook off the uncertainty and surged into the close. The S&P 500 added 1.59 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 601.41 points, or 1.39 percent. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.63 percent, marking a strong rebound from earlier losses. Early in the day, stocks climbed before dipping into the red when Zelensky balked during a White House meeting when Trump reiterated the U.S. position that it would seek a negotiated settlement to Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. Zelensky, seeking stronger U.S. security guarantees, walked away empty-handed\u2014leaving behind a mineral-rights deal that had been viewed as key to securing continued American support and deepening ties with the U.S. economy. Markets dipped briefly but rebounded decisively, with investors signaling confidence in Trump\u2019s negotiating approach. The stock rally suggests Wall Street views Trump\u2019s America First foreign policy as a source of stability rather than chaos. Investors have learned that Trump negotiates hard and that prioritizing U.S. interests over foreign entanglements creates more certainty, not less. Meanwhile, a major trade realignment is taking shape. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that Mexico has proposed matching U.S. tariffs on China and urged Canada to do the same, signaling a potential North American economic fortress against Beijing\u2019s cheap exports. \u201cI think it would be a nice gesture if the Canadians did it also, so in a way we could have \u2018Fortress North America\u2019 from the flood of Chinese imports,\u201d Bessent said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration has been actively negotiating with the Trump administration to raise tariffs on Chinese goods and shift more of its trade toward the U.S. Mexico is particularly focused on Chinese-built cars and auto parts, which have flooded its market in recent years. Trump has long linked trade policy to national security, arguing that Beijing has used Mexico as a backdoor to circumvent U.S. tariffs and undercut American industries. The administration has threatened 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods starting March 4 unless they step up cooperation. Canada, for its part, has already imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, steel, and aluminum\u2014but has yet to enact its second wave of tariffs on critical minerals, semiconductors, and solar panels. That could now become a bargaining chip in discussions with Trump. On the economic front, core inflation rose 2.6 percent year-over-year in January, moderating slightly but still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s two percent target. This diminishes the likelihood of near-term rate cuts, despite Wall Street\u2019s persistent hopes for easier monetary policy. Meanwhile, global investors piled into government bonds, pushing down yields. Some see this as a sign of caution about the health of the U.S. economy, while others believe it reflects confidence in the U.S. economy\u2019s strength amid trade realignments and shifting geopolitical strategies. Friday\u2019s market rally sends a clear message: investors aren\u2019t rattled by Trump\u2019s tough stance on Ukraine, China, or trade. If anything, the stock market appears reassured by his insistence that Washington won\u2019t be pressured into bad deals or endless foreign commitments. Zelensky\u2019s diplomatic miscalculation cost him leverage, while Trump\u2019s refusal to be strong-armed reinforced his position. Meanwhile, Mexico\u2019s willingness to align with U.S. tariffs signals a major shift in North American trade policy, further isolating Beijing\u2019s influence in the Western Hemisphere. Markets trust what they see: a White House that puts America first, a stronger North American trade alliance taking shape, and a president who isn\u2019t afraid to call the shots.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":"In context: HP has announced a significant shift in its manufacturing operations. By the end of its 2025 fiscal year, the tech giant plans to have 90 percent of its manufacturing moved outside of China. The decision comes in response to ongoing trade tensions, particularly the threat of a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports. The move is part of HP's broader strategy to enhance its supply chain resilience and adapt to evolving market conditions.  As the US implements new tariffs, consumers could see higher prices for new computers. However, companies like HP are taking proactive steps to minimize disruptions and keep costs down. Unfortunately, those cost-cutting measures include layoffs. \"We have been doing a lot of work to make our supply-chain network more resilient,\" HP CEO Enrique Lores said in a recent meeting with analysts and reporters. It is a significant pivot for the company. Just last year, Ernest Nicolas, chief supply chain officer for the company, asserted that its Chinese operations were one of HP's most important manufacturing, engineering, and innovation hubs. \"The advanced infrastructure and manufacturing talent pipeline allows it to serve as our standard of production that our global network strives towards,\" Nicolas stated.  In addition to relocating production, HP has increased its inventory as a buffer against potential tariff hikes. The company reports that its inventory reached $8.4 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, up from $7.7 billion in the previous period. According to HP CFO Karen Parkhill, this nine-day increase in inventory is part of HP's \"tariff mitigation strategy.\" The company has been stockpiling for 72 days now. An unfortunate part of the company's strategy is layoffs. It plans to eliminate up to 2,000 positions to balance costs amid tariff uncertainties. The Palo Alto company's strategic shift reflects broader industry concerns about the impact of tariffs on the PC market. With traditionally slim profit margins, PC manufacturers have limited capacity to absorb additional costs. \"[It's] a bit of a cat-and-mouse game as the various negotiations around the world take place,\" said Dan Newman, principal analyst at Futurum Research. That said, analysts expect to see accelerated growth in the PC market during the coming year, driven by several factors. The approaching end-of-support deadline for Windows 10 is anticipated to trigger a significant refresh cycle for hundreds of millions of PC users. Additionally, manufacturers will continue introducing AI-capable PCs with advanced processors, boosting demand. Recent market data from Canalys indicates a positive trend, with PC shipments growing for the fifth consecutive quarter. In the fourth quarter, OEMs shipped 67.9 million desktops, notebooks, and workstations, an increase of five percent.

{"date":"2025-03-01","content":" As an iPhone user with my iPhone 16 Pro Max as my daily driver, I will cut right to it and state that I love the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung has created something special here\u2014a device that impresses even someone firmly planted in Apple\u2019s ecosystem. While I routinely test countless Android phones, for the first time since the Z Fold6, I may have found that perfect slab of technology. Designer: Samsung In this review, I\u2019ll examine the design refinement that contributes to improved ergonomics, the stellar performance that delivers exceptional everyday use, and the thoughtful aesthetic choices that make this device stand out in a crowded market. Samsung\u2019s ambitious AI integration, powered in part by Google Gemini, redefines smartphone interactions, making this Ultra model powerful and genuinely intelligent. For Yanko Design readers, I\u2019ll mainly focus on how the industrial design choices impact the user experience, from the materials used to how the device feels. The S25 Ultra represents a maturation of Samsung\u2019s design language, balancing technological innovation with practical usability to create a device that feels both cutting-edge and comfortable.       The sustainability efforts behind this flagship deserve attention, as do the value propositions that might make even loyal iPhone users reconsider their allegiance. My assessment comes from the perspective of someone who appreciates thoughtful design above all else. The S25 Ultra delivers this abundance, making it one of the most compelling smartphones released this year. Let\u2019s dive into what makes this device worthy of consideration, starting with its refined design and aesthetics. The Galaxy S25 Ultra showcases Samsung\u2019s premium design philosophy with its titanium frame and Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass construction. The device features what Samsung calls \u2018New Luminous Colors Inspired by Nature,\u2019 creating a distinctive visual identity. The meticulously crafted body delivers a genuinely premium feel, befitting a flagship of this caliber. Samsung has pushed the boundaries of display engineering with the thinnest bezels ever seen in the S series, maximizing screen real estate while maintaining structural integrity.       Samsung has perfected the camera housing integration. The quad-camera array is thoughtfully designed, creating an aesthetically pleasing and functionally intelligent visual flow. My finger naturally rests against this gentle slope when holding the phone horizontally for landscape photography. The camera system has been significantly upgraded from the S24 Ultra, now featuring a 200MP wide camera, 50MP ultra-wide (up from 12MP in the previous generation), a 50MP telephoto, and a 10MP telephoto lens, providing 2x, 3x, 5x, and 10x optical-quality zoom capabilities.  The color options deserve special mention, particularly the Titanium Violet of my review unit. It transforms dramatically under different lighting conditions\u2014appearing almost navy in dim environments but revealing rich purple depths in sunlight. This dynamic finish makes the phone feel alive, changing its character throughout the day. It\u2019s the kind of detail elevates the S25 Ultra from a mere tool to a device you genuinely enjoy using.  Samsung has also refined the device\u2019s visual proportions. This phone boasts the \u201cThinnest Bezel Ever in the S series,\u201d enhancing the immersive quality of the screen while still providing enough edge for secure handling. Additionally, the front-facing camera is now nearly invisible during everyday use, preserving the screen\u2019s visual integrity without sacrificing photo quality. The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat titanium frame, replacing the S24 Ultra\u2019s curved edges. This design shift aligns with broader industry trends toward flat-edged flagships while maintaining comfort through thoughtful engineering. The phone weighs 219g\u2014a substantial 13g lighter than the S24 Ultra\u2014making it more comfortable during extended use despite its large display.       The frame features a matte titanium finish that provides excellent grip without feeling rough or catching on pocket fabric. This balance between security and convenience makes the phone easier to handle in everyday situations. The power and volume buttons have been thoughtfully positioned and designed with distinctive tactile signatures, making them instantly identifiable by touch alone.  What truly impresses is the weight distribution. Despite housing a massive battery and extensive camera hardware, the S25 Ultra maintains exceptional balance in portrait and landscape orientations. Samsung has meticulously positioned the components to create a device that feels natural regardless of how you hold it. The S-Pen integration deserves special praise. The stylus sits flush within the frame and ejects with a satisfying mechanism that feels deliberate rather than springy. The pen itself has been designed for improved grip during extended note-taking or drawing sessions. Writing feels remarkably natural\u2014almost like pen on paper. After two weeks of note-taking, I reached for the S25 Ultra instead of my iPad for quick sketches and annotations.  At 8.2mm thick, the S25 Ultra is 0.4mm thinner than its predecessor, contributing to improved handling. While this might seem like a minor reduction, it makes a noticeable difference when using the device one-handed. The rounded corners improve comfort, allowing the phone to sit more naturally in the palm.  For a device of this size and capability, the S25 Ultra achieves something remarkable\u2014it feels significantly more manageable than its dimensions suggest. Samsung\u2019s attention to weight distribution, surface textures, and overall ergonomics has transformed what could have been an unwieldy device into one that feels natural in the hand. The ergonomic improvements in the S25 Ultra make a tangible difference during daily use, reinforcing Samsung\u2019s commitment to refining large-screen usability without compromising comfort or design. Samsung\u2019s choice of titanium for the frame brings structural benefits beyond aesthetics. The material provides strength without excess weight, ensuring a durable build that remains comfortable to carry and use. Its thermal properties contribute to efficient heat dissipation, working alongside an advanced vapor chamber cooling system to maintain performance stability under demanding conditions.  Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass reinforces the front and back of the device, offering superior protection against daily wear. The upgraded oleophobic coating significantly reduces fingerprint accumulation, keeping the surface cleaner for extended periods. The improved slip resistance enhances grip, preventing the phone from shifting when placed on smooth or angled surfaces. Internally, material choices reflect an emphasis on efficiency and performance. A graphene-infused copper alloy in the vapor chamber optimizes heat distribution, preventing excessive buildup during extended use. This approach supports sustained performance from the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, ensuring consistent responsiveness in high-intensity tasks. The Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s camera system builds on Samsung\u2019s imaging legacy with a sophisticated combination of high-resolution sensors and advanced computational photography. The partnership with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset plays a central role, processing raw optical data with AI-driven precision to maximize image quality across various lighting conditions.  The 200MP main sensor remains the defining feature at its core, but the real improvements come from refinements across the entire system. The 50MP ultra-wide lens significantly jumps from the S24 Ultra\u2019s 12MP, reducing edge distortion by 22% to produce cleaner architectural and landscape shots. The dual telephoto setup pairs a 3x optical lens with a 5x periscope, using sophisticated pixel-binning techniques to approximate 10x optical zoom without the artifacts typically associated with digital cropping. The Snapdragon 8 Elite\u2019s Hexagon NPU and Spectra ISP optimize real-time image processing, handling 200MP bursts at 30fps while keeping thermal output in check.   Low-light photography benefits from a new Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF), which intelligently isolates moving subjects from static backgrounds to enhance clarity. In nighttime cityscape testing, STF improved noise reduction by 62% compared to the S24 Ultra, delivering sharper details in illuminated and shadowed environments. The filter tracks pixel movement across frames, applying targeted noise reduction to static elements like buildings while maintaining clarity in moving subjects such as pedestrians. The Snapdragon 8 Elite\u2019s 3nm architecture allocates AI resources to STF calculations, ensuring real-time processing even in 8K video recording. Samsung\u2019s documentation describes the technology as \u201d accurately differentiating moving and static objects to improve noise reduction in low light,\u201d producing results that preserve detail without the heavy-handed smoothing seen in earlier models.  Samsung has also introduced Virtual Aperture to Expert RAW mode, a feature inspired by professional mirrorless cameras. It allows post-capture depth-of-field adjustments, simulating apertures from \u0192\/1.4 for strong background blur to \u0192\/16 for deep-focus shots. The system analyzes 200MP depth data to produce natural-looking bokeh, avoiding some smartphones\u2019 artificial \u201cportrait mode\u201d effect. In testing, shifting from \u0192\/2.8 to \u0192\/8.0 refined background elements in a caf\u00e9 setting, keeping the subject sharp while removing distractions\u2014results that previously required manual Lightroom edits. According to Samsung, this feature enables \u201cstunning portraits with bokeh and pin-sharp landscapes,\u201d giving users unprecedented control over focus and depth beyond standard computational blur. For videographers, the S25 Ultra introduces Samsung Log, capturing 10-bit color depth for expanded post-production flexibility. The increased dynamic range helps preserve detail in shadows and highlights, while built-in tools like zebra patterns and false color overlays provide professional exposure guidance. Users can apply professional-grade LUTs, such as ARRI LogC3, directly in Samsung\u2019s Gallery app for simplified color grading. In testing, grading a sunset time-lapse using DaVinci Resolve\u2019s REC.709 LUT revealed intricate cloud textures that HDR10+ often flattens, demonstrating the advantages of the new log format for those who edit footage professionally. Samsung\u2019s computational tools extend beyond the camera itself. Generative Edit allows users to remove unwanted objects and shadows with contextual awareness, avoiding unnatural smudging. Audio Eraser intelligently filters out wind noise from videos while preserving essential background sounds. Portrait Studio refines selfies with customizable styling options while maintaining skin texture, sidestepping the overly smooth results of older beauty filters. Samsung states that Generative Edit provides \u201ccontext-aware object removal,\u201d making it easier to erase elements without requiring advanced editing skills.  Despite these advancements, some aspects of the camera system have trade-offs. The 5x telephoto sensor, with its 1\/2.52\u2033 size, struggles in dim lighting compared to larger competitors like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, which uses a 1\/1.4\u2033 sensor for its zoom. This can result in noticeable grain when capturing distant subjects at night. Generative Edit, while effective for most objects, sometimes leaves subtle artifacts when attempting to remove elements from glass reflections, highlighting the challenges AI still faces with complex transparency effects.  The Galaxy S25 Ultra delivers one of the most refined mobile photography experiences, combining computational advancements with high-end hardware. By integrating STF for low-light improvements, Virtual Aperture for depth control, and a professional-grade log format for video, Samsung continues to expand creative possibilities for photographers and content creators alike. Samsung has incorporated sustainability-focused changes in the Galaxy S25 Ultra, introducing bio-based adhesives as part of its environmental strategy. The shift from petroleum-derived adhesives to plant-based alternatives is intended to lower the device\u2019s carbon footprint. Samsung\u2019s environmental reports indicate that these adhesives contribute to a reduction in indirect supply chain emissions, though exact figures have not been independently verified. These adhesives also improve repairability. The S25 Ultra includes pull-tab battery adhesives designed for easier removal without requiring solvents or excessive heat. This approach minimizes e-waste and simplifies battery replacements, contributing to the device\u2019s longevity. Additionally, the use of bio-based adhesives aims to reduce reliance on conventional materials that may contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and bisphenol-A (BPA). By adopting non-toxic formulations, Samsung seeks to improve safety for repair technicians and mitigate environmental impact when the device reaches end-of-life. Samsung has also made impressive progress with recycled materials. The S25 Ultra\u2019s battery contains 50% recycled cobalt recovered from discarded Galaxy devices, while its frame incorporates 28% recycled aluminum. These recycled components work harmoniously with the bio-adhesives, which avoid contaminating these materials during disassembly and recycling. The eco-conscious approach extends to packaging as well. The S25 Ultra comes in 96.6% plastic-free packaging that relies on bio-based adhesives for paper-based seals, which decompose faster than synthetic alternatives. What\u2019s particularly impressive is that these sustainable choices don\u2019t compromise performance. The bio-based adhesives maintain the device\u2019s IP68 water and dust resistance rating, while the recycled materials offer the same structural integrity and thermal properties as virgin materials. This demonstrates that sustainability and premium performance aren\u2019t mutually exclusive\u2014a crucial lesson for the industry moving forward. Combined with Samsung\u2019s seven-year software update pledge, these hardware sustainability features represent a genuine commitment to reducing the environmental impact of flagship smartphones. The S25 Ultra sets a new standard for premium devices to embrace circular design principles without sacrificing the quality and performance that consumers expect. The Galaxy S25 Ultra represents Samsung\u2019s most refined vision of a flagship smartphone. It successfully balances seemingly contradictory goals\u2014delivering a large display while remaining comfortable to hold, incorporating premium materials while improving sustainability, and offering professional-grade features while maintaining intuitive usability.  At $1,299 for the base model, the S25 Ultra demands a premium investment. Still, Samsung\u2019s seven-year software commitment effectively reduces the annual cost to around $185 when considered over the entire support lifecycle\u2014a perspective transforming how we evaluate flagship pricing. The integrated S-Pen eliminates the need for a separate $99 stylus purchase, while professional camera features like Samsung Log and Virtual Aperture reduce dependence on separate equipment or subscription software. The durability improvements\u2014titanium frame, Gorilla Armor 2, and enhanced water resistance\u2014potentially reduce long-term ownership costs by minimizing repair needs. Meanwhile, battery health management and improved repairability suggest that the device will maintain performance longer than previous generations. What distinguishes this device isn\u2019t any single revolutionary feature but rather the holistic excellence across all aspects of the experience. The thoughtful ergonomics, the versatile camera system, the S-Pen integration, and the extended software support combine to create a device that feels complete and purposeful. For professionals who would otherwise purchase multiple devices to handle different tasks, the S25 Ultra\u2019s versatility represents significant consolidated value, functioning effectively as a communication device, creative tool, note-taking system, and professional-grade camera in a single package.  For designers and creative professionals, the color accuracy, stylus precision, and camera versatility make this a genuine productivity tool. For everyday users, the refined interface, all-day battery life, and durability improvements enhance the ownership experience. The S25 Ultra isn\u2019t without limitations\u2014its size won\u2019t appeal to those seeking compact devices, and its interface requires adjustment for those coming from other ecosystems. Yet, these considerations feel minor compared to its achievements. In a market often criticized for incremental improvements, the S25 Ultra demonstrates that meaningful innovation remains possible. It sets a new standard for flagship excellence that balances technological advancement with practical utility, creating a device that will stay relevant and capable for years to come. While the initial investment remains substantial, the S25 Ultra delivers comprehensive capabilities that continue providing value throughout an extended ownership cycle, making it a justifiable premium purchase for those who will leverage its full potential.
