{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  With dips in the stock market, planned staff cuts to the Social Security Administration, and rapidly changing economic policy, nearly a dozen older Americans told Business Insider they aren't sure how to navigate retirement under Trump 2.0 \u2014 so we asked financial advisors.          It turns out they've also been fielding an uptick in queries about how this political moment will impact clients' finances.               Some retirees are tempted to make drastic changes to their investments, while others feel anxious about how their Social Security benefits may fare. This comes as the White House makes sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, the Department of Government Efficiency proposes slashing budgets for government programs, and Wall Street braces for a potential recession.               Financial advisors' advice to older Americans right now? Don't panic. The news cycle since President Donald Trump's inauguration has moved quickly, and most advisors caution older adults against making any major changes to their retirement or savings accounts. Advisors told BI that building emergency funds and cutting back on spending are smarter ways to approach economic uncertainty.               \"While it's difficult not to react when stocks are falling, this has often been the best course of action, or you risk locking in potential losses and missing out on any market recoveries,\" Rita Assaf, the vice president of retirement offerings at Fidelity Investment, said. \"If you are saving for retirement, continue to stick to your plan. If you haven't created a plan, you should.\"               Here are the three top tips on retirement planning in the current economic climate from financial advisors, economists, and wealth managers.               TheS&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq have fallen recently, sparking nervousness among older Americans who have invested their retirement savings. A potential recession could also impact the value of some retirees' assets, such as their homes               \"Putting the possibility of a recession into perspective can be hard to do,\" John Canally, the chief portfolio strategist of wealth management at TIAA, said. \"Emotion is a big part of investing, for better or worse, and investors often see short-term volatility as extremely disruptive.\"               However, Gordon Whittaker, a Merrill wealth management advisor, told BI there is nothing about this period in the market that is different from other times of elevated volatility. If Americans have a smart retirement portfolio with adequate risk allocations, he said they shouldn't make any major money changes.               Financial advisors told BI that it's better to wait and see before making any immediate changes to 401(k) or Roth IRA strategies. Additionally, don't make any changes now in an effort to \"get ahead of the economy,\" Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said. He added that investors are more likely to miss out on gains rather than avoid losses when they try to outguess the market.               Market conditions will likely change again soon, and Canally said it's important to \"stay anchored\" to long-term wealth and savings goals.               Older Americans who've invested in the market should ensure their stock portfolio is diverse, Christopher Scibilia, a private client advisor at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said. People should invest in various stock options, ideally in stable industries without much risk. Scibilia added that retirees should also plan to withdraw their investments when the market is higher to avoid losses.               Regardless of age, economists and financial advisors told BI it is a good time for Americans to reevaluate their spending.               The job market could slow down, and the price of everyday items could tick up due to tariffs and market volatility, especially if there's a recession. This is a good time to examine household budgets and see what can be trimmed or cut if income changes, McBride said. He added that people should prioritize paying down debt, building emergency funds, and focusing on liquid cash savings.               Scibilia said older Americans especially should have cash on hand in case of unexpected expenses, like a medical diagnosis. He said building an emergency fund alongside a traditional retirement account should be a top consideration for Americans who are retired or are looking to retire soon.               BI previously heard from older Americans who are either unable to retire or must return to work after retirement because of financial constraints. Many said that Social Security isn't enough to afford essentials, and millions of retirees don't have adequate savings.               The Social Security fund is unlikely to be immediately affected by any of Trump's planned policies, though Trump has suggested cutting some government healthcare coverage and resources for Social Security beneficiaries.               Financial advisors and economists told BI that having multiple income streams can help protect people from market volatility or any changes in government benefits.               Assaf and Scibilia said that older Americans should consider waiting to collect Social Security. Delaying their claim until age 70 could increase people's benefits by 8%, which could be especially helpful for Americans worried about the Social Security fund dwindling in the 2030s, they said.               \"Having multiple income sources, like Social Security, pensions, or part-time work, can also provide stability,\" Scibilia said.               Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, also told BI that people with emergency funds, investment portfolios, and updated skills in their industry recover fastest from job losses. Scibilia added that pursuing part-time work and increasing health insurance coverage can help retirees weather unexpected expenses.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Online trading platform Robinhood has positioned itself as the financial app of the people, promising \u201cinvesting for all.\u201d Apparently the company has decided that what the people need as the stock market continues to undergo a \u201ccorrection\u201d is the ability to gamble. On Monday, the company announced that it will launch a new prediction hub in its app that will allow people to \u201ctrade on the outcomes of some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest events,\u201d which is apparently distinct from gambling in some way. Per Robinhood\u2019s press release the predictions hub will launch with the ability for people to \u201ctrade contracts\u201d on what they believe will be the upper bound of the target interest rate the Federal Reserve will announce in May. It\u2019ll also launch with the ability to predict the outcomes of the upcoming March Madness tournament, with both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s brackets available. While the hub will live in the Robinhood app, the \u201ccontracts\u201d are being made available by Kalshi, which is technically a federally regulated exchange under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0094but has also drawn ire from that very same agency for allowing people to bet on the outcome of elections. Shortly before Trump took office, the CFTC accused Kalshi\u2019s election contracts of being a \u201cTrojan horse to facilitate Kalshi\u2019s transformation into a large-scale election gambling market.\u201d But don\u2019t worry, Kalshi has quelled those fears by\u2026adding Donald Trump, Jr. to its board of advisers. So, less \u201caddressed outstanding concerns about unregulated gambling\u201d and more \u201cbuddied up to the kid of the president,\u201d but you know, same outcome! Robinhood has tried to get into the predictions game before. It allowed people to bet on the outcome of the presidential election, which drew criticism from lawmakers for failing to offer sufficient protections for users who were being exposed to speculative \u201cinvesting.\u201d The company tried to get in on the Super Bowl, too, but pulled back after the CFTC asked it to hold its horses. That, too stemmed from Kalshi, which was the exchange offering the contracts that Robinhood allowed its users to buy\u00e2\u0080\u0094but that seems to have resolved itself, as new CFTC acting Chairman Caroline Pham signaled these contracts will be allowed under the new administration. If you\u2019re wondering what the difference between futures contracts tied to the outcome of things like elections and sporting events and gambling is, join the club. The whole argument here appears to be that you aren\u2019t betting on odds set by a bookmaker but are instead purchasing a \u201cderivatives contract\u201d tied to the outcome of a specific event. That apparently makes it an investment and not a bet. A federal judge has upheld the legality of this kind of \u201cinvesting\u201d despite objections of the previous administration\u2019s CFTC, so it seems like Robinhood probably has a green light here. For the time being, with the Peter Thiel-backed Polymarket still technically illegal in the US, it also has a pretty strong hold on the market. Surely there is no social commentary to be found in the fact that the service that is supposedly \u201cdemocratizing finance\u201d (please do not bring up the time it literally stopped retail traders from purchasing or selling certain stocks because it was costing the wrong people money) is rapidly devolving into a platform for purely volatile and speculative \u201cassets\u201d like crypto and events predictions.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"AMD\u2019s RX 9000 series quickly joined the ranks of the best graphics cards, and it appears that its success came as a surprise to everyone \u2014 yes, even AMD itself. At a recent roundtable in Japan, the company revealed that its market share skyrocketed recently, reaching a whopping 45% in Japan. Although this refers to Japan, it\u2019s easy to imagine that AMD is gaining on Nvidia globally, too, although there are a few things to consider here. AMD\u2019s Yoshiaki Sato and Saki Suzuki shared a couple of updates during a Team AMD Roundtable held in Japan, which was later shared by ASCII. AMD was joined on stage by representatives of its many board partners, including ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, PowerColor, and Sapphire. AMD\u2019s add-in board partners (AIBs) reportedly shared that they wanted to make and sell more Radeon graphics cards, but were being held back due to a lack of GPUs. To this, AMD\u2019s Sato replied: \u201cAMD isn\u2019t used to selling [this many] graphics cards.\u201d This got a laugh from the audience, and I admit, I chuckled, too. It\u2019s a candid response that shows that AMD maybe hasn\u2019t predicted just how much gamers would be willing to embrace its new GPUs. That 45% market share in Japan is a success, but AMD isn\u2019t resting on its laurels. Sato said that the 45% figure is a \u201cpeak\u201d for AMD, but one of its board partners chimed in with: \u201cNo, we\u2019re below the majority. We\u2019re the opposition party, so let\u2019s aim for 70%,\u201d which prompted another representative to say: \u201cWe\u2019ve never been the ruling party!\u201d AMD is well aware of its market share compared to its rival, Nvidia. Worldwide figures usually pin AMD at anywhere between 10% and 18% of the GPU market. However, we might see an increase considering that AMD\u2019s RX 9070 GPUs are flying off the shelves \u2026 but that might put a stop to its market share gains, too. Although AMD was able to deliver more stock than Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series (which is sometimes referred to as a \u201cpaper launch\u201c), the GPUs are largely sold out at many U.S. retailers. When they\u2019re back in stock, they might be more expensive \u2014 and that\u2019ll put an end to AMD\u2019s performance-per-dollar argument. Let\u2019s hope that the company can find a middle ground with its board partners and deliver more cards to gamers at MSRP, or at least close to it. It\u2019s clear that the market is finally open to it. Well, look at that. AMD actually released a graphics cards that was competitive on price, performance, and features with Nvidia. And it managed to keep enough cards in stock for the launch that it wasn't immediately ruined by scalpers. Although that might seem like a low bar to reach, it's what passes for a success story for GPU launches in 2025, because Nvidia's has been one of the worst we've ever seen. As exciting as it is that there's a new graphics card that's actually kind of good and worth paying money for, though, it's not time for AMD (or fans) to rest on their laurels. There's more to push for: most notably that prices should come down further. The RX 9070 is still too expensive After the way Nvidia's RTX 50-series ended up being called a \"paper launch,\" many breathed a sigh of relief when AMD's RX 9000 series appeared on the shelves in much larger quantities. However, once this initial shipment is sold, AMD could face the same problem as the rest of the best graphics cards: Price hikes, price hikes everywhere. The cards officially hit the shelves yesterday, and many were spotted far above the recommended list price (MSRP), with some overclocked models priced at up to $250 more than the $600 starting price. However, AMD spoke several times about working with its partners to ensure wide availability at MSRP, and indeed, many retailers had some models up for sale. Those MSRP cards were only around for a short time, though, and they might never come back, according to retailers. AMD is joining the battle against some of Nvidia's best graphics cards. The RX 9070 XT and its non-XT counterpart should now (hopefully) start flooding the shelves, and gamers are hoping to see them at their recommended list price (MSRP). Unfortunately, some models may cost up to $250 more from the get-go, which is similar to all of Nvidia's recent RTX 50-series releases where the GPUs cost much more than they should. Although the cards aren't technically up for sale just yet,\u00a0Best Buy seems to have plenty of RX 9070 XT and non-XT models listed -- they're just marked as \"coming soon.\" Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  Warren Buffett has overtaken Bill Gates on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index after adding an unmatched $18.7 billion to his net worth this year.          The Berkshire Hathaway CEO has climbed to sixth place on the list with a $161 billion fortune, $1 billion more than Gates. He's also the biggest wealth gainer of 2025 so far \u2014 outpacing a $17 billion rise by the TikTok investor Jeff Yass.               Buffett has consistently trailed Gates on the rich list. When the Microsoft cofounder's net worth dipped below $110 billion during a market slump in October 2022, Buffett was worth less than $100 billion.               Similarly, during the pandemic-driven crash in March 2020, Gates' wealth dipped below $95 billion, but Buffett was under $65 billion.               Even when Buffett surged to $130 billion in March 2022, Gates still had a slight edge at about $135 billion.               The earliest entries on Bloomberg's list, which began in March 2012, show Gates at $63 billion and Buffett at $44 billion.               Buffett's gain this year reflects a 13% rise in Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares, while an 8% decline in Microsoft stock has limited Gates' wealth increase to $1.3 billion.               The Trump administration's policies have reignited inflation and recession fears, spurring investors to sell riskier technology stocks and reconsider more conservatively valued stocks such as Berkshire.               Last year, Berkshire Hathaway nearly doubled its stockpile of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid assets to $334 billion. It sold a net $134 billion worth of stocks and spent less than $3 billion on share buybacks, halting repurchases entirely in the second half of the year.               While Buffett may be ahead now, Gates has typically led him in wealth rankings even outside Bloomberg's. Gates topped Forbes' annual list of the 400 richest Americans on 25 occasions, including a 24-year streak from 1994 to 2017. Buffett, in contrast, has ranked first only once, in 1993.               Since 2006, Buffett has donated about 57% of his Berkshire shares, which make up virtually all of his personal wealth \u2014 primarily to four of his family's foundations and the Gates Foundation.               Those shares would be worth $207 billion based on Berkshire's stock price at Friday's close. If Buffett had retained those shares, he'd be the world's richest person, with a fortune in excess of $360 billion, comfortably surpassing Elon Musk's $320 billion estimated net worth.               Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, had given nearly $60 billion to their foundation as of 2023.               Regulatory disclosures show that Gates owned about 1.3% of Microsoft before stepping down as director in 2020. Most of his wealth is now held in Cascade Investment, a holding company he funded with Microsoft stock sales and dividends.               Musk remains the world's richest person, with a roughly $102 billion lead on Bloomberg's list over Jeff Bezos, who's in second place, despite Musk being the biggest wealth loser this year with a $112 billion decline.               Meta's Mark Zuckerberg is just $4 billion behind in third spot, with an estimated $214 billion, following a $7.2 billion increase this year.

The untold story of Jack Tramiel, Holocaust survivor and home computing's first king                March 10, 2025              I have vivid memories of my family's first computer: a blocky Commodore 64 parked in a corner of our basement, its cursor blinking on a royal blue screen. It was just one of the more than 12 million units sold, an astonishing business success pioneered by a Holocaust survivor and Polish immigrant named Jack Tramiel. In his latest piece for The Crazy Ones, Gareth Edwards recounts Tramiel\u2019s journey from Auschwitz to founding Commodore, and later reviving Atari. His ruthless approach to vertical integration and relentless cost-cutting made computers accessible to millions of families who could never have afforded them otherwise\u2014launching a generation of tech careers and helping shape our digital present.

In 1980, Commodore opened its first computer factory in Germany. In just three years, the company had become the third-largest computer manufacturer in the world. With annual revenue of $680 million (more than $2.2 billion today), its success was largely due to its Polish-American founder, Jack Tramiel. As he ascended to the front of the 2,000-employee crowd at the new factory, he was advised to avoid mentioning his past. Specifically, to omit that he\u2019d been a prisoner in Nazi slave camps and at Auschwitz during the war. Tramiel listened to the advice and took to the stage. \u201cI told them I was Jewish and that I was a survivor of the concentration camps. And then I said that I wanted anyone who was in the SS in my office in the next two days.\u201d Nobody\u2014nobody\u2014told Jack Tramiel what he could or couldn\u2019t do. Over the next few days, six men resigned saying that they would never work for a Jew. Over 15 others presented themselves to Tramiel and confessed that they had served in the SS. Tramiel thanked each man for his honesty, offered his forgiveness, and then told them to get back to work. He was determined to make Commodore a business of the future, not the past. He just wanted them to know who he was. And that they worked for him now. This is the story of Jack Tramiel, one of the most explosive and ruthless founders the computer industry has ever seen. It is the story of four machines\u2014the PET, VIC-20, Commodore 64, and Atari ST\u2014and of the man who ruled home computing for over 20 years. This account is based on contemporary accounts in Time, Fortune, and the New York Times, as well as books such as Back into the Storm by Bil Herd, Retro Tech by Peter Leigh, and The Home Computer Wars by Michael Tomczyk. I am particularly indebted to Commodore: A Company on the Edge by Brian Bagnall, and to both the Computer History Museum and the Commodore archive for their considerable archive of material. It is also based on the words of former Commodore executive and computer designer Leonard Tramiel, creator of the PET computer Chuck Peddle, and former editor of Commodore\u2019s print publications Neil Harris.

When Idek Trzmiel was an adolescent, he worked as a tailor\u2019s apprentice in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. In 1939, at the start of World War Two, Trzmiel, who was Jewish, was sent to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto with his family. He would spend the next five years there fighting to survive and to avoid being deported to Nazi Germany\u2019s extermination camps. In 1944, the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto was finally liquidated and its remaining occupants were marked for death. Alongside his father, Trzmiel was sent to Auschwitz. During the process of liquidation, they lost touch with Trzmiel\u2019s mother. By that time, Trzmiel was 16. He was saved by his ability to work. At Auschwitz, he and his father were among the small number of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a deportees selected by the camp authorities for survival. For almost a month, they were used as slave labor within Auschwitz itself, witnessing some of the worst horrors of the Nazi regime. Trzmiel escaped death at Auschwitz by the narrowest of margins. In August 1944, Germany\u2019s desperate need for slave labor at home meant that approximately 10,000 people were relocated from Auschwitz to a new work camp in Hanover. The Trzmiels were among them. They were saved from death, but this salvation would prove only temporary for many. As slaves, they were treated brutally. Once they were no longer able to work, they were killed.\u00a0 In early 1945, this fate befell Idek\u2019s father. Because he was no longer able to work, he was murdered with an injection of gasoline. By April 1945, only 250 of the original slave laborers sent to the camp from Auschwitz were still alive. This number included Idek. They were emaciated and unable to work. The Nazis ordered them to start digging their own graves. Right at that time, American forces finally reached the camp and liberated it. Idek spent three months recovering in an Allied hospital in 1945. Amid the chaos of liberation and immediate post-war Germany, Idek, like many others, struggled to come to terms with what they had just survived.\u00a0 \u201cI came out like a wild tiger,\u201d he remembered later. \u201cI wanted to get back everything I had lost.\u201d Like many survivors, Idek struggled to understand his experience. Over the next two years, he took odd jobs in Germany wherever he could find them. He also became fixated on revenge. When a German police officer disparaged his Jewish background, he beat him, which led to Idek\u2019s arrest and trial for assault. A sympathetic American lieutenant helped him escape jail by telling Idek the exact statutes he needed to cite to be sentenced as a Polish combatant, rather than as a civilian survivor. As a result, he was sentenced to only 30 days of confinement in a military stockade operated by American occupation forces, rather than in a German prison.\u00a0 While serving his sentence, a brief encounter changed the course of his life. \u201cThere I met a priest, because there was no rabbi, and he opened my mind up, you know? He said: \u2018If you are going to be killing them the same way that they did to you, then what\u2019s the difference between you and them?\u2019\u201d Once his sentence was complete, Idek decided that he needed to leave the past\u2014and Germany\u2014behind for good. In November 1947, Idek, who was in his early twenties, emigrated by ship to the United States with the help of a Jewish survivors\u2019 charity. He had married fellow Holocaust survivor Helen Goldgrub a few months before but had to leave her behind. The couple agreed that she would follow once he had secured reliable work. By the time he arrived in New York City, Juda Idek Trzmiel had Americanized his name and become Jack Tramiel. He had no money, job, or connections but was determined to make his mark. He lived out of a shelter for Jewish emigr\u00e9s, worked odd jobs, and learned English. Then, in 1948, he joined the U.S. Army.   \"I felt I owed something to this country,\u201d Tramiel explained later. \u201cAnd I believed in paying it back.\" This idea\u2014that a debt should always be repaid\u2014became the first of a series of rules by which Tramiel decided to live his life. It was his philosophy that applied to everything from relationships to personal choices\u2014and especially to business. \u201cJack called his management philosophy \u2018the Religion.\u2019 \u2018You have to believe in it, otherwise it doesn't work,\u2019 he\u2019d say,\u201d Michael Tomczyk, who worked for Tramiel at Commodore and Atari, later remembered.\u00a0 At this stage, \u201cthe Religion\u201d was still a work in progress. In many ways, so was Jack himself. He spent four years in the U.S. Army. While in uniform, he returned to Germany, where he discovered that his mother had also survived the war and was reunited with her. On his return to the U.S., he was accompanied by his wife Helen. Thanks to his army position, Tramiel had the paperwork\u2014and financial security\u2014to bring her back to the U.S. By the time Tramiel left the Army in 1951, he\u2019d also become a father to the first of three sons. The army had given him a new set of technical skills\u2014typewriter maintenance\u2014that he intended to put to good use. He took a job at a typewriter store in New York but wasn\u2019t there long. Tramiel used his army connections to secure a lucrative repair contract for the store\u2019s owner. In return, he expected to get a raise. When that didn\u2019t happen, he quit on the spot. \u201cI have no intention of working for people who have no brains,\u201d he told the man. Then, he walked out the door. A second tenet of Jack Tramiel\u2019s Religion had been laid down: Only work with smart people. With the help of veteran grants, Tramiel set up his own typewriter repair shop in the Bronx. The shop was breaking even, but there wasn\u2019t any real scope to expand. That was when another tenet of his Religion was laid down: Always look for opportunities.\u00a0 In 1955, Tramiel was selling mechanical adding machines, an early form of the calculator. They were sourced from a company known as Everest. During a conversation with one of its agents, Tramiel learned that the company wanted someone to be its exclusive importer in Ontario, Canada. Tramiel took on the contract and moved his family, including his first son, to Toronto. In 1958, opportunity struck again. Sears was looking for a supplier for typewriters in Canada. Tramiel persuaded the company to issue him the contract, along with roughly $175,000 in advanced sales (about $2 million today). It was an extraordinary coup for Tramiel, but he faced one problem: Despite what he\u2019d told the department store, he lacked the knowledge and manufacturing capacity to build typewriters himself. Tramiel approached the leading U.S. manufacturers, including Royal and Smith-Corona, to see if they would help bring the typewriters over to Canada. Both firms refused to supply machines to Tramiel. They wanted him to fail so they could secure the Sears contract themselves. But Tramiel had no intention of failing. He flew to Europe to find the right manufacturing partner. In Prague, Czechoslovakia, he made a deal with a local typewriter manufacturer. Tramiel\u2019s firm would import Czech typewriters to Canada, where they would alter them just enough to be able to rebadge the machines as domestically produced, exempting them from import tariffs. All he needed now was a brand name for his rebadging operation. He wanted a word with a military connection, something that would sound authoritative to Canadian Sears customers, but also in the U.S. if he decided to expand there. All the good ones like \u201cGeneral\u201d and \u201cAdmiral\u201d seemed to be taken. One day, while in a taxi in Berlin, he saw a particularly stylish car in front. The name of its maker\u2014Hudson Motor Company\u2014was emblazoned on the trunk. So was the model. It gave Tramiel the word he was after. Commodore. \u00a0Under Jack\u2019s leadership, Commodore was a financial success, but Jack was never satisfied. Whenever Commodore made money, Tramiel would invest it all back into the firm. He expanded existing facilities, spent more on advertising, and purchased new businesses to add to the Commodore brand, including an office furniture factory. This created periods of enormous growth, but also often left Commodore financially fragile and without significant cash reserves. Another tenet of Jack\u2019s religion was established: All growth opportunities must be taken, regardless of the financial burden they might place on the company. In conversation with Tomczyk, Tramiel acknowledged that this approach was partly a result of his experiences in the Holocaust. He couldn\u2019t trust what tomorrow might bring. \"\u2019I live in the future,\u2019 he told me. \u2018Only the future. There's nothing else.\u2019\"\u00a0 Eventually, this growth came at a cost. In the late 1950s, Tramiel was forced to sell half of Commodore to Atlantic Acceptance, the third largest non-bank lender in Canada. Then, he took out further loans from Atlantic Acceptance, which allowed the company to expand into electronics, such as radios, and office supplies. This time, the price was surrendering the chairmanship of Commodore to C. Powell Morgan, president of Atlantic Acceptance. Then, in 1965, Atlantic Acceptance collapsed in a financial scandal considered one of the largest in Canadian history. C. Powell Morgan was jailed for financial fraud. Tramiel, too, was investigated for financial fraud, although he was ultimately cleared. This was a financial catastrophe for Commodore. The company was heavily indebted to Atlantic, and other lenders called in their loans as well.\u00a0 Tramiel frantically hunted for a new financial patron. What he got was Irving Gould. Gould, born in 1914, was a powerful Canadian financier and owner (or part-owner) of multiple businesses around the world. Although his exact wealth in 1965 is uncertain, the lowest estimates place it in the hundreds of millions (enough to make him a billionaire, in modern terms). That wealth was, in part, built through his ability to spot financial opportunities lurking in the gray area between business activities, and the regulations and tax authorities that governed them. It was Gould who would later create a byzantine corporate setup at Commodore that would see all of its global business profits reported in the Bahamas, saving the corporation hundreds of millions in tax worldwide. Tramiel first met Gould in the fall of 1965. The financier was a man who liked to operate in the background but enjoyed a flamboyant personal lifestyle. Tramiel was the exact opposite. He was a loud, bombastic figure who lived a frugal life. Despite their differences, both men recognized a mutual talent for business. Gould could see that Tramiel knew how to create profitable businesses\u2014with occasional cash flow crises. Each crisis allowed Gould to take a little bit more of Commodore. Once the crisis had passed, Gould would take the money back out.\u00a0 On the other hand, Gould had cash to help Commodore survive. During that first investment, he took 17 percent of the company and was appointed chairman. This arrangement would cause Tramiel problems in the future, but Gould opened other doors. Their relationship triggered one of the most important events in Tramiel's life: his first visit to Japan. When Tramiel visited Japan in the late 1960s, he realized that Commodore was in the wrong business. There, he saw the future. That future involved electronic calculators, not typewriters. Electronic calculators used silicon chips to carry out the same range of calculations as Commodore\u2019s mechanical machines, but were much smaller, easier to use, and far less prone to failure.\u00a0 \"I made the trip to Japan and I found out the world was changing,\u201d he later remembered.\u00a0 As is often the case with the history of Commodore, why Tramiel decided to make that trip is open to question. Tramiel often claimed it was on his own volition, but Gould was a life-long Japanophile with shipping interests (and a mistress) there. \u201cYeah. Irving [Gould] told Jack to get his ass to Japan,\u201d Chuck Peddle, later one of the most important figures at Commodore, told the Computer History Museum bluntly in 2019. Whatever the reason, Tramiel was deeply influenced by his trip. Upon his return, he pivoted Commodore to the calculator business, importing Casio calculators and rebranding them for Canadian and U.S. markets. Soon, Commodore set up factories to build calculators of its own in the U.S. These were funded by Irving Gould\u2014in return for a little bit more of the company. For five years, Commodore flew high in the calculator business. Tramiel bought silicon chips from domestic manufacturers such as Texas Instruments, one of the largest chip makers in the world, and turned them into calculators, selling the finished product at considerable profit. He wasn\u2019t the only one doing this. In Albuquerque, an ex-Airforce officer named Ed Roberts had founded a company called MITS that was doing the same. Both men were generating large profits, but Texas Instruments was watching. Texas Instruments decided to start making calculators itself, and because the company made its own chips, it could make the machines cheaper than anyone else. By 1974, it was selling almost 30 million calculators a year, destroying the market for third-party calculator manufacturers like Commodore and MITS almost overnight. In Albuquerque, Ed Roberts reacted by accepting his defeat. In what would prove to be a key moment in the history of computing, he pivoted MITS to produce a personal computer known as the Altair 8800. Tramiel took a different lesson from the experience. He added a new tenet to his Religion: Always control the means of production. \"I had to decide a way I could not depend on the outside. How to become vertically integrated.\" Being vertically integrated meant Commodore, like Texas Instruments, had to make its own chips. But chip manufacture was highly specialized. It wasn\u2019t something you could start doing overnight. So Tramiel, ever ruthless, decided to take over someone else\u2019s chip business instead. That business was MOS Technology. Founded in 1969, MOS had perfected low-cost chip manufacture by the mid-seventies. At the beginning of 1975, it stunned the computer industry by announcing the launch of the 6502 central processing unit (CPU) chip for just $25. Meanwhile, rivals Motorola and Intel were selling their own equivalents for $179. MOS Technology seemed to be on the verge of a bright future, but the company was in deep financial trouble. In part, this was because of a lawsuit from Motorola. It was also because MOS was sitting on a huge pile of unpaid invoices from calculator manufacturers\u2014most notably Commodore, which was in deep financial distress due to its competition with Texas Instruments and Tramiel\u2019s financial strategies. Tramiel sensed a way he could save Commodore. Instead of paying his bills, he returned to Irving Gould. Gould injected sufficient capital to allow Tramiel to buy the near-bankrupt MOS. For another slice of Commodore, of course. Overnight, Commodore became a major manufacturer of chips. Tramiel had vertically integrated his production line. He also took something else from MOS. The deal was conditional on one man leaving MOS and working directly for Tramiel at Commodore: the designer of the 6502 chip itself, Chuck Peddle.   \u201cThe 6502 was specifically designed to be the universal solvent. It's just enough, and it's simple enough, and it's cheap enough that you can use it for anything,\u201d Peddle told the Computer History Museum. The Altair 8800 had proved that a market existed for low-end computers, but Peddle was one of the first to spot the market\u2019s true potential. While at MOS, he designed the KIM-1, an extremely basic computer using the 6502 to prove it could be done. Peddle had caught Tramiel\u2019s attention not because of the KIM-1, but because Tramiel wanted a way into a growing off-shoot of the calculator market\u2014chess calculators, or machines that would play you at chess. Once Peddle joined Commodore, however, he suggested to Tramiel that they go one further. Peddle pointed out that the Altair 8800 released by MITS for the computer hobbyist market had shown that there was demand for personal computers. He told Tramiel that they shouldn\u2019t waste time with calculators. Instead, they should build a computer based on the 6502 chip. \u201cI can build a personal computer that can sell,\u201d Peddle told Tramiel. Tramiel had no real understanding of what a computer was or why people might buy one. But Peddle was a smart man offering up an opportunity. That fulfilled the two tenets of Tramiel\u2019s Religion\u2014work with smart people and look for opportunities. So he told Peddle to do it. Peddle had talked briefly with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak when they were working on the Apple computer. He knew the two men were hoping to use the 6502 chip in their next machine, the Apple II. So he suggested that they let Commodore buy them out. Jobs was excited by the possibility. \u201cSteve [Jobs] started saying all we want to do was offer [Apple] for a few hundred thousand dollars, and we will get jobs at Commodore, we\u2019ll get some stock, and we\u2019ll be in charge of running the program,\u201d Wozniak said later. Jobs and Tramiel sat down to negotiate. Overconfident, Jobs told Tramiel they wanted $150,000 (about $850,000 today) for Apple. Tramiel was prepared to back Peddle\u2019s idea, but spending that much money on a company based out of a suburban garage seemed ludicrous. Jobs\u2019s attitude also annoyed him. So he walked away from the negotiations, and told Peddle he had three months to assemble a team and design the computer himself. He wanted it ready for the January 1977 Computer Electronics Show (CES). Peddle tried to explain that this was too short a deadline, but Tramiel waved his objections away and added a new tenet to the Religion: Give smart people a clear deadline and they\u2019ll somehow figure it out. Peddle set about designing and building a bespoke Commodore computer. At the time, MITS\u2019s Altair 8800 dominated the hobbyist market, while companies like Vector Graphic were making machines like the Vector 1 for small and medium businesses. Both machines required users to understand complex machine language if they wanted to create their own programs. Peddle believed that this was a mistake. He concluded that the first successful mass market computer would be one that people felt that they could program themselves. He designed a machine that came with a keyboard and monitor. Then, he set about sourcing a human-readable programming language. He decided that the language that best met that requirement was Microsoft BASIC.\u00a0 Peddle approached Bill Gates at Microsoft and requested a version of Microsoft BASIC for the 6502 chip. Gates was skeptical. He thought the chip would use up so much processing power it would cripple the machine, but agreed to do it anyway. Peddle suggested a contract where Microsoft would receive a royalty for each machine sold. Gates laughed him off. He didn\u2019t think the thing would sell, and he wanted the money upfront. \u00a0Rather than charge Commodore a small fee for every machine they sold with BASIC on it, Gates offered a perpetual license. In return for a fixed fee, Commodore would be given a version of BASIC that it could install on as many machines as it liked, for as long as it wanted. Commodore and Microsoft never revealed how much the deal cost, but most estimates have placed it at about $25,000. Commodore would go on to use that version of BASIC for every single Commodore designed and released during Tramiel\u2019s time in charge\u2014somewhere north of 15 million machines. In modern terms, the deal cost Microsoft more than $400 million in lost revenue. Bill Gates never made a fixed-fee deal again. At CES 1977, the Commodore PET was revealed to the world, wrapped in a stainless steel case that was made by a filing cabinet factory that Tramiel owned in Canada. PET didn\u2019t stand for anything. It was just a pun on the popularity of pet rock toys at the time.\u00a0   The machine was an instant hit. The only problem was that Commodore did not have the money to set up the manufacturing capacity necessary to bring it to market. Peddle raised this concern with Tramiel, who laughed it off. \u201cHe says, \u2018When HP first started selling calculators, you had to pay them in advance for 90 days,\u2019\u201d Peddle remembered. \u201cSo he said, \u2018We're going to do that.\u2019\u201d \"Three million bucks in advanced sales,\u201d Tramiel later confirmed with a grin in a Computer History Museum interview. \u201cWe knew we had a winner.\" Tramiel suspected that no customer would ask for their money back once they\u2019d pre-ordered the device, as long as they thought it was eventually on the way. Using pre-payments as a form of seed capital, Commodore was able to quickly build up the manufacturing capacity required to turn MOS chips into full-fledged computers, and to source monitors and keyboards to use with them. This strategy was successful, and several other computer firms followed suit. Unlike Commodore, not all of them delivered. Adam Osborne, one of the computing industry\u2019s rising voices, raged about these practices in his Information Age column. He said that companies that used the pre-payment method gave the new computing industry a bad name and alienated potential users. Tramiel shrugged the criticism off. He wasn\u2019t in business to be nice. By 1980, thanks to the PET, Commodore was the third largest computer manufacturer in the world.\u00a0 The success of the PET changed Commodore. From this point onwards, it was a computer company\u2014and a global one at that. With Tramiel\u2019s agreement, Gould restructured the business into a series of regional subsidiaries under a single parent company based in the Bahamas.   Gould designed this structure to minimize Commodore\u2019s tax bills and avoid, as much as possible, the need to file detailed reports and accounts. The structure also mitigated a growing problem for the company: that of managing Jack Tramiel. According to Tramiel\u2019s management philosophy, his Religion, he needed control over almost all aspects of day-to-day operations. He wanted to interview every hire and sign off every expense. He wanted to be the final decision-maker in all aspects of design, sales, and marketing. He was obsessed with control. When Commodore was small, this wasn\u2019t an issue. As the third-largest computer manufacturer in the world, with subsidiaries across the globe, it didn\u2019t work as well. Different markets required different approaches to sales. They used different regulatory frameworks, time zones, and languages. It simply wasn\u2019t possible for these subsidiaries to function if every decision or invoice had to be run past Jack Tramiel back in California On top of this, Jack Tramiel demanded absolute dedication and loyalty from his staff. He expected managers to be able to answer any question he asked about their teams or projects, and did not tolerate failure from anyone\u2014no matter the reason. If Tramiel felt someone had failed him, then no mercy would be offered. Failure often led to dismissal without warning. If Tramiel felt the employee still had some use or potential, he would subject them to what Commodore insiders called a \u201cJack Attack.\u201d They would be summoned to Tramiel\u2019s office and subjected to his full wrath. Sometimes, it would happen on the floor in front of the entire department. He would berate and insult them, question their competence and ability, and strip them of their projects or authority. Often, they would be summarily transferred to a distant location within the growing Commodore empire and given tasks well below their level or skill. Long-term Commodore employees realized that these exiles were always temporary. This was a penance they were expected to perform. If they didn\u2019t quit, they would eventually be summoned back and given their old responsibilities back. Sometimes, they found themselves trusted with even more. Tramiel seemed to believe that surviving a Jack Attack demonstrated character.\u00a0 \"I wanted Commodore to be a family. Everyone should work together,\u201d Tramiel said later, when asked about his reputation for Jack Attacks. \u201cMy personal job was not to tell them how good they are. But to tell them what they were doing wrong.\" As a management method, it created a set of die-hard, talented loyalists around Tramiel who began to refer to themselves internally as the \u201cCommodorians.\u201d But it also created a hostile working environment that meant Commodore struggled to retain new talent. \u201cOnce I asked Jack point-blank why so many managers got fired or resigned from Commodore. \u2018Business is war,\u2019 he said. \u2018You have to be in it to win. Our generals are all in the trenches, so more of them get killed,\u2019\u201d Tomczyk remembered. \u201cHe comes in like a lighted flare in a darkened room. He illuminates the scene with such brilliance that you\u2019re almost blinded,\u201d said James Finke, one of the many presidents Irving Gould put in place at Commodore to try and manage Tramiel. \u201cBut his vapor trails take a lot of the oxygen out of the air, and when he leaves the room there\u2019s no more light.\u201d Tramiel wasn\u2019t entirely happy with Commodore\u2019s new structure. He negotiated to retain full control of Commodore\u2019s U.S. arm, including chip design, manufacturing, and global strategy. Gould was happy to agree. His goal was to shield the regional subsidiaries from Tramiel\u2019s need to micromanage, and it worked. This strategy was particularly successful in the U.K., Germany, and Japan, where talented regional managers pushed Commodore\u2019s growth in ways that were hyper-optimized to their local markets. Almost as soon as the PET, Commodore\u2019s first computer, hit the shelves, Tramiel was pushing Peddle to design a new one. Peddle believed it was time to push the boundaries of what a home computer could do and began work on what became known as Project TOI (\u201cTool of Intellects\u201d). However, Tramiel and Peddle had opposing visions, and relations between the two started to deteriorate. Ever since Tramiel had first visited Japan, he\u2019d become obsessed with the Japanese approach to technical development. It wasn\u2019t just about pushing the boundaries of what was technically possible. It was also about finding ways to drive down costs. Doing so would create new buyers for technology by lowering the financial bar to entry. Peddle wanted to deliver a generational leap in technology. Tramiel was happy being second, but cheaper. What he saw was a market full of computers, all priced roughly the same, competing for the same buyers. He didn\u2019t want a computer better than the Apple II, which was a popular choice. He wanted something that was comparable but cheaper.\u00a0 And Commodore could go cheaper, because Apple didn\u2019t make its own chips. The Apple II was built around the 6502 chip, which it was buying from Commodore-owned MOS Technology. Tramiel believed he could do to Apple with computers what Texas Instruments had done to him in the calculator market\u2014release a much cheaper product, and outcompete. The only point on which both men agreed was that the new machine needed to support color displays, something most computers at the time didn\u2019t have the processing power to do.\u00a0 Peddle didn\u2019t cede, and it wasn\u2019t long before a different group of engineers within Commodore approached Tramiel with something closer to the kind of computer that he wanted. Bob Yannes, another engineer at MOS, had built a prototype known as the MicroPET. As with Peddle\u2019s KIM-1, it wasn\u2019t a full computer design. However, it proved that an evolved version of the PET could deliver everything Tramiel wanted\u2014including a cut in production cost. Tramiel ordered parallel development to start on the project, code-named Project Vixen. For a while, development on both machines continued. Things finally came to a head in April 1980 during a conference in London with the leaders of all of Commodore\u2019s subsidiaries. For several days, debate raged over which project should be taken to production. Peddle and most of those present demanded all effort be focused on Project TOI. Only two voices spoke in support of Project Vixen: Kit Spencer of Commodore U.K. and Tony Tokai of Commodore Japan. It was not lost on Jack Tramiel that they were the two regional heads he rated most highly. Finally, while all the key players were gathered for a pub lunch on the last day, Tramiel rose from his seat and pounded the table once with his fist. Everyone fell silent. \"Gentlemen,\u201d Tramiel growled. \u201cThe Japanese are coming. So we will become the Japanese!\" He had listened to all the arguments, but it was his company. His decision was that the next machine would focus on driving down costs. Project Vixen, which had started as the MicroPET, won. The decision marked the end of the successful relationship between Peddle and Tramiel. True to his ruthless reputation, Tramiel forced Peddle to leave Commodore not long after. Meanwhile, the joy of the Project Vixen team was short-lived. Tramiel issued a mandate that the machine launch at CES in January 1981, only eight months away. This tight deadline was made worse as the team found that Peddle (who hadn\u2019t yet left the company) and most of the Commodore U.S. research arm were indifferent or actively hostile to their efforts. They had wanted Project TOI and believed Vixen was doomed. They had no desire to work on it, and they believed that doing so would risk incurring the wrath of Jack Tramiel when it failed.\u00a0 Project Vixen might have been doomed, except for a quirk of Commodore\u2019s new subsidiary structure. Out of respect for Japan\u2019s electronics industry, Tramiel had allowed Commodore Japan, under Tony Tokai, to build a large research and development arm of its own. Tokai was one of the two subsidiary heads who had backed Tramiel\u2019s decision to choose Project Vixen. The Vixen team asked Tokai for support, and he gave it to them. Tokai\u2019s support proved critical to Project Vixen\u2019s success. He placed all of his development resources at the project team\u2019s disposal. This included an engineering team led by Yash Terakura, Commodore Japan\u2019s talented chief engineer. Thanks to this injection of talent and personnel, the VIC-20 was finished in time for CES 1981\u2014just as Tramiel had demanded. The VIC-20 was barely better than the PET, but it did have color, and could be hooked up to either a monitor or a television. This became a common practice, particularly outside the U.S., and it wasn\u2019t unusual to see a home computer beneath, or alongside, a family TV in many households. However, what stunned everyone was the price. Commodore U.S. and Commodore Japan were both masters of cost reduction in different areas, and their cooperation accidentally created a masterpiece. The machine cost just $299.95 (about $1,000 today), which was less than half that of any other comparable machine on the market.\u00a0   Any doubt over whether Tramiel was correct evaporated once the orders came in. In 1983, two years after launch, the VIC-20 passed 1 million computers sold. It was the first computer to reach that milestone, beating the Apple II despite launching two years after it.\u00a0 Commodore had made the first true home computer, rather than a microcomputer, as it had often been referred to before. Microcomputers like the Altair were for hobbyists\u2014people who wanted technology to tinker with. The PET was a microcomputer as well. Others like the Apple II or the soon-to-be-released IBM PC were pitched as business or productivity machines, while companies like Atari or Intellivision created games consoles. Most families didn\u2019t have the kind of money\u2014often $500 or more\u2014required to buy a computer that was specialized around one of those goals. It made buying a computer a luxury purchase. The genius of the VIC-20 was that it could do all of these tasks. It was a machine you could tinker with, use for basic business productivity tasks, or play games on\u2014all for less than $300. You could even hook it up to your television as a monitor if you couldn\u2019t afford to buy one to go with the computer.\u00a0 Suddenly, every child or teenager who had been pestering their parents for something they could play games on had an argument they could make for buying a VIC-20 that they couldn\u2019t for an Atari. The VIC-20 was educational. It was a computer. It just happened to also play games. This helped adults\u2014many of whom wanted to play games just as much as their children did\u2014justify the decision. Commodore ensured that a series of critically acclaimed text adventures were available to buy at launch, targeted at exactly these grown-up gamers. It didn\u2019t take long for Commodore to make the home computer the prime focus of its marketing message. They also found the perfect voice for the machine of the future: William Shatner.   The VIC-20 helped Tramiel decide the final tenet in his Religion: Low cost is everything. \u201cComputers for the masses, not the classes,\u201d he was quoted saying after the launch of the VIC-20. Then, in November 1981, less than a year after its launch, Tramiel decided it was time to create a successor. The catalyst for the successor came, once again, from inside MOS Technology. Its chips now lay at the heart of various non-Commodore gaming systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System and Atari\u2019s full line of systems. The subsidiary had also been working on designing chips for a new generation of video game consoles. This included its VIC-II video chip as well as something new and revolutionary: the SID chip, for sound generation. By the middle of 1981, MOS was struggling to find an outside buyer for the VIC-II and SID chips. They were bleeding-edge technology aimed squarely at video game console manufacturers. But that market had seen a downturn in investment. Ironically, this downtown was because of the arrival of home computers such as Commodore\u2019s. In November 1981, frustrated that his revolutionary design was languishing on the shelf, the SID chip\u2019s designer went to Jack Tramiel. He dragged along Al Charpentier, the creator of the VIC-II, and MOS general manager Charles Winterble for support. He argued that Commodore should use the chips in a new computer instead of video game consoles, and that they should make a VIC-20 successor built around the VIC-II and SID.\u00a0 Tramiel recognized the designer. It was Bob Yannes, the same man who had brought him the MicroPET that had become the VIC-20. Yannes had already given Commodore its biggest success (tenet one). He was clearly a smart man (tenet two). Though it might harm VIC-20 sales, there was a market opportunity (tenet three). Not least because Commodore owned the means of production for both the VIC-II and SID chips (tenet four). Jack Tramiel signed off on the project. The Religion demanded it. Yannes left the room under orders that the new machine should be ready in time for CES 1982, less than two months away (tenet five). The Religion demanded that, too.   The deadline was short but not impossible. With Commodore\u2019s vertical integration, board and chip prototyping could be done in house. Other home computer companies had to create chip designs, send them off to a chip manufacturer, and wait for them to be produced. At Commodore, it was just about finding spare staff or production downtime at MOS Technology. Nor did the team have to worry about project or fiscal management. Tramiel didn\u2019t believe in such things. \u201cI had no formal budget accountability,\u201d Winterble said later. \u201cOther than Jack watching me. Jack said that budgets were a license to steal.\u201d The VIC-20 also gave the project team a solid headstart in components and casing for the new project\u2014there is a reason that the VIC-20 and Commodore 64 look so similar. Even with the headstart, the production process was lightning-fast. The most successful computer that the world has arguably ever seen went from paper to production in just under six weeks. That machine launched at CES in January 1982 as the soon-to-be-legendary Commodore 64. The 64 was a reference to the 64 kilobytes of RAM the machine contained. This had been the only other stipulation from Jack Tramiel to the team, even though this amount of RAM was expensive at the time, and was far more than most other home computer manufacturers included in their machines. \u201cJack made the bet that by the time we were ready to produce a product, 64KB of RAM would be cheap enough for us to use,\u201d Charpentier said later. Tramiel was right. The Commodore 64 stunned both the industry and the press. It wasn\u2019t just its groundbreaking design (which was due to the VIC-II and SID). It was the price. Other machines on the market with the same broad range of specifications as the Commodore 64 were retailing at $1,000 or above. The Commodore 64 was priced at barely half that. \u201cAll we saw at our booth were Atari people with their mouths dropping open, saying, \u2018How can you do that for $595?!\u201d David Ziembicki, one of the Commodore 64 project team, remembered. The cost of making the Commodore 64 dropped once production started. Another manufacturer with such a significant price advantage may have been tempted to bank these efficiency savings as profits, but that wasn\u2019t Tramiel\u2019s way. Whenever production costs fell, he dropped the retail price further. This created a permanent price war with his competitors, who were often forced to sell their own machines at a loss. Commodore was now offering a record-making machine at a rapidly dropping price, one with a growing range of games from developers who loved its chipset. Commodore\u2019s rivals desperately tried to match Tramiel\u2019s price cuts to compete, but they couldn\u2019t match the company\u2019s vertical integration. Several were driven out of the business entirely. In a twist of fate, one of those companies was Texas Instruments. It had pivoted from calculators into computing; now it was Commodore\u2019s turn to drive it out of the computer business instead. Tramiel admitted that he found this very satisfying. Revenge is a form of debt, so it needs to be repaid. Tenet one.   Over 12 million Commodore 64s were sold during its remarkable 12-year production run. By some estimates, this made it the highest number of computers sold of any type, ever. It marked the peak of Tramiel\u2019s time at Commodore. It was the culmination of all his principles on how a business should be run. It took everything the VIC-20 had pioneered and distilled it into its perfect form. No computer has ever captured the time, the place, and the technology better.   It also did something that nobody could ever have anticipated. Over its 12-year run (which was itself likely another record), it opened up computing to people from backgrounds who never dreamed they would have access to it. Tramiel\u2019s policy of ruthless price-cutting saw to that.\u00a0 \u201cI firmly believe that Commodore launched more tech careers than any other company, by far,\u201d said Matthew Gracie, a senior engineer at Security Onion Solutions. \u201cEven a working-class family like mine in the 1980s could plausibly afford the Sears bundle of a Commodore 64 and monitor. That set me on my path.\u201d CES 1983 didn\u2019t bring any major new announcements from Commodore, but nobody was overly concerned. Both the Commodore 64 and its precursor, the VIC-20, were selling in extraordinary numbers. Behind the scenes, Tramiel was pushing for a new computer line that completely diverged from the PET\/VIC-20\/Commodore 64, and would focus more explicitly on business and education.\u00a0 However, from the moment development began, it was troubled. A lot of that trouble was created by Tramiel, his management philosophy, and his Jack Attacks. Computing was changing. Advances in technology and user expectations meant that machines and chips now required more intense\u2014and more planned\u2014development. Development like that took time and cost money, neither of which Tramiel believed in providing. \u201cTramiel is not an investor,\u201d Peddle said later. \u201cHe never invested in any development activity\u2026He never invested. Which is what it takes to get a new high-capability processor.\u201d The PET, VIC-20, and Commodore 64 were all the result of chip development at MOS that had started prior to Commodore\u2019s takeover, or were designed by the few smart and talented people who could tolerate Tramiel\u2019s Jack Attacks. That was a shrinking pool. By now, there was a shadow management layer operating within Commodore, built around the \u201cCommodorians\u201d\u2014the people who knew how to manage, and survive, Jack. This often didn\u2019t align with the official management chain. It created constant change in staff at the executive level within Commodore, and the firm was incapable of retaining talent. Despite all of this, CES 1984 began with the launch of the Commodore 16 and the Commodore Plus\/4\u2014the first two machines of the new business-friendly line. Tramiel himself took to the stage to announce that Commodore had reached $1 billion in sales\u2014a first for the entire personal computer industry. This was a moment of celebration, but something seemed off for the experienced Jack-watchers in the room. \u201cJack was on stage and he didn't look like a happy man, and Jack was not someone to hide his emotions generally\u2014it just seemed strange for some of us in the back of the room,\u201d Neil Harris, then-editor of Commodore\u2019s print publications, remembered. Shortly after this appearance, Tramiel departed CES. Three days later, he met with Irving Gould. Immediately afterwards, to the shock and amazement of the computing world, Commodore announced the departure of Jack Tramiel. Behind the scenes at Commodore and unbeknownst to most, a struggle for power had been underway between Irving Gould and Jack Tramiel. Over time, two distinct narratives have emerged for what happened that day. The first is that Gould had become increasingly frustrated and angry with Tramiel\u2019s aggressive management style, including his obsession with maintaining personal control over strategy and spending within Commodore. Gould decided enough was enough, and fired Tramiel. The other narrative is that Tramiel had become increasingly frustrated with the way Gould treated Commodore\u2019s assets as if they were his own, and took money out of the company. Tramiel had tolerated this as long as Gould didn\u2019t interfere with how Tramiel ran the company, but when Gould blocked Tramiel from appointing his sons to the Commodore board, Tramiel quit in disgust. Debate continues to rage to this day over which of those narratives is closer to the truth. What that debate tends to miss is that both accounts are likely true. In September 1983, just a few months before CES 84, Osborne Computing had gone bankrupt. The company had produced the Osborne 1, the first truly portable computer, and was seen as a stable and successful business with a bright future. Its sudden and spectacular fall sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. Adam Osborne, its flamboyant founder, was already defending himself from accusations that his autocratic and chaotic personal leadership style had caused the implosion. Meanwhile, IBM\u2014the most traditional and conservative among technology companies\u2014had come from nowhere to dominate low-end business computing thanks to Don Estridge\u2019s IBM PC.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to imagine Gould wondering if Commodore, his golden goose, would be ruined by Tramiel\u2014his Adam Osborne. Gould had tried multiple times to establish a senior management structure that conformed with standard expectations of how a billion-dollar multi-national business like Commodore should operate. His efforts had continually been undermined by Tramiel and his loyal Commodorians. There are even rumors that Tramiel insisted that one or more of his sons be elevated to the board, strengthening his control. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Gould had been taking enormous amounts of money out of Commodore. He regularly treated corporate assets (including the company jet) as if they were his own. This was infuriating to the eternally frugal Tramiel, who still regarded Commodore as his company, not Gould\u2019s. From Tramiel\u2019s perspective, Gould\u2019s continuous attempts to add layers of unnecessary management was an expensive mistake, a direct threat to his control, and a risk to the financial health of the company. If Gould wasn\u2019t going to let Tramiel build Commodore his way, there was no reason for Tramiel to stay there. It was natural for him to have wanted out. Both men wanted Commodore to continue growing, but they disagreed over the way to make that happen. It was a battle between Jack Tramiel\u2019s Religion and Gould\u2019s vision of Commodore as a corporate clone of IBM. The result, at that fateful January meeting, was a short but decisive war for the soul of Commodore. As Commodore\u2019s chairman and its largest shareholder, it was a war that Gould was always going to win. \"It was like the air went out of the room.\u201d Neil Harris said, remembering how it felt when the news became public. Most people assumed that this would be the end of Jack Tramiel. In the immediate aftermath of his resignation, Tramiel told former colleagues and the press that he planned to spend a year traveling the world. Three months later, Tramiel and his wife were at a hotel in Sri Lanka when he was summoned to the phone. On the other end of the line was Steve Ross, the CEO of Warner Communications. Warner had a problem\u2014a problem called \u201cAtari.\u201d Warner had bought Atari in 1979. Atari\u2019s iconic line of home videogame systems, featuring titles such as Pong, Pac-Man, and Super-Breakout, had made it the most successful home video-gaming company in the world. Almost immediately after Warner\u2019s purchase, a crash in the video game market tanked its value. Since then, it was losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Warner\u2019s share price weakened the company so much that media tycoon Rupert Murdoch nearly executed a hostile takeover of the entire company. Ross successfully fought it off, but he knew that he might not be able to do so again. He wanted to ask Tramiel if he would consider becoming Atari\u2019s new CEO. Tramiel refused and instead made Ross a counter-offer: Warner should simply give him Atari instead. Warner\u2019s CEO was confused but intrigued, and Tramiel flew back to Silicon Valley to explain his plan. After this, things moved fast. In early May 1984, a small group of Commodorians were invited to meet with Tramiel at a rented room in a small apartment complex in Sunnyvale, California, near Atari\u2019s headquarters. Among them was Shiraz M. Shivji, Commodore\u2019s director of research and development and a former member of the Commodore 64 development team. Tramiel told them what was coming and swore them to secrecy. On May 17, 1984, Tramel Technology Ltd. was founded. The spelling was deliberate. Tramiel had grown tired of people mispronouncing his name. Meanwhile, over at Commodore, a number of Tramiel\u2019s old Commodorians started to resign from the firm.\u00a0 Initially, these departures didn\u2019t raise much suspicion or alarm in Gould\u2019s reworked C-Suite. This changed at 4 a.m. on July 2, 1984, when Warner Communications announced that it had sold Atari\u2019s entire home computing arm, including all of its assets, facilities, and the brand, to Tramel Technology, owned by Jack Tramiel. Tramiel may have been on vacation when Ross called him, but his business instincts were as sharp as ever. He exploited Warner\u2019s desperation to be rid of Atari to propel himself instantly back to the top of the computer business. But he did it on his terms, not the company\u2019s. Warner lent Tramel Technology $240 million in return for the option to buy up to 32 percent of Tramel Technology at a predefined share price. Tramel Technology used that money to buy Atari from Warner. In effect, Tramiel made Warner pay for him to take Atari\u2014and the huge liability it represented\u2014off its hands. In return, Warner had the option to get a chunk of the value back if he managed to turn the company around. \u201cBoth the home computer and video game marketplaces continue, in my view, to offer great opportunities,\u201d Tramiel told the Associated Press that day. The scale and speed with which Tramiel was moving quickly became apparent. By lunchtime, Jack had installed himself in the CEO\u2019s office at Atari\u2019s headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Alongside him were his three sons\u2014newly appointed company directors\u2014and more than 20 new Atari senior executives. They were his loyal Commodorians, swapping roles at their former employer for near-identical roles at Atari\u2014including Shiraz Shivji and Commodore Japan\u2019s Tony Tokai. Gould and Commodore\u2019s new C-suite realized that Tramiel was looting them of talent. Then, to their horror, they discovered that they had no way of stopping it. It turned out that many of the best and brightest at Commodore didn\u2019t have non-compete clauses. Many didn\u2019t even have written contacts. The former head of Commodore had never really believed in such things. A good, solid handshake was enough. That former head was, of course, Jack Tramiel. \"The word started passing through the grapevine, after Jack bought Atari, that if anyone was interested, there were opportunities out there,\u201d Neil Harris remembered. He handed in his notice shortly after. He, too, was off to Atari. Jack was back. He announced that Atari would unveil a new machine\u2014one that would surpass anything Commodore had planned for the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1985, just six months away.   Tramiel didn\u2019t have a new computer ready to go. He just knew that he needed one. Atari was bleeding cash and his only chance of Atari competing with\u2014let alone beating\u2014Commodore at its own game was if he got a next-generation home computer out before his former company did. He also knew that Commodore had already begun development on such a machine. Just before Tramiel\u2019s takeover of Atari became public, Commodore had announced the purchase of Amiga, a struggling computer company that already had a much-hyped machine in development. Commodore planned to release this machine as the Commodore Amiga in early 1985. To make things worse for Atari, Commodore also filed a legal case against Shiraz Shivji and several of the other engineers that Tramiel had poached. Commodore accused them of intellectual property theft, alleging that they had taken commercially sensitive documents and designs from Commodore when they left. This was swiftly settled, but it delayed Shivji from starting work on Atari\u2019s new machine by another month. For a brief moment, it seemed like Tramiel had finally been outmaneuvered. The Amiga was already half-built. Commodore would beat Tramiel to market, unless he could find a way to undermine the company yet again. It was Jack\u2019s son Leonard (the middle of his three boys) who gave him what he needed to turn the tables. Tramiel had tasked Leonard with chasing down old payments that Atari had due from partners or suppliers, and in a stack of checks he found one to Amiga. \u201cI looked through that stack of checks and pulled out ones that were either big, or had interesting people they were made out to,\u201d Leonard recalled. \u201cAnd one of them was [a] canceled check for the money that Atari gave to Amiga.\u201d The check was for $500,000 (almost $1.5 million today) paid to Amiga by Atari in early 1984. Leonard took it to Tramiel, who sensed that there was something lurking behind it that he could use to hamstring the release of the Commodore Amiga. Tramiel discovered that Atari had loaned Amiga $500,000 in early 1984 to help the latter stave off bankruptcy, prior to his takeover. As collateral, Jay Miner, one of Amiga\u2019s founders, agreed to enter talks that would allow Atari to use some of the chips the company had designed for its Amiga computer. The loan was a good-faith payment to ensure Amiga could keep running while the companies negotiated a royalty fee. If Amiga and Atari didn\u2019t agree on a fee within 60 days, Amiga would have to pay back the loan with interest. If they failed to do so, Atari would get the rights to use Amiga\u2019s chip designs for free. From Atari\u2019s perspective, this was a smash-and-grab on Amiga. Atari had no real intention of negotiating. In 60 days, the company would get chip designs that were worth far more than the value of the loan. What nobody at Atari realized was that Miner had no intention of negotiating, either. He was gambling that the extra 60 days of development that the money secured would allow Amiga to refine its computer design further and finally find a buyer for the whole machine elsewhere. Enter Commodore. The extra development time allowed Miner to demonstrate a more complete machine to potential buyers, one of which was Commodore. In fact, Commodore was so impressed with Amiga\u2019s machine that it decided to buy Amiga as a company. As negotiations between Amiga and Commodore neared completion, Miner revealed the details of the loan from Atari. Unwilling to give chip rights to a competitor, Commodore wired Miner enough money to cover paying off Atari. Miner delivered the check for the full amount personally to Atari the same day, just one day before the deadline on payment would have expired. Atari was surprised, but thanks to the interest payments on the loan, the company had still made money for effectively doing nothing. So the paperwork was filed away and forgotten about, until Leonard Tramiel stumbled upon it.\u00a0 Once he learned the full details in July 1984, Jack Tramiel sued Amiga, its founders, and Commodore. He argued that Atari had the right to use Amiga\u2019s chips, and Commodore should cease development on its computer until the terms of that agreement could be negotiated. This was because Atari had loaned Amiga the money in good faith, but there was no evidence that Amiga had opened negotiations (Tramiel\u2019s lawyers skipped over the part where Atari hadn\u2019t opened negotiations, either).\u00a0 The case was spurious at best, and Tramiel knew it. But he didn\u2019t need to win. What mattered was that it brought Commodore\u2019s plans to bring its Amiga computer to market to a screeching halt while the case was being settled. The Commodore run by Jack Tramiel would have spotted that the case was a spoiler action and settled immediately. The new Commodore didn\u2019t. Its executives could see that Tramiel would lose the case in court, so they decided to fight it. It took a few months for them to realize that Tramiel didn\u2019t care about winning, only about the development delay it was causing them. Once that had sunk in, they bought him off, agreeing to an out-of-court settlement that Tramiel later described as a \u201crather large seven-figure sum.\u201d By that point, however, the damage had been done. While the two parties were arguing in court, Jack\u2019s ex-Commodorians had been completing the design of his promised new computer. That computer, when it launched, was called the Atari ST. It beat the Amiga to market by over a month. The Commodore Amiga and Atari ST stand together as the last great machines of the home computing age, before 32-bit games consoles and PCs would come to dominate. While debate still rages over which machine is better, it\u2019s remarkable that Atari\u2019s machine was even in a position to compete with Commodore\u2019s. The Commodore 64 will always be the peak of Jack Tramiel\u2019s \u201cReligion,\u201d but the Atari ST deserves an honorable mention as the last time his principles actually worked. Tramiel\u2019s new colleagues took the experience they had built up at Commodore and created a machine that featured a Motorola 68000 chip. Like the Commodore 64, it launched with more memory than most competitors\u2014512kb of RAM, which could be upgraded even further. Like the Commodore 64, the computer was reasonably priced\u2014less than $800 (about $2,300 in 2025).  Commodore\u2019s woes were far from over. The company even lost the case it had originally filed against Atari, that some of its employees\u2014including Shivji\u2014were stealing IP for the new company. While the engineers were forced to return some documents they had taken from Commodore when they departed, the court ruled that no infringement of Commodore\u2019s intellectual property took place during the design of the Atari ST. In most cases, this would be the end of the story. But no story involving Jack Tramiel is ever that simple. Eyebrows have often been raised in computer forums across the internet at the alleged design similarities between the Atari ST and an aborted Commodore computing project called the \u201cCommodore 900.\u201d Those eyebrows were only raised further when Commodore veteran David Haynes was asked directly about the Atari ST\u2019s origin in 2011. \u201cAt one point while at Commodore, Jack had a few of the then-C900 engineers (I guess they were the second team on the project) meeting \u2018off-site\u2019 on some super-secret project. This was probably late 1983 or early 1984,\u201d Haynes replied. \u201cShortly after Jack left, those guys all followed, and of course surfaced at Atari. With a new 68K computer that looked an awful lot like the second spin of the C900. Well, other than the fact it actually worked this time.\u201d Whether there is any truth to Haynes\u2019s allegation is unclear. What is indisputable is that Atari achieved a hardware miracle and had the new Atari ST ready for launch by January 1985. It received broadly positive reviews from both industry experts and the wider press. Impressed, they provided it with its nickname: the \u201cJackintosh.\u201d The Atari ST, and its later variants, sold almost 2 million units. Tramiel confounded both the critics and Gould. He revived Atari almost overnight. It was a remarkable achievement, but it would be his last in the world of computing. In 1996, Atari announced that it was merging with disk-drive manufacturer JT Storage. It was only a merger on paper. In reality, JT Storage was buying Atari out. After 11 years of trying to build a new empire with Atari, Jack Tramiel finally decided to bow out. The Atari ST was no failure. It was an excellent machine and sold well. For eight years, the Atari ST slugged it out with the Commodore Amiga for the position of top dog in the home-computer market. The problem was that the home-computer market was dying. Perhaps if they had spotted this sooner, Commodore and Atari would have been able to adapt. Tramiel should have spotted it, because the reason for the decline was the same reason for Commodore\u2019s meteoric rise: price drops. The home computer market only existed because it offered a mid-tier option for lower-income households to get on the computing ladder. Home computers offered gaming and productivity in a single package\u2014hence why Commodore had thrived while Don Estridge\u2019s IBM PC had dominated all other markets. In the 1980s, the IBM PC\u2019s price point was low enough to disrupt business and more affluent computer owner markets, but not low enough to beat what Commodore (and later Atari) could offer the average family. While Commodore and Atari spent the late eighties slugging it out like tired old wrestlers, they failed to notice the new contender running toward their ring: Rod Canion\u2019s Compaq. Behind Compaq were the other PC clones such as Hewlett-Packard and Dell. They brought the same ruthless push to drive down cost to the PC market that Tramiel had brought to the home computer market. By the early nineties, people didn\u2019t need a computer under their TV any more. They could have a PC on their desk. Whether it was Gould or Tramiel who ultimately pulled the trigger on Jack\u2019s exit from Commodore, the irony was that both men were right. Gould had no idea how to run a computer company, only how to loot one. Commodore needed direction, and it never had it after Tramiel. Gould was right about one thing, however. Tramiel\u2019s management philosophy was on borrowed time. In the dying days of Atari, Tramiel first tried to push development on a PC clone, and then tried to pivot back into gaming with the Atari Jaguar console. Both plans failed. His tyrannical approach to management left Atari short on talent, and even shorter on friends in supplier, retail, or developer markets. Tramiel had always abused Commodore\u2019s position as a market leader to make money at their expense. They were in no mood to do him favors at Atari. Because of higher expectations, new machines also required complex, multi-year development processes, which entailed significant investment. As Chuck Peddle had always said, Tramiel was never an investor. One day in 1982, Michael Tomczyk, who had led the project to develop the Commodore 64, found himself sitting in Jack Tramiel\u2019s office. Tomcyzk had just returned from a trade show in Hanover, Germany. During the course of their conversation, Tomczyk mentioned how impressed he\u2019d been with the Autobahn highway network on the way there. \"I built that road,\" Tramiel told him matter-of-factly. \u201cJack went on to explain that during World War II as a teenager he had been selected to work on the road gangs,\u201d Tomczyk remembered. \u201cHe said that it was one way to survive, because they had to feed the people that did that kind of hard labor, or they wouldn't work. \u2018We built good roads,\u2019 he said.\u201d Tramiel had never hidden the horrors in his past. He was proud that he had helped build a better future through Commodore and Atari. However, the longer he lived, the more concerned he became that people would forget what that future had cost. And that which is forgotten can be repeated. \"You know,\" Tramiel said once, \"it's hard to believe it really happened. But it can happen again. In America. Americans like to make rules, and that scares me. If you have too many rules you get locked in a system. It's the system that says this one dies and that one doesn't, not the people. That's why I don't hate the German people. Individuals, yes. Rules, yes. But not all Germans. \"They just obeyed the rules. But that's why we need more Commodores. We need more mavericks, just so the rules don't take over.\" When Tramiel finally walked away from the computer business in 1996, he didn\u2019t walk away from public life completely. Instead he switched his focus elsewhere, to something he\u2019d begun doing a while before. In October 1988, work began on the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. The museum was built using $190 million of private funding. That funding included a significant donation from two of the museum\u2019s founding patrons, Jack and Helen Tramiel. In 1990, Jack contributed his own oral history to the museum. It represented a growing desire to tell his own story, and to help other Holocaust survivors preserve theirs. In 2005, a new museum that covered the history of Polish Jews was announced in Warsaw, on the site of the Warsaw ghetto. Among the founding benefactors were Jack and Helen Tramiel. Tramiel died in April 2012. In life, he was hated as much as he was loved. Jack Tramiel was always one thing or the other\u2014never in between. What nobody can deny is that he changed the world. We live in a future that was conceived by Jack Tramiel. Tramiel didn\u2019t just promise \u201ccomputers for the masses, not the classes\u201d\u2014he delivered. He forced the entire computing industry to do the same. Tramiel was the first and last king of home computing. That brief age of a computer under every TV or on the desk. The world of technology today is led by people who fell in love with computers because of Jack. Speak to a tech founder or visionary. Speak to a CEO or CTO. Speak to a lead software engineer or senior games developer. Ask them who built the computer that made them realize they weren\u2019t just living in the future, but could help shape it. Most will give you a single word: \u201cCommodore.\u201d   Gareth Edwards is a digital strategist, writer, and historian.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"\ufeffInternet from terrestrial lasers, not satellites. \ufeffInternet from terrestrial lasers, not satellites. by  Dominic Preston Light-based internet project Taara is exiting Alphabet\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d incubator X, spinning off into an independent company. Taara\u2019s tech uses lasers to transmit data, and is envisaged as a rival to Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink when it comes to connecting rural areas to the internet. The Financial Times reports that Alphabet will retain a minority stake in Taara, which has also secured funding from Series X Capital. The company currently has two dozen employees and operates in 12 countries, working on everything from connecting the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo to augmenting the congested network at the 2024 Coachella festival.  \u201cWe\u2019ve realised over time that for a good number of the things we create, there\u2019s a lot of benefit to landing just outside of the Alphabet membrane,\u201d said Eric \u201cAstro\u201d Teller, X\u2019s so-called captain of moonshots. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be able to get connected quickly to market capital, bring in strategic investors and generally be able to scale faster this way.\u201d Taara\u2019s current tech involves firing a narrow beam of light from one traffic light-sized terminal to another, with transmission of up to 20 gigabits per second over 20km (almost 12.5 miles) distances. The terminals can be mounted on towers, and are quicker and cheaper to install than laying fiber \u2014 especially when you need a signal to reach an island, cross a river, or arrive at some otherwise hard-to-reach location. Last month the company announced that it has condensed its tech into a much more compact chip, which it expects to launch in a product in 2026. While Taara\u2019s tower-based optical technology works differently to Starlink\u2019s satellites, it\u2019s setting itself up as a rival in the business of connecting rural areas. \u201cWe can offer 10, if not 100 times more bandwidth to an end user than a typical Starlink antenna, and do it for a fraction of the cost,\u201d founder Mahesh Krishnaswamy told Wired. Taara itself has its origins in another X project, Loon, which imagined distributing data by shooting lasers around a network of 20-mile-high balloons. Believe it or not, that proved unfeasible in the end, and Loon was wound down in 2021 \u2014 just three years after it too \u201cgraduated\u201d from Alphabet\u2019s moonshot program. Loon\u2019s lasers were repurposed into Taara\u2019s towers by Krishnaswamy, though the tech also found a third home in Aalyria, another spin-off that focuses on coordinating satellite and airborne mesh networks, and has its own Tightbeam project that sounds similar to Taara.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 9\/10 A password manager makes creating strong passwords\u2014and remembering them!\u2014easy. Good password managers will generate strong passwords for you, store them in a secure vault and log you into websites, all without you doing anything. There are dozens of cloud-based password managers on the market, but in my testing one consistently rises to the top\u2014Bitwarden. Bitwarden is open source, secure, works across platforms, and offers an intuitive workflow that makes it easy to manage your passwords across all your devices. The free plan makes a good, basic, but secure password manager, and Bitwarden's premium features cost less than the competition. The code that runs Bitwarden is open source. That means it's freely available for anyone to inspect, attack, seek out flaws, and report them. In theory, the more eyes on the code, the more airtight it becomes. None of the other major cloud-based password managers out there are open source. While this doesn't make Bitwarden invulnerable, the company has never had a breach. Like most password managers, Bitwarden uses AES-256 encryption to protect your data. Your passwords are only ever unencrypted on your own devices. Bitwarden maintains a zero-knowledge system. All your usernames, passwords, URLs, notes, and other vault data are end-to-end encrypted, which means that Bitwarden cannot see or access any of your data. To further enhance its security standing, Bitwarden is regularly audited by third-parties to ensure it's secure. The most recent overall test is from 2023, when the Cure53 security firm did a source code audit and penetration test of the core application and library. Individual platform apps and the web interface have also been audited, all of which leaves me feeling pretty good about the security behind Bitwarden. It's also worth noting that, if you know what you're doing, you can install Bitwarden's backend code on your own server for self-hosting if you prefer to run your own cloud. All the security in the world is kinda useless, though, if actually using the apps and services isn't a good experience. Fortunately, Bitwarden has a mostly smooth workflow that integrates well with different platforms and takes advantage of standardized security features like passkeys. You can even log into Bitwarden with a passkey, which means you don't even need to use your username or password to open your vault. There are apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as extensions for all major web browsers. I've used Bitwarden on every platform and in every browser. Yes, even Opera. At the start of 2025, Bitwarden switched to native apps for Android and iOS. I never minded the old app, but this is decidedly faster in my testing (at least on Android. The final iOS version is not out of beta yet). Bitwarden also recently revamped its browser extension, giving it a cleaner look with more customization options to tailor the user experience to fit your workflow. There's a new compact mode that saves a bit of space, and light and dark themes to fit with your PC's theme. Bitwarden Password Manager Rating: 9\/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Although I do use the browser extension, I very rarely actually interact with it. When I land on a page where I need to log in, I just use the keyboard shortcut Control+Shift L, which autofills the username and password. Hit return and you're done. Note that you can have forms fill automatically on page load. This is disabled by default, but you can turn it on in the app settings. Bitwarden can also fill in forms for payment, address, and the like, but for the free plan, this only works using the browser extensions on desktop. Paid users can use form fill on mobile as well. To create a new login in Bitwarden, just fill out a form on a webpage. Bitwarden's browser extension will offer to fill in password fields with a generated password string. Accept the generated password, send the form, and Bitwarden will offer to save the new login for you. Just click \"yes\" and the new login will be added to your account and synced to all your devices. Bitwarden supports passwordless authentication, meaning you can log in with a one-time code, biometric authentication, or a security key (like Yubikey, but this does require a paid account). Bitwarden supports Windows Hello and Touch ID on its desktop apps for Windows and macOS, giving you the added security of those biometric authentication systems. Bitwarden also has excellent support for passkeys. Passkeys are an attempt to replace the password with a key that you don't have to remember or worry about at all. When you create a passkey for a website, the site spits out two pieces of code, one it saves on the server, one it saves on your device. When you return to the site, the site checks for the code it saved to your device and if it's there, it logs you in. The idea behind passkeys is promising, and they are secure, but the user experience is hit or miss. Bitwarden is a bright spot in this regard, as it provides a very good user experience with passkeys. Bitwarden Password Manager Rating: 9\/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Once you've set up a passkey for a site, logging in is easy. You just enter your username and Bitwarden\u2019s browser extension will ask if you want to log in with your passkey. Click yes and you're logged in. The mobile experience is similar, though you do have to first set up Bitwarden as your passkey provider on your device. You can find instructions on how to do that on the Bitwarden website. If Bitwarden has a weak spot in its suite of apps, it's probably the desktop app. They're perfectly serviceable, though with the browser extension able to do nearly everything, there's not much use for the desktop apps. I wish that the desktop app had access to things like reports (which let you scan your vault for exposed passwords, duplicates, weak passwords, and more) and setting up emergency access. Unfortunately these things are currently only available through the web interface. It's not a huge deal, but it does seem like the desktop app should be as capable as the web app. Should You Get a Free, Premium, or Family Account? Almost all of Bitwarden's features are available with only a free account. The Free plan gets unlimited passwords, passkeys, and secure notes across as many devices as you have. You also get access to the password generator and even Bitwarden Send, a sharing service for sending sensitive info to other people. If you upgrade to a Premium account ($10\/year), you'll get access to some nice additional features like emergency access, which allows you to designate another user who can access your account in an emergency. You'll also get 1 gigabyte of secure storage, two-factor authentication options like Yubikey, and the ability to share files via Bitwarden Send. The last feature you get with a Premium subscription is access to reports, which will tell you if a password has been compromised in a security breach, or if you have any weak or duplicate passwords. Reports are manual, meaning you have to log in to the web interface and run them. Some services will run these sorts of scans for you. Bitwarden has long been WIRED's top pick for password managers, and recent updates have only cemented its position. Bitwarden offers everything you need to manage passwords and passkeys with a free account, and it bundles in some nice extras for just $10 per year. That's the best deal in the password manager market. Bitwarden Password Manager Rating: 9\/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

You can also take advantage of deals on Apple\u2019s newest iPad and the high-end OnePlus 13. by  Barbara Krasnoff If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. I don\u2019t want to sound alarmist or anything (although I admit I\u2019m naturally pessimistic), but the way things are going, it\u2019s a good idea to have an extra source of power for your home in case of storms and other outages. Luckily, EcoFlow is running a sale through March 26th, letting you save on several of its portable batteries and power stations. For example, the Delta Pro 3 is a scalable power unit that can power everything from a family picnic to an entire home during a blackout. It\u2019s on sale at Amazon for $2,899, which is $700 off its usual $3,699 list price and the best price we\u2019ve seen to date. Our reviewer was very impressed with the Delta Pro 3, especially its versatility. It has the ability to power both 120V and 240V appliances, and can plug directly into your home\u2019s circuit using an inlet box or manual transfer switch. It can be charged using 1000W and 16000 solar inputs or an AC wall charger, among other charging methods. And you can link multiple DP3 units together to increase their output, so that, say, three units connected to an EcoFlow Smart Home Panel 2 (which is also on sale at Amazon for $1,399, or $500 off) can provide enough power to keep a typical home running for a day and a half. Read our review. On the other hand, if you\u2019re just looking for something to use when camping or enjoying additional outdoor activities, EcoFlow\u2019s River 3 Portable Power Station is down to $189 (from $338) at Amazon with a 45W solar panel, which nearly matches its all-time low. It can quickly charge appliances with anywhere from a 300W to 600W AC output, and uses its own solar panel to completely repower it in a little over six hours. That means you can place it in the sun while you\u2019re hiking around and use it to power your games at night. EcoFlow\u2019s new portable solar generator can scale to power your entire home during a blackout, a van or RV\u2019s electrical system, or a party at the beach.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"US shoppers stepped up their spending a just bit in February after a sharp pullback the previous month, signaling that Americans are shopping more cautiously as concerns about the direction of the economy mount WASHINGTON -- U.S. shoppers stepped up their spending a just bit in February after a sharp pullback the previous month, signaling that Americans are shopping more cautiously as concerns about the direction of the economy mount.  Retail sales rose just 0.2% in February, a small rebound after a sharp drop of 1.2% in January, the Commerce Department said Monday. Sales rose at grocery stores, home and garden stores, and online retailers. Sales fell at auto dealers, restaurants, and electronics stores.  The small increase suggests Americans may be growing more wary about spending as the stock market has plunged and President Donald Trump's tariff threats and government spending cuts have led to widespread uncertainty among consumers and businesses.  Some economists were relieved the numbers weren\u2019t worse. Still, many expect consumer spending will grow just 1% to 1.5% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, far below the 4.2% gain in the final quarter last year.  \u201cConsumer spending is on track to slow sharply this quarter, but not by as much as we previously feared,\u201d Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said in an email.  On Friday, a measure of consumer sentiment fell sharply for the third straight month and is now down more than 20% since December. Respondents to the University of Michigan's survey cited policy uncertainty as a leading reason for the gloomier outlook. While the respondents were divided sharply by party \u2014 sentiment about the current economy fell among Republican by much less than for Democrats \u2014 Republicans' confidence in the economy's future dropped 10%.  Consumers from all income levels are feeling more strained, according to a slew of earnings reports over the past few weeks from major retailers including Walmart, Macy\u2019s and Dollar General. Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and a bellwether for the retail sector, released a weak outlook last month citing uncertainty around tariffs. February sales also fell last month at gas stations, clothing stores, and sporting goods stores. The figures aren't adjusted for prices, and the cost of gas also declined in February, which likely accounts for most of the drop. Excluding gas and autos, retail sales rose 0.5%, a healthier figure but still modest after a plunge of 0.8% in January.  Also Monday, the National Association of Homebuilders said its index measuring builder sentiment fell three points to 39, the lowest level in seven months, as economic uncertainty dimmed builders' outlook and fewer potential buyers visited homes.  \u201cEconomic uncertainty, the threat of tariffs and elevated construction costs pushed builder sentiment down in March,\u201d the group said. The homebuilders estimate tariffs will add $9,200 to the cost of a new home. Macy\u2019s says its customers, even at its upscale chains Bluemercury and Bloomingdale\u2019s, are feeling angst and its financial outlook this month reflects that.  \u201cI think the affluent customer that\u2019s shopping Macy\u2019s is just as uncertain and as confused and concerned by what\u2019s transpiring,\u201d Macy\u2019s CEO Tony Spring said at the time. Hiring has mostly held up and there are no signs that companies are laying off workers. As long as Americans have jobs, spending could remain resilient. But that is not assured.  Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said Thursday that the overall economic picture for his customers is not ideal and the company said it would close around 100 stores.  \u201cOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation \u201d Vasos said during an earnings call. \u201cMany of our customers report that they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.\u201d Spending patterns at Costco have changed to accommodate a soured view of the economy, including a shift toward ground beef and poultry instead of more expensive cuts of meat, said to Gary Millership, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.  American Eagle Outfitters CEO Jay Schottenstein said angst is particularly high among younger customers. \u201cNot just tariffs, not just inflation,\" said Schottenstein. \"We see the government cutting people off. They don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to affect them. And when people don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know \u2013 they get very conservative.\u201d  The retail sales report mostly just covers goods purchases \u2014 as well as restaurant sales \u2014 but there are signs Americans are cutting back spending on services as well.  Airline executives at JP Morgan's airline industry conference last week said bookings have fallen.  \u201cThere was something going on with economic sentiment, something going on with consumer confidence,\" said Delta CEO Ed Bastian at the industry conference. ___ D'Innocenzio reported from New York.  24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA+2.83%) stock was down by 1.76% at the market close on Monday ahead of chief executive Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at the GPU Technology Conference. The chipmaker\u2019s shares closed at $119.53 each and are down 11% so far this year. During after-hours trading, the stock was slightly down by around 0.1%. All eyes will be on Huang\u2019s keynote on Tuesday at the chipmaker\u2019s annual developer conference, also known as the GTC, where he is expected to unveil its next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he will share more about the company\u2019s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation AI platform Vera Rubin, and other product plans at the conference. Nvidia has \u201csome really exciting things to share\u201d at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics, Huang said during the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call.  Last week, analysts at Bank of America (BAC+1.91%) said in a note that they \u201cexpect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra\u201d at the GTC. The analysts added that they anticipate Nvidia will focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop.  Jefferies (JEF+1.63%) analysts said in a note on Monday that they expect \u201cthe noise around CPO [co-packaged optics] to resurface over next few weeks\u201d going into the GTC and the optical conference. Nvidia will likely discuss how the optical technology will be used in AI data centers, the analysts said. Meanwhile, some quantum computing stocks climbed on Monday ahead of the GTC\u2019s first \u201cQuantum Day\u201d that will be held on Thursday.  Quantum Computing (QUBT-3.53%) stock closed up by 13.12%, while D-Wave was up by 10.15% at the market close.  Executives from quantum companies, including D-Wave, are expected to join Huang  to discuss \u201cwhat businesses should expect from quantum computing in the coming decades \u2014 mapping the path toward useful quantum applications,\u201d Nvidia said. Shares of IonQ (IONQ+1.13%) and Rigetti Computing (RGTI-4.14%), both of which are also expected to join Huang at the GTC, were down by 0.28% and 0.53% respectively at the close.

Updated:                       03\/17\/25       Published:                       03\/11\/25       As liquor sales stagnated last year for nearly the first time in two decades, one segment of the market actually grew by a whopping 29% YoY: Pickle-flavored spirits. If you\u2019re like me, your first question was, \u201cWhat the ever-loving fffff-?\u201d But your second question is, \u201cWhat are they doing right?\u201d  So I sat down with the marketing director for the top-selling pickle liquor to find out how this small startup is beating the trend and outmarketing the market.  Most people don\u2019t think about National Pickle Day. Like, at all. But to Erin Quinn it means a lot of green. And that green is money. And also, presumably, dill. \u201cIt was our biggest earned media impressions surge,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a lot of national news outlets doing National Pickle Day coverage. And from an online sales standpoint, it was definitely our biggest surge.\u201d But that never would have happened if Quinn hadn\u2019t been looking down the whole length of her calendar. \u201cLook at the full year for what opportunities might be relevant for your brand,\u201d she advises. Now, your brand may not be connected to any gimmicky holidays, but there will be conferences, trade shows, festivals, and fairs. The lesson remains: \u201cIdentify a few that look relevant to you. Then take a look at how those have been covered in the past by the news media.\u201d And it\u2019s not just about news media, but social media, too. Quinn recommends doing social listening around the events to see which ones already have your audience catching a buzz. Those will make the most rich opportunities for seasonal campaigns. But this isn\u2019t an \u201cIf you build it, they will come\u201d kind of exercise. Which brings us to lesson two. \u201cMedia outlets aren\u2019t going to cover your brand for the sake of you existing. You have to have news to get attention.\u201d News outlets could have just as easily reached out to Vlasic or Frito Lay for content about National Pickle Day, right? So why did they cover this small, upstart liquor brand instead? Because Quinn gave them a reason. Two, actually. Two big, pickle-green, mid-calf, 100% genuine leather reasons.  Quinn says her team asked themselves, \u201cWho\u2019s an unexpected brand that we can partner with to do something cool that\u2019s going to get people talking?\u201d The answer was Texas-based luxury boot company Miron Crosby. And the one-of-a-kind, pickle-themed cowboy boot sweepstakes was born. Though that makes it sound a lot easier than it was. \u201cWe really wanted to design a custom pair of pickle cowboy boots,\u201d Quinn recalls. \u201cBut I was met with a fair amount of silence.\u201d By a stroke of luck, Miron Crosby was looking to target the same audience as The Original Pickle Shot. But luck isn\u2019t a long term strategy, so what\u2019s a new brand with a small audience and limited budget supposed to do?  Quinn offers two pieces of advice for how emerging brands can stretch their budget and amplify their reach. First, \u201cIdentify brands that are complementary to yours,\u201d she says. \u201cBrands that have a similar presence, that are looking to grow, and you can grow together.\u201d Together, you can split the costs of campaigns and share each other\u2019s audiences. She gives the example of how The Original Pickle Shot partnered with flavored-salt company Twang on a product giveaway. Quinn\u2019s team handled the logistics, Twang donated products, and both companies shared the results with their social networks and influencers. The second piece of advice is to consider what else you bring to a collaboration besides reach. \u201cWe might not be able to offer a huge social following yet, but, hey, we\u2019ll run the sweepstakes, we\u2019ll pay all the fees, if you make a collab post.\u201d No matter the size, every brand needs good content. If you can provide relevant, eye-catching content, that can make you an attractive partner for a bigger brand with a wider audience. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an emerging brand, sometimes that\u2019s what partnerships have to look like.\u201d And, if you\u2019re wondering, National Pickle Day falls on Fri., Nov. 14 this year. Govern yourselves accordingly. What\u2019s one marketing mechanism that will generate the most revenue quickly for a startup? \u2014Jennifer Waters, Co-founder, 7 Figure Dojo; Executive sensei, Seigler's Karate Center Quinn says: I know it\u2019s annoying to say \u201cit depends,\u201d but my recommendation for quick revenue growth would likely vary depending on the startup. For example, paid social is likely to be a cost-efficient and impactful choice for a budget-friendly DTC skincare brand targeted towards Gen Z. (There\u2019s a reason that paid social is the first and only paid media that many brands invest in!) Promo codes, rebates, and couponing can be an important add-on to said campaign, as these tactics provide an extra incentive for conversion and you can use redemption as a KPI. No matter the business model, my most important \u201cdo this before anything else\u201d recommendation would be to spend time on your consumer target, positioning, and brand identity development so that you are targeting the right people in the right place with the right messaging and creative. It won\u2019t drive revenue in the short term, but it should increase the likelihood of long-term success. Quinn asks: What\u2019s the most memorable advertisement (commercial, print ad, OOH, anything!) you can remember seeing, and why do you think it has stuck with you?

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. The backlash Tesla owners are facing over Elon Musk has crossed the pond. Here in London, a man says he was aghast when he was confronted about his vehicle in a parking lot.In today's big story, BI spoke with 10 federal workers who voted for Trump. Months later, some of them now regret it.  What's on deck   Markets: Rob Arnott thinks the market's tech stock sell-off isn't over.       Tech: BI reviewed a leaked ByteDance document showing TikTok staff being evaluated on their \"ByteStyle\" and more.       Business: Needy hospitals are trapped in a cycle of corporate plunder, Bethany McLean writes.               But first, some voters feel hoodwinked.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   \"I feel betrayed. This is not what I wanted, to let everybody lose their job.\"           That's what a two-time Trump voter who works for Veterans Affairs told BI. \"You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. This is not 'The Apprentice.'\"               So far, tens of thousands of workers have already lost their jobs as a result of DOGE's efforts to reshape the federal workforce.               With Elon Musk as de facto leader, the DOGE office initiatives have ranged from dismantling agencies like USAID to slashing budgets and sweeping layoffs \u2014 some of which have been reversed by court order.               Just a few months ago, some of the workers impacted by the cuts may have been celebrating Trump's election victory. They voted for a better economy, lower prices, or more stringent border controls.               What they didn't expect was an existential threat to their careers.               BI spoke to current and former federal workers who voted for Trump \u2014 and some have come to regret it.               \"If I knew I was going to lose my job because Trump became president, no, I would not vote for him,\" one worker said.               Betrayal. Anger. Regret. You can read what all the workers told BI here.       For federal workers hoping to now pivot to the private sector, things might be tricky.           Lackluster corporate hiring, a shrinking middle-management job market, and pullbacks by universities are making the route to employment beyond federal agencies trickier to navigate, BI's Tim Paradis writes.               Federal workers also face a unique hurdle. Recruiters and career coaches told BI that many federal workers have the know-how to succeed in private industry, yet they might struggle to make that clear.               Adopting a key new skill might help them: translation.       1. Rob Arnott says the sell-off in tech stocks isn't over. \"We're seeing the unwinding of a bubble,\" Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, told BI. He compared the current market to the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and warned that the Magnificent Seven stocks are set to slide further.       2. Why China looks investible again. Just a year ago, investors fled the country in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, with the CSI 300 dropping over 45%. Now, the country's stocks are rallying, thanks to a pro-tech shift from Beijing \u2014 and analysts are paying attention.       3. Follow these leaders for sharp insights on recessions. Leading economists are bracing for a recession, although there's been no official call yet. BI compiled a list of the best commentators on recessions, and the warning signs they're watching.       1. Amazon's DeepSeek scramble. When DeepSeek debuted in January, customer demand was so high Amazon rushed to add the AI to its development tool Bedrock. Now, Amazon wants to promote its products as an alternative to DeepSeek and is telling employees to point out its privacy and security issues, according to internal guidelines seen by BI.       2.Meet the Palantir Mafia. The software company's alumni have collectively raised more than $6 billion for their own startups, which include the social-gathering app Partiful and the defense-tech company Anduril. See BI's list of 30 Palantir alums who struck out on their own.       3. How TikTok scores employees. It's performance review season for TikTok employees, and BI viewed a rubric to see how they're scored. Workers are measured on Output, Leadership Principles, and ByteStyles \u2014 i.e. a set of workplace values. If an employee receives a low rating, though, they could end up on a PIP.       1. How wealthy investors keep bankrupting needy hospitals. As Steward Health Care closed hospitals and cut corners on care, its top officers got richer, and the profits kept flowing to its private-equity owner Cerberus. Now, its bankruptcy reveals a deeper flaw in America's healthcare infrastructure: Facilities that have been plundered can only be sold to others who are likely to continue the plundering, Bethany McLean writes.       2. Older Americans on the shifting job market. Some are taking blue- collar jobs, while others are navigating unemployment. Many told BI that ageism, technology changes, and economic shifts have affected their retirement plans.       3. The ghosted generation. College app rejections. No-show dates. Job apps sent into the void. No one has been more rejected in both their personal and professional lives than Gen Z, writes Delia Cai. It's led young people to adopt a blas attitude in order to protect themselves \u2014 and it could turn them into a generation of incredibly risk-averse adults.      It's St. Patrick's Day.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Some MAGA followers are spreading an unsubstantiated theory related to the cost of the US national debt. The US stock market has had a bumpy ride since United States President Donald Trump\u2019s election in November. After hitting record highs in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s victory, US stocks have shed trillions of dollars amid his dizzying back-and-forth announcements on tariffs and growing fears of a recession. While Trump has played down the turbulence as a temporary \u201cperiod of transition\u201d on the road to a stronger economy, supporters and critics of the US president alike have speculated without evidence that he may be trying to crash the stock market on purpose. Trump\u2019s vacillating economic policies have created uncertainty \u2013 something investors famously dislike. The benchmark S&P500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the biggest US firms, has lost nearly $5 trillion in value from its February 19 peak. On March 10, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4 percent \u2013 its worst single-day drop since September 2022. Regardless of whether Trump is playing the long game as he claims, the past month \u201cstands out for both the amount of uncertainty and the variety of fronts\u201d, Tara Sinclair, director of the George Washington University Center for Economic Research, told Al Jazeera. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis produces based on news coverage of economic policy-related issues, in February hit its highest level since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index in January reached its highest point on record apart from May 2020. There are several unsubstantiated theories about why Trump might want to crash the stock market, but chief among them is that he is trying to make it easier to pay off the US\u2019s $36 trillion national debt by lowering interest rates. Since taking office, Trump has both expressed concern about the size of the debt and called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. In a recent interview with FOX News, he claimed that \u201cnobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high, because people can\u2019t borrow money.\u201d With a debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of about 120 percent, the federal debt is approaching its highest level since the end of World War II. It is also expensive to pay off \u2013 the US government last year spent more than $1 trillion on interest payments alone.      Some Trump supporters have claimed that he is intentionally trying to induce economic pain to force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make it cheaper to refinance the national debt. \u201cTrump is setting up a stock market crash. The US government needs to refinance $7 trillion in debt over the next 6 months,\u201d crypto influencer and investor Thomas Kralow, who has more than 500,000 YouTube followers, said on X last week. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want this done at current 10-year yields. This is why he\u2019s letting the stock market drop while pushing bond prices higher,\u201d Kralow said, adding this would create \u201cshort term pain, long term gain\u201d. While the Federal Reserve makes its decisions independent of the White House and US Congress, it typically lowers the cost of borrowing during difficult economic conditions in order to stimulate growth. When interest rates go down, the government also pays out lower yields on US Treasury bonds \u2013 essentially a type of loan to the government \u2013 thereby reducing the cost of interest paid on outstanding debt. If bond yields were to come down, the US government would be able to pay substantially lower interest payments on the debt that needs refinancing, which is expected to amount to some $9 trillion in 2025, according to an estimate by Axel Funhoff, a professor at the Antwerp Management School in Belgium. \u201cFor the better part of a decade, the US benefitted from historically low interest rates. These lower rates enabled the government to finance its debt at rates around 2.7 percent,\u201d Funhoff said in a LinkedIn post in January. Compared with that era of cheap borrowing, current interest rates are much higher: The yields on 10-year Treasury bonds and 5-year Treasury bonds stood at 4.3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on Friday.      A different theory circulating among some Trump critics suggests that he is deliberately tanking the stock market to reward himself and his supporters, including conservative Wall Street investors and MAGA-supporting Silicon Valley CEOs. Proponents of this theory claim that Trump induced a market tumble so that he and his allies can \u201cbuy the dip\u201d \u2013 in other words, buy stocks at a discount before the market bounces back. \u201c[Trump] is purposely manipulating the stock markets \u2026. Tariff scare, markets go down his rich buddies buy the dip, afterwards tariff off, stock market goes back up, said rich friends get richer\u2026 He needs to be investigated,\u201d X user AKASabraFella said last week. While the Trump administration has played down the turmoil in the markets, it has not given any indication that it actually wants the stock prices to go down. Indeed, Trump has in the past often boasted about the performance of stocks on his watch when the market has been bullish. Kathleen Brooks, the founder of market analysis company Minerva Analysis, said she did not believe Trump was purposely trying to cause the market to drop. \u201cThe US economy peaked in November and since then US economic data has been trending lower and surprisingly on the downside. This means that the bond market had to play catch-up,\u201d Brooks told Al Jazeera, adding that other assets like Bitcoin have also fallen from their peak. \u201cIt is not unusual for markets to move in unison like this. This undermines the view that the moves in the Treasury market are a conspiracy theory. Instead, there are good fundamental reasons for the decline,\u201d she said. Some market analysts have also suggested that the market is overvalued and long overdue a correction \u2013 Wall Street lingo for a drop of more than 10 percent from its peak. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, whose market moves are closely watched due to his decades-long record of outperforming the S&P 500, dumped at least $134bn in stocks in 2024 in a sell-off that was widely interpreted as a signal that the market was running too hot.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"A poster depicting U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin stands near the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv during a protest against Trump\u2019s position on Ukraine on Mar. 15, 2025. WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is set to hold talks on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin as he looks to get buy-in on a U.S. ceasefire proposal that he hopes can create a pathway to ending Russia\u2019s devastating war on Ukraine. The White House is optimistic that peace is within reach even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains skeptical that Putin is doing much beyond paying lip service to Trump as Russian forces continue to pound his country. Advertisement Advertisement The engagement is just the latest turn in dramatically shifting U.S.-Russia relations as Trump has made quickly ending the conflict a top priority, even at the expense of straining ties with longtime American allies who want Putin to pay a price for the invasion. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad situation in Russia, and it\u2019s a bad situation in Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters on Monday. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Ukraine is not good, but we\u2019re going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace. And I think we\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d In preparation for the Trump-Putin call, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff met last week with Putin in Moscow to discuss the proposal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had persuaded senior Ukrainian officials during talks in Saudi Arabia to agree to the ceasefire framework. The U.S. president said Washington and Moscow have already begun discussing \u201cdividing up certain assets\u201d between Ukraine and Russia as part of a deal to end the conflict. Trump, who during his campaign pledged to quickly end the war, has at moments boasted of his relationship with Putin and blamed Ukraine for Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion, all while accusing Zelensky of unnecessarily prolonging the biggest land war in Europe since World War II. Trump has said that swaps of land and power plants will be part of the conversation with Putin. Witkoff and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that U.S. and Russian officials have discussed the fate of the Zaporizhzhia power plant in southern Ukraine. The power plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. The U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest, fueling fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe. The nuclear power plant is a significant asset, producing nearly a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s electricity in the year before the war. \u201cI can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment. And the president, as you know, is determined to get one done.\u201d But Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, questioned whether Putin is ready to end the war or will hold out for potential further concessions as Trump grows impatient. After a disastrous Feb. 28 White House meeting with Zelensky, Trump temporarily cut off some military intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine. It was restored after the Ukrainians last week signed off on the Trump administration\u2019s 30-day ceasefire proposal. \u201cThe U.S. has been consistently offering in some form preemptive concessions that have been weakening the American and Ukrainian negotiating position,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real danger here that the administration\u2019s approach is boiling down to sticks for Ukraine and carrots for Putin.\u201d Zelensky in his nightly video address on Monday made clear he remains doubtful that Putin is ready for peace. \u201cNow, almost a week later, it\u2019s clear to everyone in the world\u2014even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years\u2014that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,\u201d Zelensky said. In his dealings with Zelensky and Putin, Trump has frequently focused on who has the leverage. Putin has \u201cthe cards\u201d and Zelensky does not, Trump has said repeatedly. Trump, who has long shown admiration for Putin, has also made clear he\u2019d like to see the U.S.-Russia relationship return to a more normal footing. The president during his recent contentious meeting with Zelensky grumbled that \u201cPutin went through a hell of a lot with me,\u201d a reference to the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in which he beat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump on Monday again underscored his view that Ukraine is not in a strong negotiating position. He said Russian forces have \u201csurrounded\u201d Ukrainian troops in Russia\u2019s Kursk region\u2014amplifying an assertion made by Russian officials that\u2019s been refuted by Zelensky. Ukraine\u2019s army stunned Russia in August last year by attacking across the border and taking control of an estimated 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of land. But Ukraine\u2019s forces are now in retreat and it has all but lost a valuable bargaining chip, as momentum builds for a ceasefire with Russia. Zelensky has acknowledged that the Ukrainians are on their back foot but refutes Russian claims that they have encircled his troops in Kursk. Trump suggested that he\u2019s taken unspecified action that has kept Russia from slaughtering Ukrainian troops in Kursk. \u201cThey\u2019re surrounded by Russian soldiers, and I believe if it wasn\u2019t for me they wouldn\u2019t be here any longer,\u201d Trump said. Leavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"One of the founders of betting firm Paddy Power says new government rules to protect punters playing online slots don't go far enough. Stewart Kenny, who helped found the Irish company in the 80s, believes online slot games spin too fast, which contributes to them being addictive. He thinks new government rules limiting the stakes are not enough to render them safe, and thinks the games should also be slowed down. From April, slots will be limited to \u00a35 per spin for over 25s. In May, 18-24-year-olds will be limited to \u00a32 per spin. This follows a government review of the 2005 Gambling Act, and the publication of a white paper which introduces new measures to strengthen gambling harm legislation. Online slots are web versions of slot machines you see in a casino. The punter enters money and spins a wheel. If the symbols or pictures match, they could win money. The government said it was bringing in stake limits for them because they are \"a higher-risk gambling product associated with large losses, long sessions, and binge play\". But in a new documentary series on Radio 4, Stewart Kenny, who resigned from the board of the betting company in 2016, says the speed of the games is what makes them addictive. He says the gap between investment and results being \"only seconds\" means punters can \"repeat the dose\" at high speed.  In addition to this, he says the machines provide \"plenty of noise and plenty of colours\", as well as near misses, which are \"fundamental to gambling addiction\". The Department for Culture Media and Sport said the Gambling Commission introduced requirements that changed speed and intensity of slots in 2021: \"This included a minimum speed of 2.5 seconds per spin, a ban on autoplay and features that increase play intensity, such as turbo, quick spin and slam stop, or give the illusion of 'false wins'.\" Gambling companies make a significant proportion of their profits from online slots. Acording to market data collected by the Gambling Commission up to December 2024, the profits from slots increased 15% year on year to a new high of \u00a3709m. The number of spins increased 9% in the previous quarter to a new peak of \u00a323.9bn. Paddy Power merged with another betting brand, Betfair, and under the name Flutter Entertainment, is now one of the biggest betting companies in the world.  Stewart Kenny resigned from the board of Flutter, saying he felt the company was not doing enough to protect vulnerable customers using its websites. Mr Kenny no longer has any financial interest with the company, and receives no payment for taking part in the programmes. In the documentary series Changing the Odds, Mr Kenny teams up with journalist Lydia Thomas, who has reported on the betting industry for a decade, to chart 20 years since the 2005 Gambling Act. The act paved the way for the UK betting industry to revolutionise gambling and take it online. For many years, the UK has been the biggest online betting market in the world \u2013 with the industry worth \u00a315.6bn. Only recently has the United States overtaken as more states allow online gambling. And it is the move online that sparked Mr Kenny's worries when he was sitting on the board. He believes the internet by its very nature can be addictive and that adding online casinos in the mix has \"made the cocktail too strong\".  Mr Kenny still enjoys gambling, and regularly bets on horse and dog racing, which he believes is a less addictive gambling product. But he criticises the industry for encouraging sports betting punters to move to online slots. \"I have always said I have been very relaxed about my kids opening up betting accounts. But, I would be horrified if my grandchildren open up a betting account. \"What the bookmakers do is, when you open a betting account at the age of 18 to have a bet, and you're a kid and you want to have a fiver on your local team, within 48 hours, the bookmakers will try and suck you into the highly addictive online casino by sending you free spins.\" Mr Kenny believes it is up to the government and regulators to make gambling safe. \"There's a balance here. If you want to bet, you should be allowed to bet. It's a free society. So you don't want to interfere with people's entertainment too much.  It's so easy to blame the betting companies. This is a matter for legislators.\" Flutter Entertainment said it recognised that the gambling industry had not always got things right in the past but said its UK business had \"evolved significantly in the years since Stewart's involvement, which ended over eight years ago\".   It said in that time, it had been \"a vocal and constructive supporter\" of the Gambling Act Review and the white paper, while \"leading the industry on proactive change\" with its introduction of deposit limits for under-25s and the setting of a \u00a310 stake limit on online slot products.  \"We were pleased that some of these measures were publicly praised by Stewart as we respect his views.\" Gambling industry body The Betting and Gaming Council said: \"Each month, around 22.5 million people in Britain enjoy a bet and the overwhelming majority do so safely and responsibly. The BGC supported plans to reform stake limits and introduce a mandatory levy to fund research, prevention and treatment. \"The white paper is a once-in-a-generation moment for change and the proposals contained in it must draw a line under the lengthy and often polarised debates on gambling.\" Changing the Odds starts on Radio 4 at 11am on Monday 17 March.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"As Wall Street grapples with the increasing likelihood of a U.S. recession, the Trump administration has gone to bat defending President Donald Trump\u2019s stock market-slamming trade policies. JPMorgan (JPM) chief economist Bruce Kasmun told reporters last week that he sees a 40% recession risk, up from 30% at the start of 2025, while Moody\u2019s chief economist Mark Zandi raised his recession odds to 35% from 15%, Fortune reports. Larry Summers, who led the Treasury Department under Former President Bill Clinton, said the odds are \u201cgetting close to 50\/50.\u201d The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial indexes were slammed last week by Trump\u2019s tariffs, which are poised to affect major U.S. corporations and consumers. An escalating tit-for-tat trade war with Europe alone threatens $9.5 trillion worth of business. The Trump administration has announced new tariffs on imports from China, Canada, Mexico, all foreign steel and aluminum, and European alcohol. China, Canada, and the European Union have announced retaliatory measures, while other nations have held off \u2014 for now.  \u201cWe will feel better about calling a stock market bottom when the market is no longer \u2018tarrified\u2019 by Trump\u2019s tariff threats and actions,\u201d Yardeni Research wrote in a note. \u201cIt might bottom after April 2, when Trump imposes reciprocal tariffs all around the world, if they lead to tariff-reduction negotiations.\u201d Here\u2019s what Trump  and his allies  have said about a potential recession.  2 \/ 8 \u201cYou know that there are no guarantees, like who would have predicted Covid, right?\u201d Scott Bessent, Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary, told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday when asked about the possibility of a recession.  Bessent, a former partner at Soros Fund Management and the founder of Key Square Group macro fund, said there could \u201cbe an adjustment\u201d because of the Trump administration\u2019s policies.  \u201cI\u2019ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They\u2019re normal,\u201d the treasury secretary said. \u201cWhat\u2019s not healthy is straight up, that you get these euphoric markets. That\u2019s how you get a financial crisis.\u201d Bessent also said he wasn\u2019t worried about the markets, something that he and other federal officials have said over the past several days.  3 \/ 8 Recessions are no joking matter. They can lead to job losses, slam workers\u2019 bargaining power, and retirement accounts can take a near-term hit. Banks may also get stricter about issuing loans, while credit card companies could reduce limits for some cardholders.  But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick thinks a recession is worth it in the long run. \u201cThese policies are the most important thing America has ever had,\u201d Lutnick told CBS News last week. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d \u201cThe only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\u201d Lutnick added.  Just a few days before that media appearance, Lutnick had told NBC News that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be no recession in America.\u201d 4 \/ 8 Last week, Trump was asked by Fox News host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year. The president didn\u2019t rule it out as a potential outcome. \u201cI hate to predict things like that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\u201d \u201cHave no fear, we will WIN everything!!!\u201d he wrote on his Truth Social on Thursday. \u201cOur economy will BOOM, like never before!\u201d the president added on Friday. 5 \/ 8 Although Tesla (TSLA) CEO and White House Senior Advisor Elon Musk hasn\u2019t directly commented on the risk of a recession, he has discussed the potential impact of Trump\u2019s trade policies.  Back in October, Musk backed up a forecast that said the then-presidential candidate\u2019s plans would cause \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d in the pursuit of a healthier economy. The forecast, tweeted out by X user FischerKing64, hypothesized that government spending cuts and mass layoffs would cause an overreaction in the economy and crash the stock market. \u201cBut when the storm passes and everyone realizes we are on sounder footing, there will be a rapid recovery to a healthier, sustainable economy,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cSounds about right,\u201d was Musk\u2019s reply. 6 \/ 8 House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, called for Americans to stay calm and carry on, even in the face of economic uncertainty.  \u201cIt is a shake-up and he said there is going to be a shake-up right now but this is what is required, in my mind, to start the process of repairing and restoring the American economy,\u201d Johnson said last week when asked about Trump\u2019s tariff strategy.  \u201cI believe the strategy is going to work ...

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"by Calculated Risk on 3\/17\/2025 10:00:00 AM  The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported the housing market index (HMI) was at 39, down from 42 last month.  Any number below 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as poor than good.  From the NAHB: Builder Confidence Falls on Cost Uncertainty Economic uncertainty, the threat of tariffs and elevated construction costs pushed builder sentiment down in March even as builders express hope that a better regulatory environment will lead to an improving business climate.  Builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes was 39 in March, down three points from February and the lowest level in seven months, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)\/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.  \u201cBuilders continue to face elevated building material costs that are exacerbated by tariff issues, as well as other supply-side challenges that include labor and lot shortages,\u201d said NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, a home builder and developer from Lexington, N.C. \u201cAt the same time, builders are starting to see relief on the regulatory front to bend the rising cost curve, as demonstrated by the Trump administration's pause of the 2021 IECC building code requirement and move to implement the regulatory definition of \u2018waters of the United States\u2019 under the Clean Water Act consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Sackett decision.\u201d  \u201cConstruction firms are facing added cost pressures from tariffs,\u201d said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. \u201cData from the HMI March survey reveals that builders estimate a typical cost effect from recent tariff actions at $9,200 per home. Uncertainty on policy is also having a negative impact on home buyers and development decisions.\u201d  The latest HMI survey also revealed that 29% of builders cut home prices in March, up from 26% in February. Meanwhile, the average price reduction was 5% in March, the same rate as the previous month. The use of sales incentives was 59% in March, unchanged from February.  ... The HMI index gauging current sales conditions fell three points to 43 in March, its lowest point since December 2023. The gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers dropped five points to 24 while the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months held steady at 47.  Looking at the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast fell three points in March to 54, the Midwest moved three points lower to 42, the South dropped four points to 42 and the West posted a two-point decline to 37. emphasis added Click on graph for larger image.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"So far, Samsung has only given a see-but-no-touch glimpse of its ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Edge smartphone. It\u2019s going to be a vehicle of engineering showcase for Samsung, but to an average buyer, the phone might leave a rather big hole in their wallets.  According to the folks over at Android Headlines, Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s 12GB RAM \/ 256GB storage variant will reportedly fall in the ballpark of \u20ac1,200 and \u20ac1,300, which roughly translates to $1,300 and $1,400 based on current conversion rates.  For the higher end-variant with double the onboard storage, Samsung is reportedly eyeing an asking price in the range of \u20ac1,300 and \u20ac1,400m, which broadly comes in at $1,400 to $1,522 apiece. For comparison, Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone 17 Air could cost somewhere around $900 upon its launch later this year.\u00a0 It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Samsung has traditionally sold their phones at a lower asking price in the US market, compared to the EU region. For example, the Galaxy S25 starts at \u20ac900 in the EU bloc, but it is sold at $800 in the US. The Galaxy S25 Ultra commands a sticker price worth \u20ac1,470, yet the US retail pricing starts at $1,300. Irrespective of the comparison, the leaked figures are neck-to-neck with what Samsung asks for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, arguably the most decked-out top-tier Android phone on the planet. Apparently, Samsung is charging an innovation tax here, but the cost of materials is also running pretty high for the device, it seems.  Notably, the leak mentions that Samsung aims to slot the Galaxy S25 Edge somewhere between the Galaxy S25+ and the Ultra model. If that turns out to be true, we are looking at a retail price that falls between $1,000 and $1,300 broadly. According to the latest leak, the Galaxy S25 Edge\u2019s chassis is made out of titanium, following in the footsteps of Apple. Samsung will reportedly offer the phone in three colors with a familiar naming scheme to go with it viz. Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Silver.  As far as the innards go, leaks are predicting Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC for the Galaxy S25 Edge. On the front is a 6.7-inch OLED panel, while the battery capacity could be on the lower side of the spectrum at 3,786 mAh, smaller than even the Galaxy S25.  On the positive side of things, it could employ a bigger vapor chamber cooling system than the vanilla Galaxy S25. The dual rear camera setup will reportedly include a 200-megapixel primary snapper and a 12-megapixel sensor for ultrawide capture. The phone is expected to launch later this month, but availability could be limited.  Earlier this week, a known tipster suggested Samsung might skip straight from One UI 7 to One UI 8, citing the delays that have plagued the current version of the software. Today, the first versions of One UI 8 were spotted on an internal test server. This isn't an indication One UI 8 will release any time soon, but it does indicate development has started at least two months earlier than expected. One UI 7 has been in beta testing in December and has come to only a select few devices so far. Samsung did confirm the stable build of One UI 7 should launch in April and that more devices are being added to the beta program, including foldable phones. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 have begun to receive the update, too, allowing them to finally join the Android 15 party. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of this year's most-anticipated devices and the final addition to the S25 lineup, and now we have what might be the most accurate render of it yet. Shared by Ice Universe, the render shows a phone with bezels that match those of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but with a slightly smaller screen. Unfortunately, the image only shows the front of the phone. Without a look at the back, we can't confirm other details like the rumored 200MP camera. Samsung has started the rollout of OneUI 7 Beta update for its latest foldable phones, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. Multiple users have on X and Samsung\u2019s community forum have reported receiving the enrolment message on their eligible Samsung phone. A few days ago, the company promised that One UI 7 beta testing for its latest foldables will kick off for users in India, Korea, the US, and the UK. As per user posts in the Samsung forum, Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 users in the US have started receiving the update.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":" There\u2019s no doubt that traffic congestion is becoming a nemesis in urban settings. This is reason enough for every major automotive manufacturer to go the electric way with the accompanying compact form factor. A countless number of personal commuters and two-seater versions have given us reason enough to make a radical change in the perception of future commuting. The FT-Me compact two-seater concept by the Japanese automaker is designed with a vision to navigate the bustling city traffic with maximum efficiency. This jet helmet-inspired commuter has a sharp element to it, even though it measures just 2.5 meters long and weighs just 937 pounds. These dimensions pit it right against the likes of Citroen Ami or Microline, coming in the European L6e category. The top speed is capped at 28 mph to comply with the classification requirements, and even a teenager can drive it since it\u2019ll come under the quadricycle category. Designer: Toyota        The primary focus of the designers for this vehicle is high maneuverability and compact design that fits into tight parking spaces as well. The propulsion system on the vehicle consumes three times less energy (per mile) than any other comparable system. The estimated range on the pint-sized commuter in tests is 62 miles on a single charge. On top of that, it has solar panels on the roof to provide a few extra miles of range, extending it to around 118 on a sunny day. According to the maker, the peculiar black and contrasting white scheme is symbolic of the \u201csense of safety, robustness, and a lightweight, go-anywhere attitude.\u201d The sense of airiness on the inside is honed by the 360-degree visibility on all sides which makes it perfect for any kind of user.        At its core, the lightweight vehicle is a two-seater commuter, but the passenger seat can be easily removed to use as cargo space. There is enough to fit a foldable bicycle or anything measuring 1.2 meters long. This attribute could make it a practical choice for delivery companies or last-mile cargo haulers that want to transport lightweight loads. Toyota has been mindful enough to include drivers with disability since it comes with hand-controlled acceleration and brake controls on the steering wheel. Smart features come in the form of keyless entry courtesy of the smartphone app.   The bi-tone exterior that extends to the wheels is not just for the sharp looks as it aids the other motorists to spot the car in dark conditions.\u00a0 Especially when you choose the custom panels with murals or graphics on them. Toyota has not detailed any of the specifications or the availability of the pint-sized EV, but we expect it to be priced anywhere between $8,000 \u2013 $10,000 on the higher side. If Toyota plans to bring the FT-Me micromobility vehicle to the US, it has to compete with the likes of Ami for sure.

Amidst the market chaos tariffs have wrought, here are some cryptocurrencies to watch this week. Binance\u2019s crytocurrency BNB popped after two reports that the Trump family was in talks to snap up a stake in the Binance U.S. exchange (which pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in 2023). The reported talks apparently touched on the idea of the two parties co-developing a stablecoin. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao denied the reports, but said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cmind a pardon.\u201d Still, BNB  was sitting around $615 as of Sunday evening, up 8% from its price five days prior. Meme coins are so out this season (well... mostly), and the Trump family\u2019s token is no exception. The token was trading around $11.32 as of Sunday evening, down about 47.9% from a month ago. On Inauguration Day, TRUMP\u2019s market cap was around $14.5 billion; it now sits at roughly $2.2 billion.  Talk of an end to the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple is drawing attention to the payment company\u2019s token, XRP. After a dip below $80,000 last week, Bitcoin staged a minor recovery over the weekend. The leading cryptocurrency was still down 10.9% from Jan. 1 as of Sunday evening, and that means the folks who flocked to it after witnessing the post-election boom are still seeing red. The early days of Trump\u2019s second term have spelled chaos for Bitcoin, the price of which loosely correlates with the stock market. Given the tariffs to come and uncertainty surrounding  AI stocks, more stock market carnage could drag Bitcoin down with it. A vote on reissuing burned tokens thrust Crypto.com-backed Cronos further into the spotlight. The cryptocurrency popped 3% in 24 hours to around $0.085 as of Sunday night.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"     The Federal Reserve's second policy meeting of the year won't change much for mortgage rates in the near term.    The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at its monetary policy meeting this week \u2014 though sticky inflation, increased unemployment and slowing economic growth could force the central bank to cut rates in late spring or early summer.\u00a0 As recession fears mount and uncertain trade policies pressure financial markets, the key question for investors was how the Trump administration's economic austerity measures and tariffs would\u00a0influence the Fed's\u00a0interest rate forecast.\u00a0 \"Policy is not on a preset course,\" Fed chair Jerome Powell said during Wednesday's press conference. \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\" The Fed is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. A sluggish economy typically warrants interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, but lowering rates too quickly could fuel price growth when inflation is still above target.\u00a0 Still, the Federal Reserve, which sets a short-term benchmark interest rate for lenders, only\u00a0indirectly impacts the mortgage market. In 2024, the central bank cut interest rates three times, but mortgage\u00a0rates didn't fall. That's because rates are primarily driven by movement in the bond market, specifically on the 10-year Treasury yield. Bond yields and interest rates rise or fall depending on how\u00a0new economic data\u00a0shifts market speculation and risk assessment. Until the impact of the administration's policies is clearer, mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate.\u00a0 Read more: How the Federal Reserve's Decision Impacts Mortgage Rates Fannie Mae projects mortgage\u00a0rates to stay above 6.5%\u00a0for the better part of the year. Yet lenders base their rates on a range of factors, and no forecast is set in stone. Given the precarious nature of the economy, any sign of risk or disruption could lower bond yields and impact the trajectory of mortgage rates.\u00a0 If an economic downturn appears likely, for example, mortgage rates could start decreasing, but they would need to drop closer to 5.5% to bring buyers into the market at scale, according to\u00a0Alex Thomas, senior research analyst at John Burns Research and Consulting.\u00a0 While cheaper home loan rates are positive for housing affordability, a shaky economy could keep the housing market frozen. \"If lower mortgage rates are the result of a recession, housing demand could remain muted,\" said Thomas. Prospective homebuyers who have been\u00a0waiting for mortgage rates to drop\u00a0for the past few years may need to adjust to the \"new normal\" in the mortgage market, with rates fluctuating between 5% and 7% over the longer term. That may seem high compared to the recent\u00a02% rates\u00a0of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a\u00a030-year fixed mortgage\u00a0has been around 7%.\u00a0 Today's\u00a0unaffordable housing market\u00a0isn't just a result of high mortgage rates. A\u00a0long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation have locked out buyers over the last several years. With the\u00a0spring homebuying season\u00a0fast approaching, prospective homebuyers are left wondering whether to enter the market or continue waiting on the sidelines. It's never a good idea to rush into\u00a0buying a home\u00a0without establishing a clear budget.\u00a0 Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home:\u00a0 \ud83d\udcb0 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate. \ud83d\udcb0 Save for a bigger down payment.\u00a0A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance. \ud83d\udcb0 Shop for mortgage lenders.\u00a0Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders. \ud83d\udcb0 Consider mortgage points.\u00a0You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate.","label":0}

Because Netflix has more subscribers to spread its content spending across, it can afford to spend more on content. Because it has more content, it drives better engagement, leading to more subscribers and possibly better pricing power in a virtuous cycle. This is the enduring power of Netflix\u2019s first-mover advantage in streaming,\u201d the firm wrote.  \tThe question is, \u201cwhere does the company go from here?  \tHe posed three issues. First, can the streamer\u2019s core business sustain this level of growth? His answer, yes. \u201cWhen looking at revenue per hour viewed, Netflix still appears to be under-earning relative to the engagement it drives, and we believe it still has a consumer surplus to price into going forward.\u201d  \t           \tOn advertising, as Netflix builds out its ad capabilities, he said, it \u201cwill also be able to effectively ramp monetization of this unlocked incremental subscriber ad-tier TAM. We now forecast Netflix will generate over $6 billion in advertising revenue in 2027 and almost $10 billion by 2030.\u201d  \tAnd margins. \u201cContinued growth in subscription revenues and faster growth in advertising should drive margin expansion of at least +200 bps per year going forward, reaching 40% by 2030 with room to grow from there.\u201d Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  The CEO of Silicon Valley's most famous incubator thinks \"vibe coding\" is set to transform the startup landscape.          \"I mean, the wild thing is people are getting to a million dollars to 10 million dollars a year revenue with under 10 people, and that's really never happened before in early stage venture,\" Garry Tan, CEO and president of Y Combinator, said in an interview with CNBC.               Tan said it's due, in part, to vibe coding \u2014 Silicon Valley's favorite new buzzword, coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy in a post on X in February.               But what, exactly, does vibe coding mean?               \"You can just talk to the large language models and they will code entire apps,\" Tan said. \"And if it doesn't do \u2014 if there's a bug, or if you want it to change, or you want it to look a different way, you don't have to, you know, go in there and write the code yourself.\"               In essence \u2014 Tan seems to define it as an increasing reliance on artificial intelligence to do the bulk of the heavy lifting during the programming process. He said vibe coding is dialing up the speed at which startups can develop relevant software.               \"You don't have to hire someone to do it, you just talk directly to the large language model that wrote it and it'll fix it for you,\" he said. \"And sometimes you could just accept all changes without even looking at the changes it made, because it's that good now.\"               Tan says vibe coding makes the process of building software overall more efficient, and the current batch of startups that Y Combinator is incubating \u2014 which Tan says is composed of about \"81%\" AI companies themselves \u2014 is taking full advantage.               \"This is the first time that's ever happened, and about 25% of the batch \u2014 95% of their code was written by large language models,\" Tan said.               The sheer power of LLMs is allowing startups to stay leaner, Tan said. What would've once taken \"50 or 100\" engineers to build, he believes can now be accomplished by a team of 10, \"when they are fully vibe coders.\"               \"When they are actually really, really good at using the cutting edge tools for code gen today, like Cursor or Windsurf, they will literally do the work of 10 or 100 engineers in the course of a single day,\" he said.               Vibe coding does have its drawbacks, Tan caveated in an episode of Y Combinator's Lightcone Podcast earlier this month. In particular, a survey of Y Combinator's current batch of founders indicated LLMs are weak at actually debugging the code they churn out.               \"The humans have to do the debugging, still. They have to figure out well, 'What is the code actually doing?'\" he said, adding, \"There doesn't seem to be a way to just tell it, 'debug.'\"               Still, to Tan, the benefits are plentiful. Among them \u2014 that investing time and money into building niche software is more justifiable, given the new speed at which AI makes it possible to code.               \"I think the other thing that it's going to do in the industry is that there are all these pieces of software that normally you could never write software for, like industries that before people would say, 'Oh it's too small a market,'\" he said.               All of those narrower markets, he added, can now support business that gross a \"hundred million\" yearly, while still being run by small teams.               \"This is really the good news,\" Tan said.               For those struggling to break into a shrinking job market, Tan says the advent of vibe coding has arrived at the \"perfect time.\" It gives young engineers the opportunity to strike out on their own rather than relying on big-name companies to kickstart their careers.               \"You know, maybe it's that engineer who couldn't get a job at Meta or Google, who actually can build a standalone business making 10 or 100 million dollars a year with 10 people,\" Tan said. \"Like that's such a powerful moment in software.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Tesla stock is getting hammered again this week, as shares of the electric vehicle maker led by the world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, faced further pressure from Wall Street as Musk grows embedded in the White House and questions swirl about Tesla\u2019s brand reputation globally and its standing in its crucial Chinese market. Tesla showrooms have faced a spate of protests in recent weeks. Shares of Tesla dropped 5% to $225.31 Tuesday, building on Monday\u2019s 5% dip as the stock appears poised to decline for a ninth consecutive week. Tuesday\u2019s drop came as Musk\u2019s firm faced yet another ding from Wall Street analysts. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan cut his price target for Tesla stock by $120 to $320, maintaining his outperform rating for Musk\u2019s company while \u201crightsizing expectations.\u201d Narayan cited \u201cintensifying\u201d competition for Tesla in China, which accounted for 21% of Tesla\u2019s 2024 sales, predicting Chinese car companies will \u201cdominate\u201d the market in the country for driverless vehicles, which Musk has emphasized as the future of his company. Driving down Tesla shares Monday was a note from Mizuho analysts led by Vijay Rakesh lowering their price target for Tesla shares by $85 to a still bullish $430, as the analysts slashed their 2025 vehicle delivery forecast from 2.3 million to 1.8 million, a more than 20% cut that falls well below consensus forecasts of 2 million deliveries. Rakesh chalked up Tesla\u2019s \u201csales woes\u201d to weakening \u201cbrand perception\u201d in the U.S. and the European Union, a \u201cdeterioration in geopolitics\u201d and increasingly challenging competition in China from domestic EV firms. Two of Tesla\u2019s Chinese EV competitors made major announcements this week which may further weaken Tesla\u2019s positioning in the country. BYD unveiled a new fast charging system which may charge cars in less than a third of the time Tesla\u2019s current chargers allow, while Zeekr said it will offer its self-driving system for free in China. RBC said it expects Tesla\u2019s market share in China to halve to 10%, and relatedly lowered its valuation for Tesla\u2019s full self-driving and robotaxi units from $1.26 trillion to about $850 billion. Mizuho analysts said Tesla\u2019s U.S. sales last month declined 2% year-over-year as the broader EV market rose by 16%, its China sales cratered 49% as EV sales in the country grew by 85% and its Germany sales tanked 76% as the European nation\u2019s EV market expanded by 31%. Tesla stock ended Friday trading at its lowest end-of-week level since just before the election. Shares of Tesla are down 44% year-to-date, the worst loss of any company listed on the S&P, according to FactSet data. Mizuho and RBC joined the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS in slashing its delivery forecasts for Tesla. \u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\u201d Last week, JPMorgan analysts described the recent melting of Tesla\u2019s perception, especially in pockets of the world in which Musk inserted himself into right-wing politics, such as Germany. Though Musk is perhaps the closest ally of President Donald Trump, the latter\u2019s hawkish tariffs are a major drag on Musk\u2019s main source of wealth, Tesla. In a letter to the Office of the United States Trade Representative submitted last Tuesday, Tesla lobbied the Trump administration to take a \u201cphased approach\u201d on tariffs and consider Tesla\u2019s EVs contain \u201ccertain parts and components\u201d which \u201care difficult or impossible to source within the United States,\u201d a break from Trump\u2019s frequently shifting tariff deadlines and targets. About 53% respondents to a CNN poll published last week said they hold a negative opinion of Musk compared to roughly 35% with a positive view and about 11% with no take. Tesla stock is still up 1% from last Monday, when it suffered a 4.5-year-worst 15% amid a broader selloff tied to economic uncertainty fears linked to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Musk\u2019s $321 billion net worth makes him easily the richest person on the planet, though that\u2019s down more than $140 billion from its peak of $464 billion set in December when Tesla stock traded at about $480 following a post-election upward swing.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"We\u2019ve seen folding devices from many of the big tech players but while Samsung is currently on its 6th generation of the Galaxy Z Fold, and Google on its second Pixel Fold, Apple is still nowhere to be seen in the market.\u00a0 That\u2019s not unusual, Apple typically launches features and designs a little later than others, and sometimes not at all \u2013 it\u2019s never done an under display fingerprint sensor for example.\u00a0 When it comes to folding devices from the Cupertino company though, rumors are ramping up and the latest suggests we might see mass production start next year.\u00a0 According to a research note from GF Securities, picked up by MacRumours, analyst Jeff Pu has said Apple\u2019s first two folding phones have recently entered New Product Introduction at Foxconn. In the note, Pu suggested the foldable devices could go into early prototyping stage as early as this April, before mass production in the second half of 2026.\u00a0 Now, before you get too excited, Pu didn\u2019t offer any specific details about the two foldable devices, though it is thought it will be the first foldable iPhone, as well as a foldable iPad. The foldable iPhone has been the subject of a number of rumors recently, with some of the latest reports suggesting it will have an aspect ratio a little different from the current folding phones out there and potentially offering an 8-inch inner display.\u00a0 The folding iPad meanwhile, is rumored to have up to a 19-inch display when unfolded, which would make it significantly larger than the current iPad Air and iPad Pro, both of which top out at 13-inches.\u00a0 If Pu is accurate in his analysis and mass production does begin at the end of 2026, it is possible we will see a folding iPhone and folding iPad announced in the second half of 2026 or early 2027. Of course, nothing is official confirmed by Apple, so take this news with a pinch of salt until there is some more concrete evidence to suggest these devices are hitting production phase, but we\u2019re keeping our fingers crossed. Ever since we first heard murmurs of Apple prepping an ultra-slim iPhone, speculations were rife about a fittingly high asking price. But it seems buyers won\u2019t get hit with an absurd \u201cinnovation tax\u201d for the iPhone 17 Air model later this year. According to Bloomberg, the upcoming phone might be priced at \u201croughly $900.\u201d To put that into perspective, that\u2019s the same asking price as the iPhone 16 Plus. To recall, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the \u201cPlus\u201d model in Apple\u2019s line-up later this year. A few pleasant surprises The package, however, is going to be a mixed bag of surprises. For example, the slim phone is expected to offer a 6.6-inch display, but it will borrow the ProMotion display tech from the pricier Pro models. So far, the high refresh rate perk has been exclusive to Apple\u2019s flagship iPhones and iPads.  As the release for the iPhone 17 draws ever closer (expected in September 2025), more leaks have emerged \u2014 and now a set of dummy units give us a close look at the entire lineup, but specifically the iPhone 17 Air. This handset has been the source of quite a bit of speculation and rumors, and a peek at its profile shows a phone even slimmer than we had imagined. The leaks come courtesy of Sonny Dickson, a well-known tipster. Dickson shared the images on X. It's important to remember that these units are chunks of metal; they have no electronics inside them, so we can't gauge specs based on the design. It does give us a firm look at the profile, however, and an idea of the placement of various components. The iPhone 17 Air is going to be the next big smartphone experiment at Apple. With a rumored thickness of just 5.5 millimeters and a high-density battery, it\u2019s going to be the showcase of multiple innovations later this year. But Apple\u2019s plans for slimmer phones down the road sound even more ambitious. According to Bloomberg, Apple is planning to make a phone so slim that it will lack any physical port whatsoever. In fact, the company explored the idea for the iPhone 17 Air, but decided to wait out on those plans for a variety of reasons.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"It\u2019s generally pretty easy to spot a microcontroller on a PCB. There are clues aplenty: the more-or-less central location, the nearby crystal oscillator, the maze of supporting passives, and perhaps even an obvious flash chip lurking about. The dead giveaway, though, is all those traces leading to the chip, betraying its primacy in the circuit. As all roads lead to Rome, so it often is with microcontrollers. It looks like that may be about to change, though, based on Texas Instruments\u2019 recent announcement of a line of incredibly small Arm-based microcontrollers. The video below shows off just how small the MSPM0 line can be, ranging from a relatively gigantic TSSOP-20 case down to an eight-pin BGA package that measures only 1.6 mm by 0.86 mm. That\u2019s essentially the size of an 0603 SMD resistor, a tiny footprint for a 24-MHz Cortex M0+ MCU with 16-kB of flash, 1-kB of SRAM, and a 12-bit ADC. The larger packages obviously have more GPIO brought out to pins, but even the eight-pin versions support six IO lines. Of course, it\u2019s hard not to write about a specific product without sounding like you\u2019re shilling for the company, but being first to market with an MCU in this size range is certainly newsworthy. We\u2019re sure other manufacturers will follow suit soon enough, but for now, we want to know how you would go about using a microcontroller the size of a resistor. The promo video hints at TI\u2019s target market for these or compact wearables by showing them used in earbuds, but we suspect the Hackaday community will come up with all sorts of creative and fun ways to put these to use \u2014 shoutout to [mitxela], whose habit of building impossibly small electronic jewelry might be a good use case for something like this. There may even be some nefarious use cases for a microcontroller this small. We were skeptical of the story about \u201cspy chips\u201d on PC motherboards, but a microcontroller that can pass for an SMD resistor might change that equation a bit. There\u2019s also the concept of \u201cOreo construction\u201d that these chips might make a lot easier. A board with a microcontroller embedded within it could be a real security risk, but on the other hand, it could make for some very interesting applications. What\u2019s your take on this? Can you think of applications where something this small is enabling? Or are microcontrollers that are likely to join the dust motes at the back of your bench after a poorly timed sneeze a bridge too far? Sound off in the comments below.      What Would You Do With The World\u2019s Smallest Microcontroller?   \u00a0  Is it marked Not for rectal use? If not, I have an idea \ud83d\ude1b Probably about the same stuff I did with an Atmel 2313 almost 25 years ago, except it would be smaller and  not have a resonator and have fewer external ICs and consume less power and\u2026 Although I do doubt my ability to put this on a PCB to do a reflow. Plug-A-Day goes brrr. Smaller, less detectable chess cheating devices. Just think of possibilities for younger players to finally beat Magnus! Boofing BGA\u2019s gives a new meaning to the term \u2018anal beads\u2019. Put it in a ring to respond to RFID as a security key. Keep your (security) keyring on an actual ring that you would normally wear, such as a wedding ring or class ring. I couldn\u2019t find the power requirements info quickly from the datasheet, but you might be able to power it from skin temperature using the Seebeck effect. Then maybe add a sensor or two, wake up every minute and measure body temperature or oxygenation or something. An automated reader in the home would make the whole operation seamless \u2013 such as a reader embedded into a doorway that you have to pass through. From page #1: \u201cRUN: 87\u00b5A\/MHz\u201d. Given it runs at 24MHz it would run at 2,088uA (or about 2mA) in the active state. What is really interesting to me is how low the low power states are. \u201cSTANDBY: 5\u00b5A with SRAM retention\u201d.  If you can store even a little bit of power, you can wake up in bursts and last a long time on very little capacity. This would pair well with energy harvesting devices. Unfortunately spo2 and in general optical front ends require 25mA+ at tmyour desired sampling frequency (32 to 3200sps, with led on periods of about 60 to 400us). Doubt you\u2019ll be powering anything with Seebeck :( Oh man now that\u2019s one of those \u2018I wish I thought of that\u2019 ideas. A small amount of \u2018I must never lose this\u2019 storage. Trouble, I suppose, is getting the info on\/off the thing while being robust as a ring, and not looking janky. I like the class ring idea. Something that hefty would give you a fair amount of internal volume to work with for support components. \u201cWorld\u2019s Smallest Microcontroller?\u201d Not even close. NY8A051H 497\u00d7418\u00b5m That\u2019s just the raw die size. Based on its datasheet, the NY8A051H is only available in SOP-8 and SOT-23-6, which are much larger. Die was available to buy from LCSC few months ago. Interesting.  Not trying to disagree with you but the datasheet I found only mentions the two packaging formats Adrian mentioned.  Do you have a link to something showing this chip in the smaller format? The Ti chip seems nicer in that it\u2019s a 32-bit ARM MCU, but I\u2019ll grant I haven\u2019t really worked with 8-bit since the 6502. https:\/\/www.nyquest.com.tw\/upload\/2024_11_293\/NY8A051H_v1.8.pdf Ordering Information -> Package Type -> Die Die version is used for chip-on-board (COB) mounting. The silicon die is glued to the PCB and connected with bond wires, then covered by a blob of epoxy. It uses significantly more area than just the bare die size. But still much smaller than conventional packaging. UFO implants, finally! Wouldn\u2019t that make it Too Hot To Handle? That comment hit Rock Bottom\u2026 loose it on the floor No one\u2019s said the obvious, pair with the world\u2019s smallest violin. The world\u2019s tiniest synth keyboard. lose I would use it to store me plans to take over da world! \u201cGee, Brain, but where would we get uniforms that small? NARF!\u201d Well Futurists might get their world of ubiquitous computers in the most banal of places. I want silicon cheap enough space heaters preform compute instead of using nichrome wire. When it gets cold in my office, I just fire up a couple more computers.  If it\u2019s still cold, I mine some coins. The ADC is probably the most interesting thing to me. If they\u2019re cheap enough, you could throw one of these at whatever you want to sample (depending on all the usual ADC considerations, of course). It looks like its I2C peripheral even has a follower mode (not always a given in MCUs), so bam, you have a bus full of serial ADCs with short analog traces, extra filtering logic, etc. One of the ADCs is also a temp sensor, which would have been extremely useful in a thermography product I worked on a few years back. I\u2019m thinking back to one of my first design projects out of college. My employer had an existing design built around a single TTL Hex inverter IC. I was tasked with keeping the same PCB size but squeezing an MSP-430 in there and programming it to tolerate less precise pulse times and to log how many times it had been signaled in its lifetime. This thing would have made that trivial. Imagine a beowulf cluster of these. At $0.20, it makes sense to use it as dedicated high speed spi adc, with one module per each channel. Like a universal sensor driver with some serious protocol to communicate to main big chip. Imagine 24 of them connected to rpi2040 for eeg cap, slurping 24 channels of analog data. Smart networks and AI. By pushing processing closer to the sensor(s). That\u2019s\u2026. not a beowulf cluster. That\u2019s just device \/ perfrerial design structure. Commonly used these days, and yes a chip like this could be used if space was a constraint on the device side. Cloud computing. Specifically, DUST cloud. Endless Space here we come. How fast do you need to measure it? Will you run out of bandwidth on the SPI bus? With such processing power you could even use some compression and send many samples in one packet if latency is not essential. Obviously a blinky led FOR ANTS! Might be a fantastic mini-core for small fpgas like the ice40up5k. Just have a small bank of these attached that the fpga could off load small processing tasks instead of tiny softcores taking up flip-flops and bram. Wow that is a SICK idea. I\u2019d like to start implanting them in my body somewhere. Maybe parts of my brain that aren\u2019t used very often. I was going to say I\u2019d need a lot of them to replace all the brain I don\u2019t use, but then I remembered I don\u2019t have much brain to start with, so I\u2019d only need a few to do the job. Clearly the answer is a Beowulf Cluster for ants. I think size by itself is pretty boring. The use cases shown have been done for a long time now. Take the earbud: The BLE still needs to be solved and there is probably dedicated hardware for noise cancelation, that can not be addressed with a 24MHz micro. Then either the BLE solution or the Audio dsp will give you a CPU for free, it\u2019s already on one of the dies somewhere. If the power consumption was incredible, compared to larger devices, that would be nice, but the video did not say that. The earbuds thing does feel like a stretch. Earbuds these days are often using purpose built ICs or are going to tapeout. Put the \u00b5C in an optical package, along with some LEDs (R, G, B, IR) and a photo diode. Basically make a hackabe WS2812 that is also capable of optical communication \/ can act as a sensor pixel \/ have its own peripehrals. Winning answer! Wikipedia\u2019s page on \u201csmart dust\u201d has a bunch of ideas, from as far back as the early 1990s. Power and wireless communication (and sufficient power for wireless communcation) are still going to be tricky, but there are some technologies to explore. Personally I\u2019m hoping for a radio-controlled bumblebee. Or maybe start with a dragonfly. How about a cockroach? https:\/\/backyardbrains.com\/products\/roboroach Hide the MCU under one of those larger resistors\u2026 would be nice if the modified resistor was functional as well. I think that\u2019s alluded to in the writeup about embedding it in the board.  You could put this underneath a 555 and someone looking at it would not be likely to see it. (\u201cYou\u2019ll never believe what you can do with just a 555!\u201d) ADC and LINbus suggests some kind of sensor array.  But what needs to be that tiny? Maybe an EEG for a brain interface in a hat or helmet. Like a motorcycle where you could activate lights with a thought. I want a swarm of wasp drones. The central hive\/cluster is not just their storage, but also charging, and the central gathering point all their data is sent to before it goes to the rest of the network. World\u2019s smallest TI-83? Obviously I\u2019d immediately eat one I would use up all the IPv6 addresses. I recently used spider style attiny85 to drive 10 rgb led strip for replacement lightbar for sgi octane, this would work too, but maybe not because soldering would be a nightmare. ;-) I would drop it on the floor and lose it, obviously, why are you asking? The size isn\u2019t THAT unprecedented.  NXP\u2019s LPC1103 (32k flash, 8k RAM, 16pins, 2.17\u00d72.32mm) came out a decade ago.  Yeah, this is less than half that size, but we\u2019re in the realm of diminishing returns WRT \u201cnew applications.\u201d  I think. 5.03mm\u00b2 vs 1.38mm\u00b2, thats closer to quarter of the size. .5mm vs .35mm ball pitch is somewhat significant difference. And this new TI part is also almost half the height, .35mm vs .6mm. That being said, .35mm pitch wlcsp is not all that exotic (MAX32660 would be better comparison point), but doing that for 8 pin chip is novel Let\u2019s say STM32C011D6, then \u2013 comes in WLCSP 12 1.7\u00d71.42\u00d70.6 P 0.35 mm. That\u2019s more like 1:2 sizewise. But with 1.5x more pins. I would have to add a programming header that was 5x the size of the IC. And then a battery\u2026 I think you nailed it. There is no eco system that goes with this part. Anything to makes it useful will be so much bigger. Oh, it is. You have dev boards for the development process, and in a final product you would buy it pre-programmed. When they are used as clusters, nearby or distributed, the size you describe is already there. Anyway, a new ecosystem of smaller connections would make it shine. I remember TI advertising a 25 cent processor a while back. That was at 1 million quantity. I think they are doing the same saying this is a 20 cent processor you will pay 3 times that at 1000 pcs. False advertising. Click the link in the article and then scroll down and click \u201cbuy now\u201d. $0.18 in 1000 quantity. I worked on a product that had a 3mm wide double sided fpc and a bunch of sensors. The MCU I used was smaller than the IMU but this TI part would have made love much easier. Really small MCUs are driven by mechanical design rather than electrical I would probably manage to short all of the pins together while attempting to solder it. I have no desire to work with anything smaller than a 0.5mm pin pitch. It needs to be deadbug integrated into a blinken lights circuit. Comically proportioned next to the normal leds etc.. I made a sound-reactive LED necklace out of an ATTiny85 years and years ago. Could probably make it earring-sized with that guy. World\u2019s smallest microcontroller? \u201c10-cent WCH CH570\/CH572 RISC-V MCU features 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth LE 5.0, USB 2.0\u201d. https:\/\/www.cnx-software.com\/2025\/03\/15\/10-cents-wch-ch570-ch572-risc-v-mcu-features-2-4ghz-wireless-bluetooth-le-5-0-usb-2-0\/ Quite a lot smaller 1.38 mm\u00b2 vs 9 mm\u00b2 of the WCH. On paper the MSPM0C1104 looks like a good replacement for the ATTiny85. The first project that comes to mind is elm-chan\u2019s Simple SD Audio Player. But with that tiny DSBGA you could glue it directly onto an SD micro card with some tiny caps, inductors, and a tiny power ic. Three stiff bent wires glued on to the other side could be made into a pseudo headphone jack. Then power is just whatever the power ic can handle. A single AA battery would probably last all day. Really tiny music player. Not sure how you\u2019d access the SD afterwards though. I think we\u2019re getting close to things a little smaller than a grain of rice, with induction power and an outside that\u2019s multicolor OLED and some data flow over the induction, and capacitance touch sensor, maybe a inertial sensor that knows how it\u2019s oriented\u2026  And then put it in transparent PLA reels with a 3D printer that has a nozzle but enough to let them flow. Kinda grainy prints, but you\u2019ve now got the ability to print some very neat toys. 6 i\/o pins? Build a huge isometric grid of them and have them run a nano OS to run jobs such that they flow through the mesh like a graph based processing pipeline with configurable parallelism? Hmm.  The Transputer only used four links to neighbours, and ran at 20 MHz. I wonder how this would compare in the same sort of arrangement. 16k is a bit limiting but \u2013 USB encrypter? Place it in a small cable, plug in USB drive, data is encrypted. Key held in CPU flash. Need the same cable (or the key) to decrypt USB contents. A USB phy likely uses the same area as the chip here itself lol I guess I can make the world\u2019s first 0402 smart resistor lol Hide it under a 1206 and claim my circuit is only using a 555. What about ESD issues? MSP430 would make more sense with low power. DOOM. Run Doom on a cufflink? The ch32v riscv series is a better choice. 1K pricing of the TI part indicates low volume pricing to HI. Also 1k sram, come on already. Put 32 (or 64) on an Arduino Uno form factor board and do massive parallel processing. Just because. Build a tiny Connection Machine Ultra light weight mouse control the worlds smallest micro, I would expect. I mean, couple this with some small enough motors, linear actuators, and a 3D printed model could result in a very good Gundam Mobile suit that actually moves. Hmm\u2026 Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent. (Comment Policy) This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

PlayStation's special-edition DualSense Controller themed around The Last of Us releases April 10, three days before Season 2 premieres on HBO. By      Steven Petite    and      Jon Bitner    on March 17, 2025 at 2:59PM PDT  The Last Of Us Limited Edition DualSense Controller   $85 | Releases April 10  After selling out almost instantly when preorders opened on March 14, The Last of Us Limited Edition DualSense Controller is back in stock at two major retailers. As of March 17 at 2 PM PT, Target and Best Buy are taking preorders again, but the special-edition PS5 controller remains out of stock at Amazon and Walmart. It appears that the bulk of the stock will be sold by PlayStation itself, as the controller is still available to order at PS Direct despite being such a hot commodity at major retailers. The Last of Us-themed DualSense Controller releases April 10, three days before Season 2 of the TV adaptation airs on HBO. The Last of Us DualSense Controller Preorders:   Designed with a black and white color scheme, the controller is adorned with various icons and emblems representing different events and characters from the game. The bottom half of the controller (including both analog sticks) is a brilliant white, while the top half (including the face buttons and D-pad) is black. You\u2019ll get a pop of white on the triggers and on \"The Last of Us\" text emblazoned on its back. Fans will also notice several easter eggs scattered around the gamepad's surface, including a firefly, moth, and wolf printed on the controller, referencing the Fireflles organization and the characters Ellie and Abby. It\u2019s a good-looking controller by all accounts, and it\u2019s bound to be just as popular as previous limited-edition models from PlayStation.   Sony has released several other limited-edition DualSense controllers, including version based on Astro Bot, Spider-Man, God of War, Concord, and more. While most of these are sold out, you can still grab the official Helldivers 2 DualSense and Fortnite DualSense controllers for $85 each. Like the new Last of Us controller, these gamepads feature unique color schemes and decals themed after the games they're based on.  The Last of Us Season 1 Limited-Edition Collectible Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)   $38 (was $50) | Releases March 18    If you want to refresh your memory ahead of the premiere of The Last of Us Season 2, check out the brand-new Limited Edition Steelbook release of Season 1 on 4K Blu-ray. The new edition comes with a very cool steelbook case and is on sale for $38 (was $50) at Amazon. You could display your steelbook case next to the official action figure versions of Joel & Ellie, who joined the PlayStation Shapes collectible lineup last fall. The two-pack of articulated and customizable action figures is discounted to $40 (was $50). And if you like board games, The Last of Us was recently adapted into a cooperative strategy game called Escape the Dark. Designed to be played solo or alongside up to four friends, the officially licensed tabletop game is available for $71.49 at Amazon.   If haven't played video game series yet or are looking to add physical copies to your PS5 collection, you can grab The Last of Us Part 1 for $50 (was $70) and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for $50. Meanwhile, GameSpot sister site Fanatical is offering a steep discount on The Last of Us Part 1 for PC and a 10% preorder discount for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered ahead of the PC port's April 3 launch.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"The U.S. consumer is holding up pretty well even as businesses scramble to adjust to President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, economic indicators  show. This is helping to support stock prices \u2014 especially on days when the president doesn\u2019t mention tariffs. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones and Nasdaq Composite indexes closed higher on Monday after overall retail sales rebounded by less than expected in February, rising 0.2% from January \u2014 but the control group that feeds into GDP topped forecasts with a 1% increase.  By contrast, the New York Fed\u2019s empire manufacturing index fell by almost 26 points to -20 for March, the lowest level since early 2024, while the price measure picked up. Additionally, the NAHB homebuilders index for this month also weakened unexpectedly. We\u2019re seeing \u201cresilience of economy on consumer side, but weakness on business side as companies deal with tariff issue,\u201d economist Ed Yardeni said on a conference call. While the U.S. economy isn\u2019t definitely heading for a recession, the odds of one have increased.  And while current bear indicators are at a levels that usually signal a screaming buy for stocks \u2014 because they prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates \u2014 that\u2019s not going to happen at this week\u2019s meeting of the central bank, Yardeni said. Policymakers still remain dovish, however, and may cut later this year, he added. \u201cGet a neck brace, the volatility will most likely continue,\u201d Yardeni said, adding that he\u2019s not sure that the stock market has hit bottom. The situation may stabilize after the Trump administration imposes reciprocal tariffs on April 2 \u2014 provided that it then negotiates the rates down. If they become a permanent feature, as Trump has insisted they will be, the situation would be different. Pantheon Macroeconomics sees the elevated risk of much weaker growth as consumers seek to rebuild a savings buffer in response to concerns about job security, keeping to its projection of 75 bps of rate cuts this year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on NBC\u2019s (CMCSA+0.29%) \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he he was \u201cnot at all\u201d worried about the stock market, calling corrections \u201chealthy.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"ByMegan Poinski  ByMegan Poinski , Forbes Staff.  While President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is prioritizing the end of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and many companies have stepped back from their commitments, DEI is alive and well in many companies across the United States. A study released last month by labor and employment law firm Littler found that 49% of C-suite leaders are not considering rollbacks of their DEI programs as a result of Trump\u2019s orders. In fact, only 8% are seriously considering making changes based on the orders. However, business leaders know that this decision to press forward with such programs could be problematic from a legal standpoint. Given the Trump Administration\u2019s posture on DEI, 55% of business leaders say they are more concerned about lawsuits, government enforcement actions and shareholder proposals targeting their positions than before Trump\u2019s inauguration. This fear is felt by a larger proportion of government contractors (74%), public companies (67%) and large employers (65%). And 42% that have decreased their DEI commitments did so because of liability concerns. Even so, six in 10 companies said they would make no changes to their DEI policies until they see or hear more from the White House\u2014including planned enforcement against companies. \u201cDespite the increased scrutiny, many companies seem to be taking a measured approach, rather than rushing to end or scale back IE&D efforts,\u201d Jeanine Conley Daves, Littler shareholder and member of its DEI consulting practice, said in the report. \u201cLeaders are looking for ways to balance legal risks with the value such programs provide to their workforces and company cultures.\u201d While DEI had been seen as an aspect of corporate responsibility before Trump\u2019s second term began, it\u2019s also been important to employees, who want to know that their employer embraces people of all kinds. Employee expectations for DEI programs are a major influencer in retention, the study found. More than 75% of employers with the programs say employees play a role, with 26% indicating their expectations have a large impact on programs. Another tricky policy area is when there is real financial or performance trouble. It often makes sense to work with an asset management firm to help right-size the business, get out of problematic situations and discover value. I talked to Norma Kuntz, CEO of asset management firm Gordon Brothers, about how businesses can work through problems. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. A trader at the New York Stock Exchange at Friday's opening bell. The chaos of Trump\u2019s economic policies and dim consumer sentiment loomed over a terrible week on Wall Street last week. Tariffs on imported aluminum and steel took effect last Wednesday, and Trump threatened more tariffs on the EU, including a new 200% tariff on European wine and spirits in retaliation for a new 50% tax on imports of American whiskey. If this tariff and tax move forward, they would take effect as part of Trump\u2019s new global reciprocal tariffs on April 2. On Thursday, the S&P 500 officially hit correction territory, falling 10.1% from its all-time high more than a month before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq also hit their lowest points of the year. Markets were back up on Friday, with the S&P up 2.1%, the Nasdaq climbing 2.6% and the Dow up 1.6%, though this could be due to Congress passing a stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown. Consumer sentiment dropped nearly 11% in March, according to preliminary readings from the University of Michigan\u2019s continual survey. The decline was almost entirely driven by uncertainty around economic policies. And while most things dealing with Trump are extremely politically polarized, all respondents seemed to feel the uncertainty\u2014expectations were down 10% for Republicans, 12% for independents and 24% for Democrats. One economic bright spot last month: inflation was lower than expected. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the consumer price index increased 2.8% between February 2024 and last month\u20140.1% lower than consensus estimates. Core inflation, minus volatile food and energy indexes, was 3.1%. While inflation is decreasing, it\u2019s still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. These numbers also don\u2019t reflect any of Trump\u2019s economic policies, including tariffs, which many economists have cautioned will add to inflation. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman warns that a single month of slower CPI numbers is not a trend, and there are likely to be more changes in the economy in the near future. Forbes senior contributor Mayra Rodriguez Valladares writes that the big banks are warning about an economic slowdown, and given their access and knowledge of financial and monetary data, it\u2019s worth heeding their warning. A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX8 departs from San Diego International Airport. Commercial airlines are reporting turbulence ahead in 2025. Last week, Delta, American, Southwest and JetBlue all lowered their outlooks for the first part of the year, writes Forbes\u2019 Suzanne Rowan Kelleher. In regulatory filings, the airlines indicated they were cutting their projections due to reductions in consumer and corporate confidence and more economic uncertainty and softness in domestic demand. Southwest also ended one of its popular policies: Free checked baggage. Starting with flights booked on May 28, passengers not on the top loyalty tiers will have to pay an extra fee for checked bags. This change comes after activist investor Elliott Investment Management took a $1.9 billion stake in the airline last year, amid criticism that the company\u2019s leaders showed a \u201cstubborn unwillingness to evolve.\u201d Elliott urged Southwest to end its open seating policy\u2014which it announced it would do last summer\u2014and drop its free checked bags. While the baggage decision initially boosted Southwest\u2019s stock by about 11%, its share price quickly fell, and Southwest is down more than 2% in the last week. But investors seem to be the only ones who liked the change at all, writes Forbes senior contributor John Brandon. Social media posts showed Southwest employees and passengers were disheartened by the move, with potential customers saying there\u2019s no reason to fly Southwest now; they\u2019re just like other airlines that charge for baggage. Reid Larsen in his camper van. Being a small business owner is tough, especially when you\u2019re new to entrepreneurship. Forbes\u2019 Brandon Kochkodin writes about a small business of its own\u2014Rand Larsen\u2019s SMB Community\u2014that acts as a support group and community for small business owners nationwide. SMB was started after Larsen, who had started his own businesses and spent 14 months learning about entrepreneurship through acquisition working for an Ohio-based mentor, realized that distressed business owners really needed some peers to talk to. SMB is a membership organization for businesses making at least $1 million in revenue. Larsen, who has been crisscrossing the country in a 2019 Dodge Ram ProMaster camper van for more than a year, meets with small business owners, speaks at events and facilitates peer groups of entrepreneurs to talk about the ups and downs of their businesses. \u201cRunning a small business can be an incredibly isolating experience,\u201d Larsen told Kochkodin. Gordon Brothers CEO Norma Kuntz. When a business with physical assets gets in trouble, they often call Gordon Brothers, a 122-year-old asset management powerhouse, to help them figure out what to do next. Gordon Brothers is an expert in finding the value of business assets and working with property and leases to help companies optimize their footprints. In recent months, it\u2019s taken a leading role in retail bankruptcies, buying the closeout retailer Big Lots and reselling some of its leases. I talked to CEO Norma Kuntz about the asset management business and when companies should look into that kind of assistance. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. When should a business start to look at its assets and leases and figure out how to find some of the money it needs to keep going? Kuntz: Always. Day one. When you think about this industry, you think about financial assets or real estate. Those are the two big things that a general C-Suite is always thinking about. But there are lots of other assets within your business that are managed on the day-to-day, or they turn much more quickly like inventory or trucks or even the furniture and fixtures in your stores. One of the things that I have seen since I\u2019ve come into this industry is there\u2019s almost a fear of having a conversation with Gordon Brothers: Does that mean that I\u2019m in a place where something has gone wrong? What we try to say is: No, you\u2019re actually ahead of the curve. You\u2019re stopping something from going wrong. You should talk to us because we can help you determine how to optimize your [asset] portfolio so someone else could lend against it. We could probably lend against it ourselves, or we can help you if you want to sell off some of it or recycle your portfolio and reposition how your asset portfolio looks. Our advice to executives would be: You should be thinking about this at all times and thinking about your assets, just as you think about any other part of your business or your other assets, like you think about your financial portfolio. What are some assets that tend to go by the wayside in terms of what executives are thinking about?  It\u2019s driven somewhat by the market cycle and what is available in whatever market we\u2019re talking about. Gordon Brothers has a very big retail business. There\u2019s all the furniture fixtures, leases and all of the different pieces of it. What Gordon Brothers knows how to do best on the retail side is understand how to close your stores. We understand the value of it, and that\u2019s not always what an executive office is going to be best at. Oftentimes, we\u2019ll talk to retailers who say, \u2018No, we\u2019ll just close our stores ourselves.\u2019 We have a much better outcome because this is what we do for a living. Working with us to close your stores, you can get a better outcome even if you\u2019re healthy. A CEO of a retailer explained it to me: Your store portfolio is always going to have some really strong performers and some really weak performers. We can help be solution-oriented partners for you on the weak performers, even if your whole business is doing well. On the industrial side, you see a lot more forgotten assets. Oftentimes you have really big corporates that have industrial plants. Or hospitals shove old equipment in a closet. That is worth something but no one has the time to deal with it. We can partner with you and use the data from 120-plus years of looking at assets. We are able to say: the trends of this [item], you might want to sit on this a little bit longer, or we will buy it from you now if you need cash and then we can sell it at a later point in time. What\u2019s really cool about the Gordon Brothers platform is we\u2019re all one company. There isn\u2019t really anyone else in this many industries that does the breadth of what we do. We all sit under one umbrella and we\u2019re agnostic. Do we sell your assets? Do we lend against your assets? Do we appraise your assets for someone else to lend against it? That\u2019s a nice opportunity for our partners, and it\u2019s very much a solution-oriented business. We try to tag ourselves as a solution-oriented asset expertise firm. That doesn\u2019t really mean a lot to people, but that\u2019s how we are thinking about ourselves. What advice would you give to a CEO looking at the balance sheet, thinking maybe things aren\u2019t going the way they want it to: We\u2019re not in big trouble yet, but we should do something to get a little bit more going? Don\u2019t be afraid to have the conversation. Just having a conversation with Gordon Brothers or anyone in the asset expertise industry is not an indication that something is wrong. It\u2019s good management practice. I would say have the conversation early. We\u2019re very creative. We\u2019re not necessarily going to come in and say you should close half your stores. We\u2019re very thoughtful in looking at your problem and how best to solve it. Is it that you have a lot of aged inventory? Maybe our wholesale team can help you sell that off. Or is it that your stores are not performing well? Our real estate team can help you close some of those stores. Oftentimes, what\u2019s stopping people from closing stores is the leases that they\u2019re stuck in. Our real estate team can help them get out of these leases and help them figure out where\u2019s the best place for them to open new stores.

While there has been a broader sell-off in markets triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff confirmation, Salesforce\u2019s outlook reported last month fell short of analyst expectations, as the company is seeing slower-than-expected adoption of its AI-powered Agentforce platform, weighing on its stock price. Now, at levels of $280, CRM stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with CRM stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. As an aside, with earnings approaching, see How Will Micron Stock React To Upcoming Earnings?  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of CRM stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Salesforce along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CRM stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 Salesforce has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 7.7 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 38.8 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 22.7 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 Salesforce's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. \u2022 Salesforce has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 14.3% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 9.5% from $34 Bil to $37 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 8.3% to $9.4 Bil in the most recent quarter from $8.7 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Salesforce's profit margins are higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Salesforce's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $7.3 Bil, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 19.7% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Salesforce's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $13 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 33.7% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Salesforce's balance sheet looks strong. \u2022 Salesforce's Debt figure was $11 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $267 Bil (as of 3\/14\/2025).

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  The worst of the stock market sell-off looks like it's just about over.          That's according to top Wall Street forecasters who say they expect a more positive trajectory for stocks after the latest tariff-induced decline.               Concerns surrounding President Donald Trump's trade war and the prospect of a recession in the US helped wipe away about $5 trillion in market cap in the S&P 500 in recent weeks, taking the benchmark index solidly into correctional territory. Stocks capped off their worst weekly performance in two years last Friday. But Morgan Stanley and Citi analysts said the market may have found a bottom.               Morgan Stanley analysts said there are five reasons the sell-off appears to be over and stocks should start to recover.       First, the bank said major stock averages entered oversold territory last week. The S&P 500 traded close to 5,500 on Thursday, at the low end of the bank's expected trading range for the index in the first half of 2025.       Second, sentiment and positioning gauges for the benchmark index have started to \"lighten up considerably,\" a sign more upside is on the way.       Third, seasonal indicators look like they've improved going into the second half of the month.       Fourth, the US dollar has weakened in recent weeks, which could spark a wave of positive corporate earnings revisions as companies log stronger sales in overseas markets.       Finally, lower interest rates this year could help boost economic surprise indexes in the US, which could also help send stocks higher, the bank said.               \"We stand by our call from last week that 5,500 should provide support for a tradable rally led by cyclical, lower quality, and expensive growth stocks that have been hit the hardest and where the short base is the greatest. Friday's price action seems to support that call,\" Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, wrote on Monday.               Citi seemed to agree.               Analysts said the latest sell-off had taken the S&P 500 to a healthier valuation. Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks also appear more \"rationally valued,\" the bank said. The group of top tech stocks now accounts for about 9 percentage points of the S&P 500's total return since December 2023, down significantly from last year's highs.               The S&P 500 is also down 10% from its record high in February. The decline is balancing the risk-reward of stocks \"to the upside,\" analysts said.               \"This past week, we drew a line in the sand at 5,500 as a level where the risk-reward begins to skew more favorably,\" they wrote.               \"Longer-term, we remain fundamentally constructive on the S&P 500 setup as productivity improvement, AI promise, operating leverage, shareholder influences, and ongoing business model maturation elements better describe our view of US exceptionalism,\" they added.               Citi's positive outlook is notable given that the bank recently also recalibrated its view of US stocks, downgrading the market to \"neutral,\" while boosting its view of Chinese equities to \"overweight.\"               Morgan Stanley and Citi analysts are sticking to year-end price targets of 6,500 for the benchmark index. That would be a gain of about 15% by the end of 2025.               Some pessimism, though, is still percolating on Wall Street as traders eye the potential for a growth slowdown in the US.               In recent days, Goldman Sachs and RBC have downgraded their price targets for the S&P 500 to 6,200.               While not its base case, Citi said it thought the S&P 500 could fall as low as 5,100, assuming that policy uncertainty and growth fears would continue to weigh on sentiment.               Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, thinks the index could drop as low as 4,600 in the event of a recession, an 18% decline from Monday's levels.               \"We also think it's important for the S&P 500 to respond to the ~5500 level given the fundamental and technical support there. If it doesn't, that's a potential sign that growth could be deteriorating faster than expected, and recession risk could be increasing along with the odds of our bear case outcome,\" analysts said.               One thing seems clear: Markets shouldn't expect the Trump administration to swoop in and save stocks anytime soon. The president's team has repeatedly indicated that it isn't focused on markets, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that he was \"not at all\" concerned about the recent drop in stocks.               \"I've been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They're normal. What's not healthy is straight up,\" Bessent told NBC over the weekend, adding that he believed the market would perform \"great\" over the long term.               His remarks came a week after Trump refused to rule out a US recession as a result of the administration's policies.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Although Donald Trump got off to a good start, with equity prices hitting all-time highs in anticipation of pro-growth policies, investor confidence has vanished, tanking the stock market. With the president deliberately undermining the foundations of US prosperity, one must ask why he is doing it, and what could stop him.  WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 US President Donald Trump\u2019s management of economic policy has been a disaster. Previously, it would have been unfathomable for a president \u2013 including Trump during his first term \u2013 to inflict so much harm on the economy deliberately. As alarmed as I am, though, I am not panicked. A recession remains unlikely, and equilibrating forces in the political system may soon apply the brakes to this madness.

Jeff Roberson\/AP                                       hide caption  Residents in large swaths of the southern U.S. on Sunday took stock of the devastation left in the wake of tornadoes, strong winds and dust storms over the weekend. The severe weather left at least 37 people dead, and destroyed scores of homes. This bout of storms was forecast to clear the East Coast by Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service. In Missouri, where 12 people died, first responders and road crews worked to clear debris, restore power to homes, and distribute recovery supplies. Gov. Mike Kehoe's office said Sunday that hundreds of homes, schools and businesses were destroyed of severely damaged, with some burned from wildfires aggravated by high winds. \"The scale of devastation across our state is staggering,\" Gov. Kehoe said. \"While we grieve the lives of those lost, we are also focused on action.\" In Butler County, a man was killed after a tornado ripped through his home. Coroner Jim Akers told the AP that the twister left his home \"unrecognizable\" with \"just a debris field.\" Hurricane force winds in Oklahoma, fueled deadly wildfires and dust storms. Residents there spent Saturday surveying fire damage, after more than 170,000 acres burned. By Sunday afternoon, an early assessment from local officials identified more than 400 homes damaged statewide. Four people died and 142 others were injured due to the fires and winds, officials said. Cheryl Rabet of Stillwater lost her home in the blazes, as well as two RVs she rented out, reported KOSU's Lionel Ramos. \"We didn't have a chance to grab anything,\" she said, including their 16-year-old cat Momo. \"We grabbed one of our cats and that was about it.\" The Red Cross and other relief efforts have been providing food and other resources for shelters across parts of Oklahoma and other affected regions. Brady Moore, Stillwater city manager, warned that it may still be unsafe for residents to return to neighborhoods in the path of destruction, while crews work to repair downed powerlines and shut off water and gas lines. Damage assessments in the majority of Alabama counties continued on Sunday, said Gov. Kay Ivey. Three people died in the state, she said. In Troy, Ala., where a tornado flipped an 18-wheeler truck, about 200 people took shelter at a recreation center, reported local CBS station WAKA News. \"Right as the last people got in, the storm passed over, blowing out windows in cars in the parking lot, and tearing off part of the gymnasium roof,\" said Dan Smith, the director of the city's parks and recreation department. \"Our sports complex, including the baseball and softball park, also suffered major damage. But we're very fortunate\u2014it could've been a lot worse.\" There were no injuries. In Texas on Sunday, fire crews were battling a 9,500-acres blaze in Fredericksburg, in central Texas. The grass fire was more than half contained as of Sunday evening, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. Across the state, more than 42,000 acres were burning from 36 fires on Sunday night, the service said. The threat of fires was expected to continue into the week, with a red flag warning \u2013 signaling a high risk of wildfire conditions -- was expected to be reinstated for South Central Texas on Monday, as Texas Public Radio reported. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday that the state was granted federal assistance to help fight the fires. \"Texas is working around the clock to provide all necessary resources to local officials fighting wildfires in Gray and Gillespie counties,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Forever 21 has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time as traffic in U.S. shopping malls fades and competition from online retailers like Amazon, Temu and Shein intensifies Forever 21 has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time as traffic in U.S. shopping malls fades and competition from online retailers like Amazon, Temu and Shein intensifies.  F21 OpCo, which runs Forever 21 stores, said late Sunday that it will wind down the business in the U.S. under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while determining if it can continue as a business with a partner, or if it will sell some or all of its assets.  \u201cWhile we have evaluated all options to best position the company for the future, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.  The de minimis tax exemption lets shipments headed to U.S. businesses and consumers valued at less than $800 to enter the country tax free and duty free.  Forever 21 stores in the U.S. will hold liquidation sales and the website will continue to run while operations wind down. The retailer's locations outside of the U.S. are run by other licensees and are not included in the bankruptcy filing. International store locations and websites will continue operating as normal. Authentic Brands Group owns the international intellectual property associated with the Forever 21 brand and may license the brand to other operators, F21OpCo said.  Forever 21 first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019. It was acquired by a consortium of parties including Authentic Brands Group and mall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.  Forever 21 was founded in 1984 and, along with other fast-fashion chains like H&M and Zara, rode a wave of popularity among young customers in the mid-1990s. Their popularity grew during the Great Recession, when shoppers were seeking bargains. But Forever 21 went on an aggressive expansion just as shoppers were moving more online. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that part of the problem now is that Forever 21's stores are too big for its current needs and it's in malls with not enough foot traffic. \u201cForever 21 was always a retailer living on borrowed time. Over recent years it has been hit with dual headwinds from a weak apparel market and stiff competition from cheap Chinese marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth things have eroded its standing and depleted its market share.\u201d  24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Intel\u2019s (INTC-6.40%) next chief executive isn\u2019t formally due for work until Tuesday, but there\u2019s already talk of an artificial intelligence-strategy revamp under Lip-Bu Tan. Investors sent the stock soaring on Monday after a Reuters report on the incoming CEO\u2019s revitalization plans, which include pushing Intel into territory dominated by rivals Nvidia (NVDA+2.83%) and ARM (ARM-0.98%).  Intel stock jumped more than 8% to about $26 at 1:25 p.m. in New York. The rise over the past week has all but offset its loss in the market correction, and it\u2019s now up almost 29% so far this year. Nvidia, which soared with the AI hype cycle, is down about 14% from January 1. In addition to boosting sales for Intel\u2019s foundry business, which makes chips designed by other firms, Tan intends to make chips for AI servers, foundation models, and robotics, Reuters (TRI-0.55%) said, citing people familiar with the subject. Intel had neglected those markets, allowing ARM to rise in smartphone chips and Nvidia to dominate in AI. Last week, Tan told attendees of a company town hall that \u201ctough decisions\u201d were needed to revive Intel, possibly including further job cuts targeting middle managers. The company eliminated about 15,000 positions last year.  An Intel spokesperson declined to comment on the story to Quartz. Tan will join Intel after running Cadence (CDNS+2.51%), which makes product-design software and hardware, for more than a decade. He was also a founding partner at VC firm Walden and sits on the boards of Credo Technology Group (CRDO+5.83%) and Schneider Electric.

The consensus forecast is for earnings of $1.43 per share, up from $0.42 in the year-ago period, while revenues are estimated at $7.92 billion, up a solid 36% compared to last year. We expect results to be driven by strong demand from AI data centers, which require more expensive high-bandwith memory (HBM). Micron is in the process of scaling up production of its new HBM3E memory, which goes into Nvidia\u2019s latest GPU chips. The new memory chips have a lower power consumption and higher capacity, making them ideal for power-efficient and high-performance AI workloads. Separately, with much movement in the markets recently, see Is CRM Stock A Buy At $280? Micron has $112 billion in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $29 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $4.6 Bil in operating profits and net income of $3.9 Bil. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might just turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader. Related: Could Recession Pull Nvidia Stock Down To $60? There are two ways to do that: understand the historical odds and position yourself prior to the earnings release, or look at the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post earnings and position yourself accordingly after the earnings are released.

For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves \"long\" for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Intel\u2019s next-generation Panther Lake laptop processors, originally expected to launch in late 2025, may now be delayed until the first quarter of 2026. The delay appears to be linked to challenges with Intel\u2019s 18A process node, which plays a critical role in the Panther Lake architecture. This shift could affect Intel\u2019s competitive timeline as rival chipmakers continue advancing their own next-gen processors. According to slides obtained by VideoCardz, Intel has listed Panther Lake for a Q1 2026 release, suggesting a delay from previous expectations. These internal documents also hint that Panther Lake could be branded under the Core Ultra 300 series when it finally launches, following Intel\u2019s recent shift in naming conventions. According to news estimate intel 18A Panther Lake will HVM in September and will launch in October , start EEP (Early Enablement Program) limit supply to OEM , will be available on the market Q1 2026 (actually Jan) . pic.twitter.com\/9rbV9cdgjO &mdash; meng (@meng59739449) March 14, 2025 Panther Lake is designed to be a major step forward in Intel\u2019s mobile CPU lineup, likely bringing improvements in performance and power efficiency. However, sources indicate that Intel is facing manufacturing hurdles with its 18A process, which may have caused the company to push back the chip\u2019s mass production schedule. If the delay holds, laptops powered by Panther Lake CPUs may not arrive until early 2026\u2014months later than originally anticipated. Despite the potential setback, Intel is preparing to launch an Early Enablement Program (EEP) this year. This initiative is expected to provide select partners and developers with early access to Panther Lake\u2019s architecture, allowing them to optimize software and hardware well in advance of the official launch. While details remain scarce, this approach could help mitigate the impact of the delay and ensure that devices featuring Panther Lake CPUs are ready when the chips become available. The reported delay could have significant implications for Intel\u2019s market positioning, especially as competition in the laptop processor space intensifies. While Panther Lake is still expected to play a crucial role in Intel\u2019s roadmap, the industry will be watching closely to see whether the company can overcome its manufacturing challenges and deliver these chips on schedule. This was a turbulent year in the world of Windows laptops. The introduction of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips completely changed the game -- and I don't say that lightly. They entered the market in such a forceful way that both AMD and Intel were forced to respond quickly with their own more power-efficient chips that could compete. Intel's Core Ultra Series 2, otherwise known as Lunar Lake, attempted to beat Qualcomm at its own game, boasting a dramatic improvement in battery life. Intel Arrow Lake has struggled to compete against some of the best processors from both AMD and Intel itself, but improvements are on the way. In fact, a completely unexpected update just gave the CPUs a major boost. Unfortunately, there's a caveat: That boost only applies to one game. The update in question was just announced by CDProjektRed, which has dropped a surprise patch for Cyberpunk 2077. The game studio now promises to improve in-game performance on Arrow Lake CPUs by up to 33%, which is a tune-up that gamers badly need, considering that the CPUs generally failed to impress in gaming scenarios. AMD has just unveiled some internal benchmarks of its Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor. Although it's been a few months since the release of the Ryzen AI 300 series, AMD now compares its CPU to Intel's Lunar Lake, and the benchmarks are highly favorable for AMD's best processor for thin-and-light laptops. Let's check them out. For starters, AMD compared the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 to the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V. The AMD CPU comes with 12 cores (four Zen 5 and eight Zen 5c cores) and 24 threads, as well as 36MB of combined cache. The maximum clock speed tops out at 5.1GHz, and the CPU offers a configurable thermal design power (TDP) ranging from 15 watts to 54W. Meanwhile, the Intel chip sports eight cores (four performance cores and four efficiency cores), eight threads, a max frequency of 4.8GHz, 12MB of cache, and a TDP ranging from 17W to 37W. Both come with a neural processing unit (NPU), and AMD scores a win here too, as its NPU provides 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS), while Intel's sits at 47 TOPS. It's a small difference, though.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"If you\u2019re waiting on Apple\u2019s rumored foldable iPhone, start saving your pennies. And nickles, dimes, and quarters, too. Analyst Tim Long told Barclays the first foldable iPhone could start in the $2,300 range, which would make it nearly double the price of the current most expensive iPhone (the iPhone 16 Pro Max) and one of the single priciest handsets on the market. This announcement follows rumors that the foldable iPhone will enter mass production sometime in 2026 or 2027 and lines up with what tipster Ming-Chi Kuo predicted for the price. That said, the rumored handset has gained a lot of attention from iPhone fans. The expected demand for the iPhone foldable is great enough that even the higher price tag might not hurt sales. It\u2019s likely that $2,300 would just be the starting price and that higher-end configurations could cost significantly more. When compared to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, which starts at $1,899 and tops out at $2,259, it\u2019s easy to blame the so-called \u201cApple tax\u201d for the increase. That said, it\u2019s not the most expensive foldable on the market. The Huawei Mate XT is one of the only tri-fold models currently available and commands a price tag of $2,800. The Samsung multi-fold (another phone that\u2019s more rumor than substance) is expected to easily pass the $2,000 mark. The OnePlus Open starts at $1,700, and the OnePlus Open 2 \u2014whenever it arrives \u2014 is expected to cost even more. Book-style foldables tend to carry a higher price tag than flip-style foldables. Apple has a tendency to take existing technology and put its own polish on it, and the tech\u00a0usually justifies a higher price. With luck, the iPhone foldable will set itself apart from the competition and provide features worth paying the equivalent of a months\u2019 rent for. But if you really want to drop a load of dough on a phone, Huawei has an $18,000 device plated in 24-carat gold. We\u2019ve seen folding devices from many of the big tech players but while Samsung is currently on its 6th generation of the Galaxy Z Fold, and Google on its second Pixel Fold, Apple is still nowhere to be seen in the market.\u00a0 That\u2019s not unusual, Apple typically launches features and designs a little later than others, and sometimes not at all \u2013 it\u2019s never done an under display fingerprint sensor for example.\u00a0 Ever since we first heard murmurs of Apple prepping an ultra-slim iPhone, speculations were rife about a fittingly high asking price. But it seems buyers won\u2019t get hit with an absurd \u201cinnovation tax\u201d for the iPhone 17 Air model later this year. According to Bloomberg, the upcoming phone might be priced at \u201croughly $900.\u201d To put that into perspective, that\u2019s the same asking price as the iPhone 16 Plus. To recall, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the \u201cPlus\u201d model in Apple\u2019s line-up later this year. A few pleasant surprises The package, however, is going to be a mixed bag of surprises. For example, the slim phone is expected to offer a 6.6-inch display, but it will borrow the ProMotion display tech from the pricier Pro models. So far, the high refresh rate perk has been exclusive to Apple\u2019s flagship iPhones and iPads.  As the release for the iPhone 17 draws ever closer (expected in September 2025), more leaks have emerged \u2014 and now a set of dummy units give us a close look at the entire lineup, but specifically the iPhone 17 Air. This handset has been the source of quite a bit of speculation and rumors, and a peek at its profile shows a phone even slimmer than we had imagined. The leaks come courtesy of Sonny Dickson, a well-known tipster. Dickson shared the images on X. It's important to remember that these units are chunks of metal; they have no electronics inside them, so we can't gauge specs based on the design. It does give us a firm look at the profile, however, and an idea of the placement of various components.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Temu and Shein, two Chinese fast-fashion giants, are determined to increase their dominance in the U.S. market, challenging Amazon\u2019s efforts to capture a share of the budget-friendly e-commerce space.  Temu, which launched in the U.S. 2022, and Shein, which also entered the market that same year, have capitalized on China\u2019s low manufacturing costs and tariff-free import practices. However, recent U.S. tariffs \u2014 ranging from 10% to 20% on Chinese imports \u2014 pose a potential challenge for these ultra-cheap competitors, threatening to disrupt their business models.  Despite this, Shein\u2019s executive chairman, Donald Tang, has expressed confidence that the company will continue to deliver affordable products to U.S. consumers, regardless of the tariffs. \u201cWe will find a way to deliver the goods,\u201d Tang told the French international news agency AFP, stressing that customer experience would remain unaffected. While he did not elaborate on specific plans, Tang highlighted Shein\u2019s business model and its adaptable nature, which has helped it weather previous global disruptions like the pandemic. Both Temu and Shein has thrived by tapping into the growing demand for budget-friendly, trendy products. With U.S. consumers increasingly price-sensitive amid inflation and rising living costs, these platforms have benefitted from offering low-cost goods and fast shipping.  Their success has made it difficult for Amazon\u2019s (AMZN+1.34%) low-cost platform, Haul, to capture similar market share. Launched in Nov. 2024, Haul has struggled to gain traction, with only a small fraction of U.S. consumers engaging with it compared to the growing base of Temu and Shein shoppers.  As Shein and Temu continue to dominate the budget shopping category, Amazon\u2019s efforts to tap into this market are proving challenging \u2014 especially as cash-strapped consumers become more selective in their spending. With tariff concerns looming, the battle for U.S. market share will only intensify, leaving Amazon Haul with an uphill battle to gain ground.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Experts expect that the American housing market will remain largely stagnant in 2025 due to high interest rates and a limited supply of affordable housing. A recent J.P. Morgan report projected 3% growth in the cost of American homes this year, as both demand for houses and overall housing inventory remain below historical averages. At the same time, the median cost of a new house in the United States is $250,000 \u2013 a figure that 49% of American households cannot afford, according to a report from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). President Donald Trump has argued that by reducing the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., demand will decrease and supply will increase \u2013 but experts argue that this theory belies several other factors impacting the housing market. \u201cBy reducing immigration and lessening demand, Trump argues that housing costs can be reduced,\u201d said John Sim, the head of Securitized Products Research at J.P. Morgan (JPM), in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, though \u2014 approximately 30% of construction workers are immigrants, so there could be complex implications. Cutting immigration would mean cutting labor supply in the construction industry, which could end up exacerbating the lack of affordable housing.\u201d In addition to the loss of workers, preliminary data from the NAHB indicates that some homebuilders are planning for Trump\u2019s tariffs to add between $7,500 and $10,000 to the construction of new single family homes. Trump has also expressed opposition to several other strategies that could increase the amount of available housing in the U.S., including building multi-family residences in single-family neighborhoods and bringing more low-income housing developments into the suburbs. Even in the 15 states seeing the greatest increases in population growth, housing remains stubbornly inaccessible to many Americans. For example, South Carolina, which boasts the lowest housing costs of the fastest-growing states, the median home price is $350,000. In the most expensive of these states, Massachusetts, the median price is $722,425, according to a Realtor.com analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.

Jekaterina Beljankova is CEO and owner of WALLACE s.r.o, a company specializing in real estate investment in Europe.   The European luxury real estate market has long been a magnet for affluent investors seeking prestige and financial stability. Traditional hotspots like Monaco, the French Riviera and Tuscany have dominated for years, but Marbella, on Spain\u2019s Costa del Sol, is emerging as a priority for luxury real estate investors. Spain\u2019s economy, with 3.2% GDP growth in 2024\u2014outpacing Germany and France\u2014has played a key role in this shift. Real estate transactions reached a record high in 2022, with Marbella accounting for a significant share of luxury sales. Marbella\u2019s real estate market is defined by its diversity. Investors from --[m-01-titular-node_791431]-72474712058@3-[20210720084156]\">Sweden, the U.K., the Middle East and increasingly the U.S. are drawn to these investment opportunities. Properties in Spain generate average rental yields around 7% annually. While Spain\u2019s Golden Visa program is ending soon, it has granted residency to non-EU buyers investing at least \u20ac500,000 in property and further solidified its position as a hub for international investors, particularly Americans. Additionally, the weaker euro\u2014falling to $1.02 in January\u2014makes investing in Marbella\u2019s luxury market particularly attractive for U.S. investors. The rise of M\u00e1laga as a tech hub has bolstered Marbella\u2019s real estate investment appeal. With significant foreign investments and global firms like Google and Vodafone establishing operations in the area, M\u00e1laga is increasingly known as the \"Silicon Valley of Europe.\" Thousands of tech professionals have moved to the region, helping to drive demand for premium housing in nearby areas. This tech boom, coupled with Marbella\u2019s year-round appeal, positions the area as a smart investment for financial returns. Properties in prime locations consistently appreciate, with some of the most expensive rents in the province. Additionally, the rental market thrives during the high season\u2014I've seen some luxury villas command \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac25,000 per week. Furthermore, the average price of luxury properties worth over \u20ac3 million in Spain has risen by 4.5% year-on-year in 2024, reflecting a robust and appreciating market. These metrics underscore Marbella's position as a lucrative destination for luxury real estate investment, offering both capital appreciation and rental income opportunities. While Marbella\u2019s luxury real estate market offers great opportunities for investors, there are some drawbacks to consider. One is the seasonal nature of demand, which can lead to lower rental income during off-peak months. This seasonal fluctuation may affect consistent cash flow for investors reliant on rentals. Additionally, increased competition in Marbella\u2019s luxury market has led to rising prices, making it harder to secure prime properties. Though more affordable than markets like Monaco, the price gap is narrowing. Investors should also factor in property-related costs, such as annual taxes, maintenance fees and potential capital gains tax when selling. Understanding these financial aspects is key to making informed investment decisions. For global investors, it\u2019s essential to ask questions when considering investments in Marbella, about elements like the long-term growth prospects, local regulations and tax policies. Understanding how the property will perform as a rental, especially during off-peak seasons, is also crucial. Managing a property from abroad can be challenging, so investors may want to consider working with local real estate agents, legal advisors and property managers who can navigate regulations and ensure smooth operations. Similarly, navigating Spain's legal and tax systems can be complex for non-residents. To avoid issues, investors can consult with professionals familiar with both Spanish and international tax laws to ensure compliance and maximize returns. When looking for trustworthy local professionals, I suggest to first seek recommendations from expatriate communities or online groups and verify professionals' credentials, ensuring they are licensed and experienced in working with international clients. Look for experts with a proven track record, particularly in cross-border transactions. Key questions to ask include: \u201cCan you share your experience with foreign investors?\u201d and \u201cHow do you assist in navigating Spanish tax laws?\u201d It's essential to understand property management services, including tenant relations and compliance with local regulations. Challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences and understanding Spain's complex legal systems can arise. To overcome these, you may want to hire bilingual professionals or those proficient in your language who can help you gain an understanding of local customs. Consider experts experienced in both Spanish and international tax laws to ensure compliance and avoid costly mistakes. Market volatility is another important consideration for investors. Regularly consult with your advisors to stay updated on the market and make timely decisions. By maintaining clear communication, global investors can navigate Marbella\u2019s real estate market. I think Marbella's blend of natural beauty, world-class amenities and strong investment potential sets it apart from other European markets. And M\u00e1laga\u2019s rise as a tech hub and Marbella\u2019s competitive pricing make it an attractive choice for global investors.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"President Donald Trump and his top economic official\u2019s refusals to rule out a recession have rattled Wall Street and consumers, while some economists warn the Trump administration may tip the U.S. into an unnecessary recession \u2014 and the data below will help gauge exactly how close the economy may be coming to a tipping point. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, left, and President Donald Trump speak at the White House earlier ... [+] this month. The UCLA Anderson School of Management published late Tuesday an official \u201cRecession Watch\u201d for the first time in its 73 years of economic forecasts, as economist Clement Bohr issued a scathing assessment of Trump\u2019s economic policies, writing the Recession Watch \u201cserves as a warning to the current administration: be careful what you wish for because, if all your wishes come true, you could very well be the author of a deep recession.\u201d A recession is \u201centirely avoidable\u201d if Trump\u2019s signature economic policies, including the most severe tariffs in nearly a century and the public sector\u2019s dismantling at the hands of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are \u201cpared back or phased in more gradually,\u201d according to Bohr. Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 chief economist Mark Zandi struck a similar chord in a Wednesday morning interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cEarly Start with Rahel Solomon,\u201d saying it \u201cfeels like we're being pushed into recession\u201d by Trump. \u201cThe recession risks are uncomfortably high and they're rising,\u201d declared Zandi, adding he believes the odds of a recession are \u201cless than 50-50, but it really does depend on the president and what he does here.\u201d Trump braced Americans for a possible recession in a Fox News interview aired March 9, when he would not rule out the possibility of a recession, cautioning Americans for a period of economic \u201ctransition\u201d as his policies take hold and noting he\u2019s paying little attention to stock market losses. In subsequent media appearances, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent similarly declined to dismiss a potential recession and said the U.S. will go through a \u201cdetox period.\u201d Bessent told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview out Sunday he believes it \u201cwould have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes\u201d on ahead of the Great Recession. The likelihood of a recession \u201chas moved up but it\u2019s not high,\u201d Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve and the highest-ranking monetary policy official, told reporters Wednesday, quelling fears in a downtrodden economic news cycle. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of all goods and services produced in a country. The official quarterly GDP stats haven't turned negative yet, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time model ignited concerns by calling for -1.8% annual GDP growth in 2025's first quarter, which would be the worst reading since 2020\u2014though the estimate is likely skewed by its methodology, including how it accounts for a surge in gold imports. JPMorgan Chase, the country\u2019s biggest bank, calls for a weak but still positive 1% GDP growth rate during Q1, though Wall Street recession indicators tilt toward higher odds of a recession. A highly tracked model from Goldman Sachs upped its probability of a recession over the next year from 15% to 20% this month mostly on the heels of economic uncertainty from Trump\u2019s oft-changing tariffs. Stock prices don\u2019t completely correlate with economic growth, but equity investors are clearly pricing in increased odds of a down stretch for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 dove into a 10% correction last week, wiping out some $5 trillion in market value in less than a month\u2019s time, led by stocks considered the most vulnerable to a slowdown, including artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. Bank of America\u2019s monthly survey of global fund managers released Tuesday revealed some 63% of these influential investors expect the global economy to weaken over the next year, making March the second biggest jump in macroeconomic pessimism since the poll\u2019s 1994 inception. The survey also revealed fund managers fled to cash this month at the highest rate since March 2020 and moved away from U.S. stocks at their fastest pace on record, signaling an unraveling of faith in stateside equities. The fund managers heavily agree White House policy is the single biggest risk, with 55% of respondents citing a tariff-driven trade war sending the global economy into a recession as the top threat and 13% naming actions from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency sending the U.S. into a recession as the biggest risk. The Bank of America survey was conducted March 7-13 among 205 global fund managers who collectively manage $477 billion in assets. Elsewhere in financial markets, a flight to government-issued debt is evidence of a thirst for safer returns in the face of a potential recession, as yields for benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped by more than 30 basis points over the past two months (lower yields mean bonds got more valuable). But the most common bond market signal of a recession, the inversion of the yield curve, in which longer-term bonds have lower yields than shorter-dated ones, has actually normalized in recent months. The New York Fed\u2019s bond-linked recession model calls for just 27% recession odds over the next year, down from the more than 70% odds in late 2023, a period which failed to materialize into a full-blown recession. Perhaps the most concerning signal over the last is a breakdown in everyday Americans\u2019 conviction in the economy, as the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment survey tumbled this month to its lowest level since 2022. That tracks with weaker spending, as February retail sales grew by just 0.2% from January to February, according to a report released Monday by the Census Bureau, far worse than the 0.6% month-over-month increase projected by economists. One of the most important hallmarks of the American economy, the labor market has shown some cracks in early 2025 as job creation slowed and layoffs spiked, but remains overwhelmingly strong, as February\u2019s 4.1% unemployment rate sits well within the healthy historic norm. A key labor market recession indicator, the Sahm rule, flashes a far lower likelihood of a recession than it did when it peaked last summer, inspiring a short-lived market selloff in August. Trading in two of the world\u2019s most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,000 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. Bessent and Trump have made clear they are lasered in on lowering interest rates, which are determined by the politically independent Fed. Typically, rates are only drastically cut during periods of economic distress, as lower rates typically stimulate economic growth as households and businesses are more likely to borrow with lower interest costs, though that uptick in loan activity can simultaneously lead to higher inflation as demand rises. But those looking for immediately lower rates are unlikely to receive good news when the Fed convenes this week to discuss interest rate policy. There is just a 1% chance the Fed will cut rates in its meeting ending Wednesday, according to derivative contract trading tracked by CME Group. The Fed is likely to hold off on further rate cuts \u201cuntil tariff policy becomes clearer,\u201d David Mericle, Goldman\u2019s chief U.S. economist, wrote in a Sunday note to clients. \u201cCracks are forming in the economy's foundation,\u201d Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, wrote in emailed comments Monday. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t anticipate an outright pullback in consumer spending, recession risks are rising,\u201d Boussour continued.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Qualcomm is refreshing its lineup of mobile gaming silicon by introducing three new processors that will soon appear inside Android-based handheld gaming devices. At the top of the summit is the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, targeted at high-performance enthusiast gaming. In the coming weeks, this top-of-the-line silicon will make its way to the market powering handheld gaming consoles from the likes of Ayaneo and Onex. The mid-tier Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 silicon is targeted at 144fps gaming, while the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 will focus on less powerful devices with a cloud-first gaming approach. Starting with the flagship variant, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 chip is a successor to the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 silicon, which powered devices such as the Ayaneo Pocket S. It\u2019s an octa-core silicon with a 1+5+2 core layout. For demanding tasks, there\u2019s a lone prime core, ticking alongside five performance cores and a pair of efficiency cores.  Qualcomm says it offers a 28% graphics performance boost compared to its predecessor and supports hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, as well. It ships with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Game Super Resolution stack as well as the Adreno Frame Motion Engine 2.0 tech to offer a smooth visual experience.  It is also the first Snapdragon G-series product to support Unreal Engine 5\u2019s Lumen system for handling illumination and reflection in games. On the hardware side, it can drive devices rocking up to a QHD+ screen with a peak 144 Hz refresh rate. This chip will first appear inside the Ayaneo Pocket S2, which is set for a market release later this month, toting better thermals and a refined input layout. This one doesn\u2019t deviate too much from the original Pocket S in terms of designs, but the innards have received some notable upgrades.  The upcoming Ayaneo Gaming Pad tablet, set for a May launch, will also draw power from the same processor. It will be joined by the OnexSugar Sugar 1 handheld, which is set to hit the shelves as the world\u2019s first dual-screen Android-based gaming handheld device. Covering the mid-tier segment is the Qualcomm Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 silicon. This octa-core processor features a single prime core for demanding chores, four performance cores, and three efficiency cores.  It offers a massive 2.3x boost in CPU performance, while the graphics output gets an even higher 3.8x generation-over-generation boost. Just like its flagship sibling, it can also handle a 144Hz QHD+ panel and will appear inside a Retroid handheld in the coming months. Finally, we have the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 silicon. This one misses out on a prime core and instead goes with a 6+2 layout that includes two mid-tier performance cores and six low-end efficiency cores.  Qualcomm is touting an 80% CPU performance gain for this one, alongside a 25% jump in graphics performance courtesy of the onboard Adreno A12 GPU. It can handle panels with up to full-HD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate.  Retroid is among the earliest adopters of this low-power gaming chipset. The Retroid Pocket PR Classic, launching later this month, will serve the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 processor alongside an OLED screen, 5,000 mAh battery, and active cooling.  The Samsung Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23 Plus, and Galaxy S23 Ultra all use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor \u2014 but it\u2019s not just any Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It\u2019s the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 For Galaxy, and it\u2019s a little different from the chip found in other, non-Samsung smartphones. No, it's not just a marketing gimmick for Samsung. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 inside a Galaxy S23 is different from than one that'll be used in other Android phones throughout 2023. Here are four of the most important ways the processor changed, and what it means for the Galaxy S23. Razer is best known for making gaming PCs, headsets, controller charging stands, and other accessories. Now, it's creating its own handheld video game system, the Razer Edge 5G. Razer partnered with Verizon and Qualcomm to announce its new mobile gaming handheld at Mobile World Congress Las Vegas on Wednesday, calling it the world's first 5G mobile gaming handheld. It's designed to allow people to play their favorite games whether they're apps downloaded to play locally, streamed from their console of choice, or accessed directly from the cloud. Following in the footsteps of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Qualcomm has today introduced two low-end mobile processors that add the \u201cGen\u201d naming mantra to the Snapdragon 400 and 600 series. Alongside a few notable upgrades in the camera and connectivity departments, Qualcomm's latest chips have a lot going for them. Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 First in line is the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1, which takes over the mid-tier reins from the Snapdragon 695. Interestingly, this chip is based on the 4nm fabrication process, making it one of the first non-flagship mobile processors to rely on the 4nm die that offers better performance and higher energy efficiency. In comparison, Apple\u2019s A15 Bionic inside the iPhone 13 series is based on TSMC\u2019s 5nm process. Qualcomm claims that the Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 is the first chip in the series to bring computational HDR video capture chops to the table. It\u2019s also the first in the family to get the new 7th Gen AI engine that brings a 3x performance uptake for AI and ML-based tasks. Motorola is among the first brands to embrace the new Qualcomm chip, while phones powered by it will hit the shelves early next year.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"  \t\t\t\tContent Moderation\t\t\t  Late last month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a\u00a0request for public comment\u00a0on so-called \u201ctech censorship.\u201d America has a vibrant and successful market-driven system for content moderation, enabled by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows platforms to set their own rules, while users decide where to engage. That\u2019s why conversation on Bluesky feels different from Reddit, which feels different from Truth Social\u2014each platform competes on moderation, governance, and community standards. This diversity has created a vibrant marketplace of ideas, fueling the success of both large and small companies, while cementing the U.S. as the global leader in internet technology and online speech. Undermine this system, and you don\u2019t get more free speech\u2014you get fewer platforms, less competition, and more centralized control over online discourse. The FTC has based its investigation of \u201ctech censorship\u201d on a belief that tech companies are intentionally restricting access of individual users to their platforms, based on the content of the users\u2019 posts or their affiliations. In the words of the press release, the FTC pointedly seeks information on \u201chow this conduct may have violated the law.\u201d\u00a0As the FTC moves forward, it should be careful not to base its decisions on unverifiable reports, to the detriment of the digital economy that has been responsible for tremendous American innovation and growth.\u00a0 The decision whether to include certain content or users on the platform is also a basic First Amendment right. In the Supreme Court\u2019s 2024\u00a0NetChoice\u00a0opinion, the Court stated that online platforms\u2019 choices about what material to publish \u201cconstitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment\u201d that are \u201cprotected expressive activity.\u201d \u00a0As CTA CEO and Vice Chair Gary Shapiro has\u00a0noted, \u201cAmerica\u2019s tech success needs the First Amendment\u2026 It empowers U.S. tech companies by protecting their ability to innovate without fear of censorship, enabling diverse voices and perspectives to contribute to tech progress.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 These are all substantive legal issues that the FTC should consider in response to its request for public comment.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the process the FTC has established does not seem likely to result in a balanced and robust record.\u00a0 To be clear, federal agencies seeking public comment is a good thing. Taking enforcement actions against named companies based on unproven allegations, without giving them the opportunity to defend themselves, is not. The FTC\u2019s process in this proceeding raises concerns that companies won\u2019t get a fair shake.\u00a0 Basing enforcement on unvetted\u2014and often anonymous\u2014complaints is not reliable, and when the FTC receives thousands of comments, as it did in response to its\u00a0proposed noncompete rule, staff cannot verify the factual assertions in each one. \u00a0Moving forward on this basis could harm companies\u2019 protected interests in choosing what kind of content appears on their platforms, and result in worse outcomes for American consumers. Instead, FTC leadership should focus on policies that help unlock innovation from American tech companies. That includes advancing all Americans\u2019 shared interest in free speech. David Grossman is CTA\u2019s VP of Regulatory Affairs   \tFiled Under: content moderation, ftc, public comments, section 230   Musk will have a say in it, and he loves free speech! Also, he has the best interests of ordinary Americans at heart. Rejoice, everyone loves our leader with a beautiful plan. You know, because he\u2019ll put our best people on it. Well, other than the really best ones that have been fired or are leaving because they don\u2019t want to deal with the bipolar irrational administration in charge, so, the other best people that will always say yes to his amazing brilliance!    America has a vibrant and successful market-driven system for content moderation,   This diversity has created a vibrant marketplace of ideas, fueling the success of both large and small companies,  Calling our consolidated social media a vibrant and diverse marketplace is insane. (Mind you, this is not 230\u2019s fault. More to do with issue like network effects leading to lock in, lack of antitrust, etc) And organizations like the CTA are against any sort of antitrust with teeth.  My guess is that they\u2019d be against anything the FTC did, no matter how reasonable, and then use the \u201cinnovation\u201d buzzword same as telecoms use it when they try to make excuses for why Net Neutrality is bad. If you strictly focus on Facebook, X\/Twitter, and Reddit, of course it\u2019s going to look monopolistic.  If, however, you include smaller platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, and others, then you see the diversity in the market.  The only exception here is the advertising realm which really is monopolostic and limited to mostly Facebook and Google, but that\u2019s\u2026 the online advertising market and not the social media market. Ever since Elon Musk drove X\/Twitter into the ground, there\u2019s actually been a nice injection of new services that have been brought into prominence. If you can believe it, competition in the social media landscape has actually improved in recent years.    Calling our consolidated social media a vibrant and diverse marketplace is insane.  That\u2019s not what he said, though. He said that section 230 allows speech in such a way that many different companies, both large and small, can compete on their execution of it.    That\u2019s not what he said, though.  What exactly do you think America has a vibrant and successful market-driven system for content moderation each platform competes on moderation, governance, and community standards. This diversity has created a vibrant marketplace of ideas, fueling the success of both large and small companies, Are saying? It\u2019s literally talking about a vibrant and successful market system?    He said that section 230 allows speech in such a way that many different companies, both large and small, can compete on their execution of it.  He is saying that, but he\u2019s also making claims about a vibrant market system to bolster it. You seem to be missing the \u201cfor content moderation\u201d part in your understanding of what he meant. It\u2019s just one aspect of the social media landscape being addressed. It\u2019s not saying every social media company is great. It\u2019s saying that if you don\u2019t like ExTwitter, you can go to Bluesky, and 230 allows platforms to host and moderate your speech without fear of legal reprisals. How is it consolidated when there are like 3 huge companies and countless small ones out there? It\u2019s not like Facebook or Twitter are the only game in town anymore. They\u2019ll use this to chip away at section 230, surely. Meanwhile the UK may be about to completly ban the display of NSFW material as per some very recent proposals, right after the OSA has gone into effect, as if they weren\u2019t satisfied screwing over platforms enough. I hate living in the censorship timeline. Take heart! You seem to love to complain and if all this bad stuff happens, you\u2019ll never run out of material to complain about! And how is anyone going to complain about anything online if their government bans everyone in their country from accessing the internet, dipshit? KOSA is also going to be talked about in a hearing in the house\u2019s energy and commerce committee again soon. That one isn\u2019t too surprising though, we all knew they\u2019d try to bring it back again in some form. Question is if it can survive the courts if it passes, still. It helps to source the actual proposal to keep people better informed. Here, from the list of publications on this bill, for those who want to dive into it. The UK laws are falling apart and the proposals are very likely to fail. Many platforms are fighting the UK laws. Not enough of them, the laws are still in effect. And they will have it because the congress wants to destroy the internet. No they won\u2019t! Call congress and tell them not too! People have told them no over and over again and they refuse to listen. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019d be sane to not look at this in the broader context of the ongoing authoritarian takeover and weaponization of the federal government that\u2019s going on. They deserve no trust that any powers given would be used wisely, and this particular one would certainly be used to attack platforms that they don\u2019t like. So, no. Unfortunately for us, consent is a foreign concept to these people. If you need to ask \u201chow this conduct may have violated the law,\u201d you can\u2019t clearly haven\u2019t found any violations. Wannabe looking for more ways to claim they\u2019ve been abused. In the words of the press release, the FTC pointedly seeks information on \u201chow this conduct may have violated the law.\u201d Its your job to know what violates the law.  Its not a question of public opinion.  We have written law, not just make it up as you go. To be fair, this is Trump\u2019s FTC, so \u201cmake the law up as you go\u201d seems appropriate for an administration whose leader believes his word is law. I can\u2019t see some other nations putting up with this clown show much longer. Anyone have any thoughts on how this might impact companies like Xitter, Google and Meta in the  international arena?

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"        Juliana Kim                        A customer shops for eggs at a  grocery store on March 12 in Chicago. Wholesale egg prices are going down, but it could take several days before grocery prices follow suit.                                                           Scott Olson\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  After months of sticker shock from the nationwide egg crisis, relief might finally be on the way.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Friday that the national average wholesale price of eggs has been steadily declining since late February. In other words, the cost that distributors are charging retailers is going down.  According to the latest USDA report, the average wholesale cost of large white eggs was $4.15 per dozen \u2014 about half of what it was just a few weeks ago. The drop in wholesale prices is thanks to the absence of major bird flu outbreaks so far in March, which has allowed the nation's egg supply to start recovering. That's a positive sign, economists told NPR, but how soon prices might change at the grocery store will depend on a few key factors. Here's what to know. Wholesale egg prices have been dropping for three weeks in a row, according to the USDA. But that might not be reflected at your local grocery store. According to Joseph Balagtas, a professor of agriculture economics at Purdue University, that's not unusual. \"The eggs we see [at] the store today were purchased by the retailer at a wholesale price that prevailed a couple weeks ago,\" he said in an email. Inventory issues could play a role, as well, but he anticipates that store egg prices may start to ease within a matter of days. Jadrian Wooten, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, said part of the reason for the lag could be that grocery store chains are wary of cutting prices too quickly. There's still an ongoing concern about future bird flu outbreaks, which could disrupt supply again.  \"They're always going to lower egg prices a little bit slower than the wholesale side of things would do,\" he said. Wooten believes the biggest factor will be whether the virus stays contained.  \"\u200aAs long as we're on the path that we're on, we should see those prices come down in the next few weeks.\" he said. \"Unfortunately, if bird flu were to spring up again, if there was another major outbreak at another large farm, then I think you'll see the exact opposite.\" It's no surprise that soaring egg costs have left many Americans looking elsewhere for a source of protein. Ironically, that attitude shift may be helping keep egg prices from rising even further. \"That should happen, because high prices is really the market signal to us consumers to buy fewer eggs. If we buy fewer eggs, that leads to some lower prices,\" David Anderson, a livestock economist and professor at Texas A&M University, said in an email. That's the reason Wooten from Virginia Tech advises customers against buying eggs in bulk when they're worried that prices might go up. \"\u200aSome of what might be driving egg prices is the panic buying that people have been doing over the past couple months,\" he said.  What about Easter and Passover? Economists tell NPR that those holidays usually cause a bump in demand. But they don't suspect it will be a major barrier to bringing down retail costs.  In January, a group of Democratic lawmakers said food companies \"often exploit crises like pandemics and avian flu outbreaks as an opportunity to raise prices beyond what is needed to cover rising costs.\" And earlier this month, several media outlets reported that the Justice Department had opened an investigation into whether major egg producers played an intentional role in spiking prices. (NPR has not independently confirmed the investigation.) But the economists NPR spoke to remain skeptical that price gouging was at play. Balagtas from Purdue said wholesale prices have consistently aligned with trends in bird flu cases and egg production. He said there's evidence to suggest retailers have exercised restraint when it comes to raising prices. \"From May 2024 through last month, wholesale egg prices rose by 350%. Over that same time period, retail prices rose by 120%,\" he said. Balagtas added that it suggests \"retailers are trying not to pass the full costs of higher wholesale prices on to consumers.\"  Anderson from Texas A&M University similarly said he does not believe the concern of price-gouging applies to the egg crisis, because the fight against bird flu has been so costly for producers. \"We know bird flu has dramatically cut supplies leading to higher prices,\" he said. \"If you got bird flu, then you have no eggs to sell and you are not benefiting from higher prices.\" It's head-spinning to remember that a dozen eggs were close to $2 for a brief time in 2023. Last month, NPR reported that a dozen eggs could cost anywhere from $4 to more than $8 in grocery stores. The average price was $5.90 for a dozen large eggs in February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Wooten said he's hopeful that Americans can see egg prices return to between $2 to $3. \"I don't think it's going to take years to get us back to that,\" he said. It takes six months to a year for farms to recuperate when they lose a flock of egg-laying hens to bird flu. \"Hopefully by the summer, like those farms that lost a bunch, they would now have basically brand new hens that are reproducing kind of full steam ahead,\" Wooten said. \"But again, that goes back to assuming that bird flu doesn't spike back up.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":" Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As President Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u201cnot going to bend at all\u201d\u00a0approach to tariffs\u00a0raises recession risk\u00a0and helped to send the market into a correction last week, investors may want to consider strategies that focus more on the downside \u2014 ways to stay invested but stay protected during major stock downswings. Alternative exchange-traded funds are an option, and they have been growing in popularity in recent years. But in many cases, retail investors have focused on non-traditional ETFs that ratchet up the risk, rather than dialing it down, Mike Akins, ETF Action founding partner, told Bob Pisani on CNBC\u2019s \u201cETF Edge\u201d last week. He was referring to ETFs that offer leveraged and inverse exposure to some of the biggest stocks in the market, from Nvidia to Tesla, and which have been highly popular with retail traders. Meanwhile, other ETF niches within the non-traditional space, known as the buffer and covered call funds, are much more popular with institutional investors. For investors who believe market volatility will persist and think about portfolio construction for the longer-term, Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u2019s Bryon Lake said on \u201cETF Edge\u201d that looking at these protective strategies make sense. The\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0dipped into correction territory on March 13, though it managed to claw back some of its losses on Friday to finish the week down over 2%,\u00a0still its worst week since 2023. Lake said covered call funds, including premium income strategies, are one option for investors seeking durable returns. He became known for the\u00a0JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which launched during his tenure as J.P. Morgan Asset Management\u2019s global head of ETFs. \u201cYou sell that call, you get the premium for that, and then you can pay that out as income. As we look at this space, that\u2019s one category that\u2019s been evergreen for investors. A lot of investors are looking for income on a consistent basis,\u201d Lake said. Goldman has its own covered call ETFs, with options for both the\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0and\u00a0Nasdaq\u00a0indexes. Another option that offers even more downside protection are\u00a0buffer ETFs, which help investors to potentially avoid substantial losses, capping downside risk via options. Goldman says its new\u00a0U.S. Large Cap Buffer 3 ETF (GBXC)\u00a0protects against the first 5% to 15% of losses on the S&P 500, and also prevents further declines beyond 30%. However, it also caps gains to the upside between 5% and 7%. \u201cA buffer strategy is going to lower the volatility in your portfolio,\u201d Lake said. Covered call ETFs focused on the U.S. stock market have amassed nearly $100 billion in assets under management, while buffer funds hold over $60 billion, according to\u00a0ETF Action data.

{"date":"2025-03-17","content":"Business Insider Edition  If industry leaders' forecasts hold true, 2030 will usher in the decade of quantum computing, causing an explosion of innovation much like machine learning and artificial intelligence have over the last decade.\u00a0Yaad Oren, a managing director at SAP Labs, one of the world's biggest software companies, shared how to get into this growing field.          Quantum computing is a multidisciplinary field involving elements from computer science, physics, and mathematics. It leverages quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than is possible using classical computers, with researchers optimistic it could revolutionize medicine, data privacy, and more. Advancement in the field relies both on hardware research and software and algorithmic development\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the quantum business is booming.               According to research by Boston Consulting Group, the industry attracted $1.2 billion from venture capitalists in 2023 despite a 50% drop in overall tech investments that year. BCG projects that quantum computing will create between $450 billion and $850 billion of economic value globally and sustain a $90-$170 billion market for hardware and software providers by the year 2040.               LinkedIn shows that the salary bands for jobs in quantum computing range from $150,000 on the low end and balloon well past $500,000 a year, depending on the role and company. So what does it take to break into this growing \u2014\u00a0and lucrative \u2014\u00a0field?               Oren is the managing director of SAP Labs US and the global head of its business technology innovation team. SAP, the world's largest non-American software company by revenue, is a leader in cloud-based quantum computing.               He told Business Insider that recruiters in the field look for curiosity more than anything else.               \"Of course, we need expertise \u2014 and quantum is a very deep science and practice that requires a lot of knowledge \u2014 but if you follow the industry, you see there are also many disruptions going with quantum,\" Oren said. \"We're definitely looking for change agents and curiosity is needed because, I mean, the industry is not sure at all that the current quantum technology we have now will be the winning architecture. It's like building a building from the ground floor.\"               With so much of the final architecture of the quantum landscape still undecided, the companies advancing the technology \u2014\u00a0including IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon \u2014 are reliant on new ideas, and researchers resilient enough to handle failure, Oren said.               \"Some projects will be successful, some of them will fail,\" Oren said. \"This is why I think many young people coming to the industry have the ability to be change agents and challenge the paradigm that we have today.\"               For those looking to break into the industry, expertise in developing algorithms, hardware engineering, cryptography, and data science are skills in high demand. There's a lot of overlap with those working now in artificial intelligence, and the two technologies will feed off each other. Still, a wide range of engineering skills and computer science is required to fulfill the promise of quantum computing \u2014\u00a0and workers who manage to snag one of these in-demand quantum roles should be prepared to wear multiple hats.               \"The average day is very diverse at the moment because the field is maturing very fast, and there's so much to do,\" Oren said.               A typical day for a quantum expert at SAP Labs starts with conducting research, the complexity of which varies depending on the project being tackled. However, the company's researchers also partner with academics, work on public-funded projects with various governments, and meet with business clients to identify and address their needs.               \"But because there are so many stakeholders and interests, the diversity of what we do and who we work with is very, very interesting,\" Oren said. \"Since there's so much interest, it's a very, very interesting time to be in quantum \u2014\u00a0not only in the lab in the university, which is great.\"               If he had one suggestion for a newcomer entering the quantum computing field, it'd be to develop expertise in adjacent fields like quantum physics, quantum mechanics, and quantum chemistry \u2014\u00a0because, unlike their classical applications, working with quantum is an entirely different language and set of skills.               \"Quantum is working on exponential complexity, which means, if you have many variables, it's not a linear growth of complexity \u2014 it's an exponential one,\" Oren said. But with that complexity, he added, comes \"so many opportunities to build.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.
